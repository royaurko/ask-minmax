We show that the prediction of mode-coupling theory for a model of a
network-forming strong glass-former correctly describes the wave-vector
dependence of the Debye-Waller factor. To obtain a good description it is
important to take into account the triplet correlation function c_3, which we
evaluate from a computer simulation. Our results support the possibility that
this theory is able to accurately describe the non-ergodicity parameters of
simple as well as of network-forming liquids.
