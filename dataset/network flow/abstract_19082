We study the problem of optimal leader selection in consensus networks with
noisy relative information. The objective is to identify the set of $k$ leaders
that minimizes the formation's deviation from the desired trajectory
established by the leaders. An optimal leader set can be found by an exhaustive
search over all possible leader sets; however, this approach is not scalable to
large networks. In recent years, several works have proposed approximation
algorithms to the $k$-leader selection problem, yet the question of whether
there exists an efficient, non-combinatorial method to identify the optimal
leader set remains open. This work takes a first step towards answering this
question. We show that, in one-dimensional weighted graphs, namely path graphs
and ring graphs, the $k$-leader selection problem can be solved in polynomial
time (in both $k$ and the network size $n$). We give an $O(n^3)$ solution for
optimal $k$-leader selection in path graphs and an $O(kn^3)$ solution for
optimal $k$-leader selection in ring graphs.
