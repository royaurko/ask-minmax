The flux of social media and the convenience of mobile connectivity has
created a mobile data phenomenon that is expected to overwhelm the mobile
cellular networks in the foreseeable future. Despite the advent of 4G/LTE, the
growth rate of wireless data has far exceeded the capacity increase of the
mobile networks. A fundamentally new design paradigm is required to tackle the
ever-growing wireless data challenge.
  In this article, we investigate the problem of massive content delivery over
wireless networks and present a systematic view on content-centric network
design and its underlying challenges. Towards this end, we first review some of
the recent advancements in Information Centric Networking (ICN) which provides
the basis on how media contents can be labeled, distributed, and placed across
the networks. We then formulate the content delivery task into a content rate
maximization problem over a share wireless channel, which, contrasting the
conventional wisdom that attempts to increase the bit-rate of a unicast system,
maximizes the content delivery capability with a fixed amount of wireless
resources. This conceptually simple change enables us to exploit the "content
diversity" and the "network diversity" by leveraging the abundant computation
sources (through application-layer encoding, pushing and caching, etc.) within
the existing wireless networks. A network architecture that enables wireless
network crowdsourcing for content delivery is then described, followed by an
exemplary campus wireless network that encompasses the above concepts.
