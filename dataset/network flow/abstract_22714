We consider a continuum aggregation model with nonlinear local repulsion
given by a degenerate power-law diffusion with general exponent. The steady
states and their properties in one dimension are studied both analytically and
numerically, suggesting that the quadratic diffusion is a critical case. The
focus is on finite-size, monotone and compactly supported equilibria. We also
investigate numerically the long time asymptotics of the model by simulations
of the evolution equation. Issues such as metastability and local/ global
stability are studied in connection to the gradient flow formulation of the
model.
