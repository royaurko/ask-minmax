Network reconciliation is the problem of identifying nodes in separate
networks that represent the same entity, for example matching nodes across
social networks that correspond to the same user. We introduce a technique to
compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on precision and recall for
network reconciliation algorithms. The bounds require some verified matches,
but those matches may be used to develop the algorithms. The bounds do not
require knowledge of the network generation process, and they can supply
confidence levels for individual matches.
