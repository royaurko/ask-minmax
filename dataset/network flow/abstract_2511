The fractal and self-similarity properties are revealed in many real complex
networks. However, the classical information dimension of complex networks is
not practical for real complex networks. In this paper, a new information
dimension to characterize the dimension of complex networks is proposed. The
difference of information for each box in the box-covering algorithm of complex
networks is considered by this measure. The proposed method is applied to
calculate the fractal dimensions of some real networks. Our results show that
the proposed method is efficient for fractal dimension of complex networks.
