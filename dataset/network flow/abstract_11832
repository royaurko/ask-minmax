Pre-mRNA splicing relies on the poorly understood dynamic interplay between
>150 protein components of the spliceosome. The steps at which splicing can be
regulated remain largely unknown. We systematically analyzed the effect of
knocking down the components of the splicing machinery on alternative splicing
events relevant for cell proliferation and apoptosis and used this information
to reconstruct a network of functional interactions. The network accurately
captures known physical and functional associations and identifies new ones,
revealing remarkable regulatory potential of core spliceosomal components,
related to the order and duration of their recruitment during spliceosome
assembly. In contrast with standard models of regulation at early steps of
splice site recognition, factors involved in catalytic activation of the
spliceosome display regulatory properties. The network also sheds light on the
antagonism between hnRNP C and U2AF, and on targets of antitumor drugs, and can
be widely used to identify mechanisms of splicing regulation.
