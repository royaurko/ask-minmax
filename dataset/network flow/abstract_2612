We review the current understanding on universal behaviors in granular flows
through a vertical pipe and traffic flows. We carry out weakly nonlinear
analysis of a model for traffic flows based on the technique of soliton
perturbations, and determine the selected propagating velocity, the amplitude,
the width of interfaces connecting between jam phase and non-jam phase. From
the direct simulation of the model, we have confirmed the validity of our
theoretical analysis. We also introduce a model for granular pipe flow
supplemented by the white noise, which reproduces $P(f)\sim f^{-4/3}$, where
$P(f)$ is the power spectrum in the frequency $f$.
