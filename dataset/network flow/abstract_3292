We consider advection of small inertial particles by a random fluid flow with
a strong steady shear component. It is known that inertial particles suspended
in a random flow can exhibit clusterization even if the flow is incompressible.
We study this phenomenon through statistical characteristics of a separation
vector between two particles. As usual in a random flow, moments of distance
between particles grow exponentially. We calculate the rates of this growth
using the saddle-point approximation in the path-integral formalism. We also
calculate correction to the Lyapunov exponent due to small inertia by a
perturbation theory expansion.
