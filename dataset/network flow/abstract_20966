We use stochastic geometry to analyze the performance of a partial
decode-and-forward (PDF) relaying scheme applied in a user-assisted relaying
setting, where an active user relays data through another idle user in uplink
cellular communication. We present the geometric model of a network deploying
user-assisted relaying and propose two geometric cooperation policies for fast
and slow fading channels. We analytically derive the cooperation probability
for both policies. This cooperation probability is further used in the
analytical derivation of the moments of inter-cell interference power caused by
system-wide deployment of this user-assisted PDF relaying. We then model the
inter-cell interference power statistics using the Gamma distribution by
matching the first two moments analytically derived. This cooperation and
interference analysis provides the theoretical basis for quantitatively
evaluating the performance impact of user-assisted relaying in cellular
networks. We then numerically evaluate the average transmission rate
performance and show that user-assisted relaying can significantly improve
per-user transmission rate despite of increased inter-cell interference. This
transmission rate gain is significant for active users near the cell edge and
further increases with higher idle user density, supporting user-assisted
relaying as a viable solution to crowded population areas.
