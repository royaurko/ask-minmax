We use rich clusters of galaxies in the Northern and Southern Galactic
hemispheres up to a redshift z=0.12 to determine the cluster correlation
function. We show that superclusters of galaxies and voids between them form a
moderately regular network. As a result the correlation function determined for
clusters located in rich superclusters oscillates: it has a series of regularly
spaced secondary maxima and minima. The scale of the supercluster-void network,
determined from the period of oscillations, is P=115 Mpc. The amplitude of
oscillations is about 3 times larger than the estimated error. We compare the
observed cluster correlation function with similar functions derived for
popular models of structure formation. We find that the production of the
observed cluster correlation function in any model with a smooth transition of
the power spectrum from a Harrison-Zeldovich regime with positive spectral
index on long wavelengths to a negative spectral index on short wavelengths is
highly unlikely. The power spectrum must have an extra peak located at the
wavelength equal to the period of oscillations of the correlation function.
