In this paper, we mainly study a hydrodynamic system modeling the flow of
nematic liquid crystals. In three dimensions, we first establish local
well-posedness of the initial-boundary value problem of the system. Then, we
prove the existence of global strong solution to the system with small
initial-boundary condition.
