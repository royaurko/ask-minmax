We calculate the elliptic flow of charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at
2.76 TeV in relativistic viscous hydrodynamics. The recent data of the ALICE
Collaboration on the elliptic flow as function of the centrality can be very
well described using the hydrodynamic expansion of a fluid with a small shear
viscosity eta/s=0.08. The elliptic flow as function of the transverse momentum
shows systematic deviations from a hydrodynamic behavior in the small momenta
region pt<800MeV. It indicates that a non-negligible contribution of
non-thermalized particles from jet fragmentation is present.
