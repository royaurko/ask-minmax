Yard-Sale (YS) is a stochastic multiplicative wealth-exchange model with two
phases: a stable one where wealth is shared, and an unstable one where wealth
condenses onto one agent. YS is here studied numerically on 1d rings, 2d square
lattices, and random graphs with variable average coordination, comparing its
properties with those in mean field (MF). Equilibrium properties in the stable
phase are almost unaffected by the introduction of a network. Measurement of
decorrelation times in the stable phase allow us to determine the critical
interface with very good precision, and it turns out to be the same, for all
networks analyzed, as the one that can be analytically derived in MF. In the
unstable phase, on the other hand, dynamical as well as asymptotic properties
are strongly network-dependent. Wealth no longer condenses on a single agent,
as in MF, but onto an extensive set of agents, the properties of which depend
on the network. Connections with previous studies of coalescence of immobile
reactants are discussed, and their analytic predictions are successfully
compared with our numerical results.
