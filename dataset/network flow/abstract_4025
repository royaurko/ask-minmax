Assuming some regularity of the dynamical zeta function, we establish an
explicit formula with an error term for the prime orbit counting function of a
suspended flow. We define the subclass of self-similar flows, for which we give
an extensive analysis of the error term in the corresponding prime orbit
theorem.
