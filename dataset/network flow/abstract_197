In this work, a 3-D simulation is performed to study for the solid-fluid
coupling effect driven by piezoelectric materials and utilizes asymmetric
obstacles to control the flow direction. The result of simulation is also
verified. For a micropump, it is crucial to find the optimal working frequency
which produce maximum net flow rate. The PZT plate vibrates under the first
mode, which is symmetric. Adjusting the working frequency, the maximum flow
rate can be obtained. For the micrpump we studied, the optimal working
frequency is 3.2K Hz. At higher working frequency, say 20K Hz, the fluid-solid
membrane may come out a intermediate mode, which is different from the first
mode and the second mode. It is observed that the center of the mode drifts.
Meanwhile, the result shows that a phase shift lagging when the excitation
force exists in the vibration response. Finally, at even higher working
frequency, say 30K Hz, a second vibration mode is observed.
