Based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) model with periodic boundary condition,
a modified NS model was proposed by adding the overtaking strategy (OS). We
observed that (i) traffic jams still occur in our model; (ii) OS increases the
traffic flow in the regime where the densities exceed the maximum flow density.
Moreover, we analyzed the phase transition (from free flow phase to jammed
phase) of the modified NS model by studying the relaxation time, correlation
function and order parameter, respectively. Furthermore, we defined $S$ as the
overtaking success rate, which could be used to characterize the phase
transition. We found that the influence of OS on the transition density is
dominated by the braking probability $p$ and our model differs from the NS
model mainly in the regime where the densities are larger than transition
density.
