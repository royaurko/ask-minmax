In this two-part paper, the DMT of cooperative multi-hop networks is
examined. The focus is on single-source single-sink (ss-ss) multi-hop relay
networks having slow-fading links and relays that potentially possess multiple
antennas. The present paper examines the two end-points of the DMT of
full-duplex networks. In particular, the maximum achievable diversity of
arbitrary multi-terminal wireless networks is shown to be equal to the min-cut.
The maximum multiplexing gain of arbitrary full-duplex ss-ss networks is shown
to be equal to the min-cut rank, using a new connection to a deterministic
network. We also prove some basic results including a proof that the colored
noise encountered in AF protocols for cooperative networks can be treated as
white noise for DMT computations. The DMT of a parallel channel with
independent MIMO links is also computed here. As an application of these basic
results, we prove that a linear tradeoff between maximum diversity and maximum
multiplexing gain is achievable for full-duplex networks with single antenna
nodes. All protocols in this paper are explicit and rely only upon
amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying. Half duplex networks are studied, and
explicit codes for all protocols proposed in both parts, are provided in the
companion paper.
