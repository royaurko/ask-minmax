Clustering in wireless sensor networks is one of the crucial methods for
increasing of network lifetime. There are many algorithms for clustering. One
of the important cluster based algorithm in wireless sensor networks is LEACH
algorithm. In this paper we proposed a new clustering method for increasing of
network lifetime. We distribute several sensors with a high-energy for managing
the cluster head and to decrease their responsibilities in network. The
performance of the proposed algorithm via computer simulation was evaluated and
compared with other clustering algorithms. The simulation results show the high
performance of the proposed clustering algorithm.
