We propose new direction to understanding evolutionary dynamics of complex
networks using two different types of collaboration networks: academic
collaboration networks; and, disaster collaboration networks. The results show
that academic collaboration network has all properties of small-world networks
and can be considered a real small-world network with the result of its
structural analysis maybe being extendable for other real-networks who share
the common grounds of small-world properties.
