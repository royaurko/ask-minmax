Parallel shear flows come with continuous symmetries of translation in the
downstream and spanwise direction. As a consequence, flow states that differ in
their spanwise or downstream location but are otherwise identical are
dynamically equivalent. In the case of travelling waves, this trivial degree of
freedom can be removed by going to a frame of reference that moves with the
state, thereby turning the travelling wave in the laboratory frame to a fixed
point in the comoving frame of reference. We here discuss a general method by
which the translational displacements can be removed also for more complicated
and dynamically active states and demonstrate its application for several
examples. For flows states in the asymptotic suction boundary layer we show
that in the case of the long-period oscillatory edge state we can find local
phase speeds which remove the fast oscillations and reveal the slow vortex
dynamics underlying the burst phenomenon. For spanwise translating states we
show that the method removes the drift but not the dynamical events that cause
the big spanwise displacement. For a turbulent case we apply the method to the
spanwise shifts and find slow components that are correlated over very long
times. Calculations for plane Poiseuille flow show that the long correlations
in the transverse motions are not special to the asymptotic suction boundary
layer.
