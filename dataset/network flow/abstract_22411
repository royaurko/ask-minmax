We discuss various sources of azimuthal correlations in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions. The integral measure Phi is applied to quantify the
correlations. We first consider separately the correlations caused by the
elliptic flow, resonance decays, jets and transverse momentum conservation. An
effect of randomly lost particles is also discussed. Using the PYTHIA and
HIJING event generators we produce a sample of events which mimic experimental
data. By means of kinematic cuts and particle's selection criteria, the data
are analyzed to identify a dominant source of correlations.
