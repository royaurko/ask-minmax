A statistical description of heavy particles suspended in incompressible
rough self-similar flows is developed. It is shown that, differently from
smooth flows, particles do not form fractal clusters. They rather distribute
inhomogeneously with a statistics that only depends on a local Stokes number,
given by the ratio between the particles' response time and the turnover time
associated to the observation scale. Particle clustering is reduced when
increasing the fluid roughness. Heuristic arguments supported by numerics are
used to explain this effect in terms of the algebraic tails of the probability
density function of the velocity difference between two particles. These tails
are a signature of events during which particle couples approach each other
very closely.
