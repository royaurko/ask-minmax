This paper focuses on the problem of growing multiplex networks. Currently,
the results on the inter-layer degree distribution of growing multiplex
networks present in the literature pertain to the case of two layers, and are
confined to the special case of homogeneous growth. In the present paper, we
obtain closed-form solutions for the inter-layer degree distribution of
heterogeneously growing multilayer networks with arbitrary number of layers in
the steady state. Heterogeneous growth means that each incoming node
establishes different numbers of links in different layers. We first briefly
consider the problem for two layers: we consider the cases of preferential
attachment and uniform attachment separately, and we obtain closed-form
expressions for the inter-layer degree distribution and expected degree
distributions in each layer. Then for both attachment schemes, we generalize
the problem to $M$ layers, and provide solutions for the joint degree
distribution across all layers.
