In this paper we generalize examples of Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian
submanifolds constructed by Lee and Wang in $\mathbb{C}^m$ to toric almost
Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct examples of weighted Hamiltonian stationary
Lagrangian submanifolds in toric almost Calabi-Yau manifolds and solutions of
generalized Lagrangian mean curvature flows starting from these examples. We
allow these flows to have some singularities and topological changes.
