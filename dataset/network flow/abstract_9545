In this paper, we consider the effect of feedback channel error on the
throughput of one-hop wireless networks under the random connection model. The
transmission strategy is based on activating source-destination pairs with
strongest direct links. While these activated pairs are identified based on
Channel State Information (CSI) at the receive side, the transmit side will be
provided with a noisy version of this information via the feedback channel.
Such error will degrade network throughput, as we investigate in this paper.
Our results show that if the feedback error probability is below a given
threshold, network can tolerate such error without any significant throughput
loss. The threshold value depends on the number of nodes in the network and the
channel fading distribution. Such analysis is crucial in design of error
correction codes for feedback channel in such networks.
