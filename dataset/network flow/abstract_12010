Human language can be described as a complex network of linked words. In such
a treatment, each distinct word in language is a vertex of this web, and
neighboring words in sentences are connected by edges. It was recently found
(Ferrer and Sol\'e) that the distribution of the numbers of connections of
words in such a network is of a peculiar form which includes two pronounced
power-law regions. Here we treat language as a self-organizing network of
interacting words. In the framework of this concept, we completely describe the
observed Word Web structure without fitting.
