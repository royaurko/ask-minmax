We study the dynamical properties of a diffusing lamb captured by a diffusing
lion on the complex networks with various sizes of $N$. We find that the life
time <T>$ of a lamb scales as <T>\sim N$ and the survival probability $S(N\to
\infty,t)$ becomes finite on scale-free networks with degree exponent
$\gamma>3$. However, $S(N,t)$ for $\gamma<3$ has a long-living tail on
tree-structured scale-free networks and decays exponentially on looped
scale-free networks. It suggests that the second moment of degree distribution
<k^2>$ is the relevant factor for the dynamical properties in diffusive capture
process. We numerically find that the normalized number of capture events at a
node with degree $k$, $n(k)$, decreases as $n(k)\sim k^{-\sigma}$. When
$\gamma<3$, $n(k)$ still increases anomalously for $k\approx k_{max}$. We
analytically show that $n(k)$ satisfies the relation $n(k)\sim k^2P(k)$ and the
total number of capture events $N_{tot}$ is proportional to <k^2>$, which
causes the $\gamma$ dependent behavior of $S(N,t)$ and <T>$.
