In this article we prove an important inequality regarding the Ruelle
operator in hyperbolic flows. This was already proven briefly by Mark Pollicott
and Richard Sharp in a low dimensional case, but we present a clearer proof of
the inequality, filling in gaps and explaining the ideas in more detail, and
extend the inequality to higher dimensional flows. This inequality is necessary
to prove a proposition about the analyticity of Ruelle zeta functions.
