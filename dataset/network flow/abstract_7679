In this paper we investigate the life-span of classical solutions to the
hyperbolic geometric flow in two space variables with slow decay initial data.
By establishing some new estimates on the solutions of linear wave equations in
two space variables, we give a lower bound of the life-span of classical
solutions to the hyperbolic geometric flow with asymptotic flat initial Riemann
surfaces.
