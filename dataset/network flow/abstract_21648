Colour coherence in hard photoproduction is considered using the Monte Carlo
event generators PYTHIA and HERWIG. Significant effects in the parton shower
are found using multijet observables for direct and resolved photon induced
reactions. The particle flow in the interjet region of direct processes shows a
strong influence of string fragmentation effects.
