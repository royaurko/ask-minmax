Drawing on an ongoing longitudinal research study, we discuss problems in the
development of five next generation community networking projects in central
New York. The projects were funded under a state program to diffuse broadband
technologies in economically depressed areas of the state. The networks are
technologically complex and entail high costs for subscribers. The political
economy of the development process has biased the subscriber base toward the
resource rich and away from the resource poor, and toward tried-and-tested uses
like Internet and intra-organizational connectivity and away from
community-oriented uses. These trends raise troubling questions about network
ontology and function, and about the relation between the network and its
physical host community. The need for appropriate social policy, and new
planning practices, is argued to effect desired change.
