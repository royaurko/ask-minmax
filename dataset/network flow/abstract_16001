Centrality measures, erstwhile popular amongst the sociologists and
psychologists, have seen wide and increasing applications across several
disciplines of late. In conjunction with the big data problems there came the
need to analyze big networks and in this connection, centrality measures became
of great interest to the community of mathematicians, computer scientists and
physicists. While it is an important question to ask how one can rank vertices
based on their importance in a network, there hasn't been a commonly accepted
definition, mainly due to the subjectivity of the term "importance". Amongst a
plethora of application specific definitions available in the literature to
rank the vertices, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector
centrality (page-rank) have been the most important and widely applied ones. In
the current paper, we formulate a method to determine the betweenness ordering
of $k$ vertices without exactly computing their betweenness indices - which is
a daunting task for networks of large size. The method results very efficient
ordering even when runs for linear time in the number of edges. We apply our
approach to find the betweenness ordering of $k$ vertices in several synthetic
and real world graphs. We compare our method with the available techniques in
the literature and show that our method fares several times better than the
currently known techniques. We further show that the accuracy of our algorithm
gets better with the increase in size and density of the network.
