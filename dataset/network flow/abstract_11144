computers into the real world, to serve humans where the ubiquitous network
is the underneath infrastructure. In order to provide ubiquitous services
(u-Service) which deliver useful information to service users without human
intervention, this paper implements a proactive information delivery system
using Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth is a lowpowered networking service that
supports several protocol profiles, most importantly file transfer.Combined
together, ubiquitous computing and Bluetooth ha e the potential to furnish
ubiquitous solutions (u-Solutions) that are efficient, employ simplified design
characteristics, and collaboratively perform functions they are otherwise not
capable. Thus, this paper first addresses the current Bluetooth technology.
Then, it suggests and develops the proactive information delivery system
utilizing Bluetooth and ubiquitous computing network concepts. The proactive
information delivery system can be used in many ubiquitous applications such as
ubiquitous commerce (u-Commerce) and ubiquitous education (u- Education)
