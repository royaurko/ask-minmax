Peer-to-Peer systems are based on the concept of resources localization and
mutualisation in dynamic context. In specific environment such as mobile
networks, characterized by high variability and dynamicity of network
conditions and performances, where nodes can join and leave the network
dynamically, resources reliability and availability constitute a critical
issue. The resource discovery problem arises in the context of peer to peer
(P2P) networks, where at any point of time a peer may be placed at or removed
from any location over a general purpose network. Locating a resource or
service efficiently is one of the most important issues related to peer-to-peer
networks. The objective of a search mechanism is to successfully locate
resources while incurring low overhead and low delay. This paper presents a
survey on P2P networks management: classification, applications, platforms,
simulators and security.
