We identify a mechanism for a type of hysteresis which we predict to occur in
a variety of depinning transitions. We show that the phenomenon of one-way
hysteresis is generic to stress-overshoot models of the depinning transition,
and we show how to calculate the size of the hysteresis gap exactly in a large
class of models. Unlike thermodynamic phase transitions, the dynamic phase
transition is still {\em continuous} despite the presence of hysteresis because
the terms which produce the hysteresis are renormalization group irrelevant. We
discuss the experimental and numerical signatures of one-way hysteresis, which
includes microscopic nucleation.
