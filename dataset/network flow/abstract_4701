If the matter produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions reaches
thermal equilibrium, its subsequent evolution follows the laws of ideal fluid
dynamics. We show that general predictions can be made on this basis alone,
irrespective of the details of the hydrodynamical model. We derive several
scaling rules for momentum spectra and anisotropic flow (in particular the
elliptic flow, v2, and the hexadecupole flow, v4) of identified particles.
Comparison with existing data is briefly discussed, and qualitative predictions
are made for LHC.
