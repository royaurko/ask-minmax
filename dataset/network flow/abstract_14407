Lax pair and Hamiltonian formulations of the N=4 supersymmetric Toda chain
(KdV) hierarchy in N=4 superspace are proposed. The general formulae for the
infinite tower of its bosonic flows in terms of the Lax operator in N=4
superspace are derived. A new N=4 superfield basis in which the flows are local
is constructed and its embedding in the N=4 O(4) superconformal supercurrent is
established. A proof that the flows possess five complex conjugations and
aninfinite-dimensional group of discrete symmetries in N=4 superspace is
presented. A relation between the two descriptions of the hierarchy in N=4
superspace used in the literature is established. All known N=2 superfield
representations of the N=4 KdV hierarchy are shown to derive from our N=4
superspace Lax representation.
