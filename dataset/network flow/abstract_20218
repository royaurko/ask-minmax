Let S be an oriented surface of genus g with m punctures and 3g-3+m>1. For
each component of a stratum in the moduli space of quadratic or abelian
differentials, we construct a subshift of finite type and a Borel suspension
which admits a finite-to-one semi-conjugacy into the Teichmueller flow on Q.
This is used to show that the Lebesgue measure on Q is the unique measure of
maximal entropy. If h is the entropy of the Lebesgue measure, then for every
a>0 there is a compact subset K of Q such that the entropy of an invariant
Borel probability measure on Q-K does not exceed h-1+a. Moreover, the growth
rate of periodic orbits in Q-K does not exceed h-1+a$. This implies that the
number of periodic orbits in Q of period at most R is asymptotic to
exp(hR)/hR.Finally we give a unified and simplified proof of exponential mixing
for the Lebesgue measure on strata.
