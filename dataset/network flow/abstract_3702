We carry out a series of numerical simulations of viscous accretion flows
having a reasonable spatial distribution of the viscosity parameter. We add the
power-law cooling throughout the flow. We show that, in agreement with the
theoretical solutions of viscous transonic flows, matter having the viscosity
parameter above a critical value becomes a Keplerian disk while matter having
lesser viscosity remains a low angular momentum, sub-Keplerian flow. The latter
component produces centrifugal pressure supported shock waves. Thus, for
instance, a flow having sufficiently high viscosity on the equatorial plane and
low viscosity above and below, would produce a Two Component Advective Flow
(TCAF) where a Keplerian disk is surrounded by a rapidly infalling
sub-Keplerian halo. We find that the post- shock region of the relatively
cooler Keplerian disk is evaporated and the overall configuration is quite
stable. This agrees with the theoretical model with two components which
attempt to explain the spectral and timing properties of black hole candidates.
