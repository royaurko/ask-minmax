In this paper, we study and analyze cognitive radio networks in which
secondary users (SUs) are equipped with Energy Harvesting (EH) capability. We
design a random spectrum sensing and access protocol for the SU that exploits
the primary link's feedback and requires less average sensing time. Unlike
previous works proposed earlier in literature, we do not assume perfect
feedback. Instead, we take into account the more practical possibilities of
overhearing unreliable feedback signals and accommodate spectrum sensing
errors. Moreover, we assume an interference-based channel model where the
receivers are equipped with multi-packet reception (MPR) capability.
Furthermore, we perform power allocation at the SU with the objective of
maximizing the secondary throughput under constraints that maintain certain
quality-of-service (QoS) measures for the primary user (PU).
