In this paper we present a method for the estimation of the color of the
illuminant in RAW images. The method includes a Convolutional Neural Network
that has been specially designed to produce multiple local estimates. A
multiple illuminant detector determines whether or not the local outputs of the
network must be aggregated into a single estimate. We evaluated our method on
standard datasets with single and multiple illuminants, obtaining lower
estimation errors with respect to those obtained by other general purpose
methods in the state of the art.
