In IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), network nodes
experiencing collisions on the shared channel need to backoff for a random
period of time, which is uniformly selected from the Contention Window (CW).
This contention window is dynamically controlled by the Backoff algorithm.
First step to design a an efficient backoff algorithm for multi-hop ad hoc
network is to analysis of the existing backoff algorithms in multi-hop ad hoc
networks. Thus, in this paper, we considered two important multi-hop adhoc
network scenarios: (a) Node Mobility Scenario and (b) Transmission Range
Scenario and analyze and evaluate both the impact of mobility (i.e. node speed)
and the impact of transmission range of nodes on the performance of various
backoff algorithms
