Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a popular framework to express
multivariate probability distributions. Acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs)
are generalizations of DAGs that can succinctly capture much richer sets of
conditional independencies, and are especially useful in modeling the effects
of latent variables implicitly. Unfortunately there are currently no good
parameterizations of general ADMGs. In this paper, we apply recent work on
cumulative distribution networks and copulas to propose one one general
construction for ADMG models. We consider a simple parameter estimation
approach, and report some encouraging experimental results.
