STAR's measurements of directed flow ($v_1$) for pions, kaons (charged and
$K_s^0$), protons and antiprotons for Au + Au collisions at $\sqrtsNN = 200$
GeV are presented. Negative $v_1(y)$ slope is observed for pions, antiprotons,
protons and kaons. The proton $v_1(y)$ slope at midrapidity is found extremely
small. Sizable difference is seen between $v_1$ of protons and anti-protons in
5-30% central collisions. Anti-flow can explain the negative slope, however, it
has difficulties explaining the centrality dependence of the difference between
the $v_1(y)$ slopes of protons and anti-protons. The $v_1$ excitation function
is presented. Comparisons to model calculations (RQMD, uRQMD, AMPT and QGSM)
are made, and it is found that none of the four models can successfully
describe the data.
