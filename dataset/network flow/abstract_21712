We discuss the role of the dilaton tadpole in the holographic description of
non-supersymmetric gauge theories that are conformal in the planar limit. On
the string theory side, the presence of the dilaton tadpole modifies the AdS
background inducing a logarithmic running for the radius and the dilaton. Using
the holographic prescription we compute the Wilson loop on the gravity side and
find a smooth interpolating potential between asymptotic freedom and
confinement, as expected from field theory.
