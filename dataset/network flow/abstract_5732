The cooperative behaviour of interacting neurons and synapses is studied
using models and methods from statistical physics. The competition between
training error and entropy may lead to discontinuous properties of the neural
network. This is demonstrated for a few examples: Perceptron, associative
memory, learning from examples, generalization, multilayer networks, structure
recognition, Bayesian estimate, on-line training, noise estimation and time
series generation.
