Distributed system as e.g. artificial immune systems, complex adaptive
systems, or multi-agent systems are widely used in Computer Science, e.g. for
network security, optimisations, or simulations. In these systems, small
entities move through the network and perform certain tasks. At some time, the
entities move to another place and require therefore information where to move
is most profitable. Common used systems do not provide any information or use a
centralised approach where a center delegates the entities. This article
discusses whether small information about the neighbours enhances the
performance of the overall system or not. Therefore, two information-protocols
are introduced and analysed. In addition, the protocols are implemented and
tested using the artificial immune system SANA that protects a network against
intrusions.
