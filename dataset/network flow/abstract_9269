In this paper, firstly, we study analytically the topological features of a
family of hierarchical lattices (HLs) from the view point of complex networks.
We derive some basic properties of HLs controlled by a parameter $q$. Our
results show that scale-free networks are not always small-world, and support
the conjecture that self-similar scale-free networks are not assortative.
Secondly, we define a deterministic family of graphs called small-world
hierarchical lattices (SWHLs). Our construction preserves the structure of
hierarchical lattices, while the small-world phenomenon arises. Finally, the
dynamical processes of intentional attacks and collective synchronization are
studied and the comparisons between HLs and Barab{\'asi}-Albert (BA) networks
as well as SWHLs are shown. We show that degree distribution of scale-free
networks does not suffice to characterize their synchronizability, and that
networks with smaller average path length are not always easier to synchronize.
