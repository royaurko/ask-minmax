In data-intensive applications data transfer is a primary cause of job
execution delay. Data access time depends on bandwidth. The major bottleneck to
supporting fast data access in Grids is the high latencies of Wide Area
Networks and Internet. Effective scheduling can reduce the amount of data
transferred across the internet by dispatching a job to where the needed data
are present. Another solution is to use a data replication mechanism. Objective
of dynamic replica strategies is reducing file access time which leads to
reducing job runtime. In this paper we develop a job scheduling policy and a
dynamic data replication strategy, called HRS (Hierarchical Replication
Strategy), to improve the data access efficiencies. We study our approach and
evaluate it through simulation. The results show that our algorithm has
improved 12% over the current strategies.
