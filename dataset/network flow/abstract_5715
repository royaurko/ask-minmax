Mobile ad hoc network is a wireless, self-configured, infrastructureless
network of mobile nodes. The nodes are highly mobile, which makes the
application running on them face network related problems like node failure,
link failure, network level disconnection, scarcity of resources, buffer
degradation, and intermittent disconnection etc. Node failure and Network fault
are need to be monitored continuously by supervising the network status. Node
monitoring protocol is crucial, so it is required to test the protocol
exhaustively to verify and validate the functionality and accuracy of the
designed protocol. This paper presents a validation model for Node Monitoring
Protocol using Specification and Description Llanguage (SDL) using both Static
Agent (SA) and Mobile Agent (MA). We have verified properties of the Node
Monitoring Protocol (NMP) based on the global states with no exits, deadlock
states or proper termination states using reachability graph. Message Sequence
Chart (MSC) gives an intuitive understanding of the described system behavior
with varying node density and complex behavior etc.
