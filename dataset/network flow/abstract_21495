We study dissipation in a dilute Bose gas induced by the motion of a
macroscopic object. A blue-detuned laser beam focused on the center of a
trapped gas of sodium atoms was scanned both above and below the BEC transition
temperature. The measurements allow for a comparison between the heating rates
for the superfluid and normal gas.
