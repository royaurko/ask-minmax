We study the conditions for persistent cooperation in an off-lattice model of
mobile agents playing the Prisoner's Dilemma game with pure, unconditional
strategies. Each agent has an exclusion radius rP, which accounts for the
population viscosity, and an interaction radius rint, which defines the
instantaneous contact network for the game dynamics. We show that, differently
from the rP=0 case, the model with finite-sized agents presents a coexistence
phase with both cooperators and defectors, besides the two absorbing phases, in
which either cooperators or defectors dominate. We provide, in addition, a
geometric interpretation of the transitions between phases. In analogy with
lattice models, the geometric percolation of the contact network (i.e.,
irrespective of the strategy) enhances cooperation. More importantly, we show
that the percolation of defectors is an essential condition for their survival.
Differently from compact clusters of cooperators, isolated groups of defectors
will eventually become extinct if not percolating, independently of their size.
