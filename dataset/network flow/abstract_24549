We study the compressive diffusion strategies over distributed networks based
on the diffusion implementation and adaptive extraction of the information from
the compressed diffusion data. We demonstrate that one can achieve a comparable
performance with the full information exchange configurations, even if the
diffused information is compressed into a scalar or a single bit. To this end,
we provide a complete performance analysis for the compressive diffusion
strategies. We analyze the transient, steady-state and tracking performance of
the configurations in which the diffused data is compressed into a scalar or a
single-bit. We propose a new adaptive combination method improving the
convergence performance of the compressive diffusion strategies further. In the
new method, we introduce one more freedom-of-dimension in the combination
matrix and adapt it by using the conventional mixture approach in order to
enhance the convergence performance for any possible combination rule used for
the full diffusion configuration. We demonstrate that our theoretical analysis
closely follow the ensemble averaged results in our simulations. We provide
numerical examples showing the improved convergence performance with the new
adaptive combination method.
