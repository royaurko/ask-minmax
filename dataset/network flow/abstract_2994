Riemann and sectional curvatures of magnetic twisted flux tubes in Riemannian
manifold are computed to investigate the stability of the plasma astrophysical
tubes. The geodesic equations are used to show that in the case of thick
magnetic tubes, the curvature of planar (Frenet torsion-free) tubes have the
effect ct of damping the flow speed along the tube. Stability of geodesic flows
in the Riemannian twisted thin tubes (almost filaments), against constant
radial perturbations is investigated by using the method of negative sectional
curvature for unstable flows. No special form of the flow like Beltrami flows
is admitted, and the proof is general for the case of thin magnetic flux tubes.
In the magnetic equilibrium state, the twist of the tube is shown to display
also a damping effect on the toroidal velocity of the plasma flow. It is found
that for positive perturbations and angular speed of the flow, instability is
achieved, since the sectional Ricci curvature of the magnetic twisted tube
metric is negative. Solar flare production may appear from these geometrical
instabilities of the twisted solar loops.
