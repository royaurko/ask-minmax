We report results of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a
one-component glassy system under the influence of a shear flow, with the aim
of investigating shear induced ordering of this system. In spite of the very
low temperature, the system transforms into a strained crystalline state
through well defined nucleation events. Various characteristics of the observed
ordering at different strain rates and temperatures are discussed. We also
define and discuss the transition rates.
