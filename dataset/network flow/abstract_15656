For the problem whether Graphic Processing Unit(GPU),the stream processor
with high performance of floating-point computing is applicable to neural
networks, this paper proposes the parallel recognition algorithm of
Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs).It adopts Compute Unified Device
Architecture(CUDA)technology, definite the parallel data structures, and
describes the mapping mechanism for computing tasks on CUDA. It compares the
parallel recognition algorithm achieved on GPU of GTX200 hardware architecture
with the serial algorithm on CPU. It improves speed by nearly 60 times. Result
shows that GPU based the stream processor architecture ate more applicable to
some related applications about neural networks than CPU.
