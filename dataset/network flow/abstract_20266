In this investigation we revisit the question of the linear stability
analysis of 2D steady Euler flows characterized by the presence of compact
regions with constant vorticity embedded in a potential flow. We give a
complete derivation of the linearized perturbation equation which, recognizing
that the underlying equilibrium problem is of the free-boundary type, is done
systematically using methods of the shape-differential calculus. Particular
attention is given to the proper linearization of the contour integrals
describing vortex induction. The thus obtained perturbation equation is
validated by analytically deducing from it the stability analyses of the
circular vortex, originally due to Kelvin (1880), and of the elliptic vortex,
originally due to Love (1893), as special cases. We also propose and validate a
spectrally-accurate numerical approach to the solution of the stability problem
for vortices of general shape in which all singular integrals are evaluated
analytically.
