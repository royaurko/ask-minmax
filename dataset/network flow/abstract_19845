The observation of inclusive diffraction with the CMS detector at the LHC is
presented for centre-of-mass energies \sqrt s = 0.9 TeV and 2.36 TeV.
Diffractive events are selected by the presence of a Large Rapidity Gap in the
forward region of the CMS detector and uncorrected data are compared with Monte
Carlo simulations based on the event generators PYTHIA and PHOJET. The
measurement of the forward energy flow, in the pseudorapidity region 3.15 <
|\eta| < 4.9, is also presented at \sqrt s = 0.9 TeV, 2.36 TeV and 7 TeV.
Uncorrected data are compared with Monte Carlo simulations based on PYTHIA.
