The gradual fall of the shear viscosity below 2.8K, observed in a liquid
helium 4 flowing through a capillary, is examined. The disappearance of the
shear viscosity in a capillary flow is a manifestation of superfluidity in
dissipative phenomena, the onset mechanism of which is a subtle problem
compared to that of superfluidity in non-dissipative phenomena. Applying the
linear-response theory to the reciprocal of the shear viscosity coefficient, we
relate these two types of superfluidity using the Kramers-Kronig relation. We
obtain a formula describing the influence of Bose statistics on the kinematic
shear viscosity in terms of the susceptibility. Compared to an ordinary liquid,
a liquid helium 4 above the lambda point has a 1/1000 times smaller shear
viscosity coefficient. Hence, although in the normal phase, it is already an
anomalous liquid under the strong influence of Bose statistics. The coherent
many-body wave function grows to an intermediate size between a macroscopic and
a microscopic one, not as a thermal fluctuation but as a thermal equilibrium
state. Beginning with bosons without the condensate, we make a perturbation
calculation of its susceptibility with respect to the repulsive interaction. We
examine how, with decreasing temperature, the growth of the coherent wave
function gradually suppresses the shear viscosity, and finally leads to a
frictionless flow at the lambda-point.
