We report on the surface rheology of cross-linked F-actin networks associated
with a lipid monolayer at the air-water interface of a Langmuir monolayer. The
rheological measurements are made using a Couette cell. These data demonstrate
that the network has a finite elastic modulus that grows as a function of the
cross-linking concentration. We also note that under steady-state flow the
system behaves as a power law fluid in which the effective viscosity decreases
with imposed shear.
