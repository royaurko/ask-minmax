We study the throughput and delay characteristics of wireless networks based
on an information-centric network architecture, where users are mainly
interested in retrieving content stored in the network, rather than in
maintaining source-destination communication. Nodes are assumed to be uniformly
distributed in the network area. Each node has a limited-capacity content
store, which it uses to cache contents according to the proposed caching
scheme. Requested content follows a general popularity distribution, and users
employ multi-hop communication to retrieve the requested content from the
closest cache. We derive the throughput-delay tradeoff of the
information-centric wireless network model and solve the caching optimization
problem. We then evaluate the network performance for a Zipf content popularity
distribution, letting the number of content types and the network size both go
to infinity. Finally, we extend our analysis to hybrid cellular networks where,
in addition to wireless nodes, there are a number of base stations uniformly
distributed at random in the network area.
