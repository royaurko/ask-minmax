Understanding the structures why links are formed is an important and
prominent research topic. In this paper, we therefore consider the link
prediction problem in face-to-face contact networks, and analyze the
predictability of new and recurring links. Furthermore, we study additional
influence factors, and the role of stronger ties in these networks.
Specifically, we compare neighborhood-based and path-based network proximity
measures in a threshold-based analysis for capturing temporal dynamics. The
results and insights of the analysis are a first step onto predictability
applications for human contact networks, for example, for improving
recommendations.
