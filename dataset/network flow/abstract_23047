The self-organized criticality (SOC) behavior of the edge plasma transport
has been investigated using the fluctuation data measured in the plasma edge
and the scrape-off layer of TEXTOR tokamak before and during the edge electrode
biasing experiments. In the "nonshear" discharge phase before biasing, both the
potential and density fluctuations clearly exhibit some of the characteristics
associated with SOC: (1) existence of f -1 power-law dependence in the
frequency spectrum, (2) slowly decaying long tails in the autocorrelation
function, (3) values of Hurst parameters larger than 0.5 at all the detected
radial locations, (4) non-Gaussian PDF of fluctuations and (5) radial
propagation of avalanche-like events in the edge plasma area. During the
biasing phase, with the generation of an edge radial electric field Er and
hence a sheared ErxB flow, the local turbulence is found to be well
decorrelated by the ErxB velocity shear, consistent with theoretical
predictions. Nevertheless, it is concomitantly found that the Hurst parameters
are substantially enhanced in the negative flow shear region and in the
scrape-off layer as well, which is contrary to theoretical expectation.
Implication of these observations to our understanding of plasma transport
mechanisms is discussed.
