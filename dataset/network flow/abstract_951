A MIMO Multi-hop Control Network (MCN) consists of a MIMO LTI system where
the communication between sensors, actuators and computational units is
supported by a (wireless) multi-hop communication network, and data flow is
performed using scheduling and routing of sensing and actuation data. We
provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the plant dynamics and on the
communication protocol configuration such that the Fault Detection and
Isolation (FDI) problem of failures and malicious attacks to communication
nodes can be solved.
