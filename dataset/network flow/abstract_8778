Pinched flow fractionation is shown to be an efficient and selective way to
quickly separate particles by size in a very polydisperse semi-concentrated
suspension. In an effort to optimize the method, we discuss the quantitative
influence of the pinching intensity in the balance between the requirements of
selectivity and minimal dilution.
