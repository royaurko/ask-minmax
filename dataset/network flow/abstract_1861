TIntelligent multi agent systems have great potentials to use in different
purposes and research areas. One of the important issues to apply intelligent
multi agent systems in real world and virtual environment is to develop a
framework that support machine learning model to reflect the whole complexity
of the real world. In this paper, we proposed a framework of intelligent agent
based neural network classification model to solve the problem of gap between
two applicable flows of intelligent multi agent technology and learning model
from real environment. We consider the new Supervised Multilayers Feed Forward
Neural Network (SMFFNN) model as an intelligent classification for learning
model in the framework. The framework earns the information from the respective
environment and its behavior can be recognized by the weights. Therefore, the
SMFFNN model that lies in the framework will give more benefits in finding the
suitable information and the real weights from the environment which result for
better recognition. The framework is applicable to different domains
successfully and for the potential case study, the clinical organization and
its domain is considered for the proposed framework
