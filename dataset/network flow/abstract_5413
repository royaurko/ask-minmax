We use complex network concepts to analyze statistical properties of urban
public transport networks (PTN). To this end, we present a comprehensive survey
of the statistical properties of PTNs based on the data of fourteen cities of
so far unexplored network size. Especially helpful in our analysis are
different network representations. Within a comprehensive approach we calculate
PTN characteristics in all of these representations and perform a comparative
analysis. The standard network characteristics obtained in this way often
correspond to features that are of practical importance to a passenger using
public traffic in a given city. Specific features are addressed that are unique
to PTNs and networks with similar transport functions (such as networks of
neurons, cables, pipes, vessels embedded in 2D or 3D space). Based on the
empirical survey, we propose a model that albeit being simple enough is capable
of reproducing many of the identified PTN properties. A central ingredient of
this model is a growth dynamics in terms of routes represented by self-avoiding
walks.
