We investigate the dynamics of bow shock nebulae created by pulsars moving
supersonically through a partially ionized interstellar. A fraction of
interstellar neutrals penetrating into the tail region of a pulsar wind will
undergo photo-ionization due to the UV light emitted by the nebula, with the
resulting mass loading dramatically changing the flow dynamics of the light
leptonic pulsar wind. Using a quasi 1-D hydrodynamic model of both
non-relativistic and relativistic flow, and focusing on scales much larger than
the stand-off distance, we find that a relatively small density of neutrals, as
low as $n_{\rm ISM}=10^{-4}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, is sufficient to strongly affect
the tail flow. Mass loading leads to the fast expansion of the pulsar wind
tail, making the tail flow intrinsically non-stationary. The shapes predicted
for the bow shock nebulae compare well with observations, both in H$\alpha$ and
X-rays.
