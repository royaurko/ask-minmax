In this paper, we study the behavior of Bergman kernels along the K\"{a}hler
Ricci flow on Fano manifolds. We show that the Bergman kernels are equivalent
along the K\"{a}hler Ricci flow under certain condition on the Ricci curvature
of the initial metric. Then, using a recent work of Tian and Zhang, we can
solve a conjecture of Tian for Fano manifolds of complex dimension $\le 3$.
