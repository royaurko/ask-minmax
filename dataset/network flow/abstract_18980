In this paper, cluster consensus in continuous-time networks of multi-agents
with time-varying topologies via non-identical inter-cluster inputs is studied.
The cluster consensus contains two aspects: intra-cluster synchronization, that
the state differences between agents in the same cluster converge to zero, and
inter-cluster separation, that the states of the agents in different clusters
do not approach. $\delta$-cluster-spanning-tree in continuous-time networks of
multi-agent systems plays essential role in analysis of cluster
synchronization. Inter-cluster separation can be realized by imposing adaptive
inputs that are identical within the same cluster but different in different
clusters, under the inter-cluster common influence condition. Simulation
examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived theoretical results.
