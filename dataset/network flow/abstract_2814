The linear instability of the electron temperature gradient (ETG) driven
modes in the presence of zonal flows is investigated. Random and deterministic
$cos$ - like profiles of the zonal flow are considered. It is shown that the
presence of shearing by zonal flows can stabilize the linear instability of ETG
drift modes.
