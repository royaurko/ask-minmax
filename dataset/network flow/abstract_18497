In this paper, we propose an algorithm that targets contamination and
eavesdropping adversaries. We consider the case when the number of independent
packets available to the eavesdropper is less than the multicast capacity of
the network. By means of our algorithm every node can verify the integrity of
the received packets easily and an eavesdropper is unable to get any meaningful
information about the source. We call it practical security if an eavesdropper
is unable to get any meaningful information about the source.We show that, by
giving up a small amount of overall capacity, our algorithm achieves achieves
the practically secure condition at a probability of one. Furthermore, the
communication overhead of our algorithm are negligible compared with previous
works, since the transmission of the hash values and the code coefficients are
both avoided.
