We develop an algebraic theory of synchronous dataflow networks. First, a
basic algebraic theory of networks, called BNA (Basic Network Algebra), is
introduced. This theory captures the basic algebraic properties of networks.
For synchronous dataflow networks, it is subsequently extended with additional
constants for the branching connections that occur between the cells of
synchronous dataflow networks and axioms for these additional constants. We
also give two models of the resulting theory, the one based on stream
transformers and the other based on processes as considered in process algebra.
