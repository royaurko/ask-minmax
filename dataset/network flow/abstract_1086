Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has recently gained considerable attentions from
both industry and research communities since the development of communication
technology and smart city. However, a proprietary and closed way of operating
hardwares in network equipments slows down the progress of new services
deployment and extension in IoV. Moreover, the tightly coupled control and data
planes in traditional networks significantly increase the complexity and cost
of network management. By proposing a novel architecture, called
Software-Defined Internet of Vehicles (SDIV), we adopt the software-defined
network (SDN) architecture to address these problems by leveraging its
separation of the control plane from the data plane and a uniform way to
configure heterogeneous switches. However, the characteristics of IoV introduce
the very challenges in rule installation due to the limited size of Flow Tables
at OpenFlow-enabled switches which are the main component of SDN. It is
necessary to build compact Flow Tables for the scalability of IoV. Accordingly,
we develop a rule optimization approach for real-time query service in SDIV.
Specifically, we separate wired data plane from wireless data plane and use
multicast address in wireless data plane. Furthermore, we introduce a
destination-driven model in wired data plane for reducing the number of rules
at switches. Experiments show that our rule optimization strategy reduces the
number of rules while keeping the performance of data transmission.
