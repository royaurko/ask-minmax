In this paper, we use the concept of colored edge graphs to model homogeneous
faults in networks. We then use this model to study the minimum connectivity
(and design) requirements of networks for being robust against homogeneous
faults within certain thresholds. In particular, necessary and sufficient
conditions for most interesting cases are obtained. For example, we will study
the following cases: (1) the number of colors (or the number of non-homogeneous
network device types) is one more than the homogeneous fault threshold; (2)
there is only one homogeneous fault (i.e., only one color could fail); and (3)
the number of non-homogeneous network device types is less than five.
