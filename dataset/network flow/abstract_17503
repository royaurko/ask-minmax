This paper deals with the well posedness of an integrodifferential equation
that describes a vortex filament associated to a 3D turbulent fluid flow. This
equation is driven by a fractional Brownian motion of Hurst parameter H>1/2. We
prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions in a functional space of
Sobolev type.
