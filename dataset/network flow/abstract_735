In this paper, we consider the consensus problem of dynamical multiple agents
that communicate via a directed moving neighborhood random network. Each agent
performs random walk on a weighted directed network. Agents interact with each
other through random unidirectional information flow when they coincide in the
underlying network at a given instant. For such a framework, we present
sufficient conditions for almost sure asymptotic consensus. Some existed
consensus schemes are shown to be reduced versions of the current model.
