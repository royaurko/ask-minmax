We introduce a growing network evolution model with nodal attributes. The
model describes the interactions between potentially violent V and non-violent
N agents who have different affinities in establishing connections within their
own population versus between the populations. The model is able to generate
all stable triads observed in real social systems. In the framework of rate
equations theory, we employ the mean-field approximation to derive analytical
expressions of the degree distribution and the local clustering coefficient for
each type of nodes. Analytical derivations agree well with numerical simulation
results. The assortativity of the potentially violent network qualitatively
resembles the connectivity pattern in terrorist networks that was recently
reported. The assortativity of the network driven by aggression shows clearly
different behavior than the assortativity of the networks with connections of
non-aggressive nature in agreement with recent empirical results of an online
social system.
