The distribution of Abell-ACO clusters of galaxies shows that clusters
located in rich superclusters form a quasiregular network with step size 120
Mpc. The power spectrum of clusters of galaxies has a sharp peak at a
wavelength equal to the step size of the network, the correlation function of
clusters is oscillating with this period. We show that spectra with a spike are
in agreement with temperature anisotropies measured by the Saskatoon
experiment. The corresponding initial power spectrum of matter has a peak
followed by a break.
