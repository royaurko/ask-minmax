We study the spectral properties of the process of explosive percolation. In
particular, we explore how the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a
network which governs the spreading efficiency evolves as the density of
connection increases. Interestingly, for networks with connectivity that grow
in an explosive way, information spreading and mass transport are found to be
carried out inefficiently. In the conventional explosive percolation models
that we studied, the sudden emergences of large-scale connectivity are found to
come with relatively lowered efficiency of spreading. Nevertheless, the
spreading efficiency of the explosive model can be increased by introducing
heterogeneous structures into the networks.
