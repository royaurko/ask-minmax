Real-world attacks can be interpreted as the result of competitive
interactions between networks, ranging from predator-prey networks to networks
of countries under economic sanctions. Although the purpose of an attack is to
damage a target network, it also curtails the ability of the attacker, which
must choose the duration and magnitude of an attack to avoid negative impacts
on its own functioning. Nevertheless, despite the large number of studies on
interconnected networks, the consequences of initiating an attack have never
been studied. Here, we address this issue by introducing a model of network
competition where a resilient network is willing to partially weaken its own
resilience in order to more severely damage a less resilient competitor. The
attacking network can take over the competitor nodes after their long
inactivity. However, due to a feedback mechanism the takeovers weaken the
resilience of the attacking network. We define a conservation law that relates
the feedback mechanism to the resilience dynamics for two competing networks.
Within this formalism, we determine the cost and optimal duration of an attack,
allowing a network to evaluate the risk of initiating hostilities.
