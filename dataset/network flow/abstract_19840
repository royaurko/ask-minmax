We present high angular and spectral resolution HI 21~cm line observations
toward the cometary-shaped compact HII region G213.880-11.837 in the GGD~14
complex.The kinematics and morphology of the photodissociated region, traced by
the HI line emission, reveal that the neutral gas is part of an expanding flow.
The kinematics of the HI gas along the major axis of G213.880-11.837 shows that
the emission is very extended toward the SE direction, reaching LSR radial
velocities in the tail of about 14 km/s. The ambient LSR radial velocity of the
molecular gas is 11.5 km/s, which suggests a champagne flow of the HI gas. This
is the second (after G111.61+0.37) cometary HII/HI region known.
