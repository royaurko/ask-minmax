A spatial scale-free network is introduced and studied whose motivation has
been originated in the growing Internet as well as the Airport networks. We
argue that in these real-world networks a new node necessarily selects one of
its neighbouring local nodes for connection and is not controlled by the
preferential attachment as in the Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) model. This
observation has been mimicked in our model where the nodes pop-up at randomly
located positions in the Euclidean space and are connected to one end of the
nearest link. In spite of this crucial difference it is observed that the
leading behaviour of our network is like the BA model. Defining link weight as
an algebraic power of its Euclidean length, the weight distribution and the
non-linear dependence of the nodal strength on the degree are analytically
calculated. It is claimed that a power law decay of the link weights with time
ensures such a non-linear behavior. Switching off the Euclidean space from the
same model yields a much simpler definition of the Barab\'asi-Albert model
where numerical effort grows linearly with $N$.
