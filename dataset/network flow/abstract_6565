This article presents a spiking neuroevolutionary system which implements
memristors as plastic connections, i.e. whose weights can vary during a trial.
The evolutionary design process exploits parameter self-adaptation and variable
topologies, allowing the number of neurons, connection weights, and
inter-neural connectivity pattern to emerge. By comparing two phenomenological
real-world memristor implementations with networks comprised of (i) linear
resistors (ii) constant-valued connections, we demonstrate that this approach
allows the evolution of networks of appropriate complexity to emerge whilst
exploiting the memristive properties of the connections to reduce learning
time. We extend this approach to allow for heterogeneous mixtures of memristors
within the networks; our approach provides an in-depth analysis of network
structure. Our networks are evaluated on simulated robotic navigation tasks;
results demonstrate that memristive plasticity enables higher performance than
constant-weighted connections in both static and dynamic reward scenarios, and
that mixtures of memristive elements provide performance advantages when
compared to homogeneous memristive networks.
