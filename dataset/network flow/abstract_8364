In this paper, we study empirically co-contributorship networks of neighbouring
scientific disciplines, and describe the system by two coupled networks. By
considering a large time window, we focus on the properties of the interface
between the disciplines. We also focus on the time evolution of the
co-contributorship network, and highlight a rich phenomenology including first order
transition and cluster bouncing and merging. Finally, we present a ferro-
electric-like model (CDIM), involving bond redistribution between the nodes,
that reproduces qualitatively the structuring of the system in homogeneous
phases
