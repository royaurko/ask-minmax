We consider the problem of distributed admission control without knowledge of
the capacity region in single-hop wireless networks, for flows that require a
pre-specified bandwidth from the network. We present an optimization framework
that allows us to design a scheduler and resource allocator, and by properly
choosing a suitable utility function in the resource allocator, we prove that
existing flows can be served with a pre-specified bandwidth, while the link
requesting admission can determine the largest rate that it can get such that
it does not interfere with the allocation to the existing flows.
