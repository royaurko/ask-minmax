Next Generation Network (NGN) provides multimedia services over broadband
based networks, which supports high definition TV (HDTV), and DVD quality
video-on-demand content. The video services are thus seen as merging mainly
three areas such as computing, communication, and broadcasting. It has numerous
advantages and more exploration for the large-scale deployment of
video-on-demand system is still needed. This is due to its economic and design
constraints. It's need significant initial investments for full service
provision. This paper presents different estimation for the different
topologies and it require efficient planning for a VOD system network. The
methodology investigates the network bandwidth requirements of a VOD system
based on centralized servers, and distributed local proxies. Network traffic
models are developed to evaluate the VOD system's operational bandwidth
requirements for these two network architectures. This paper present an
efficient estimation of the of the bandwidth requirement for the different
architectures.
