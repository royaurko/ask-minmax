In the context of Twitter, social capitalists are specific users trying to
increase their number of followers and interactions by any means. These users
are not healthy for the service, because they are either spammers or real users
flawing the notions of influence and visibility. Studying their behavior and
understanding their position in Twit-ter is thus of important interest. It is
also necessary to analyze how these methods effectively affect user visibility.
Based on a recently proposed method allowing to identify social capitalists, we
tackle both points by studying how they are organized, and how their links
spread across the Twitter follower-followee network. To that aim, we consider
their position in the network w.r.t. its community structure. We use the
concept of community role of a node, which describes its position in a network
depending on its connectiv-ity at the community level. However, the topological
measures originally defined to characterize these roles consider only certain
aspects of the community-related connectivity, and rely on a set of empirically
fixed thresholds. We first show the limitations of these measures, before
extending and generalizing them. Moreover, we use an unsupervised approach to
identify the roles, in order to provide more flexibility relatively to the
studied system. We then apply our method to the case of social capitalists and
show they are highly visible on Twitter, due to the specific roles they hold.
