While there has been a large interest in studying the role of
dissolution-driven free convection in the context of geological sequestration,
the contribution of forced convection has been largely ignored. This manuscript
considers CO$_2$ sequestration in saline aquifers with natural background flow
and uses theoretical arguments to compute the critical background velocity
needed to establish the forced convective regime. The theoretical arguments are
supported by two dimensional high-resolution numerical simulations which
demonstrate the importance of forced convection in enhancing dissolution in
aquifers characterised by low Rayleigh numbers.
