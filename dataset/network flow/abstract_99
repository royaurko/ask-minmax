We study the strong maximum principle for the heat equation associated with
the Dirichlet form on countable networks. We start by analyzing the boundedness
properties of the incidence operators on a countable network. Subsequently, we
prove that the strong maximum principle is equivalent to the underlying graph
being connected after deletion of the nodes with infinite degree. Using this
result, we prove that the number of connected components of the graph with
respect to the heat flow equals the number of maximal invariant ideals of the
adjacency matrix.
