We use the Enron email corpus to study relationships in a network by applying
six different measures of centrality. Our results came out of an in-semester
undergraduate research seminar. The Enron corpus is well suited to statistical
analyses at all levels of undergraduate education. Through this note's focus on
centrality, students can explore the dependence of statistical models on
initial assumptions and the interplay between centrality measures and
hierarchical ranking, and they can use completed studies as springboards for
future research. The Enron corpus also presents opportunities for research into
many other areas of analysis, including social networks, clustering, and
natural language processing.
