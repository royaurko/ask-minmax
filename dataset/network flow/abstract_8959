Selfish routing on dynamic flows over time is used to model scenarios that
vary with time in which individual agents act in their best interest. In this
paper we provide a survey of a particular dynamic model, the deterministic
queuing model, and discuss how the model can be adjusted and applied to
different real-life scenarios. We then examine how these adjustments affect the
computability, optimality, and existence of selfish routings.
