The Stochastic Block Model (Holland et al., 1983) is a mixture model for
heterogeneous network data. Unlike the usual statistical framework, new nodes
give additional information about the previous ones in this model. Thereby the
distribution of the degrees concentrates in points conditionally on the node
class. We show under a mild assumption that classification, estimation and
model selection can actually be achieved with no more than the empirical degree
data. We provide an algorithm able to process very large networks and
consistent estimators based on it. In particular, we prove a bound of the
probability of misclassification of at least one node, including when the
number of classes grows.
