Old and recent theoretical works by Andrzej Pekalski (APE) are recalled as
possible sources of interest for describing network formation and clustering in
complex (scientific) communities, through self-organisation and percolation
processes. Emphasis is placed on APE self-citation network over four decades.
The method is that used for detecting scientists field mobility by focusing on
contributor's self-citation, co-contributorships and article topics networks as in [1,2].
It is shown that APE's self-citation patterns reveal important information on
APE interest for research topics over time as well as APE engagement on
different scientific topics and in different networks of collaboration. Its
interesting complexity results from "degrees of freedom" and external fields
leading to so called internal shock resistance. It is found that APE network of
scientific interests belongs to independent clusters and occurs through rare or
drastic events as in irreversible "preferential attachment processes", similar
to those found in usual mechanics and thermodynamics phase transitions.
