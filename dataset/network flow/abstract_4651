The renormalization group flow recently found by Br\'ezin and Zinn- Justin by
integrating out redundant entries of the $(N+1)\times (N+1)$ hermitian random
matrix is studied. By introducing explicitly the RG flow parameter, and adding
suitable counter terms to the matrix potential of the one matrix model, we
deduce some interesting properties of the RG trajectories. In particular, the
string equation for the general massive model interpolating between the UV and
IR fixed points turns out to be a consequence of RG flow. An ambiguity in the
UV regime of the RG trajectory is remarked to be related to the large order
behavior of the one matrix model.
