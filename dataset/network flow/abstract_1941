With the tremendous amount of computing because of the wide usage of internet
it is observed that some user(s) are not able to manage their desktop with
antivirus software properly installed. It is happening few times, that we allow
our friends, students and colleagues to sit on our networked PC. Sometimes the
user is unaware of the situation that there workstations are unsecured and so
some one else could also be monitoring your flow of information and your most
important data could go haywire, resulting into leakage of most confidential
data to unwanted or malicious user(s). Example of some such documents could be
question papers designed by the faculty member by various universities. Now a
day most of the universities are having the biggest threat about the question
papers and many other confidential documents designed by their faculty members.
We in this paper present the solution to over come such a situation using the
concept of Steganography. Steganography is a technique through which one can
hide information into some cover object. This technique, if used, in positive
direction could be of great help to solve such a problem and even other.
