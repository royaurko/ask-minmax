The 2nd law of thermodynamics is used to shed light on present-day puzzles in
cosmology. The universal law, given as an equation of motion, describes diverse
systems when consuming free energy via various mechanisms to attain stationary
states in their respective surroundings. Expansion of the Universe, galactic
rotation and lensing as well as clustering of red-shifted spectral lines are
found as natural consequences of the maximal energy dispersal that satisfies
the conservation of energy, in the forms of kinetic, potential and dissipation.
The Universe in its entirety is pictured as a giant Riemann resonator in
evolution via step-by-step spontaneous breaking of one stationary-state
symmetry to another to diminish energy density differences relative to its
zero-density "surroundings". The continuum equation of evolution is proven
equivalent to the Navier-Stokes equation. The ubiquitous flow equation has no
solution because the forces and flows are inseparable when the dissipative
process has three or more degrees of freedom. Since an evolving system is
without a norm, there is no unitary transformation to solve the characteristic
equation, but detailed trajectories remain inherently intractable. Conversely,
stationary-state trajectories can be solved.
