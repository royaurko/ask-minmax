The Lee-Yang zeroes method is applied to study elliptic flow ($v_2$) in Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200A$~GeV, with the UrQMD model. In this transport
approach, the true event plane is known and both the nonflow effects and
event-by-event $v_2$ fluctuations exist. Although the low resolutions prohibit
the application of the method for most central and peripheral collisions, the
integral and differential elliptic flow from the Lee-Yang zeroes method agrees
with the exact $v_2$ values very well for semi-central collisions.
