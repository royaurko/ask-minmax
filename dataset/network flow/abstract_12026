The Sznajd model of socio-physics, that only a group of people sharing the
same opinion can convince their neighbors, is applied to a scale-free random
network modeled by a deterministic graph. We also study a model for elections
based on the Sznajd model and the exponent obtained for the distribution of
votes during the transient agrees with those obtained for real elections in
Brazil and India. Our results are compared to those obtained using a
Barabasi-Albert scale-free network.
