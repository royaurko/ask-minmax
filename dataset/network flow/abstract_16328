Solving exactly Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs) using a
Branch-and-Bound (B&B) algorithm requires a huge amount of computational
resources. Therefore, we recently investigated designing B&B algorithms on top
of graphics processing units (GPUs) using a parallel bounding model. The
proposed model assumes parallelizing the evaluation of the lower bounds on
pools of sub-problems. The results demonstrated that the size of the evaluated
pool has a significant impact on the performance of B&B and that it depends
strongly on the problem instance being solved. In this paper, we design an
adaptative parallel B&B algorithm for solving permutation-based combinatorial
optimization problems such as FSP (Flow-shop Scheduling Problem) on GPU
accelerators. To do so, we propose a dynamic heuristic for parameter
auto-tuning at runtime. Another challenge of this work is to exploit larger
degrees of parallelism by using the combined computational power of multiple
GPU devices. The approach has been applied to the permutation flow-shop
problem. Extensive experiments have been carried out on well-known FSP
benchmarks using an Nvidia Tesla S1070 Computing System equipped with two Tesla
T10 GPUs. Compared to a CPU-based execution, accelerations up to 105 are
achieved for large problem instances.
