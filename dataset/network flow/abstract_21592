We propose a hybrid model, coupling Lattice Boltzmann and Molecular Dynamics
models, for the simulation of dense fluids. Time and length scales are
decoupled by using an iterative Schwarz domain decomposition algorithm. The MD
and LB formulations communicate via the exchange of velocities and velocity
gradients at the interface. We validate the present LB-MD model in simulations
of flows of liquid argon past and through a carbon nanotube. Comparisons with
existing hybrid algorithms and with reference MD solutions demonstrate the
validity of the present approach.
