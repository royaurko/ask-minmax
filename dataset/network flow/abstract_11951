This paper investigates the virtualization and optimization of a multi-cell
WLAN. We consider the station (STA)-access point (AP) association and airtime
control for virtualized 802.11 networks to provide service customization and
fairness across multiple internet service providers (ISPs) sharing the common
physical infrastructure and network capacity. More specifically, an
optimization problem is formulated on the STAs transmission probabilities to
maximize the overall network throughput, while providing airtime usage
guarantees for the ISPs. Subsequently, an algorithm to reach the optimal
solution is developed by applying monomial approximation and geometric
programming iteratively. Based on the proposed three-dimensional Markov-chain
model of the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) protocol, the detailed
implementation of the optimal transmission probability is also discussed. The
accuracy of the proposed Markov-chain model and the performance of the
developed association and airtime control scheme are evaluated through
numerical results.
