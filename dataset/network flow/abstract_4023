We show that an observable fraction of the measured elliptic flow may
originate in classical gluon fields at the initial stage of a peripheral
high-energy nuclear collision. This mechanism complements the contribution of
late stage mechanisms, such as those described by hydrodynamics, to the
observed elliptic flow.
