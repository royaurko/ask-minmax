We demonstrate that fluid flow cloaking solutions based on active
hydrodynamic metamaterials exist for two-dimensional flows past a cylinder in a
wide range of Reynolds numbers, up to approximately 200. Within the framework
of the classical Brinkman equation for homogenized porous flow, we demonstrate
using two different methods that such cloaked flows can be dynamically stable
for $Re$ in the range 5-119. The first, highly efficient, method is based on a
linearization of the Brinkman-Navier-Stokes equation and finding the
eigenfrequencies of the least stable eigen-perturbations; the second method is
a direct, numerical integration in the time domain. We show that, by
suppressing the Karman vortex street in the weekly turbulent wake, porous flow
cloaks can raise the critical Reynolds number up to about 120, or five times
greater than for a bare, uncloaked cylinder.
