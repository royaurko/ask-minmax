Nowadays, social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn become
increasingly popular. In fact, they introduced new habits, new ways of
communication and they collect every day several information that have
different sources. Most existing research works fo-cus on the analysis of
homogeneous social networks, i.e. we have a single type of node and link in the
network. However, in the real world, social networks offer several types of
nodes and links. Hence, with a view to preserve as much information as
possible, it is important to consider so-cial networks as heterogeneous and
uncertain. The goal of our paper is to classify the social message based on its
spreading in the network and the theory of belief functions. The proposed
classifier interprets the spread of messages on the network, crossed paths and
types of links. We tested our classifier on a real word network that we
collected from Twitter, and our experiments show the performance of our belief
classifier.
