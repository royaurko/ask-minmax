We study the effects of jet quenching on the hydrodynamical evolution of the
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) fluid created in a heavy-ion collision. In jet
quenching, a hard QCD parton, before fragmenting into a jet of hadrons,
deposits a fraction of its energy in the medium, leading to suppressed
production of high-pT hadrons. Assuming that the deposited energy quickly
thermalizes, we simulate the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP
fluid. For partons moving at supersonic speed, v_p > c_s, and sufficiently
large energy loss, a shock wave forms leading to conical flow [1]. The PHENIX
Collaboration recently suggested that observed structures in the azimuthal
angle distribution [2] might be caused by conical flow. We show here that
conical flow produces different angular structures than predicted in [1] and
that, for phenomenologically acceptable values of parton energy loss, conical
flow effects are too weak to explain the structures seen by PHENIX [2].
