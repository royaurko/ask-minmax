Many real networks are complex and have power-law vertex degree distribution,
short diameter, and high clustering. We analyze the network model based on
thresholding of the summed vertex weights, which belongs to the class of
networks proposed by Caldarelli et al. (2002). Power-law degree distributions,
particularly with the dynamically stable scaling exponent 2, realistic
clustering, and short path lengths are produced for many types of weight
distributions. Thresholding mechanisms can underlie a family of real complex
networks that is characterized by cooperativeness and the baseline scaling
exponent 2. It contrasts with the class of growth models with preferential
attachment, which is marked by competitiveness and baseline scaling exponent 3.
