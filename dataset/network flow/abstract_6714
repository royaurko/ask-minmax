In many network topologies, hosts have multiple IP addresses, and may choose
among multiple network paths by selecting the source and destination addresses
of the packets that they send. This can happen with multihomed hosts (hosts
connected to multiple networks), or in multihomed networks using
source-specific routing. A number of efforts have been made to dynamically
choose between multiple addresses in order to improve the reliability or the
performance of network applications, at the network layer, as in Shim6, or at
the transport layer, as in MPTCP. In this paper, we describe our experience of
implementing dynamic address selection at the application layer within the
Mobile Shell. While our work is specific to Mosh, we hope that it is generic
enough to serve as a basis for designing UDP-based multipath applications or
even more general APIs.
