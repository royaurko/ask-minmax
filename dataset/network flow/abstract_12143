This letter introduces a 3D space-time-space block code for future digital TV
systems. The code is based on a double layer structure for inter-cell and
intra-cell transmission mode in single frequency networks. Without increasing
the complexity of the receiver, the proposed code is very efficient for
different transmission scenarios.
