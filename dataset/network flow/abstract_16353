In this study, a new type of thin, compact, and light weighed diaphragm
micro-pump has been successfully developed to actuate the liquid by the
vibration of a diaphragm. The micro-diaphragm pump with two valves is
fabricated in an aluminum case by using highly accurate CNC machine, and the
cross-section dimension is 5mm x 8mm. Both valves and diaphragm are
manufactured from PDMS. The amplitude of vibration by a piezoelectric device
produces an oscillating flow which may change the chamber volume by changing
the curvature of a diaphragm. Several experimental set-ups for performance test
in a single micro-diaphragm pump, isothermal flow open system, and a closed
liquid cooling system is designed and implemented. The performance of one-side
actuating micro-diaphragm pump is affected by the design of check valves,
diaphragm, piezoelectric device, chamber volume, input voltage and frequency.
The measured maximum flow rate of present design is 72 ml/min at zero total
pump head in the range of operation frequency 70-180 Hz.
