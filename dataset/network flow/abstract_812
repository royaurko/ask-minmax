We consider the problem of maximizing the synchronizability of oscillator
networks by assigning weights and directions to the links of a given
interaction topology. We first extend the well-known master stability formalism
to the case of non-diagonalizable networks. We then show that, unless some
oscillator is connected to all the others, networks of maximum
synchronizability are necessarily non-diagonalizable and can always be obtained
by imposing unidirectional information flow with normalized input strengths.
The extension makes the formalism applicable to all possible network
structures, while the maximization results provide insights into hierarchical
structures observed in complex networks in which synchronization plays a
significant role.
