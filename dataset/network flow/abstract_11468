Parametric resampling schemes have been recently introduced in complex
network analysis with the aim of assessing the statistical significance of
graph clustering and the robustness of community partitions. We propose here a
method to replicate structural features of complex networks based on the
non-parametric resampling of the transition matrix associated with an unbiased
random walk on the graph. We test this bootstrapping technique on synthetic and
real-world modular networks and we show that the ensemble of replicates
obtained through resampling can be used to improve the performance of standard
spectral algorithms for community detection.
