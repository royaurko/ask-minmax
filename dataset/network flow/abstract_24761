Identifying highly susceptible individuals in spreading processes is of great
significance in controlling outbreaks. In this paper, we explore the
susceptibility of people in susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) and rumor
spreading dynamics. We first study the impact of community structure on
people's susceptibility. Despite that the community structure can reduce the
infected population given same infection rates, it will not deterministically
affect nodes' susceptibility. We find the susceptibility of individuals is
sensitive to the choice of spreading dynamics. For SIR spreading, since the
susceptibility is highly correlated to nodes' influence, the topological
indicator k-shell can better identify highly susceptible individuals,
outperforming degree, betweenness centrality and PageRank. In contrast, in
rumor spreading model, where nodes' susceptibility and influence have no clear
correlation, degree performs the best among considered topological measures.
Our finding highlights the significance of both topological features and
spreading mechanisms in identifying highly susceptible population.
