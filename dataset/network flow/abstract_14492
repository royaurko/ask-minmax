We address the flutter instability of a flexible plate immersed in an axial
flow. This instability is similar to flag flutter and results from the
competition between destabilising pressure forces and stabilising bending
stiffness. In previous experimental studies, the plates have always appeared
much more stable than the predictions of two-dimensional models. This
discrepancy is discussed and clarified in this paper by examining
experimentally and theoretically the effect of the plate aspect ratio on the
instability threshold. We show that the two-dimensional limit cannot be
achieved experimentally because hysteretical behaviour and three-dimensional
effects appear for plates of large aspect ratio. The nature of the instability
bifurcation (sub- or supercritical) is also discussed in the light of recent
numerical results.
