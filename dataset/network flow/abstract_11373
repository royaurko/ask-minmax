In order to conduct analyses of networked systems where connections between
individuals take on a range of values - counts, continuous strengths or ordinal
rankings - a common technique is to dichotomize the data according to their
positions with respect to a threshold value. However, there are two issues to
consider: how the results of the analysis depend on the choice of threshold,
and what role the presence of noise has on a system with respect to a fixed
threshold value. We show that while there are principled criteria of keeping
information from the valued graph in the dichotomized version, they produce
such a wide range of binary graphs that only a fraction of the relevant
information will be kept. Additionally, while dichotomization of predictors in
linear models has a known asymptotic efficiency loss, the same process applied
to network edges in a time series model will lead to an efficiency loss that
grows larger as the network increases in size.
