The phase separation of two-dimensional binary mixtures has been studied
through numerical Langevin simulations based on a Ginzburg-Landau free energy.
We have considered not symmetric mixtures with and without imposed shear flow.
In the sheared case our main results are as follows: (1) domains are distorted
by the flow; (2) the structure factor has four peaks; (3) excess viscosity
shows a peak whose position is independent of shear rate but its height
decreases increasing shear rate.
