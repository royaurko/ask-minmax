This letter addresses the problem of modeling the highway systems of
different countries by using complex networks formalism. More specifically, we
compare two traditional geographical models with a modified geometrical network
model where paths, rather than edges, are incorporated at each step between the
origin and destination nodes. Optimal configurations of parameters are obtained
for each model and used in the comparison. The highway networks of Brazil, the
US and England are considered and shown to be properly modeled by the modified
geographical model. The Brazilian highway network yielded small deviations that
are potentially accountable by specific developing and sociogeographic features
of that country.
