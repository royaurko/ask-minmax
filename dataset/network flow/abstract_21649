We introduce the Transchemistry Model as a dynamical extension of the
Algebraic Coalescence Rehadronization (ALCOR) model in describing the
hadronization of quark matter which is expected to be produced in relativistic
heavy ion collisions. Results are presented for CERN SPS NA49 Pb+Pb experiment
calculating hadron multiplicities and momentum spectra. The freeze-out
properties of different hadrons are characterized by similar temperature,
density and flow profiles in cylindrically symmetric geometry.
