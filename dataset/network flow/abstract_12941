We study theoretically the viscoelastic properties of sheared binary fluids
that have strong dynamical asymmetry between the two components. The dynamical
asymmetry arises due to asymmetry between the viscoelastic stresses,
particularly the bulk stress. Our calculations are based on the two-fluid model
that incorporates the asymmetric stress distribution. We simulate the phase
separation process under an externally imposed shear and compare the asymmetric
case with the usual phase separation under a shear flow without viscoelastic
effects. We also simulate the behavior of phase separated stable morphologies
under applied shear and compute the stress relaxation.
