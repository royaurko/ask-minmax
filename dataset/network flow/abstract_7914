The measurement of anisotropic flow of identified particles, including
charged pion, kaon, (anti-)proton as well as strange and multi-strange
particles (${\rm K_{S}^{0}}$, ${\rm \Lambda}$, ${\rm \Xi}$ and ${\rm \Omega}$)
are measured in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{{\rm NN}}}}$ = 2.76 TeV with
the ALICE detector. The results are compared to measurements at RHIC and
hydrodynamic model calculations. The mass splitting and the scaling with the
number of constituent quarks of the anisotropic flow are also discussed.
