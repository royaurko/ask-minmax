The last few years have seen remarkably fast progress in the understanding of
statistics and epidemic dynamics of various clustered networks. This paper
considers a class of networks based around a concept (the locale) that allows
asymptotically exact results to be derived for epidemic dynamics. While there
is no restriction on the motifs that can be found in such graphs, each node
must be uniquely assigned to a generally clustered subgraph to obtain analytic
traction.
