We consider the role of network geometry in two types of diffusion processes:
transport of constant-density information packets with queuing on nodes, and
constant voltage-driven tunneling of electrons. The underlying network is a
homogeneous graph with scale-free distribution of loops, which is constrained
to a planar geometry and fixed node connectivity $k=3$. We determine properties
of noise, flow and return-times statistics for both processes on this graph and
relate the observed differences to the microscopic process details. Our main
findings are: (i) Through the local interaction between packets queuing at the
same node, long-range correlations build up in traffic streams, which are
practically absent in the case of electron transport; (ii) Noise fluctuations
in the number of packets and in the number of tunnelings recorded at each node
appear to obey the scaling laws in two distinct universality classes; (iii) The
topological inhomogeneity of betweenness plays the key role in the occurrence
of broad distributions of return times and in the dynamic flow. The
maximum-flow spanning trees are characteristic for each process type.
