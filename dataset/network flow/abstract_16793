We present the first experimental demonstration of focusing ultrasound waves
through a flat acoustic metamaterial lens composed of a planar network of
subwavelength Helmholtz resonators. We observed a tight focus of
half-wavelength in width at 60.5 KHz by imaging a point source. This result is
in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation by transmission line model
in which we derived the effective mass density and compressibility. This
metamaterial lens also displays variable focal length at different frequencies.
Our experiment shows the promise of designing compact and light-weight
ultrasound imaging elements.
