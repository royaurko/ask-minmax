The behavior of a two dimensional, steady turbulent mixing layer was
investigated. Besides the usual velocity components, all the contributing
components of the Reynolds Stresses are also calculated and presented. The
results indicated that in the two dimensional steady turbulent mixing layers
the theory of self-preservation is not valid for all the flow domain, and that
the flow is turbulent regime is divided into two areas. Through calculation of
Reynolds Stress components at the point of initiation of the flow, it was shown
that the turbulent flow in the area containing the point of singularity of the
flow is not, as previously believed, self-preserved.
