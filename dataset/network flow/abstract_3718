We present an experimental study of the statistical properties of millimetric
spheres floating on the surface of a turbulent flow. The flow is generated in a
layer of liquid metal by an electromagnetic forcing. \textcolor{red}{By using
two magnet arrays,} we are able to create one highly fluctuating flow and one
almost stationary flow. In both cases, we follow the motion of hundreds of
millimeter-size particles floating at the deformed interface of the liquid
metal. We evidence the clustering of floaters by a statistical study of the
local density of particles. Some dynamical properties of clusters are exposed.
With the almost stationary flow obtained with the random array of magnets, we
are able to relate the cluster formation to compression effects. Hence,
although floaters are not passive scalar and move on a disturbed interface, we
propose that the main clustering effect is the same as the one reported for
passive scalar on an almost flat surface of a turbulent flow.
