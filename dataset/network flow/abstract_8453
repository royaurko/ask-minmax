In this paper, we propose LMEEC, a cluster-based routing protocol with low
energy consumption for wireless sensor networks. Our protocol is based on a
strategy which aims to provide a more reasonable exploitation of the selected
nodes (cluster-heads) energy. Simulation results show the effectiveness of
LMEEC in decreasing the energy consumption, and in prolonging the network
lifetime, compared to LEACH.
