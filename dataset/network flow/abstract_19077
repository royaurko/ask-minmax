This paper introduces a traffic engineering routing algorithm that aims to
accept as many routing demands as possible on the condition that a certain
amount of bandwidth resource is reserved for each accepted demand. The novel
idea is to select routes based on not only network states but also information
derived from routing data such as probabilities of the ingress egress pairs and
usage frequencies of the links. Experiments with respect to acceptance ratio
and computation time have been conducted against various test sets. Results
indicate that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the existing
popular algorithms including Minimum Interference Routing Algorithm (MIRA) and
Random Race based Algorithm for Traffic Engineering (RRATE).
