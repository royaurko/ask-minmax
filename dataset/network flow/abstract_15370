The human brain processes information showing learning and prediction
abilities but the underlying neuronal mechanisms still remain unknown.
Recently, many studies prove that neuronal networks are able of both
generalizations and associations of sensory inputs. In this paper, following a
set of neurophysiological evidences, we propose a learning framework with a
strong biological plausibility that mimics prominent functions of cortical
circuitries. We developed the Inductive Conceptual Network (ICN), that is a
hierarchical bio-inspired network, able to learn invariant patterns by
Variable-order Markov Models implemented in its nodes. The outputs of the
top-most node of ICN hierarchy, representing the highest input generalization,
allow for automatic classification of inputs. We found that the ICN clusterized
MNIST images with an error of 5.73% and USPS images with an error of 12.56%.
