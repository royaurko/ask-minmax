The self-similarity of complex networks is typically investigated through
computational algorithms the primary task of which is to cover the structure
with a minimal number of boxes. Here we introduce a box-covering algorithm that
not only outperforms previous ones, but also finds optimal solutions. For the
two benchmark cases tested, namely, the E. Coli and the WWW networks, our
results show that the improvement can be rather substantial, reaching up to 15%
in the case of the WWW network.
