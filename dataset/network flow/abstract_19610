If M is an atoroidal 3-manifold with a taut foliation, Thurston showed that
pi_1(M) acts on a circle. Here, we show that some other classes of essential
laminations also give rise to actions on circles. In particular, we show this
for tight essential laminations with solid torus guts. We also show that
pseudo-Anosov flows induce actions on circles. In all cases, these actions can
be made into faithful ones, so pi_1(M) is isomorphic to a subgroup of
Homeo(S^1). In addition, we show that the fundamental group of the Weeks
manifold has no faithful action on S^1. As a corollary, the Weeks manifold does
not admit a tight essential lamination, a pseudo-Anosov flow, or a taut
foliation. Finally, we give a proof of Thurston's universal circle theorem for
taut foliations based on a new, purely topological, proof of the Leaf Pocket
Theorem.
