We define several notions of singular set for Type I Ricci flows and show
that they all coincide. In order to do this, we prove that blow-ups around
singular points converge to nontrivial gradient shrinking solitons, thus
extending work of Naber. As a by-product we conclude that the volume of a
finite-volume singular set vanishes at the singular time. We also define a
notion of density for Type I Ricci flows and use it to prove a regularity
theorem reminiscent of White's partial regularity result for mean curvature
flow.
