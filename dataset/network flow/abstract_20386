Using multipoint observations we show, for the first time, that Foreshock
Bubbles (FBs) have a global impact on Earth's magnetosphere. We show that an
FB, a transient kinetic phenomenon due to the interaction of backstreaming
suprathermal ions with a discontinuity, modifies the total pressure upstream of
the bow shock showing a decrease within the FB's core and sheath regions.
Magnetosheath plasma is accelerated towards the the intersection of the FB's
current sheet with the bow shock resulting in fast, sunward, flows as well as
outward motion of the magnetopause. Ground-based magnetometers also show
signatures of this magnetopause motion simultaneously across at least 7 hours
of magnetic local time, corresponding to a distance of 21.5 RE transverse to
the Sun-Earth line along the magnetopause. These observed global impacts of the
FB are in agreement with previous simulations and in stark contrast to the
known localised, smaller scale effects of Hot Flow Anomalies (HFAs).
