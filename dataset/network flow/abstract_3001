The decay of a passive scalar in a three-dimensional chaotic flow is studied
using high-resolution numerical simulations. The (volume-preserving) flow
considered is a three-dimensional extension of the randomised alternating sine
flow employed extensively in studies of mixing in two dimensions. It is used to
show that theoretical predictions for two-dimensional flows with small
diffusivity carry over to three dimensions even though the stretching
properties differ significantly. The variance decay rate, scalar field
structure, and time evolution of statistical moments confirm that there are two
distinct regimes of scalar decay: a locally controlled regime, which applies
when the domain size is comparable to the characteristic lengthscale of the
velocity field, and a globally controlled regime, which when applies when the
domain is larger. Asymptotic predictions for the variance decay rate in both
regimes show excellent agreement with the numerical results. Consideration of
both the forward flow and its time reverse makes it possible to compare the
scalar evolution in flows with one or two expanding directions; simulations
confirm the theoretical prediction that the decay rate of the scalar is the
same in both flows, despite the very different scalar field structures.
