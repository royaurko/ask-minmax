Today, complex networks have attracted increasing attention from various
fields of science and engineering. It has been demonstrated that many complex
networks display various synchronization phenomena. In this paper, we introduce
a time-varying complex dynamical network model. We then further investigate its
synchronization phenomenon and prove several network synchronization theorems.
Especially, we show that synchronization of such a time-varying dynamical
network is completely determined by the inner-coupling matrix, and the
eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of the coupling configuration
matrix of the network.
