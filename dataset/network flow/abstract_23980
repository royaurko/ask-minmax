Self-stabilization is a general paradigm to provide forward recovery
capabilities to distributed systems and networks. Intuitively, a protocol is
self-stabilizing if it is able to recover without external intervention from
any catastrophic transient failure. In this paper, our focus is to lower the
communication complexity of self-stabilizing protocols \emph{below} the need of
checking every neighbor forever. In more details, the contribution of the paper
is threefold: (i) We provide new complexity measures for communication
efficiency of self-stabilizing protocols, especially in the stabilized phase or
when there are no faults, (ii) On the negative side, we show that for
non-trivial problems such as coloring, maximal matching, and maximal
independent set, it is impossible to get (deterministic or probabilistic)
self-stabilizing solutions where every participant communicates with less than
every neighbor in the stabilized phase, and (iii) On the positive side, we
present protocols for coloring, maximal matching, and maximal independent set
such that a fraction of the participants communicates with exactly one neighbor
in the stabilized phase.
