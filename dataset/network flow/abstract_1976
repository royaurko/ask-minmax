High availability is no longer just a business continuity concern. Users are
increasingly dependant on devices that consume and produce data in ever
increasing volumes. A popular solution is to have a central repository which
each device accesses after centrally managed authentication. This model of use
is facilitated by cloud based file synchronisation services such as Dropbox,
OneDrive, Google Drive and Apple iCloud. Cloud architecture allows the
provisioning of storage space with "always-on" access. Recent concerns over
uncontributorised access to third party systems and large scale exposure of private
data have made an alternative solution desirable. These events have caused
users to assess their own security practices and the level of trust placed in
third party storage services. One option is BitTorrent Sync, a cloudless
synchronisation utility provides data availability and redundancy. This utility
replicates files stored in shares to remote peers with access controlled by
keys and permissions. While lacking the economies brought about by scale,
complete control over data access has made this a popular solution. The ability
to replicate data without oversight introduces risk of abuse by users as well
as difficulties for forensic investigators. This paper suggests a methodology
for investigation and analysis of the protocol to assist in the control of data
flow across security perimeters.
