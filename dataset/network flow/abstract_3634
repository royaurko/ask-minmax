We discuss the effect of an homogeneous flow in the aggregation process of
colloidal magnetic particles at moderate concentration. Situations in which the
presence of flow acts in favor of the chaining process: particles assemble into
chains larger than the ones emerging in the absence of flow, under the only
influence of an externnaly imposed field, have been analyzed. The results we
obtain follow from the analysis of the pair correlation function which, owing
to the potencial character of the flow we consider, can be interpreted in terms
of a Boltzmann-like stationary distribution function. To render the influence
of the flow on the resulting structures explicit, we study the particular cases
of axisymmetric and planar elongational flows.
