We present a new cellular automata model of vehicular traffic in cities by
combining ideas borrowed from the Biham-Middleton-Levine (BML) model of city
traffic and the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model of highway traffic. The model
exhibits a dynamical phase transition to a completely jammed phase at a
critical density which depends on the time periods of the synchronized signals.
