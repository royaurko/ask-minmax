We use renormalization group methods to derive equations of motion for large
scale variables in fluid dynamics. The large scale variables are averages of
the underlying continuum variables over cubic volumes, and naturally live on a
lattice. The resulting lattice dynamics represents a perfect discretization of
continuum physics, i.e. grid artifacts are completely eliminated. Perfect
equations of motion are derived for static, slow flows of incompressible,
viscous fluids. For Hagen-Poiseuille flow in a channel with square cross
section the equations reduce to a perfect discretization of the Poisson
equation for the velocity field with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The perfect
large scale Poisson equation is used in a numerical simulation, and is shown to
represent the continuum flow exactly. For non-square cross sections we use a
numerical iterative procedure to derive flow equations that are approximately
perfect.
