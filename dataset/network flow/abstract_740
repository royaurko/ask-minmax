We present five methods to the problem of network anomaly detection. These
methods cover most of the common techniques in the anomaly detection field,
including Statistical Hypothesis Tests (SHT), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and
clustering analysis. We evaluate all methods in a simulated network that
consists of nominal data, three flow-level anomalies and one packet-level
attack. Through analyzing the results, we point out the advantages and
disadvantages of each method and conclude that combining the results of the
individual methods can yield improved anomaly detection results.
