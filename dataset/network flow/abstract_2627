In contrast to mono-constrained flows with N degrees of freedom, binary
constrained flows of soliton equations, admitting 2x2 Lax matrices, have 2N
degrees of freedom. By means of the existing method, Lax matrices only yield
the first N pairs of canonical separated variables. An approach for
constructing the second N pairs of canonical separated variables with
additional N separated equations is introduced. The Jacobi inversion problems
for binary constrained flows are then established. Finally, the separability of
binary constrained flows together with the factorization of soliton equations
by the spatial and temporal binary constrained flows leads to the Jacobi
inversion problems for soliton equations.
