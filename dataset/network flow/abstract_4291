Complex networks as the World Wide Web, the web of human sexual contacts or
criminal networks often do not have an engineered architecture but instead are
self-organized by the actions of a large number of individuals. From these
local interactions non-trivial global phenomena can emerge as small-world
properties or scale-free degree distributions. A simple model for the evolution
of acquaintance networks highlights the essential dynamical ingredients
necessary to obtain such complex network structures. The model generates highly
clustered networks with small average path lengths and scale-free as well as
exponential degree distributions. It compares well with experimental data of
social networks, as for example cocontributorship networks in high energy physics.
