This paper studies the normalized Ricci flow from a slight perturbation of
the hyperbolic metric on $\mathbb H^n$. It's proved that if the perturbation is
small and decays sufficiently fast at the infinity, then the flow will converge
exponentially fast to the hyperbolic metric when the dimension $n>5$.
