The material accreting onto Sgr A* most probably comes from the nearby stars.
We analyze the pattern of this flow at distances of a fraction of a parsec and
we argue that the net angular momentum of this material is low but
non-negligible, and the initially supersonic disk accretion changes into
subsonic flow with constant angular momentum. Next we estimate the flow
parameters at a distance $R_{BHL}$ from the black hole and we argue that for
the plausible parameter range the accretion flow is non-stationary. The inflow
becomes supersonic at distance of $\sim 10^4 R_g$ but the solution does not
continue below the horizon and the material piles up forming a torus, or a
ring, at a distance of a few up to tens of Schwarzchild radii. Such a torus is
known to be unstable and may explain strong variability of the flow in Sgr A*.
Our considerations show that the temporary formation of such a torus seems to
be unavoidable.
 Our best fitting model predicts a rather large accretion rate of around $4
\cdot 10^{-6} M_{\odot}/yr$ directly on Sgr A*. We argue that magnetic fields
in the flow are tangled and this allows our model to overcome the disagreement
with the Faraday rotation limits.
