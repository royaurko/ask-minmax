It is demonstrated that the deformation of magnetic field lines in
incompressible magnetohydrodynamic flows results from a compressible mapping.
Appearance of zeroes for the mapping Jacobian correspond to the breaking of
magnetic field lines, associated with local blowup of the magnetic field. The
possibility of such events is found to be unlikely in two dimensions but not in
three dimensions.
