The spatiotemporal self-organization of viscoresistive magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) in a toroidal geometry is studied. Curl-free toroidal magnetic and
electric fields are imposed. It is observed in our simulations that a flow is
generated, which evolves from dominantly poloidal to toroidal when the
Lundquist numbers are increased. It is shown that this toroidal organization of
the flow is consistent with the tendency of the velocity field to align with
the magnetic field. Up-down asymmetry of the geometry causes the generation of
a non-zero toroidal angular momentum.
