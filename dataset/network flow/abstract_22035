We demonstrate that the addition of Dy capping layers in current
perpendicular to the plane giant magneto-resistive spin-valves can increase the
critical current density beyond which spin-torque induced instabilities are
observed by about a factor of three. Current densities as high as 5e7 A/cm2 are
measured provided that the electron current flows from the free to the
reference layer. While Dy capped samples exhibit nonmagnetic 1/f noise, it is
sufficiently small to be unimportant for read head operation at practical data
rates.
