In complex online social networks, it is crucial for a service consumer to
extract the trustworthiest way to a target service provider from numerous
social trust paths between them. The extraction of the trustworthiest way
(namely, optimal social trust path (OSTP)) with multiple end-to-end quality of
trust (QoT) constraints has been proved to be NP-Complete. Heuristic algorithms
with polynomial and pseudo-polynomial-time complexities are often used to deal
with this challenging problem. However, existing solutions cannot guarantee the
efficiency of searching, that is, they can hardly avoid obtaining partial
optimal solutions during searching process. Quantum annealing uses
delocalization and tunneling to avoid falling into local minima without
sacrifying execution time. It has been proved to be a promising way to many
optimization problems in recently published literatures. In this paper, for the
first time, QA based OSTP algorithms (QA_OSTP) is applied to the extraction of
the trustworthiest way. The experiment results show that QA based algorithms
have better performance than its heuristic opponents.
