We analyze the transport properties of a neutral tracer in a carrier fluid
flowing through percolation-like porous media with spatial correlations. We
model convection in the mass transport process using the velocity field
obtained by the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes and continuity
equations in the pore space. We show that the resulting statistical properties
of the tracer can be approximated by a Levy walk model, which is a consequence
of the broad distribution of velocities plus the existence of spatial
correlations in the porous medium.
