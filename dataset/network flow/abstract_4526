Recently, contagion-based (disease, information, etc.) spreading on social
networks has been extensively studied. In this paper, other than traditional
full interaction, we propose a partial interaction based spreading model,
considering that the informed individuals would transmit information to only a
certain fraction of their neighbors due to the transmission ability in
real-world social networks. Simulation results on three representative networks
(BA, ER, WS) indicate that the spreading efficiency is highly correlated with
the network heterogeneity. In addition, a special phenomenon, namely
\emph{Information Blind Areas} where the network is separated by several
information-unreachable clusters, will emerge from the spreading process.
Furthermore, we also find that the size distribution of such information blind
areas obeys power-law-like distribution, which has very similar exponent with
that of site percolation. Detailed analyses show that the critical value is
decreasing along with the network heterogeneity for the spreading process,
which is complete the contrary to that of random selection. Moreover, the
critical value in the latter process is also larger that of the former for the
same network. Those findings might shed some lights in in-depth understanding
the effect of network properties on information spreading.
