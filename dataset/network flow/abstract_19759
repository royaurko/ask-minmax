We analyze the stationary flow of a jet of Newtonian fluid that is drawn by
gravity onto a moving surface. The situation is modeled by a third-order ODE on
a domain of unknown length and with an additional integral condition; by
solving part of the equation explicitly we can reformulate the problem as a
first-order ODE, again with an integral constraint. We show that there are two
flow regimes, and characterize the associated regions in the three-dimensional
parameter space in terms of an easily calculable quantity. In a qualitative
sense the results from the model are found to correspond with experimental
observations.
