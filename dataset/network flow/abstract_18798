This paper presents a two-phase cooperative communication strategy and an
optimal power allocation strategy to transmit sensor observations to a fusion
center in a large-scale sensor network. Outage probability is used to evaluate
the performance of the proposed system. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1)
when signal-to-noise ratio is low, the performance of the proposed system is
better than that of the multiple-input and multiple-output system over
uncorrelated slow fading Rayleigh channels; 2) given the transmission rate and
the total transmission SNR, there exists an optimal power allocation that
minimizes the outage probability; 3) on correlated slow fading Rayleigh
channels, channel correlation will degrade the system performance in linear
proportion to the correlation level.
