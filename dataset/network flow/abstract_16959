Simulation is often used to evaluate the relevance of a Directing Program of
Production (PDP) or to evaluate its impact on detailed sc\'enarii of
scheduling. Within this framework, we propose to reduce the complexity of a
model of simulation by exploiting a multilayer perceptron. A main phase of the
modeling of one system using a multilayer perceptron remains the determination
of the structure of the network. We propose to compare and use various pruning
algorithms in order to determine the optimal structure of the network used to
reduce the complexity of the model of simulation of our case of application: a
sawmill.
