In this paper, a class of relay networks is considered. We assume that, at a
node, outgoing channels to its neighbors are orthogonal, while incoming signals
from neighbors can interfere with each other. We are interested in the
multicast capacity of these networks. As a subclass, we first focus on Gaussian
relay networks with interference and find an achievable rate using a lattice
coding scheme. It is shown that there is a constant gap between our achievable
rate and the information theoretic cut-set bound. This is similar to the recent
result by Avestimehr, Diggavi, and Tse, who showed such an approximate
characterization of the capacity of general Gaussian relay networks. However,
our achievability uses a structured code instead of a random one. Using the
same idea used in the Gaussian case, we also consider linear finite-field
symmetric networks with interference and characterize the capacity using a
linear coding scheme.
