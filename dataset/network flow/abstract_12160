This volume contains the papers presented at the 1st International Workshop
on "Decentralized Coordination of Distributed Processes", DCDP 2010, held in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands on June 10th, 2010 in conjunction with the 5th
International Federated Conferences on Distributed Computing Techniques,
DisCoTec 2010. The central theme of the workshop is the decentralized
coordination of distributed processes. Decentralized: there is no single
contributority in the network that everything is vulnerable to. Coordinated:
processes need to cooperate to achieve meaningful results, potentially in the
face of mutual suspicion. Distributed: processes are separated by a potentially
unreliable network.
