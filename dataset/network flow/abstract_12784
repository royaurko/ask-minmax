Sufficient conditions of consensus in networks described by digraphs and
consisting of identical SIMO systems are derived. It is assumed that each
system is passifiable. Cases of identical and nonidentical control gains are
considered. Scalability for circle digraph in terms of gain magnitudes is
studied.
