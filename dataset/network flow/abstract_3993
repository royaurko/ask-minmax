Complex network theory has been applied to solving practical problems from
different domains. In this paper, we present a general framework for complex
network applications. The keys of a successful application are a thorough
understanding of the real system and a correct mapping of complex network
theory to practical problems in the system. Despite of certain limitations
discussed in this paper, complex network theory provides a foundation on which
to develop powerful tools in analyzing and optimizing large interconnected
systems.
