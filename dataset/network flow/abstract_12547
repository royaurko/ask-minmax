The problem of transmitting confidential messages in $M \times K$ wireless X
networks is considered, in which each transmitter intends to send one
confidential message to every receiver. In particular, the secure degrees of
freedom (SDOF) of the considered network are studied based on an artificial
noise alignment (ANA) approach, which integrates interference alignment and
artificial noise transmission. At first, an SDOF upper bound is derived for the
$M \times K$ X network with confidential messages (XNCM) to be
$\frac{K(M-1)}{K+M-2}$. By proposing an ANA approach, it is shown that the SDOF
upper bound is tight when $K=2$ for the considered XNCM with time/frequency
varying channels. For $K \geq 3$, it is shown that SDOF of
$\frac{K(M-1)}{K+M-1}$ can be achieved, even when an external eavesdropper is
present. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to inject artificial noise into
the network, which can be aligned in the interference space at receivers for
confidentiality. Moreover, for the network with no channel state information at
transmitters, a blind ANA scheme is proposed to achieve SDOF of
$\frac{K(M-1)}{K+M-1}$ for $K,M \geq 2$, with reconfigurable antennas at
receivers. The proposed method provides a linear approach to secrecy coding and
interference alignment.
