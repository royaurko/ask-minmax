In imaging-based studies of flow around solid objects, it is useful to have
materials that are refractive-index-matched to the surrounding fluid. However,
materials currently in use are usually rigid and matched to liquids that are
either expensive or highly viscous. This does not allow for measurements at
high Reynolds number, nor accurate modeling of flexible structures. This work
explores the use of two hydrogels (agarose and polyacrylamide) as
refractive-index-matched models in water. These hydrogels are inexpensive, can
be cast into desired shapes, and have flexibility that can be tuned to match
biological materials. The use of water as the fluid phase allows this method to
be implemented immediately in many experimental facilities and permits
investigation of high Reynolds number phenomena. We explain fabrication methods
and present a summary of the physical and optical properties of both gels, and
then show measurements demonstrating the use of hydrogel models in quantitative
imaging.
