Optical MINs hold great promise and have advantages over their electronic
networks.they also hold their own challenges. More research has been done on
Electronic Multistage Interconnection Networks, (EMINs) but these days optical
communication is a good networking choice to meet the increasing demands of
high-performance computing communication applications for high bandwidth
applications. The electronic Multistage Interconnection Networks (EMINs) and
the Optical Multistage Interconnection Networks (OMINs) have many similarities,
but there are some fundamental differences between them such as the
optical-loss during switching and the crosstalk problem in the optical
switches. To reduce the negative effect of crosstalk, various approaches which
apply the concept of dilation in either the space or time domain have been
proposed. With the space domain approach, extra SEs are used to ensure that at
most one input and one output of every SE will be used at any given time. For
an Optical network without crosstalk, it is needed to divide the messages into
several groups, and then deliver the messages using one time slot (pass) for
each group, which is called the time division multiplexing. This Paper
discusses the permutation passability behavior of optical MINs. The bandwidth
of optical MINs with or without crosstalk has also been explained. The results
thus obtained shows that the performance of the networks improves by allowing
crosstalk to some extent.
