We demonstrate the effectiveness of a generalized renormalized perturbational
approach to calculate the induced magnetization for the single impurity
Anderson model with a strong on-site interaction, using flow equations for
renormalized parameters to scale from a weak correlation to a strong
correlation regime. We show that, using simple approximation schemes in
different parameter regimes, remarkably accurate results can be obtained for
all magnetic field values by comparing the results with those from direct
numerical renormalization group and Bethe ansatz calculations.
