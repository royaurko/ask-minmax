The exact form of the Jacobi -- Levi-Civita (JLC) equation for geodesic
spread is here explicitly worked out at arbitrary dimension for the
configuration space manifold M_E = {q in R^N | V(q) < E} of a standard
Hamiltonian system, equipped with the Jacobi (or kinetic energy) metric g_J. As
the Hamiltonian flow corresponds to a geodesic flow on (M_E,g_J), the JLC
equation can be used to study the degree of instability of the Hamiltonian
flow. It is found that the solutions of the JLC equation are closely resembling
the solutions of the standard tangent dynamics equation which is used to
compute Lyapunov exponents. Therefore the instability exponents obtained
through the JLC equation are in perfect quantitative agreement with usual
Lyapunov exponents. This work completes a previous investigation that was
limited only to two-degrees of freedom systems.
