The demand for Internet based services has exploded over the last decade.
Many organizations use the Internet and particularly the World Wide Web as
their primary medium for communication and business. This phenomenal growth has
dramatically increased the performance requirements for the Internet. To have a
high performance Internet, a good congestion control system is essential for
it. The current work proposes that the congestion control in the Internet can
be inspired from the population control tactics of the nature. Toward this
idea, each flow (W) in the network is viewed as a species whose population size
is congestion window size of the flow. By this assumption, congestion control
problem is redefined as population control of flow species. This paper defines
a three trophic food chain analogy in congestion control area, and gives a
ratio dependent model to control population size of W species within this plant
herbivore carnivorous food chain. Simulation results show that this model
achieves fair bandwidth allocation, high utilization and small queue size. It
does not maintain any per flow state in routers and have few computational
loads per packet, which makes it scalable.
