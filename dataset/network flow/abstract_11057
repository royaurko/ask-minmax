We consider the prisoner's dilemma being played repeatedly on a dynamic
network, where agents may choose their actions as well as their co-players.
This leads to co-evolution of network structure and strategy patterns of the
players. Individual decisions are made fully rationally and are based on local
information only. They are made such that links to defecting agents are
resolved and that cooperating agents build up new links. The exact form of the
updating scheme is motivated by profit maximization and not by imitation. If
players update their decisions in a synchronized way the system exhibits
oscillatory dynamics: Periods of growing cooperation (and total linkage)
alternate with periods of increasing defection. The cyclical behavior is
reduced and the system stabilizes at significant total cooperation levels when
players are less synchronized. In this regime we find emergent network
structures resembling 'complex' and hierarchical topology. The exponent of the
power-law degree distribution ($\gamma\sim8.6$) perfectly matches empirical
results of human communication networks.
