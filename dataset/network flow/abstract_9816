Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments are described for two
granular-flow systems, the vibrofluidized bed and the gas-fluidized bed. Using
pulsed field gradient, magnetic resonance imaging, and hyperpolarized gas NMR,
detailed information is obtained for the density and motions of both grains and
interstitial gas. For the vibrofluidized bed, the granular temperature profile
is measured and compared with a first-principles formulation of granular
hydrodynamics. For the gas-fluidized bed, dynamic correlations in the grain
density are used to measure the bubble velocity and hyperpolarized xenon gas
NMR is used to measure the bubble-emulsion exchange rate. A goal of these
measurements is to verify in earth gravity first-principles theories of
granular flows, which then can be used to make concrete predictions for
granular flows in reduced gravity.
