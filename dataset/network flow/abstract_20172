We investigated nonequilibrium domain wall dynamics under an ac field by
measuring the hysteresis loops of epitaxial ferroelectric capacitors at various
frequencies and temperatures. Polarization switching is induced mostly by
thermally activated creep motion at lower frequencies, and by viscous flow
motion at higher frequencies. The dynamic crossover between the creep and flow
regimes unveils two frequency-dependent scaling regions of hysteresis loops.
Based on these findings, we constructed a dynamic phase diagram for hysteretic
ferroelectric domain dynamics in the presence of ac fields.
