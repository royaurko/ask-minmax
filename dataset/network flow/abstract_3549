We investigate the longest-path attacks on complex networks. Specifically, we
remove approximately the longest simple path from a network iteratively until
there are no paths left in the network. We propose two algorithms, the random
augmenting approach (RPA) and the Hamilton-path based approach (HPA), for
finding the approximately longest simple path in a network. Results demonstrate
that steps of longest-path attacks increase with network density linearly for
random networks, while exponentially increasing for scale-free networks. The
more homogeneous the degree distribution is, the more fragile the network,
which is totally different from the previous results of node or edge attacks.
HPA is generally more efficient than RPA in the longest-path attacks of complex
networks. These findings further help us understand the vulnerability of
complex systems, better protect complex systems, and design more tolerant
complex systems.
