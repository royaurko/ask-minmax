We study the formation of clusters of passive Lagrangian tracers in a
non-smooth turbulent flow in a flat free-slip surface as a model for particle
dynamics on free surfaces. Single particle and pair dispersion show different
behavior for short and large times: on short times particles cluster
exponentially rapidly until patches of the size of the divergence correlation
length are depleted; on larger times the pair dispersion is dominated by almost
ballistic hopping between clusters. We also find that the distribution of
particle density is close to algebraic and can trace this back to the
exponential distribution of the divergence field of the surface flow.
