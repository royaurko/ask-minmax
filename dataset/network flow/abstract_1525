We have developed different network approaches to complex patterns of
frictional interfaces (contact areas developments). Here, we analyze the
dynamics of static friction. We found, under the correlation measure, the
fraction of triangles correlates with the detachment fronts. Also, for all
types of the loops (such as triangles), there is a universal power law between
nodes' degree and motifs where motifs frequency follow a power law. This shows
high energy localization is characterized by fast variation of the loops
fraction. Also, this proves that the congestion of loops occurs around hubs.
Furthermore, the motif distributions and modularity space of networks -in terms
of within-module degree and participation coefficient- show universal trends,
indicating an in common aspect of energy flow in shear ruptures. Moreover, we
confirmed that slow ruptures generally hold small localization, while regular
ruptures carry a high level of energy localization. We proposed that
assortativity, as an index to correlation of node's degree, can uncover
acoustic features of the interfaces. We showed that increasing assortativity
induces a nearly silent period of fault's activities. Also, we proposed that
slow ruptures resulted from within-module developments rather than
extra-modules of the networks. Our approach presents a completely new
perspective of the evolution of shear ruptures.
