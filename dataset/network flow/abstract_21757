We propose new formulas for singular vectors in Verma modules over the affine
Lie superalgebra $\hat{sl}(2|1)$. We analyze the coexistence of singular
vectors of different types and identify the twisted modules $N_{h,k;\theta}$
arising as submodules and quotient modules of $\hat{sl}(2|1)$ Verma modules. We
show that with the twists (spectral flow transformations) properly taken into
account, a resolution of irreducible representations can be constructed
consisting of only the $N_{h,k;\theta}$ modules.
