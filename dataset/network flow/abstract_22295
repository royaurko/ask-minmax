We study squeeze flow of two different fluids (castor oil and ethylene
glycol) between a pair of glass plates and a pair of perspex plates, under an
applied load. The film thickness is found to vary with time as a power-law,
where the exponent increases with load. After a certain time interval the area
of fluid-solid contact saturates to a constant value. This saturation area,
increases with load at different rates for different fluid-solid combinations.
