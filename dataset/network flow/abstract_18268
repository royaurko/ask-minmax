A clustered base transceiver station (BTS) coordination strategy is proposed
for a large cellular MIMO network, which includes full intra-cluster
coordination to enhance the sum rate and limited inter-cluster coordination to
reduce interference for the cluster edge users. Multi-cell block
diagonalization is used to coordinate the transmissions across multiple BTSs in
the same cluster. To satisfy per-BTS power constraints, three combined precoder
and power allocation algorithms are proposed with different performance and
complexity tradeoffs. For inter-cluster coordination, the coordination area is
chosen to balance fairness for edge users and the achievable sum rate. It is
shown that a small cluster size (about 7 cells) is sufficient to obtain most of
the sum rate benefits from clustered coordination while greatly relieving
channel feedback requirement. Simulations show that the proposed coordination
strategy efficiently reduces interference and provides a considerable sum rate
gain for cellular MIMO networks.
