  The indoor carbon monoxide concentration in 10 car parks with volumes varying from 1,000 m 3 to 35,000 m 3 and ceiling height of 3 m was simulated using the multi-zone network model CONTAM93/94 developed at the Building and Fire Research Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST) in the U.S.A. Use of the model in designing the ventilation system in a car park is illustrated. Experimental measurements on the carbon monoxide level in that car park were performed to verify the results.
