In sparse light splitting all-optical WDM networks, the more destinations a
light-tree can accommodate, the fewer light-trees andwavelengths amulticast
session will require. In this article, a Hypo-Steiner light-tree algorithm
(HSLT) is proposed to construct a HSLT light-tree to include as many
destinations as possible. The upper bound cost of the light-trees built by HSLT
is given as N(N -1)/2, where N is the number of nodes in the network. The
analytical model proves that, under the same condition, more destinations could
be held in a HSLT than a Member-Only (Zhang et al., J. Lightware Technol,
18(12), 1917-1927 2000.) light-tree. Extensive simulations not only validate
the proof but also show that the proposed heuristic outperforms the existing
multicast routing algorithms by a large margin in terms of link stress,
throughput, and efficiency ofwavelength usage.
