We interpret the subgraph centrality as the partition function of a network.
The entropy, the internal energy and the Helmholtz free energy are defined for
networks and molecular graphs on the basis of graph spectral theory. Various
relations of these quantities to the structure and the dynamics of the complex
networks are discussed. They include the cohesiveness of the network and the
critical coupling of coupled phase oscillators. We explore several models of
network growing/evolution as well as real-world networks, such as those
representing metabolic and protein-protein interaction networks as well as the
interaction between secondary structure elements in proteins.
