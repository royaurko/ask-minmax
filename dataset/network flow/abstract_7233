We analyze the properties of the self-similar network obtained from the
trajectories of unimodal maps at the transition to chaos via the horizontal
visibility (HV) algorithm. We first show that this network is uniquely
determined by the encoded sequence of positions in the dynamics within the
Feigenbaum attractor and it is universal in that it is independent of the shape
and nonlinearity of the maps in this class. We then find that the network
degrees fluctuate at all scales with an amplitude that increases as the size of
the network grows. This suggests the definition of a graph-theoretical Lyapunov
exponent that measures the expansion rate of trajectories in network space. On
good agreement with the map's counterpart, while at the onset of chaos this
exponent vanishes, the subexponential expansion and contraction of network
degrees can be fully described via a Tsallis-type scalar deformation of the
expansion rate, that yields a discrete spectrum of non-null generalized
exponents. We further explore the possibility of defining an entropy growth
rate that describes the amount of information created along the trajectories in
network space. Making use of the trajectory distributions in the map's
accumulation point and the scaling properties of the associated network, we
show that such entropic growth rate coincides with the spectrum of
graph-theoretical exponents, what appears as a set of Pesin-like identities in
the network.
