The kinetics of spreading of a liquid drop in a wedge or V-shaped groove, in
a network of such grooves, and on a hydrophilic strip, is re-examined. The
length of a droplet of volume Omega spreading in a wedge after a time t is
predicted to scale as Omega^(1/5) * t^(2/5), and the height profile is
predicted to be a parabola in the distance along the wedge. If the droplet is
spreading radially in a sparse network of V-shaped grooves on a surface, the
radius is predicted to scale as Omega^(1/6) * t^(1/3), provided the liquid is
completely contained within the grooves. A number of other results are also
obtained.
