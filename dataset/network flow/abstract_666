Heterogeneous Networks is the integration of all existing networks under a
single environment with an understanding between the functional operations and
also includes the ability to make use of multiple broadband transport
technologies and to support generalized mobility. It is a challenging feature
for Heterogeneous networks to integrate several IP-based access technologies in
a seamless way. The focus of this paper is on the requirements of a mobility
management scheme for multimedia real-time communication services - Mobile
Video Conferencing. Nowadays, the range of available wireless access network
technologies includes cellular or wide-area wireless systems, such as cellular
networks (GSM/GPRS/UMTS) or Wi-Max, local area Network or personal area
wireless systems, comprising for example, WLAN (802.11 a/b/g) and Bluetooth. As
the mobile video conferencing is considered, the more advanced mobile terminals
are capable of having more than one interface active at the same time. In
addition, the heterogeneity of access technologies and also the seamless flow
of information will increase in the future, making the seamless integration of
the access network a key challenge for mobility management in a heterogeneous
network environment. Services must be provided to the user regardless of the
particular access technology and also the type of service provider or the
network used.
