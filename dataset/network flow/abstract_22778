We show in this note that the Ito-Lyons solution map associated to a rough
differential equation is Frechet differentiable when understood as a map
between some Banach spaces of controlled paths. This regularity result provides
an elementary approach to Taylor-like expansions of Inahama-Kawabi type for
solutions of rough differential equations depending on a small parameter, and
makes the construction of some natural dynamics on the path space over any
compact Riemannian manifold straightforward, giving back Driver's flow as a
particular case.
