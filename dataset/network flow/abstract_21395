We suggest that the conventional need for overwhelming amounts of
astrophysical dark matter should be regarded as a warning to standard gravity
rather than as merely a challenge to it, and show that the systematics of
galactic rotation curve data can just as readily point in the direction of the
equally covariant conformal gravity alternative. In particular we identify an
apparent imprint of the Hubble flow on those data, something which while quite
natural to conformal gravity is not at all anticipated in the standard
gravitational paradigm.
