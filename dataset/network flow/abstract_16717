In this paper, we study the consensus problem for networked dynamic systems
with arbitrary initial states, and present some structural characterization and
direct construction of consensus functions. For the consensus problem under
similar transformation, we establish some necessary and sufficient conditions
by exploiting the structure of consensus functions. Finally, we discuss the
consensus problem for dynamic systems under switching by using the common
Lyapunov function method.
