A semi-analytical dynamical mean-field approximation (DMA) has been developed
for large but finite $N$-unit active rotator (AR) networks subject to
individual white noises. Assuming weak noises and the Gaussian distribution of
state variables, we have derived equations of motions for moments of local and
global variables up to the {\it infinite} order. In DMA, the original
$N$-dimensional {\it stochastic} differential equations (DEs) are replaced by
three-dimensional {\it deterministic} DEs while the conventional moment method
yields $(1/2)N(N+3)$ deterministic DEs for moments of local variables. We have
discussed the characters of the stationary state, the time-periodic state and
the random, disordered state, which are realized in excitable AR networks,
depending on the model parameters. It has been demonstrated that although
fluctuations of global variable vary as $1/\sqrt{N}$ when $N$ is increased,
those of local variables remain finite even for $N \to \infty$. Results
calculated with the use of our DMA are compared to those obtained by direct
simulations and by the Fokker-Planck equation which is applicable to the
$N=\infty$ AR model. The advantage and disadvantage of DMA are also discussed.
