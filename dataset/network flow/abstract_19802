The linear and non-linear dynamic response to an oscillatory shear flow of
giant wormlike micelles consisting of Pb-Peo block copolymers is studied by
means of Fourier transform rheology. Experiments are performed in the vicinity
of the isotropic-nematic phase transition concentration, where the location of
isotropic-nematic phase transition lines is determined independently. Strong
shear-thinning behaviour is observed due to critical slowing down of
orientational diffusion as a result of the vicinity of the isotropic- nematic
spinodal. This severe shear-thinning behaviour is shown to result in gradient
shear banding. Time-resolved Small angle neutron scattering experiments are
used to obtain insight in the microscopic phenomena that underly the observed
rheological response. An equation of motion for the order-parameter tensor and
an expression of the stress tensor in terms of the order-parameter tensor are
used to interpret the experimental data, both in the linear and non-linear
regime. Scaling of the dynamic behaviour of the orientational order parameter
and the stress is found when critical slowing down due to the vicinity of the
isotropic-nematic spinodal is accounted for.
