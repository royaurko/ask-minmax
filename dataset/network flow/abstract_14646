Acceleration in symbolic verification consists in computing the exact effect
of some control-flow loops in order to speed up the iterative fix-point
computation of reachable states. Even if no termination guarantee is provided
in theory, successful results were obtained in practice by different tools
implementing this framework. In this paper, the acceleration framework is
extended to data-flow analysis. Compared to a classical
widening/narrowing-based abstract interpretation, the loss of precision is
controlled here by the choice of the abstract domain and does not depend on the
way the abstract value is computed. Our approach is geared towards precision,
but we don't loose efficiency on the way. Indeed, we provide a cubic-time
acceleration-based algorithm for solving interval constraints with full
multiplication.
