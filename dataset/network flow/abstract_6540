In this paper, we analyze the coding delay and the average coding delay of
random linear network codes (a.k.a. dense codes) and chunked codes (CC), which
are an attractive alternative to dense codes due to their lower complexity,
over line networks with Bernoulli losses and deterministic regular or Poisson
transmissions. Our results, which include upper bounds on the delay and the
average delay, are (i) for dense codes, in some cases more general, and in some
other cases tighter, than the existing bounds, and provide a more clear picture
of the speed of convergence of dense codes to the (min-cut) capacity of line
networks; and (ii) the first of their kind for CC over networks with such
probabilistic traffics. In particular, these results demonstrate that a
stand-alone CC or a precoded CC provide a better tradeoff between the
computational complexity and the convergence speed to the network capacity over
the probabilistic traffics compared to arbitrary deterministic traffics which
have previously been studied in the literature.
