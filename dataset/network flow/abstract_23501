A theory of stress fields in two-dimensional granular materials based on
directed force chain networks is presented. A general equation for the
densities of force chains in different directions is proposed and a complete
solution is obtained for a special case in which chains lie along a discrete
set of directions. The analysis and results demonstrate the necessity of
including nonlinear terms in the equation. A line of nontrivial fixed point
solutions is shown to govern the properties of large systems. In the vicinity
of a generic fixed point, the response to a localized load shows a crossover
from a single, centered peak at intermediate depths to two propagating peaks at
large depths that broaden diffusively.
