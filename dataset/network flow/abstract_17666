The solitary wave problem at the free surface of a two-dimensional,
infinitely-deep and irrotational flow of water, under the influence of gravity,
is formulated as a nonlinear pseudodifferential equation. A Pohozaev identity
is used to show that it admits no solutions which asymptotically vanish faster
than linearly.
