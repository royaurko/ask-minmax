We study numerically cross conductances in a four-terminal all-graphene
setup. We show that far away from the Dirac point current flows along zigzag
directions, giving the possibility to guide the current between terminals using
a tunable pn-junction. The device operates as a gate-controlled current switch,
and the electronic properties of graphene are crucial for efficient
performance.
