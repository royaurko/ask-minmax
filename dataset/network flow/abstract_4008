We present various Lattice Boltzmann Models which reproduce the effects of
rough walls, shear thinning and granular flow. We examine the boundary layers
generated by the roughness of the walls. Shear thinning produces plug flow with
a sharp density contrast at the boundaries. Density waves are spontaneously
generated when the viscosity has a nonlinear dependence on density which
characterizes granular flow.
