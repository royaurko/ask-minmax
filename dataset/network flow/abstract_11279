This Letter studies the critical point as well as the discontinuity of a
class of explosive site percolation in Erd\"{o}s and R\'{e}nyi (ER) random
network. The class of the percolation is implemented by introducing a best-of-m
rule. Two major results are found: i). For any specific $m$, the critical
percolation point scales with the average degree of the network while its
exponent associated with $m$ is bounded by -1 and $\sim-0.5$. ii).
Discontinuous percolation could occur on sparse networks if and only if $m$
approaches infinite. These results not only generalize some conclusions of
ordinary percolation but also provide new insights to the network robustness.
