The energy spectrum in three examples of inhomogeneous, anisotropic
turbulence, namely, purely mechanical wall turbulence, the Bolgiano-Obukhov
cascade and helical turbulence, is analyzed. As one could expect, simple
dimensional reasoning leads to incorrect results and must be supplemented by
informations on the dynamics. In the case of wall turbulence, an hypothesis of
Kolmogorov cascade, starting locally from the gradients in the mean flow,
produces an energy spectrum which obeys the standard $k^{-{5\over 3}}$ law only
for $kx_3>1$, with $x_3$ the distance from the wall, and an inverse power law
for $kx_3<1$. An analysis of the energy budget for turbulence in stratified
flows, shows the unrealizability of an asymptotic Bolgiano scaling. Simulation
with a GOY model, leads instead to a $k^{-\alpha}$ spectrum for both
temperature and velocity, with $\alpha\simeq 2$, and a cross-correlation
between the two vanishing at large scales. In the case of not reflection
invariant turbulence, closure analysis suggests that a purely helical cascade,
associated with a $k^{-{7\over 3}}$ energy spectrum cannot take place, unless
external forcing terms are present at all scales in the Navier-Stokes equation.
