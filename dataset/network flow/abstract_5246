In the last 15 years, White and Huisken-Sinestrari developed a far-reaching
structure theory for the mean curvature flow of mean convex hypersurfaces.
Their papers provide a package of estimates and structural results that yield a
precise description of singularities and of high curvature regions in a mean
convex flow. In the present paper, we give a new treatment of the theory of
mean convex (and k-convex) flows. This includes: (1) an estimate for
derivatives of curvatures, (2) a convexity estimate, (3) a cylindrical
estimate, (4) a global convergence theorem, (5) a structure theorem for ancient
solutions, and (6) a partial regularity theorem. Our new proofs are both more
elementary and substantially shorter than the original arguments. Our estimates
are local and universal. A key ingredient in our new approach is the new non-
collapsing result of Andrews. Some parts are also inspired by the work of
Perelman. In a forthcoming paper, we will give a new construction of mean
curvature flow with surgery based on the theorems established in the present
paper.
