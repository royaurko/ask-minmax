We perform stability analysis of an accretion disc around a stellar mass
black hole. The cooling of the accretion flow due to bremsstrahlung and
synchrotron radiation processes are considered. The solutions with shock are
perturbed at the shock location and the radial dependence of perturbation is
obtained by solving the equations numerically using fourth-order Runge-Kutta
method. The perturbations are assumed to be infinitesimal, thereby allowing a
linear analysis. The frequencies that solve the equations are found and the
existence of unstable frequencies implies instability.
