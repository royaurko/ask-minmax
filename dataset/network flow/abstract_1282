We study the statistical properties of spectrum and eigenstates of the Google
matrix of the citation network of Physical Review for the period 1893 - 2009.
The main fraction of complex eigenvalues with largest modulus is determined
numerically by different methods based on high precision computations with up
to $p=16384$ binary digits that allows to resolve hard numerical problems for
small eigenvalues. The nearly nilpotent matrix structure allows to obtain a
semi-analytical computation of eigenvalues. We find that the spectrum is
characterized by the fractal Weyl law with a fractal dimension $d_f \approx 1$.
It is found that the majority of eigenvectors are located in a localized phase.
The statistical distribution of articles in the PageRank-CheiRank plane is
established providing a better understanding of information flows on the
network. The concept of ImpactRank is proposed to determine an influence domain
of a given article. We also discuss the properties of random matrix models of
Perron-Frobenius operators.
