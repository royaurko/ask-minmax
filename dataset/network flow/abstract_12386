The energy-delay tradeoffs in wireless networks are studied using a
game-theoretic framework. A multi-class multiple-access network is considered
in which users choose their transmit powers, and possibly transmission rates,
in a distributed manner to maximize their own utilities while satisfying their
delay quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The utility function considered
here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per Joule of energy
consumed and is particularly useful for energy-constrained networks. The Nash
equilibrium solution for the proposed non-cooperative game is presented and
closed-form expressions for the users' utilities at equilibrium are obtained.
Based on this, the losses in energy efficiency and network capacity due to
presence of delay-sensitive users are quantified. The analysis is extended to
the scenario where the QoS requirements include both the average source rate
and a bound on the average total delay (including queuing delay). It is shown
that the incoming traffic rate and the delay constraint of a user translate
into a "size" for the user, which is an indication of the amount of resources
consumed by the user. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among throughput,
delay, network capacity and energy efficiency are also quantified.
