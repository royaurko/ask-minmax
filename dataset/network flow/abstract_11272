Mobility management and bandwidth management are two major research issues in
a cellular mobile network. Mobility management consists of two basic
components: location management and handoff management. To Provide QoS to the
users Handoff is a key element in wireless cellular networks. It is often
initiated either by crossing a cell boundary or by deterioration in the quality
of signal in the current channel. In this paper, a new admission control policy
for cellular mobile network is being proposed. Two important QoS parameter in
cellular networks are Call Dropping Probability (CDP) and Handoff Dropping
Probability (HDP). CDP represents the probability that a call is dropped due to
a handoff failure. HDP represents the probability of a handoff failure due to
insufficient available resources in the target cell. Most of the algorithms try
to limit the HDP to some target maximum but not CDP. In this paper, we show
that when HDP is controlled, the CDP is also controlled to a minimum extent
while maintaining lower blocking rates for new calls in the system.
