A two-dimensional array of independent random signs produces coalescing
random walks. The position of the walk, starting at the origin, after N steps
is a highly nonlinear, noise sensitive function of the signs. A typical term of
its Fourier-Walsh expansion involves the product of about square roof of N
signs.
