This paper presents an intelligent traffic monitoring system using wireless
vision sensor network that captures and processes the real-time video image to
obtain the traffic flow rate and vehicle speeds along different urban roadways.
This system will display the traffic states on the front roadways that can
guide the drivers to select the right way and avoid potential traffic
congestions. On the other hand, it will also monitor the vehicle speeds and
store the vehicle details, for those breaking the roadway speed limits, in its
database. The real-time traffic data is processed by the Personal Computer (PC)
at the sub roadway station and the traffic flow rate data is transmitted to the
main roadway station Arduino 3G via email, where the data is extracted and
traffic flow rate displayed.
