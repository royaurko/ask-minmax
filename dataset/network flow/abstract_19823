Consider the Navier-Stokes flow past a rotating obstacle with a general
time-dependent angular velocity and a time-dependent outflow condition at
infinity -- sometimes called an Oseen condition. By a suitable change of
coordinates the problem is transformed to an non-autonomous problem with
unbounded drift terms on a fixed exterior domain $\Omega\subset \R^d$. It is
shown that the solution to the linearized problem is governed by a strongly
continuous evolution system $\{T_\Omega(t,s)\}_{t\geq s\geq0}$ on
$L^p_\sigma(\Omega)$ for $1<p<\infty$. Moreover, $L^p$-$L^q$ smoothing
properties and gradient estimates of $T_\Omega(t,s)$, $0\leq s \leq t$, are
obtained. These results are the key ingredients to show local in time existence
of mild solutions to the full nonlinear problem for $p\geq d$ and initial value
in $L^p_\sigma(\Omega)$.
