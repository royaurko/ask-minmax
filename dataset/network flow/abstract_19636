A substitution $\vp$ is strong Pisot if its abelianization matrix is
non-singular and all eigenvalues except the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue have
modulus less than one. For strong Pisot $\vp$ that satisfies a no cycle
condition and for which the translation flow on the tiling space $\T_\vp$ has
pure discrete spectrum, we describe the collection $\T^P_\vp$ of pairs of
proximal tilings in $\T_\vp$ in a natural way as a substitution tiling space.
We show that if $\psi$ is another such substitution, then $\T_\vp $ and
$\T_\psi$ are homeomorphic if and only if $\T^P_\vp$ and $\T^P_\psi$ are
homeomorphic. We make use of this invariant to distinguish tiling spaces for
which other known invariants are ineffective. In addition, we show that for
strong Pisot substitutions, pure discrete spectrum of the flow on the
associated tiling space is equivalent to proximality being a closed relation on
the tiling space.
