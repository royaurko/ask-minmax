Let $g(t)$ with $t\in [0,T)$ be a complete solution to the Kaehler-Ricci
flow: $\frac{d}{dt}g_{i\bar j}=-R_{i\bar j}$ where $T$ may be $\infty$. In this
article, we show that the curvatures of $g(t)$ is uniformly bounded if the
solution $g(t)$ is uniformly equivalet. This result is stronger than the main
result in \v{S}e\v{s}um \cite{sesum} within the category of K\"ahler-Ricci
flow.
