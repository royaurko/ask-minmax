We find general, time-dependent solutions produced by open string sources
carrying no momentum flow in 2+1 dimensional gravity. The local Poincar\'e
group elements associated with these solutions and the coordinate
transformations that transform these solutions into Minkowski metric are
obtained. We also find the relation between these solutions and the planar wall
solutions in 3+1 dimensions.
