We present a number of variously rearranged matrix plots of the $3, 107
\times 3, 107$ 1995-2000 (asymmetric) intercounty migration table for the
United States, principally in its bistochasticized form (all 3,107 row and
column sums iteratively proportionally fitted to equal 1). In one set of plots,
the counties are seriated on the bases of the subdominant (left and right)
eigenvectors of the bistochastic matrix. In another set, we use the ordering of
counties in the dendrogram generated by the associated strong component
hierarchical clustering. Interesting, diverse features of U. S. intercounty
migration emerge--such as a contrast in centralized, hub-like
(cosmopolitan/provincial) properties between cosmopolitan "Sunbelt" and
provincial "Black Belt" counties. The methodologies employed should also be
insightful for the many other diverse forms of interesting transaction
flow-type data--interjournal citations being an obvious, much-studied example,
where one might expect that the journals Science, Nature and PNAS would display
"cosmopolitan" characteristics.
