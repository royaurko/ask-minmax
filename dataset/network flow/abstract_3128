We present a novel heuristic algorithm for routing optimization on complex
networks. Previously proposed routing optimization algorithms aim at avoiding
or reducing link overload. Our algorithm balances traffic on a network by
minimizing the maximum node betweenness with as little path lengthening as
possible, thus being useful in cases when networks are jamming due to queuing
overload. By using the resulting routing table, a network can sustain
significantly higher traffic without jamming than in the case of traditional
shortest path routing.
