Boolean networks may be viewed as idealizations of biological genetic
networks, where each node is represented by an on-off switch which is a
function of the binary output from some other nodes. We evolve connectivity in
a single Boolean network, and demonstrate how the sole requirement of
sequential matching of attractors may open for an evolution that exhibits
punctuated equilibrium.
