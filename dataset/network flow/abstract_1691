We investigate through computational simulations with a pore network model
the formation of patterns caused by erosion-deposition mechanisms. In this
model, the geometry of the pore space changes dynamically as a consequence of
the coupling between the fluid flow and the movement of particles due to local
drag forces. Our results for this irreversible process show that the model is
capable to reproduce typical natural patterns caused by well known erosion
processes. Moreover, we observe that, within a certain range of porosity
values, the grains form clusters that are tilted with respect to the horizontal
with a characteristic angle. We compare our results to recent experiments for
granular material in flowing water and show that they present a satisfactory
agreement.
