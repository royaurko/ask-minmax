Now a days, Internet plays a major role in our day to day activities e.g.,
for online transactions, online shopping, and other network related
applications. Internet suffers from slow convergence of routing protocols after
a network failure which becomes a growing problem. Multiple Routing
Configurations [MRC] recovers network from single node/link failures, but does
not support network from multiple node/link failures. In this paper, we propose
Enhanced MRC [EMRC], to support multiple node/link failures during data
transmission in IP networks without frequent global re-convergence. By
recovering these failures, data transmission in network will become fast.
