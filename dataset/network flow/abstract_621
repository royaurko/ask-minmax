Critical nodes or "middlemen" have an essential place in both social and
economic networks when considering the flow of information and trade. This
paper extends the concept of critical nodes to directed networks. We identify
strong and weak middlemen. Node contestability is introduced as a form of
competition in networks; a duality between uncontested intermediaries and
middlemen is established. The brokerage power of middlemen is formally
expressed and a general algorithm is constructed to measure the brokerage power
of each node from the networks adjacency matrix. Augmentations of the brokerage
power measure are discussed to encapsulate relevant centrality measures. We use
these concepts to identify and measure middlemen in two empirical
socio-economic networks, the elite marriage network of Renaissance Florence and
Krackhardt's advice network.
