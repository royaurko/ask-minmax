This work presents a numerical simulation using CFX 4.4 of the Energy
Amplifier Experimental Facility (X-ADS) downcomer channel. The simulation is
focused on the Steady-State Analysis. The Intermediate Heat exchangers (IHX) of
the X-ADS reference configuration are immersed in the lead-bismuth eutectic of
the downcomer. Due to the absence of a physical separation between the primary
coolant hot and cold collectors, two different flow paths are available in the
downcomer region: inside the IHX and outside it (IHX by-pass flow). The amount
of IHX by-pass flow is determined by the balance between the driving force due
to buoyancy (originated by the weight difference between the cooled fluid
inside the IHX and the hot outside downcomer fluid) and the IHX pressure
losses. At the IHX exit the two flow paths are mixed before the core inlet.
This fact provides a potential for a downcomer thermal stratification, which is
influenced by the actual value of coolant flow rate outside the IHX. The amount
and extension of the thermal stratification phenomena is the object of this
study. The simulation allowed studying the position and intensity of the
thermal stratification phenomena. Several runs have been performed. However, to
limit the extension of the paper, we deal with the results of only one of the
calculations performed, which resulted in the worst condition from the point of
view of thermal loads on the structure. Other results obtained will be shortly
recalled when needed.
