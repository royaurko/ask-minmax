Synchronization underlies biological and man-made phenomena including memory
and perception in the brain, coordinated motion of animal flocks, and stability
of the power grid, and is often modeled through networks of phase-coupled
oscillating nodes. Heterogeneity in the node dynamics, however, may prevent
such networks from achieving the required level of synchronization. In order to
guarantee synchronization, external inputs can be used to pin a subset of nodes
to a reference frequency, while the remaining nodes are steered toward
synchronization via local coupling. In this paper, we present a submodular
optimization framework for selecting a set of nodes to act as external inputs
in order to achieve synchronization from almost any initial network state. We
derive threshold-based sufficient conditions for synchronization, and then
prove that these conditions are equivalent to connectivity of a class of
augmented network graphs. Based on this connection, we map the sufficient
conditions for synchronization to constraints on submodular functions, leading
to efficient algorithms with provable optimality bounds for selecting input
nodes. We illustrate our approach via numerical studies of synchronization in
networks from power systems, wireless networks, and neuronal networks.
