Fine powders often tend to agglomerate due to van der Waals forces between
the particles. These forces can be reduced significantly by covering the
particles with nanoscaled adsorbates, as shown by recent experiments. In the
present work a quantitative statistical analysis of the effect of powder flow
regulating nanomaterials on the adhesive forces in powders is given. Covering
two spherical powder particles randomly with nanoadsorbates we compute the
decrease of the mutual van der Waals force. The dependence of the force on the
relative surface coverage obeys a scaling form which is independent of the used
materials. The predictions by our simulations are compared to the experimental
results.
