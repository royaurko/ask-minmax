We report on an XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer observation of the
black hole candidate and Galactic microquasar GRS 1758-258. The source entered
a peculiar "off/soft" state in late February, 2001, in which the spectrum
softened while the X-ray flux -- and the inferred mass accretion rate --
steadily decreased. We find no clear evidence for emission or absorption lines
in the dispersed spectra, indicating that most of the observed soft flux is
likely from an accretion disk and not from a cool plasma. The accretion disk
strongly dominates the spectrum in this lower-luminosity state, and is only
mildly recessed from the marginally stable orbit. These findings may be
difficult to explain in terms of advection-dominated accretion flow, or "ADAF"
models. We discuss these results within the context of ADAF models,
simultaneous two-flow models, and observed correlations between hard X-ray flux
and jet production.
