Agent-based models of the binary naming game are generalized here to
represent a family of models parameterized by the introduction of two
continuous parameters. These parameters define varying listener-speaker
interactions on the individual level with one parameter controlling the speaker
and the other controlling the listener of each interaction. The major finding
presented here is that the generalized naming game preserves the existence of
critical thresholds for the size of committed minorities. Above such threshold,
a committed minority causes a fast (in time logarithmic in size of the network)
convergence to consensus, even when there are other parameters influencing the
system. Below such threshold, reaching consensus requires time exponential in
the size of the network. Moreover, the two introduced parameters cause
bifurcations in the stabilities of the system's fixed points and may lead to
changes in the system's consensus.
