It has recently been proposed a theoretical model which accounts for the
origin of radio mini-halos observed in some cooling flow clusters as related to
electron re-acceleration by MHD turbulence (Gitti, Brunetti & Setti 2002). The
MHD turbulence is assumed to be frozen into the flow of the thermal ICM and
thus amplified in the cooling flow region. Here we present the application of
this model to a new mini-halo candidate, the cluster A2626, and compare the
results with those obtained for the mini-halo in the Perseus cluster. We
present VLA data at 330 MHz and 1.5 GHz of the diffuse radio emission observed
in A2626, and we show that its main properties can be explained by the model.
We find that the power necessary for the re-acceleration of the relic electron
population is only a factor ~ 0.7% of the maximum power that can be extracted
by the cooling flow (as estimated on the basis of the standard model). We also
discuss the observational properties of known mini-halos in connection with
those of host clusters, showing that the radio power of mini--halos increases
with the maximum power of cooling flows. This trend is expected in the
framework of the model. Possible effects of new Chandra and XMM-Newton
estimates of $\dot{M}$ on this trend are considered: we conclude that even if
earlier derived cooling rates were overestimated, cooling flow powers are still
well above the radio powers emitted by mini-halos.
