The oscillatory flow through tapered cylindrical tube sections (jet pumps) is
characterized by a numerical parameter study. The shape of a jet pump results
in asymmetric hydrodynamic end effects which cause a time-averaged pressure
drop to occur under oscillatory flow conditions. Hence, jet pumps are used as
streaming suppressors in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices. A two-dimensional
axisymmetric computational fluid dynamics model is used to calculate the
performance of a large number of conical jet pump geometries in terms of
time-averaged pressure drop and acoustic power dissipation. The investigated
geometrical parameters include the jet pump length, taper angle, waist diameter
and waist curvature. In correspondence with previous work, four flow regimes
are observed which characterize the jet pump performance and dimensionless
parameters are introduced to scale the performance of the various jet pump
geometries. The simulation results are compared to an existing quasi-steady
theory and it is shown that this theory is only applicable in a small operation
region. Based on the scaling parameters, an optimum operation region is defined
and design guidelines are proposed which can be directly used for future jet
pump design.
