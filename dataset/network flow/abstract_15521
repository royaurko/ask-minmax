Understanding dynamical processes on networks is an important area of
research in complex systems, with far reaching implications and applications in
many real-world cases. Here we introduce and study a model of intertwined
dynamics on interconnected networks, inspired by the human brain, which
consists of bidirectionally coupled synchronization and energy transport
processes. Remarkably, the proposed model allows the emergence of spontaneous
switch-like synchronization transitions driven by the energy transport
dynamics, which qualitatively mirror the transitions observed in human brain
dynamics between resting-state and cognitive activity. We provide a
steady-state analytical explanation for the observed behavior and show that the
switch-like transition is robust over a wide range of model parameters and
network topologies. Finally, we suggest that the complexity inherent in other
interconnected dynamical processes might be responsible for various other
emergent behaviors observed in natural systems.
