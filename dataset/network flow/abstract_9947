In the present work we consider the behavior of the geodesic flow on the unit
tangent bundle of the 2-torus $T^2$ for an arbitrary Riemannian metric. A
natural non-negative quantity which measures the complexity of the geodesic
flow is the topological entropy. In particular, positive topological entropy
implies chaotic behavior on an invariant set in the phase space of positive
Hausdorff-dimension (horseshoe). We show that in the case of zero topological
entropy the flow has properties similar to integrable systems. In particular
there exists a non-trivial continuous constant of motion which measures the
direction of geodesics lifted onto the universal covering $\Br^2$. Furthermore,
those geodesics travel in strips bounded by Euclidean lines. Moreover we derive
necessary and sufficient conditions for vanishing topological entropy involving
intersection properties of single geodesics on $T^2$.
