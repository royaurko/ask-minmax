The PHENIX Experiment at RHIC has conducted a beam energy scan at several
collision energies in order to search for signatures of the QCD critical point
and the onset of deconfinement. PHENIX has conducted measurements of transverse
energy production, muliplicity fluctuations, the skewness and kurtosis of net
charge distributions, Hanbury-Brown Twiss correlations, charged hadron flow,
and energy loss. The data analyzed to date show no significant indications of
the presence of the critical point.
