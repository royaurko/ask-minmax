We study converging fluid films driven by both surface tension and
gravitational forcing. Our numerical study explores this complete range of flow
regimes Even in this intermediate flow regime, away from well known limiting
behavior, we find similarity forms. The intermediate regime spans a huge range
of Bond numbers, and limits all realistic convergent flows to the intermediate
scaling regime. We verify the validity of numerical methodology and results
with various experiments.
