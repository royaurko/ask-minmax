A self-organising neural network is presented that is based on a rigorous
Bayesian analysis of the information contained in individual neural firing
events. This leads to a visual cortex network (VICON) that has many of the
properties emerge when a mammalian visual cortex is exposed to data arriving
from two imaging sensors (i.e. the two retinae), such as dominance stripes and
orientation maps.
