We study the international interbank market through a geometrical and a
topological analysis of empirical data. The geometrical analysis of the time
series of cross-country liabilities shows that the systematic information of
the interbank international market is contained in a space of small dimension,
from which a topological characterization could be conveniently carried out.
Weighted and complete networks of financial linkages across countries are
developed, for which continuous clustering, degree centrality and closeness
centrality are computed. The behavior of these topological coefficients reveals
an important modification acting in the financial linkages in the period
1997-2011. Here we show that, besides the generalized clustering increase,
there is a persistent increment in the degree of connectivity and in the
closeness centrality of some countries. These countries seem to correspond to
critical locations where tax policies might provide opportunities to shift
debts. Such critical locations highlight the role that specific countries play
in the network structure and helps to situates the turbulent period that has
been characterizing the global financial system since the Summer 2007 as the
counterpart of a larger structural change going on for a more than one decade.
