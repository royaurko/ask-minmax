Molecular dynamics simulations were used to quantify mechanically-induced
structural evolution in nanocrystalline Al with an average grain size of 5 nm.
A polycrystalline sample was cyclically strained at different temperatures,
while a recently developed grain tracking algorithm was used to measure the
relative contributions of novel deformation mechanisms such as grain rotation
and grain sliding. Sample texture and grain size were also tracked during
cycling, to show how nanocrystalline plasticity rearranges overall grain
structure and alters the grain boundary network. While no obvious texture is
developing during cycling, the processes responsible for plasticity act
collectively to alter the interfacial network. Cyclic loading led to the
formation of many twin boundaries throughout the sample as well as the
occasional coalescence of neighboring grains, with higher temperatures causing
more evolution. A temperature-dependent cyclic strengthening effect was
observed, demonstrating that both the structure and properties of
nanocrystalline metals can be dynamic during loading.
