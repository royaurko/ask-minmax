The economic dispatch problem is considered for unbalanced three-phase power
distribution networks entailing both non-deferrable and elastic loads, and
distributed generation (DG) units. The objective is to minimize the costs of
power drawn from the main grid and supplied by the DG units over a given time
horizon, while meeting the overall load demand and effecting voltage
regulation. Similar to optimal power flow counterparts for balanced systems,
the resultant optimization problem is nonconvex. Nevertheless, a semidefinite
programming (SDP) relaxation technique is advocated to obtain a (relaxed)
convex problem solvable in polynomial-time complexity. To promote a reliable
yet efficient feeder operation, SDP-compliant constraints on line and neutral
current magnitudes are accommodated in the optimization formulated, along with
constraints on the power factor at the substation and at nodes equipped with
capacitor banks. Tests on the IEEE 13-node radial feeder demonstrate the
ability of the proposed method to attain the globally optimal solution of the
original nonconvex problem.
