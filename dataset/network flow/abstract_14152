P and CP violation in cosmology can be manifested as large-scale helical
velocity flows in the ambient plasma and as primordial helical magnetic fields.
We show that kinetic helicity at last scattering leads to
temperature-polarization correlations ($C_l^{TB}$ and $C_l^{EB}$) in the cosmic
microwave background radiation (CMBR) and calculate the magnitude of the
effect. Helical primordial magnetic fields, expected from cosmic events such as
electroweak baryogenesis, can lead to helical velocity flows and hence to
non-vanishing correlations of the temperature and B-type polarization. However
we show that the magnitude of the induced helical flow is unobservably small
because the helical component of a magnetic field is almost force-free. We
discuss an alternate scheme for extracting the helicity of a stochastically
homogeneous and isotropic primordial magnetic field using observations of the
CMBR. The scheme involves constructing Faraday rotation measure maps of the
CMBR and thus determining the sum of the helical and non-helical components of
the primordial magnetic field. The power spectrum of B-type polarization
fluctuations, on the other hand, are sensitive only to the non-helical
component of the primordial magnetic field. The primordial magnetic helicity
can then be derived by combining these two sets of observations.
