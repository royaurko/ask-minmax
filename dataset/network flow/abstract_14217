The magnetic fields and energy flows in an astronomical jet described by our
earlier model are calculated in detail. Though the field distribution varies
with the external pressure function p(z), it depends only weakly on the other
boundary conditions. Individual fieldlines were plotted; the lines become
nearly vertical at the bottom and are twisted at the top. An animation of a
fieldline's motion was made, which shows the line being wound up by the
accretion disc's differential rotation and rising as a result of this. The
distribution of Poynting flux within the jet indicates that much of the energy
flows up the jet from the inside of the accretion disc but a substantial
fraction flows back down to the outside.
