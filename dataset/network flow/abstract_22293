Axisymmetric toroidal equilibria with toroidal and poloidal rotations are
solved with a specific set of source functions. The two independent solutions
are associated to L and H modes. The L/H transition is regarded as a
bifurcation from one equilibrium configuration to another, under strong
external heating and pellet injection to shape temperature and density
profiles. Because of the steep edge gradient of the H solution, large static
radial electric field, zonal flow, and improved confinements, come as
consequences, not causes, of the H mode.
