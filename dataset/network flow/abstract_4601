Network connectivity plays an important role in the information exchange
between different agents in the multi-level networks. In this paper, we
establish a game-theoretic framework to capture the uncoordinated nature of the
decision making at different layers of the multi-level networks. To study the
network resiliency, we introduce two adversarial attack models and quantify
their impacts, and design a decentralized and resilient alternating-play
algorithm that aims to maximize the algebraic connectivity of the global
network under attack. We show that the designed algorithm converges to a Nash
equilibrium in a finite number of steps, and yields an equilibrium network.
Moreover, simulation results of a two-layer mobile robotic networks corroborate
and show the interdependency between different layers of networks in the
recovery process.
