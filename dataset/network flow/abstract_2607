How complex of the complex networks has attracted many researchers to explore
it. The entropy is an useful method to describe the degree of the $complex$ of
the complex networks. In this paper, a new method which is based on the Tsallis
entropy is proposed to describe the $complex$ of the complex networks. The
results in this paper show that the complex of the complex networks not only
decided by the structure property of the complex networks, but also influenced
by the relationship between each nodes. In other word, which kinds of nodes are
chosen as the main part of the complex networks will influence the value of the
entropy of the complex networks. The value of q in the Tsallis entropy of the
complex networks is used to decided which kinds of nodes will be chosen as the
main part in the complex networks. The proposed Tsallis entropy of the complex
networks is a generalised method to describe the property of the complex
networks.
