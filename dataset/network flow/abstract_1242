In grid networks, distributed resources are interconnected by wide area
network to support compute and data-intensive applications, which require
reliable and efficient transfer of gigabits (even terabits) of data. Different
from best-effort traffic in Internet, bulk data transfer in grid requires
bandwidth reservation as a fundamental service. Existing reservation schemes
such as RSVP are designed for real-time traffic specified by reservation rate,
transfer start time but with unknown lifetime. In comparison, bulk data
transfer requests are defined in terms of volume and deadline, which provide
more information, and allow more flexibility in reservation schemes, i.e.,
transfer start time can be flexibly chosen, and reservation for a single
request can be divided into multiple intervals with different reservation
rates. We define a flexible reservation framework using time-rate function
algebra, and identify a series of practical reservation scheme families with
increasing generality and potential performance, namely, FixTime-FixRate,
FixTime-FlexRate, FlexTime-FlexRate, and Multi-Interval. Simple heuristics are
used to select representative scheme from each family for performance
comparison. Simulation results show that the increasing flexibility can
potentially improve system performance, minimizing both blocking probability
and mean flow time. We also discuss the distributed implementation of proposed
framework.
