We exhibit a stable finite time blow up regime for the 1-corotational energy
critical harmonic heat flow from $\Bbb R^2$ into a smooth compact revolution
surface of $\Bbb R^3$ which reduces to the semilinear parabolic problem
$$\partial_t u -\pa^2_{r} u-\frac{\pa_r u}{r} + \frac{f(u)}{r^2}=0$$ for a
suitable class of functions $f$. The corresponding initial data can be chosen
smooth, well localized and arbitrarily close to the ground state harmonic map
in the energy critical topology. We give sharp asymptotics on the corresponding
singularity formation which occurs through the concentration of a universal
bubble of energy at the speed predicted in [Van den Bergh, J.; Hulshof, J.;
King, J., Formal asymptotics of bubbling in the harmonic map heat flow, SIAM J.
Appl. Math. vol 63, o5. pp 1682-1717]. Our approach lies in the continuation of
the study of the 1-equivariant energy critical wave map and Schr\"odinger map
with $\Bbb S^2$ target in [Rapha\"el, P.; Rodnianksi, I., Stable blow up
dynamics for the critical corotational wave maps and equivariant Yang Mills
problems, to appear in Prep. Math. IHES.], [Merle, F.; Rapha\"el, P.;
Rodnianski, I., Blow up dynamics for smooth solutions to the energy critical
Schr\"odinger map, preprint 2011.].
