Using the $\mu(I)$ continuum model recently proposed for dense granular
flows, we study theoretically steady and fully developed granular flows in two
configurations: a plane shear cell and a channel made of two parallel plates
(Poiseuille configuration). In such a description, the granular medium behaves
like a fluid whose viscosity is a function of the inertia. In the shear plane
geometry our calculation predicts that the height of the shear bands scales
with $U_0^{1/4}P_0^{1/2}$, where $U_0$ is the velocity of the moving plate and
$P_0$ the pressure applied at its top. In the Poiseuille configuration, the
medium is sheared between the lateral boundaries and a plug flow is located in
the center of the channel. The size of the plug flow is found to increase for a
decreasing pressure gradient. We show that, for small pressure gradient, the
granular material behaves like a Bingham plastic fluid.
