Power grids, road maps, and river streams are examples of infrastructural
networks which are highly vulnerable to external perturbations. An abrupt local
change of load (voltage, traffic density, or water level) might propagate in a
cascading way and affect a significant fraction of the network. Almost
discontinuous perturbations can be modeled by shock waves which can eventually
interfere constructively and endanger the normal functionality of the
infrastructure. We study their dynamics by solving the Burgers equation under
random perturbations on several real and artificial directed graphs. Even for
graphs with a narrow distribution of node properties (e.g., degree or
betweenness), a steady state is reached exhibiting a heterogeneous load
distribution, having a difference of one order of magnitude between the highest
and average loads. Unexpectedly we find for the European power grid and for
finite Watts-Strogatz networks a broad pronounced bimodal distribution for the
loads. To identify the most vulnerable nodes, we introduce the concept of
node-basin size, a purely topological property which we show to be strongly
correlated to the average load of a node.
