An analogue of the Trotter formula for the Arratia flow is presented. For
that, perturbations of the Brownian web by mappings associated with an ordinary
differential equation with a smooth right part are considered. The existence of
the limiting flow is proved by using the fractional step method. The flow
obtained is called the Arratia flow with a drift. Also small-time asymptotics
of mathematical expectations of sizes of clusters in an Arratia flow with a
drift are studied.
