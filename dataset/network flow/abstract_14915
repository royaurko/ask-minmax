We study the distribution of X-ray selected clusters of galaxies with respect
to superclusters determined by Abell clusters of galaxies and show that the
distribution of X-ray clusters follows the supercluster-void network determined
by Abell clusters. We find that in this network X-ray clusters are more
strongly clustered than other clusters. Poor, non-Abell X-ray clusters follow
the supercluster-void network as well: these clusters are embedded in
superclusters determined by rich clusters and populate filaments between them.
We present a new catalog of superclusters of Abell clusters out to a redshift
of z_{lim}=0.13, a catalog of X-ray clusters located in superclusters
determined by Abell clusters, and a list of additional superclusters of X-ray
clusters.
