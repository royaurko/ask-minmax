Modern world builds on the resilience of interdependent infrastructures
characterized as complex networks. Recently, a framework for analysis of
interdependent networks has been developed to explain the mechanism of
resilience in interdependent networks. Here we extend this interdependent
network model by considering flows in the networks and study the system's
resilience under different attack strategies. In our model, nodes may fail due
to either overload or loss of interdependency. Under the interaction between
these two failure mechanisms, it is shown that interdependent scale-free
networks show extreme vulnerability. The resilience of interdependent SF
networks is found in our simulation much smaller than single SF network or
interdependent SF networks without flows.
