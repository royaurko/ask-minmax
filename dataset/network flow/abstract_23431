The output parameters from the ground array of the Auger South observatory,
were simulated for the typical instrumental and environmental conditions at its
Malarg\"ue site using the code sample-sim. Extensive air showers started by
photons, protons and iron nuclei at the top of the atmosphere were used as
triggers. The study utilized the air shower simulation code Aires with both
QGSJet and Sibyll hadronic interaction models. A total of 1850 showers were
used to produce more than 35,000 different ground events. We report here on the
results of a multivariate analysis approach, including principal component
analysis and neural networks, to the development of new primary composition
diagnostics.
