We show that the main results of the analysis of the friction factor for
turbulent pipe flow reported in G. Gioia and P. Chakraborty (GC), Phys. Rev.
Lett. 96, 044502 (1996) can be recovered by assuming the Heisenberg closure
hypothesis for the turbulent spectrum. This highlights the structural features
of the turbulent spectrum underlying GC's analysis.
