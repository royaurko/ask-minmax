Traditional cryptography-based security mechanisms such as authentication and
contributorization are not effective against insider attacks like wormhole,
sinkhole, selective forwarding attacks, etc., Trust based approaches have been
widely used to counter insider attacks in wireless sensor networks. It provides
a quantitative way to evaluate the trustworthiness of sensor nodes. An
untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the
quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analysing the trust level of a node
is important. In this paper we focused about indirect trust mechanism, in which
each node monitors the forwarding behavior of its neighbors in order to detect
any node that behaves selfishly and does not forward the packets it receives.
For this, we used a link state routing protocol based indirect trusts which
forms the shortest route and finds the best trustworthy route among them by
comparing the values of all the calculated route trusts as for each route
present in the network. And finally, we compare our work with similar routing
protocols and show its advantages over them.
