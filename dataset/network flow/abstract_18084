The correlations among elements that break in random fuse network fracture
are studied, for disorder strong enough to allow for volume damage before final
failure. The growth of microfractures is found to be uncorrelated above a
lengthscale, that increases as the the final breakdown is approached. Since the
fuse network strength decreases with sample size, asymptotically the process
resembles more and more mean-field-like (``democratic fiber bundle'') fracture.
This is found from the microscopic dynamics of avalanches or microfractures,
from a study of damage localization via entropy, and from the final damage
profile. In particular, the last one is statistically constant, except exactly
at the final crack zone (in contrast to recent results by Hansen et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 90, 045504 (2003)), in spite of the fact that the fracture surfaces
are self-affine.
