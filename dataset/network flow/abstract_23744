We study the performance of approximate Nash equilibria for linear congestion
games. We consider how much the price of anarchy worsens and how much the price
of stability improves as a function of the approximation factor $\epsilon$. We
give (almost) tight upper and lower bounds for both the price of anarchy and
the price of stability for atomic and non-atomic congestion games. Our results
not only encompass and generalize the existing results of exact equilibria to
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibria, but they also provide a unified approach which
reveals the common threads of the atomic and non-atomic price of anarchy
results. By expanding the spectrum, we also cast the existing results in a new
light. For example, the Pigou network, which gives tight results for exact Nash
equilibria of selfish routing, remains tight for the price of stability of
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibria but not for the price of anarchy.
