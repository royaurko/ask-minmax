We construct the classical Poisson structure and $r$-matrix for some finite
dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems obtained by constraining the flows
of soliton equations in a certain way. This approach allows one to produce new
kinds of classical, dynamical Yang-Baxter structures. To illustrate the method
we present the $r$-matrices associated with the constrained flows of the
Kaup-Newell, KdV, AKNS, WKI and TG hierarchies, all generated by a
2-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Some of the obtained $r$-matrices depend only
on the spectral parameters, but others depend also on the dynamical variables.
For consistency they have to obey a classical Yang-Baxter-type equation,
possibly with dynamical extra terms.
