We study the flow generated by an incompressible viscoelastic fluid in a
fractured porous medium. The model consists of a fluid flow governed by
Stokes-Volterra equations evolving in a periodic double-porosity medium. Using
the multiscale convergence method associated to some recent tools about the
convergence of convolution sequences, we show that the equivalent macroscopic
model is of the same type as the microscopic one, but in a fixed domain.
