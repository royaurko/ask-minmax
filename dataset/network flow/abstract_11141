We investigate the effects of heterogeneous and clustered contact patterns on
the timescale and final size of infectious disease epidemics. The abundance of
transitive relationships (the number of 3 cliques) in a network and the
variance of the degree distribution are shown to have large effects on the
number ultimately infected and how quickly the epidemic propagates. The network
model is based on a simple generalization of the configuration model, and
epidemic dynamics are modeled with a low dimensional system of ordinary
differential equations. Because of the simplicity of this model, we are able to
explore a large parameter space and characterize dynamics over a wide range of
network topologies. We find that the interaction between clustering and the
degree distribution is complex, and that clustering always slows down an
epidemic, but that simultaneously increasing clustering and variance of the
degree distribution can potentially increase final epidemic size. In contrast
to solutions for unclustered configuration model networks, we find that bond
percolation solutions for the final epidemic size are potentially biased if
they do not take variable infectious periods into account.
