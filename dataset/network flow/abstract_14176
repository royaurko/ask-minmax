We consider hot accretion onto a rapidly spinning neutron star (or any other
compact object with a surface). A radiative hot settling flow has been
discovered at low accretion rates in the early work by Medvedev & Narayan
(2001) and analytical solution has been presented. It was shown later that this
flow can match external medium smoothly, thus enforcing its physical
feasibility. Here we complete the study of the global structure of such hot
accretion by presenting the analytical solution for the boundary later, which
forms between the bulk of the flow and the stellar surface. We confirm our
results via full numerical solution of height-integrated two-temperature
hydrodynamic equations.
