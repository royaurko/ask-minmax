We investigate characteristic properties of the congested traffic states on a
30 km long stretch of the German freeway A5 north of Frankfurt/Main. Among the
approximately 245 breakdowns of traffic flow in 165 days, we have identified
five different kinds of spatio-temporal congestion patterns and their
combinations. Based on an "adaptive smoothing method" for the visualization of
detector data, we also discuss particular features of breakdowns such as the
"boomerang effect" which is a sign of linearly unstable traffic flow.
Controversial issues such as "synchronized flow" or stop-and-go waves are
addressed as well. Finally, our empirical results are compared with different
theoretical concepts and interpretations of congestion patterns, in particular
first- and second-order macroscopic traffic models.
