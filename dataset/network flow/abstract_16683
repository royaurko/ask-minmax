In the widely used 802.11 standard, the so called performance anomaly is a
well known issue. Several works have tried to solve this problem by introducing
mechanisms such as packet fragmentation, backoff adaptation, or packet
aggregation during a fixed time interval. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach solving the performance anomaly problem by packet aggregation using a
dynamic time interval, which depends on the busy time of the wireless medium.
Our solution differs from other proposition in the literature because of this
dynamic time interval, which allows increasing fairness, reactivity, and in
some cases efficiency. In this article, we emphasize the performance evaluation
of our proposal.
