Stochastic network calculus requires special care in the search of proper
stochastic traffic arrival models and stochastic service models. Tradeoff must
be considered between the feasibility for the analysis of performance bounds,
the usefulness of performance bounds, and the ease of their numerical
calculation. In theory, transform between different traffic arrival models and
transform between different service models are possible. Nevertheless, the
impact of the model transform on performance bounds has not been thoroughly
investigated. This paper is to investigate the effect of the model transform
and to provide practical guidance in the model selection in stochastic network
calculus.
