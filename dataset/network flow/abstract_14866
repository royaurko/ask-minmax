We consider the thermal production of dileptons and photons at temperatures
above the critical temperature in QCD. We use a model where color excitations
are suppressed by a small value of the Polyakov loop, the semi Quark-Gluon
Plasma (QGP). Comparing the semi-QGP to the perturbative QGP, we find a mild
enhancement of thermal dileptons. In contrast, to leading logarithmic order in
weak coupling there are far fewer hard photons from the semi-QGP than the usual
QGP. To illustrate the possible effects on photon and dileptons production in
heavy ion collisions, we integrate the rate with a realistic hydrodynamic
simulation. Dileptons uniformly exhibit a small flow, but the strong
suppression of photons in the semi-QGP tends to bias the elliptical flow of
photons to that generated in the hadronic phase.
