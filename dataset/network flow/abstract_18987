In many real applications that use and analyze networked data, the links in
the network graph may be erroneous, or derived from probabilistic techniques.
In such cases, the node classification problem can be challenging, since the
unreliability of the links may affect the final results of the classification
process. If the information about link reliability is not used explicitly, the
classification accuracy in the underlying network may be affected adversely. In
this paper, we focus on situations that require the analysis of the uncertainty
that is present in the graph structure. We study the novel problem of node
classification in uncertain graphs, by treating uncertainty as a first-class
citizen. We propose two techniques based on a Bayes model and automatic
parameter selection, and show that the incorporation of uncertainty in the
classification process as a first-class citizen is beneficial. We
experimentally evaluate the proposed approach using different real data sets,
and study the behavior of the algorithms under different conditions. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
