Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NDIS) monitor a network with the aim of
discerning malicious from benign activity on that network. While a wide range
of approaches have met varying levels of success, most IDS's rely on having
access to a database of known attack signatures which are written by security
experts. Nowadays, in order to solve problems with false positive alters,
correlation algorithms are used to add additional structure to sequences of IDS
alerts. However, such techniques are of no help in discovering novel attacks or
variations of known attacks, something the human immune system (HIS) is capable
of doing in its own specialised domain. This paper presents a novel immune
algorithm for application to an intrusion detection problem. The goal is to
discover packets containing novel variations of attacks covered by an existing
signature base.
