We performed a network traffic simulation to clarify the mechanism producing
self-similar traffic originating in the transport layer level. Self-similar
behavior could be observed without assuming a long-tailed distribution of the
input file size. By repeating simulations with modified TCP we found that the
feedback mechanism from the network, such as packet transmission driven by
acknowledgement packets, plays an essential role in explaining the
self-similarity observed in the actual traffic.
