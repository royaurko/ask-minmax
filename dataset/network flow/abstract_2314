Flow develops in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions via re-interactions
among partons or/and hadrons. Characterizing flow is a crucial step towards
understanding the formation of partonic matter. We review new measurements on
anisotropic flow, including v2 at large rapidity, v1, v4, and new ways of
addressing non-flow issues. We then show the self-consistency of the data and
characterize flow of pions, kaons, protons and Xi within the Blast Wave
parameterization. Finally, we show that the data currently available suggests
that flow develops at both partonic and hadronic stages.
