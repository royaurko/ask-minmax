The Skyrme potential energy density functional is introduced into the
Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model and the updated
version is applied to studying the directed and elliptic flows of light
particles (protons, neutrons, deuterons, tritons, $^3$He and $^4$He) in
$^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions at beam energies 150, 250 and 400 MeV/nucleon.
The results are compared with the recent FOPI experimental data. It is found
that the yields and collective flows of light particles can be described quite
well. The influence of the equation of state (EoS), medium-modified
nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections (NNECS) and cluster recognition criteria
on the directed and elliptic flows is studied in detail. It is found that the
flows of light particles are sensitive to the medium-modified NNECS, but not
sensitive to the isospin dependent cluster recognition criteria. It seems
difficult, however, even with the new data and calculations, to obtain a more
accurate constraint on the nuclear incompressibility $K_0$ than the interval
200-260 MeV.
