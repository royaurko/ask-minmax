Elementary, one- and two-point, Backlund transformations are constructed for
the generic case of the sl(2) Gaudin magnet. The spectrality property is used
to construct these explicitly given, Poisson integrable maps which are
time-discretizations of the continuous flows with any Hamiltonian from the
spectral curve of the 2x2 Lax matrix.
