The beta function of a two-dimensional massless Dirac Hamiltonian subject to
a random scalar potential, which e.g., underlies the theoretical description of
graphene, is computed numerically. Although it belongs to, from a symmetry
standpoint, the two-dimensional symplectic class, the beta function
monotonically increases with decreasing $g$. We also provide an argument based
on the spectral flows under twisting boundary conditions, which shows that none
of states of the massless Dirac Hamiltonian can be localized.
