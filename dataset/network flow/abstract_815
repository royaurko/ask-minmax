This article describes our strategy for deploying self-forming ad hoc
networks based on the Internet Protocol version 6 and evaluates the dynamics of
this proposal. Among others, we suggest a technique called adaptive routing
that provides secure intelligent routing capabilities to computer communication
networks. This technique uses the flow label, supports hybrid metrics, network
load sharing, and is not restricted to evaluation of performance on first hop
routers when making routing decisions. Selective anycasting is an extension to
the anycast addressing model that supports exclusion of members of groups that
perform poorly or inappropriately on a per-host basis. Distributed name lookup
is suggested for integrating self-forming and global networks where they
coexist. At last, we pose an address hierarchy to support unmanaged discovery
of services in unknown networks.
