We investigate the properties of the twist line defect in the critical 3d
Ising model using Monte Carlo simulations. In this model the twist line defect
is the boundary of a surface of frustrated links or, in a dual description, the
Wilson line of the Z2 gauge theory. We test the hypothesis that the twist line
defect flows to a conformal line defect at criticality and evaluate numerically
the low-lying spectrum of anomalous dimensions of the local operators which
live on the defect as well as mixed correlation functions of local operators in
the bulk and on the defect.
