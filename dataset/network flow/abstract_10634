Theory of complex networks proved successful in the description of a variety
of static networks ranging from biology to computer and social sciences and to
economics and finance. Here we use network models to describe the evolution of
a particular economic system, namely the International Trade Network (ITN).
Previous studies often assume that globalization and regionalization in
international trade are contradictory to each other. We re-examine the
relationship between globalization and regionalization by viewing the
international trade system as an interdependent complex network. We use the
modularity optimization method to detect communities and community cores in the
ITN during the years 1995-2011. We find rich dynamics over time both inter- and
intra-communities. Most importantly, we have a multilevel description of the
evolution where the global dynamics (i.e., communities disappear or reemerge)
tend to be correlated with the regional dynamics (i.e., community core changes
between community members). In particular, the Asia-Oceania community
disappeared and reemerged over time along with a switch in leadership from
Japan to China. Moreover, simulation results show that the global dynamics can
be generated by a preferential attachment mechanism both inter- and
intra-communities.
