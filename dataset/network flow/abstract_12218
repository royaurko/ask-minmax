Network coding and cooperative communication have received considerable
attention from the research community recently in order to mitigate the adverse
effects of fading in wireless transmissions and at the same time to achieve
high throughput and better spectral efficiency. In this work, we analyze a
network coding scheme for a cooperative communication setup with multiple
sources and destinations. The proposed protocol achieves the full diversity
order at the expense of a slightly reduced multiplexing rate compared to
existing schemes in the literature. We show that our scheme outperforms
conventional cooperation in terms of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff.
