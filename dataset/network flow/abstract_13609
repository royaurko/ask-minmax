We report part of our recent work on viscous hydrodynamics with consistent
phase space distribution $f(x,\p)$ for freeze out. We develop the gradient
expansion formalism based on kinetic theory, and with the constraints from the
comparison between hydrodynamics and kinetic theory, viscous corrections to
$f(x,\p)$ can be consistently determined order by order. Then with the obtained
$f(x,\p)$, second order viscous hydrodynamical calculations are carried out for
elliptic flow $v_2$.
