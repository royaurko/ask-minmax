In this paper we present a non-hydrostatic shallow water-type model
approximating the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes sytems with free
surface. The closure relations are obtained by a minimal energy constraint
instead of an asymptotic expansion. The model slightly differs from the
well-known Green-Naghdi model and is confronted with stationnary and analytical
solutions of the Euler system corresponding to rotational flows. In particular,
we give time-dependent analytical solutions for the Euler system that are also
analytical solutions for the proposed model but that are not solutions of the
Green-Naghdi model.
