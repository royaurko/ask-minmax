We propose a simple yet effective wireless network coding and decoding
technique. It utilizes spatial diversity through cooperation between nodes
which carry out distributed encoding operations dictated by generator matrices
of linear block codes. For this purpose, we make use of greedy codes over the
binary field and show that desired diversity orders can be flexibly assigned to
nodes in a multiple unicast network, contrary to the previous findings in the
literature. Furthermore, we present the optimal detection rule for the given
model that accounts for intermediate node errors and suggest a network decoder
using the sum-product algorithm. The proposed sum-product detector exhibits
near optimal performance.
