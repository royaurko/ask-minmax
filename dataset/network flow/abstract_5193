In confined magnetically ordered structures one can observe vortices of
magnetization and electromagnetic power flow vortices. There are topologically
distinct and robust states. In this paper we show that in a normally magnetized
quasi-2D ferrite disk there exist eigen power-flow-density vortices of
magnetic-dipolar-mode oscillations. Because of such circular power flows, the
oscillating modes are characterized by stable magnetostatic energy states and
discrete angular moments of the wave fields. We show that the
power-flow-density vortices of magnetostatic modes can be excited by
electromagnetic fields of a microwave cavity. There is a clear correspondence
between the power-flow-density vortex structures in a ferrite disk derived from
an analytical solution of the magnetostatic-wave spectral problem and obtained
by the numerical-simulation electromagnetic program.
