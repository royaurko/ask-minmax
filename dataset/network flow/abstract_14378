Given a smooth closed manifold M, the Morse-Witten complex associated to a
Morse function f and a Riemannian metric g on M consists of chain groups
generated by the critical points of f and a boundary operator counting isolated
flow lines of the negative gradient flow. Its homology reproduces singular
homology of M. The geometric approach presented here was developed in [We-93]
and is based on tools from hyperbolic dynamical systems. For instance, we apply
the Grobman-Hartman theorem and the Lambda-Lemma (Inclination Lemma) to analyze
compactness and define gluing for the moduli space of flow lines.
