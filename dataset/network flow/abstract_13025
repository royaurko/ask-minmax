We construct a new harmonic family: dielectric flow solutions with maximal
supersymmetry in eleven-dimensional supergravity. These solutions are
asymptotically AdS_4 x S^7, while in the infra-red the M2 branes are
dielectrically polarized into M5 branes. These solutions are holographically
dual to vacua of the mass deformed theory on M2 branes. They also provide an
interesting insight on the supergravity solutions sourced by giant gravitons,
allowing one to see how supergravity solves the giant graviton puzzle.
