In this paper a subset of High-Dimensional Random Apollonian networks, that
we called Wheel Random Apollonian Graphs (WRAG), is considered. We show how to
generate a Wheel Random Apollonian Graph from a wheel graph. We analyse some
basic graph properties like vertices and edges cardinality, some question
concerning cycles and the chromaticity in such type of graphs, we suggest
further work on this type of graphs.
