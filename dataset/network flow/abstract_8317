We consider a simple network, where a source and destination node are
connected with a line of erasure channels. It is well known that in order to
achieve the min-cut capacity, the intermediate nodes are required to process
the information. We propose coding schemes for this setting, and discuss each
scheme in terms of complexity, delay, achievable rate, memory requirement, and
adaptability to unknown channel parameters. We also briefly discuss how these
schemes can be extended to more general networks.
