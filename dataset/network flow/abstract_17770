In this paper, I present a summary on some works that utilized static
analysis techniques for understanding biological systems. Control flow
analysis, context dependent analysis, and other techniques were employed to
investigate the properties of BioAmbients. In this summary report, I tried to
introduce the ideas and explain the techniques used in the subject papers. This
summary will highlight the biological concepts of BioAmbients.
