The Scaling of microchip technologies, from micron to submicron and now to
deep sub-micron (DSM) range, has enabled large scale systems-on-chip (SoC). In
future deep submicron (DSM) designs, the interconnect effect will definitely
dominate performance. Network-on-Chip (NoC) has become a promising solution to
bus-based communication infrastructure limitations. NoC designs usually targets
Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), however, the fabrication
process costs a lot. Implementing a NoC on an FPGA does not only reduce the
cost but also decreases programming and verification cycles. In this paper, an
Asynchronous NoC has been implemented on a SPARTAN-3E\textregistered device.
The NoC supports basic transactions of both widely used on-chip interconnection
standards, the Open Core Protocol (OCP) and the WISHBONE Protocol. Although,
FPGA devices are synchronous in nature, it has been shown that they can be used
to prototype a Global Asynchronous Local Synchronous (GALS) systems, comprising
an Asynchronous NoC connecting IP cores operating in different clock domains.
