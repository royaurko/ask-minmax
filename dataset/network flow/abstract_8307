We study the reaction-diffusion process $A + B \to \emptyset$ on uncorrelated
scale-free networks analytically. By a mean-field ansatz we derive analytical
expressions for the particle pair-correlations and the particle density.
Expressing the time evolution of the particle density in terms of the
instantaneous particle pair-correlations, we determine analytically the
`jamming' effect which arises in the case of multicomponent, pair-wise
reactions. Comparing the relevant terms within the differential equation for
the particle density, we find that the `jamming' effect diminishes in the
long-time, low-density limit. This even holds true for the hubs of the network,
despite that the hubs dynamically attract the particles.
