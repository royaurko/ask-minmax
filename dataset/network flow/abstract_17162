Consider individuals interacting in social network and a response that can be
measured on each individual. We are interested in making inferences on a
population quantity that is a function of both the response and the social
interactions. In this paper, working within Rubin's inferential framework, we
introduce a new notion of non-ignorable sampling design for the case of missing
covariates. This notion is the key element for developing valid inferences in
applications to epidemiology and healthcare in which hard-to-reach populations
are sampled using link-tracing designs, including respondent-driven sampling,
that carry information about the quantify of interest.
