Many networks do not live in isolation but are strongly interacting, with
profound consequences on their dynamics. Here, we consider the case of two
interacting social networks and, in the context of a simple model, we address
the case of political elections. Each network represents a competing party and
every agent on the election day can choose to be either active in one of the
two networks (vote for the corresponding party) or to be inactive in both (not
vote). The opinion dynamics during the election campaign is described through a
simulated annealing algorithm. We find that for a large region of the parameter
space the result of the competition between the two parties allows for the
existence of pluralism in the society, where both parties have a finite share
of the votes. The central result is that a densely connected social network is
key for the final victory of a party. However, small committed minorities can
play a crucial role, and even reverse the election outcome.
