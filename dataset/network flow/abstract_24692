In this paper, we propose a generic technique to model temporal dependencies
and sequences using a combination of a recurrent neural network and a Deep
Belief Network. Our technique, RNN-DBN, is an amalgamation of the memory state
of the RNN that allows it to provide temporal information and a multi-layer DBN
that helps in high level representation of the data. This makes RNN-DBNs ideal
for sequence generation. Further, the use of a DBN in conjunction with the RNN
makes this model capable of significantly more complex data representation than
an RBM. We apply this technique to the task of polyphonic music generation.
