Policy-based management (PBM) is being used as technological solution on the
managing and controlling complex networks and systems. One of the most
important issues involved in the life-cycle of PBM is the policies creation
because the future decisions made by the management system depend on this, and
therefore, the network behavior. In this paper we present a novel model for
creating management policies in telecommunications networks. We propose a model
which includes a Policy Creation Process, Actors, Policy Abstraction Levels and
a Procedure for Creating Policies. An implementation of the proposed model over
the Technology Division at University of Cauca is included.
