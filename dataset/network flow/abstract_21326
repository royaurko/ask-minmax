In this report, we propose a technique using negotiation based on multi-agent
system (MAS) in the context of cognitive radio network (CRN). The agents are
particularly suited to provide responsive solutions to complex problems such as
the negotiation of the spectrum in CRN. We have implemented our proposed
solution with JADE (Java Agent Development Framework) and we have also evaluate
the proposed solution to show its interest.
