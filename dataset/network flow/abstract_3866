We introduce a series of generalized clustering coefficients based on String
formalism given by Aoyama, using adjacent matrix in networks. We numerically
evaluate Milgram condition proposed in order to explore q-th degrees of
separation in scale free networks and small world networks. We find that scale
free network with exponent 3 just shows 6-degrees of separation. Moreover we
find some relations between separation numbers and generalized clustering
coefficient in both networks.
