Increase in the speed of processors has led to crucial role of communication
in the performance of systems. As a result, routing is taken into consideration
as one of the most important subjects of the Network on Chip architecture.
Routing algorithms to deadlock avoidance prevent packets route completely based
on network traffic condition by means of restricting the route of packets. This
action leads to less performance especially in non-uniform traffic patterns. On
the other hand True Fully Adoptive Routing algorithm provides routing of
packets completely based on traffic condition. However, deadlock detection and
recovery mechanisms are needed to handle deadlocks. Use of global bus beside
NoC as a parallel supportive environment, provide platform to offer advantages
of both features of bus and NoC. This bus is useful for broadcast and multicast
operations, sending delay sensitive signals, system management and other
services. In this research, we use this bus as an escaping path for deadlock
recovery technique. According to simulation results, this bus is suitable
platform for deadlock recovery technique.
