We consider a stationary Mean Field Games system defined on a network. In
this framework, the transition conditions at the vertices play a crucial role:
the ones here considered are based on the optimal control interpretation of the
problem. We prove separately the well-posedness for each of the two equations
composing the system. Finally, we prove existence and uniqueness of the
solution of the Mean Field Games system.
