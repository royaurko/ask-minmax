A computer simulation model is used to study the density profile and flow of
a miscible gaseous fluid mixture consisting of differing constituent masses
($m_A = m_B/3$) through an open matrix. The density profile is found to decay
with the height $\propto \exp(-m_{A(B)}h)$, consistent with the barometric
height law. The flux density shows a power-law increase $\propto
{(p_c-p)}^{\mu}$ with $\mu \simeq 2.3$ at the porosity $1-p$ above the pore
percolation threshold $1-p_c$
