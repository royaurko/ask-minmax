We discuss the leading particle spectra and diffractive mass spectra from the
novel point of view, namely by treating them as particular examples of the
general energy flow phenomena taking place in the multiparticle production
processes. We argue that they show a high degree of universality what allows
for their simple description in terms of the Interacting Gluon Model developed
by us some time ago.
