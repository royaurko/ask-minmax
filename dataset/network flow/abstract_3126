In this paper, we investigate the factors that affect the synchronization of
coupled oscillators on networks. By using the edge-intercrossing method, we
keep the degree distribution unchanged to see other statistical properties'
effects on network's synchronizability. By optimizing the eigenratio $R$ of the
coupling matrix with \textit{Memory Tabu Search} (MTS), we observe that a
network with lower degree of clustering, without modular structure and
displaying disassortative connecting pattern may be easy to synchronize.
Moreover, the optimal network contains fewer small-size loops. The optimization
process on scale-free network strongly suggests that the heterogeneity plays
the main role in determining the synchronizability.
