We consider a standard \textit{susceptible-infected-susceptible} (SIS) model
to study behaviors of steady states of epidemic spreading in small-world
networks. Using analytical methods and large scale simulations, we recover the
usual epidemic behavior with a critical threshold $\lambda_{c}$ below which
infectious diseases die out. Whereas for the spreading rate $\lambda$ far above
$\lambda_{c}$, it was found that the density of infected individuals $\rho$ as
a function of $\lambda$ has the property $\rho \approx F(K)(\ln \lambda - \ln
\lambda_{c})$.
