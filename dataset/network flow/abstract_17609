Development and interaction of starting vortices initiated by Dielectric
Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuators in quiescent air are illustrated in
the attached fluid dynamics videos. These include a series of smoke flow
visualisations, showing the starting vortices moving parallel or normal to the
wall at several different actuator configurations.
