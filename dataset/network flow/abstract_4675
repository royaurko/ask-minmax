We give the complete classification of regular projectively Anosov flows on
closed three-dimensional manifolds. More precisely, we show that such a flow
must be either an Anosov flow or decomposed into a finite union of $T^2 \times
I$-models. We also apply our method to rigidity problems of some group actions.
