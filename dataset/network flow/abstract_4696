The first measurement of the elliptic transverse flow for multi-strange
baryons Xi and Omega in high energy heavy ion collisions is presented, which
may indicate the presence of partonic collectivity. A hydrodynamically inspired
model fit to the transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow of Xi- and
AntiXi+ indicates that these particles might be emitted from the system at a
high temperature (~150 MeV) with significant radial transverse flow and that
the emitting system is spatially asymmetric.
