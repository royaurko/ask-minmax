The use of under-utilized Internet resources is widely recognized as a viable
form of high performance computing. Sustained processing power of roughly 40T
FLOPS using 4 million volunteered Internet hosts has been reported for
embarrassingly parallel problems. At the same time, peer-to-peer (P2P) file
sharing networks, with more than 50 million participants, have demonstrated the
capacity for scale in distributed systems. This paper contributes a study of
load balancing techniques for a general class of loosely-synchronous parallel
algorithms when executed over a P2P network. We show that decentralized,
diffusive load balancing can be effective at balancing load and is facilitated
by the dynamic properties of P2P. While a moderate degree of dynamicity can
benefit load balancing, significant dynamicity hinders the parallel program
performance due to the need for increased load migration. To the best of our
knowledge this study provides new insight into the performance of
loosely-synchronous parallel programs over the Internet.
