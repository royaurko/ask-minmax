Given a budget and arbitrary cost for selecting each node, the budgeted
influence maximization (BIM) problem concerns selecting a set of seed nodes to
disseminate some information that maximizes the total number of nodes
influenced (termed as influence spread) in social networks at a total cost no
more than the budget. Our proposed seed selection algorithm for the BIM problem
guarantees an approximation ratio of (1 - 1/sqrt(e)). The seed selection
algorithm needs to calculate the influence spread of candidate seed sets, which
is known to be #P-complex. Identifying the linkage between the computation of
marginal probabilities in Bayesian networks and the influence spread, we devise
efficient heuristic algorithms for the latter problem. Experiments using both
large-scale social networks and synthetically generated networks demonstrate
superior performance of the proposed algorithm with moderate computation costs.
Moreover, synthetic datasets allow us to vary the network parameters and gain
important insights on the impact of graph structures on the performance of
different algorithms.
