The domain of definition of the divergence operator \delta on an abstract
Wiener space (W, H, \mu) is extended to include W-valued and W\otimesW-valued
"integrands". The main properties and characterizations of this extension are
derived and it is shown that in some sense the added elements in \delta's
extended domain have divergence zero. These results are then applied to the
analysis of quasiinvariant flows induced by W-valued vector fields and, among
other results, it turns out that these divergence-free vector fields "are
responsible" for generating measure preserving flows.
