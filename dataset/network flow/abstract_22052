We report numerical simulations of one-dimensional cellular solutions of the
stabilized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. This equation offers a range of
generic behavior in pattern-forming instabilities of moving interfaces, such as
a host of secondary instabilities or transition toward disorder. We compare
some of these collective behaviors to those observed in experiments. In
particular, destabilization scenarios of bifurcated states are studied in a
spatially semi-extended situation, which is common in realistic patterns, but
has been barely explored so far.
