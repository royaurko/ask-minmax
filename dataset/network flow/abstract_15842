In opportunistic networks the existence of a simultaneous path is not assumed
to transmit a message between a sender and a receiver. Information about the
context in which the users communicate is a key piece of knowledge to design
efficient routing protocols in opportunistic networks. But this kind of
information is not always available. When users are very isolated, context
information cannot be distributed, and cannot be used for taking efficient
routing decisions. In such cases, context oblivious based schemes are only way
to enable communication between users. As soon as users become more social,
context data spreads in the network, and context based routing becomes an
efficient solution. In this paper we design an integrated routing protocol that
is able to use context data as soon as it becomes available and falls back to
dissemination based routing when context information is not available. Then, we
provide a comparison between Epidemic and PROPHET, these are representative of
context oblivious and context aware routing protocols. Our results show that
integrated routing protocol is able to provide better result in term of message
delivery probability and message delay in both cases when context information
about users is available or not.
