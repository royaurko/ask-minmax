We introduce an elementary model of a turbulent boundary layer over a flat
surface, given as a vertical random distribution of spanwise Lamb-Oseen vortex
configurations placed over a non-slip boundary condition line. We are able to
reproduce several important features of realistic flows, such as the viscous
and logarithmic boundary sublayers, and the general behavior of the first
statistical moments (turbulent intensity, skewness and flatness) of the
streamwise velocity fluctuations. As an application, we advance some heuristic
considerations on the boundary layer underlying kinematics that could be
associated with the phenomenon of drag reduction by polymers, finding a
suggestive support from its experimental signatures.
