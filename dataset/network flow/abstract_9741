Operators perceive programmable networks brought by Software Defined Networks
(SDN) as cornerstone to decrease the time to deploy new services, to augment
the flexibility and to adapt network resources to customer needs at runtime.
However, despite the vulnerabilities identified due that the intelligence is
centralized on SDN, its research is more centered on forwarding traffic and
reconfiguration issues, not considering to a great extent the fault management
aspects of the control plane. This paper provides SDN with fault management
capabilities by using autonomic principles like self-healing mechanisms. We
propose a generic self-healing approach that relies on a Bayesian Networks for
the diagnosis block and we applied this algorithm to a centralized SDN
infrastructure to prove its functioning in the presence of faults.
