The flow equation method (Wegner 1994) is used as continuous unitary
transformation to construct perturbatively effective Hamiltonians. The method
is illustrated in detail for dimerized and frustrated antiferromagnetic S=1/2
chains. The effective Hamiltonians conserve the number of elementary
excitations which are S=1 magnons for the dimerized chains. The sectors of
different number of excitations are clearly separated. Easy-to-use results for
the gap, the dispersion and the ground state energies of the chains are
provided.
