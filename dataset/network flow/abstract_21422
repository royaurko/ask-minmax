The far-infrared emission from rich galaxy clusters is investigated. Maps
have been obtained by ISO at 60, 100, 135, and 200 microns using the PHT-C
camera. Ground based imaging and spectroscopy were also acquired. Here we
present the results for the cooling flow cluster Sersic 159-03. An infrared
source coincident with the dominant cD galaxy is found. Some off-center sources
are also present, but without any obvious counterparts.
