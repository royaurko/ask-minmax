Motivated by applications in network epidemiology, we consider the problem of
determining whether it is possible to delete at most $k$ edges from a given
input graph (of small treewidth) so that the maximum component size in the
resulting graph is at most $h$. While this problem is NP-complete in general,
we provide evidence that many of the real-world networks of interest are likely
to have small treewidth, and we describe an algorithm which solves the problem
in time $O((wh)^{2w}n)$ on an input graph having $n$ vertices and whose
treewidth is bounded by a fixed constant $w$.
