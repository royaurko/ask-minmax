The flux lattice driven by a uniform driving force in a superconductor with
hot, strong, sharp and randomly distributed pinning centers, with applied
magnetic field half the matching field is simulated. At low temperature both a
non activated regime, where flux motion occurs within a robust percolative flux
flow channel, and an activated regime are obtained depending on the sample
preparation. These two regimes exhibit distinct resistivity and magnetic
induction. In the non activated regime, a clear fingerprint is observed in the
autocorrelation function of the longitudinal resitivity, which oscillates at a
frequency close to the inverse lattice diffusion time.
