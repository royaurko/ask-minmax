We propose a two-fold approach to model reduction of fluid-structure
interaction. The state equations for the fluid are solved with reduced basis
methods. These are model reduction methods for parametric partial differential
equations using well-chosen snapshot solutions in order to build a set of
global basis functions. The other reduction is in terms of the geometric
complexity of the moving fluid-structure interface. We use free-form
deformations to parameterize the perturbation of the flow channel at rest
configuration. As a computational example we consider a steady fluid-structure
interaction problem: an incmpressible Stokes flow in a channel that has a
flexible wall.
