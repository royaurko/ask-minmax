The cellular automata (CA) approach to traffic modeling is extended to allow
for spatially homogeneous steady state solutions that cover a two dimensional
region in the flow-density plane. Hence these models fulfill a basic postulate
of a three-phase traffic theory proposed by Kerner. This is achieved by a
synchronization distance, within which a vehicle always tries to adjust its
speed to the one of the vehicle in front. In the CA models presented, the
modelling of the free and safe speeds, the slow-to-start rules as well as some
contributions to noise are based on the ideas of the Nagel-Schreckenberg type
modelling. It is shown that the proposed CA models can be very transparent and
still reproduce the two main types of congested patterns (the general pattern
and the synchronized flow pattern) as well as their dependence on the flows
near an on-ramp, in qualitative agreement with the recently developed continuum
version of the three-phase traffic theory [B. S. Kerner and S. L. Klenov. 2002.
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35, L31]. These features are qualitatively different
than in previously considered CA traffic models. The probability of the
breakdown phenomenon (i.e., of the phase transition from free flow to
synchronized flow) as function of the flow rate to the on-ramp and of the flow
rate on the road upstream of the on-ramp is investigated. The capacity drops at
the on-ramp which occur due to the formation of different congested patterns
are calculated.
