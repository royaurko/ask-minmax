This work considers relay assisted transmission for multiuser networks when
the relay has no access to the codebooks used by the transmitters. The relay is
called oblivious for this reason. Of particular interest is the generalized
compress-and-forward (GCF) strategy, where the destinations jointly decode the
compression indices and the transmitted messages, and their optimality in this
setting. The relay-to-destination links are assumed to be out-of-band with
finite capacity. Two models are investigated: the multiple access relay channel
(MARC) and the interference relay channel (IFRC). For the MARC with an
oblivious relay, a new outerbound is derived and it is shown to be tight by
means of achievability of the capacity region using GCF scheme. For the IFRC
with an oblivious relay, a new strong interference condition is established,
under which the capacity region is found by deriving a new outerbound and
showing that it is achievable using GCF scheme. The result is further extended
to establish the capacity region of M-user MARC with an oblivious relay, and
multicast networks containing M sources and K destinations with an oblivious
relay.
