One of the most important challenges in the integration of renewable energy
sources into the power grid lies in their `intermittent' nature. The power
output of sources like wind and solar varies with time and location due to
factors that cannot be controlled by the provider. Two strategies have been
proposed to hedge against this variability: 1) use energy storage systems to
effectively average the produced power over time; 2) exploit distributed
generation to effectively average production over location. We introduce a
network model to study the optimal use of storage and transmission resources in
the presence of random energy sources. We propose a Linear-Quadratic based
methodology to design control strategies, and we show that these strategies are
asymptotically optimal for some simple network topologies. For these
topologies, the dependence of optimal performance on storage and transmission
capacity is explicitly quantified.
