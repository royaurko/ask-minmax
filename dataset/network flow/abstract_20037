In this paper, we find various analytic (1+3)D solutions to relativistic
ideal hydrodynamic equations based on embedding of known low-dimensional
scaling solutions. We first study a class of flows with 2D Hubble Embedding,
for which a single ordinary differential equation for the remaining velocity
field can be derived. Using this equation, all solutions with transverse 2D
Hubble embedding and power law ansatz for the remaining longitudinal velocity
field will be found. Going beyond the power law ansatz, we further find a few
solutions with transverse 2D Hubble embedding and nontrivial longitudinal
velocity field. Finally we investigate general scaling flows with each
component of the velocity fields scaling independently, for which we also find
all possible solutions. Possible physical relevance of these solutions will be
discussed.
