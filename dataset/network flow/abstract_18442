Subgraphs are very important for understanding structure and function of
complex networks. Dyad and triad are the elementary subgraphs. We focus on the
distribution of their act degree defined as the number of activities, events or
organizations they join, which indicates the importance of the subgraphs. The
empirical studies show that, in a lot of real world systems, the dyad or triad
act degree distributions follow "shifted power law" (SPL), where {\alpha} and
{\gamma} are constants. We defined a "heterogeneity index", H, to describe how
it is uneven and analytically deduced the correlation between H and {\alpha}
and {\gamma}. This manuscript, which shows the details of the empirical
studies, serves as an online supplement of a paper submitted to a journal.
