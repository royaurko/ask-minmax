We show that the mesoscopic and transport characteristics of networks follow
the same trends for the same type of the shear ruptures in terms of rupture
speed while also comparing the results of three different friction
experiments.The classified fronts obtained from a saw cut Westerly granite
fault regarding friction network parameters show a clear separation into two
groups indicating two different rupture fronts. With respect to the scaling of
local ruptures durations with the networks parameters we show that the gap is
related to the possibility of a separation between slow and regular fronts.
