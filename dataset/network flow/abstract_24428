In recent wireless networking optical communication is an emerging field.
Another novel approach of optical communication using Narrow Line of Sight
technique is discussed. Array of trans receivers are placed on the ceiling to
communicate with the mobile nodes (users / trans receivers) instead of a single
transmitter. An intelligent position tracking technique based on the
informations available from prepositioned sensors and using them in simple
geometric equations is described. Intelligent cell concept is used to
facilitate the tracking system. The whole wide area is divided into several sub
areas and some of the sub areas are designated as boundary sub areas which hold
the data regarding the movement of the mobile nodes. The Diffie Hellman simple
authenticated key agreement is used for secure communication.
