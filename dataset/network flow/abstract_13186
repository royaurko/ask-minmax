We introduce two simple two-dimensional lattice models to study traffic flow
in cities. We have found that a few basic elements give rise to the
characteristic phase diagram of a first-order phase transition from a freely
moving phase to a jammed state, with a critical point. The jammed phase
presents new transitions corresponding to structural transformations of the
jam. We discuss their relevance in the infinite size limit.
