Online Social Networking is a fascinating phenomena, attracting more than one
billion people. It supports basic human needs such as communication,
socializing with others and reputation building. Thus, an in-depth
understanding of user behavior in Online Social Networks (OSNs) can provide
major insights into human behavior, and impacts design choices of social
platforms and applications. However, researchers have only limited access to
behavioral data. As a consequence of this limitation, user behavior in OSNs as
well as its development in recent years are still not deeply understood.
  In this paper, we present a study about user behavior on the most popular
OSN, Facebook, with 2071 participants from 46 countries. We elaborate how
Facebookers orchestrate the offered functions to achieve individual benefit in
2014 and evaluate user activity changes from 2009 till 2014 to understand the
development of user behavior. Inter alia, we focus on the most important
functionality, the newsfeed, to understand content sharing amongst users. We
(i) yield a better understanding on content sharing and consumption and (ii)
refine behavioral assumptions in the literature to improve the performance of
alternative social platforms. Furthermore, we (iii) contribute evidence to the
discussion of Facebook to be an aging network.
