We present the station-based unfair access problem among the uplink and the
downlink stations in the IEEE 802.11e infrastructure Basic Service Set (BSS)
when the default settings of the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA)
parameters are used. We discuss how the transport layer protocol
characteristics alleviate the unfairness problem. We design a simple,
practical, and standard-compliant framework to be employed at the Access Point
(AP) for fair and efficient access provisioning. A dynamic measurement-based
EDCA parameter adaptation block lies in the core of this framework. The
proposed framework is unique in the sense that it considers the characteristic
differences of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol
(UDP) flows and the coexistence of stations with varying bandwidth or
Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Via simulations, we show that our
solution provides short- and long-term fair access for all stations in the
uplink and downlink employing TCP and UDP flows with non-uniform packet rates
in a wired-wireless heterogeneous network. In the meantime, the QoS
requirements of coexisting real-time flows are also maintained.
