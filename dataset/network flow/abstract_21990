We discuss mechanisms related to isospin transport in central collisions
between neutron-rich systems at Fermi energies. A fully consistent study of the
isospin distillation and expansion dynamics in two-component systems is
presented in the framework of a stochastic transport theory. We analyze
correlations between fragment observables, focusing on the study of the average
N/Z of fragments, as a function of their kinetic energy. We identify an
EOS-dependent relation between these observables, allowing to better
characterize the fragmentation path and to access new information on the low
density behavior of the symmetry energy.
