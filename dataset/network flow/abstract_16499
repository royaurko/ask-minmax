We investigate the transition to Self Organized Criticality in a
two-dimensional model of a flux tube with a background flow. The magnetic
induction equation, represented by a partial differential equation with a
stochastic source term, is discretized and implemented on a two dimensional
cellular automaton. The energy released by the automaton during one relaxation
event is the magnetic energy. As a result of the simulations we obtain the time
evolution of the energy release, of the system control parameter, of the event
lifetime distribution and of the event size distribution, respectively, and we
establish that a Self Organized Critical state is indeed reached by the system.
Moreover, energetic initial impulses in the magnetohydrodynamic flow can lead
to one dimensional signatures in the magnetic two dimensional system, once the
Self Organized Critical regime is established. The applications of the model
for the study of Gamma Ray Bursts is briefly considered, and it is shown that
some astrophysical parameters of the bursts, like the light curves, the maximum
released energy, and the number of peaks in the light curve can be reproduced
and explained, at least on a qualitative level, by working in a framework in
which the systems settles in a Self Organized Critical state via magnetic
reconnection processes in the magnetized Gamma Ray Burst fireball.
