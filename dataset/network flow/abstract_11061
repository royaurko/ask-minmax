Understanding of how protein interaction networks (PIN) of living organisms
have evolved or are organized can be the first stepping stone in unveiling how
life works on a fundamental ground. Here we introduce a hybrid network model
composed of the yeast PIN and the protein family interaction network. The
essential ingredient of the model includes the protein family identity and its
robustness under evolution, as well as the three previously proposed ones: gene
duplication, divergence, and mutation. We investigate diverse structural
properties of our model with parameter values relevant to yeast, finding that
the model successfully reproduces the empirical data.
