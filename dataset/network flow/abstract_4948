Measuring local velocities or entire flow rates in liquid metals or
semiconductor melts is a notorious problem in many industrial applications,
including metal casting and silicon crystal growth. We present a new variant of
an old technique which relies on the continuous tracking of a flow-advected
transient eddy current that is induced by a pulsed external magnetic field.
This calibration-free method is validated by applying it to the velocity of a
spinning disk made of aluminum. First tests at a rig with a flow of liquid
GaInSn are also presented.
