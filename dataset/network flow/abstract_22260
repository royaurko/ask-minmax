We make a model-independent measurement of the moment of inertia of a
rotating, expanding strongly-interacting Fermi gas. Quenching of the moment of
inertia is observed for energies both below and above the superfluid
transition. This shows that a strongly interacting Fermi gas with angular
momentum can support irrotational flow in both the superfluid and collisional
normal fluid regimes.
