We show that if a Finsler metric on $S^2$ with reversibility $r$ has flag
curvatures $K$ satisfying $(\frac{r}{r+1})^2 <K \leq 1$, then closed geodesics
with specific contact-topological properties cannot exist, in particular there
are no closed geodesics with precisely one transverse self-intersection point.
This is a special case of a more general phenomenon, and other closed geodesics
with many self-intersections are also excluded. We provide examples of Randers
type, obtained by suitably modifying the metrics constructed by Katok
\cite{katok}, proving that this pinching condition is sharp. Our methods are
borrowed from the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectizations.
Finally, we study global dynamical aspects of 3-dimensional energy levels
$C^2$-close to $S^3$.
