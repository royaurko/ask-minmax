Mobile Ad-hoc Network is a temporary network which is the cooperative
engagement of a collection of standalone mobile nodes that are not connected to
any external network. It is a decentralized network where mobile nodes can be
easily deployed in almost any environment without sophisticated infrastructure
support. An empirical study has been done for AODV routing protocol under
single channel and multi channel environment using the tool NS2. To compare the
performance of AODV in the two environments, the simulation results have been
analyzed by graphical manner and trace file based on QoS metrics such as
throughput, packet drop, delay and jitter. The simulation result analysis
verifies the AODV routing protocol performances for single channel and multi
channel. After the analysis of the simulation scenario we suggest that use of
Parallel MAC (P-MAC) may enhance the performance for multi channel.
