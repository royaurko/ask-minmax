Integration Adapters are a fundamental part of an integration system, since
they provide (business) applications access to its messaging channel. However,
their modeling and configuration remain under-represented. In previous work,
the integration control and data flow syntax and semantics have been expressed
in the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) as a semantic model for
message-based integration, while adapter and the related quality of service
modeling were left for further studies.
  In this work we specify common adapter capabilities and derive general
modeling patterns, for which we define a compliant representation in BPMN. The
patterns extend previous work by the adapter flow, evaluated syntactically and
semantically for common adapter characteristics.
