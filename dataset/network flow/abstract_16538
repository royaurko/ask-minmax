A perceptron with N random weights can store of the order of N patterns
by removing a fraction of the weights without changing their strengths. The
critical storage capacity as a function of the concentration of the remaining
bonds for random outputs and for outputs given by a teacher perceptron is
calculated. A simple Hebb-like dilution algorithm is presented which in the
teacher case reaches the optimal generalization ability.
