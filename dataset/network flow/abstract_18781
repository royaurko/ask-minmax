This paper considers the analysis and optimization of a frequency-hopping ad
hoc network with a finite number of mobiles and finite spatial extent. The
mobiles communicate using coded continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK)
modulation. The performance of the system is a function of the number of
hopping channels, the rate of the error-correction code, and the modulation
index used by the CPFSK modulation. For a given channel model and density of
mobiles, these parameters are jointly optimized by maximizing the
(modulation-constrained) transmission capacity, which is a measure of the
spatial spectral efficiency of the system. The transmission capacity of the
finite network is found by using a recent expression for the spatially averaged
outage probability in the presence of Nakagami fading, which is found in closed
form in the absence of shadowing and can be solved using numerical integration
in the presence of shadowing.
