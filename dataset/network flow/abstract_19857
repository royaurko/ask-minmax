Accretion driven millisecond X-ray pulsars can accrete over a wide range of
mass flow rates. The pulsations persist even at small accretion rates at which
these objects would be expected to be in the propeller stage. We argue that the
inner regions of disks around millisecond X-ray pulsars are sufficiently thick
that a fraction of the inflowing matter can accrete even in the spin-down
regime from regions of the disk away from the disk plane. This allows these
systems to be bright throughout a wide range of mass flow rates. We model the
lightcurve of SAX J1808.4-3658 during an outburst and show that the rapid decay
stage can be modeled with fractional accretion in the spin-down regime.
