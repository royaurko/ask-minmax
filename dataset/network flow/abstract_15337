The directed polymerization of actin networks is an essential element of many
biological processes, including cell migration. Different theoretical models
considering the interplay between the underlying processes of polymerization,
capping and branching have resulted in conflicting predictions. One of the main
reasons for this discrepancy is the assumption of a branching reaction that is
either first order (autocatalytic) or zeroth order in the number of existing
filaments. Here we introduce a unifying framework from which the two
established scenarios emerge as limiting cases for low and high filament
number. A smooth transition between the two cases is found at intermediate
conditions. We also derive a threshold for the capping rate, above which
autocatalytic growth is predicted at sufficiently low filament number. Below
the threshold, zeroth order characteristics are predicted to dominate the
dynamics of the network for all accessible filament numbers. Together, this
allows cells to grow stable actin networks over a large range of different
conditions.
