Networks of weakly nonlinear oscillators are considered with diffusive and
time-delayed coupling. Averaging theory is used to determine parameter ranges
for which the network experiences amplitude death, whereby oscillations are
quenched and the equilibrium solution has a large domain of attraction. The
amplitude death is shown to be a common phenomenon, which can be observed
regardless of the precise nature of the nonlinearities and under very general
coupling conditions. In addition, when the network consists of dissimilar
oscillators, there exist parameter values for which only parts of the network
are suppressed. Sufficient conditions are derived for total and partial
amplitude death in arbitrary network topologies with general nonlinearities,
coupling coefficients, and connection delays.
