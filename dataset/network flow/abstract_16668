In ISNN'04, a novel symmetric cipher was proposed, by combining a chaotic
signal and a clipped neural network (CNN) for encryption. The present paper
analyzes the security of this chaotic cipher against chosen-plaintext attacks,
and points out that this cipher can be broken by a chosen-plaintext attack.
Experimental analyses are given to support the feasibility of the proposed
attack.
