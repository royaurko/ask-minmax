In this paper, we prove the existence of classical solutions of the Dirichlet
problem for a class of quasi-linear elliptic equations on unbounded domains
like a cone or a U-type domain. This problem comes from the study of mean
curvature flow and its generalization, the flow by powers of mean curvature.
Our approach is a modified version of the classical Perron method, where the
solutions to the minimal surface equation are used as sub-solutions and a
family auxiliary functions are constructed as super-solutions.
