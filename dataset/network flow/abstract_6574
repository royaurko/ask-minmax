Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the dominant reliable transport
protocol utilized in the Internet. Improving the performance of TCP associated
with the presence of multi-hop is one of the research challenges in wireless
mesh networks. Wireless mesh networks have large round trip time variations and
these variations are dependent on the number of hops. In wireless mesh network,
when congestion loss and wireless loss are co-existed the number of packets
dropped increases and will have adverse effects on TCP and its congestion
control mechanism which leads to low throughput. Here we have designed a new
TCP scheme for multi-hop wireless mesh networks, by modifying the sender side
congestion control functionality of TCP NewReno, which is tuned towards
improving the performance of TCP. The simulation results show that TCP SAC has
higher performance than TCP NewReno, Reno, Sack and Vegas in multi-hop wireless
mesh networks.
