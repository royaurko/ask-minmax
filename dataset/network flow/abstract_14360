The renormalization group equations of two-dimensional sigma models describe
geometric deformations of their target space when the world-sheet length
changes scale from the ultra-violet to the infra-red. These equations, which
are also known in the mathematics literature as Ricci flows, are analyzed for
the particular case of two-dimensional target spaces, where they are found to
admit a systematic description as Toda system. Their zero curvature formulation
is made possible with the aid of a novel infinite dimensional Lie algebra,
which has anti-symmetric Cartan kernel and exhibits exponential growth. The
general solution is obtained in closed form using Backlund transformations, and
special examples include the sausage model and the decay process of conical
singularities to the plane. Thus, Ricci flows provide a non-linear
generalization of the heat equation in two dimensions with the same dissipative
properties. Various applications to dynamical problems of string theory are
also briefly discussed. Finally, we outline generalizations to higher
dimensional target spaces that exhibit sufficient number of Killing symmetries.
