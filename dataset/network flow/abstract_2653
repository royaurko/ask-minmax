Let $P$ be a principal U(1)-bundle over a closed manifold $M$. On $P$, one
can define a modified version of the Ricci flow called the Ricci Yang-Mills
flow, due to these equations being a coupling of Ricci flow and the Yang-Mills
heat flow. We use maximal regularity theory and ideas of Simonett concerning
the asymptotic behavior of abstract quasilinear parabolic partial differential
equations to study the stability of the volume-normalized Ricci Yang-Mills flow
at Einstein Yang-Mills metrics in dimension two. In certain cases, we show the
presence of a center manifold of fixed points, while in others, we show the
existence of an asymptotically stable fixed point.
