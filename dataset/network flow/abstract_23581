We study random walks on large random graphs that are biased towards a
randomly chosen but fixed target node. We show that a critical bias strength
b_c exists such that most walks find the target within a finite time when
b>b_c. For b<b_c, a finite fraction of walks drifts off to infinity before
hitting the target. The phase transition at b=b_c is second order, but finite
size behavior is complex and does not obey the usual finite size scaling
ansatz. By extending rigorous results for biased walks on Galton-Watson trees,
we give the exact analytical value for b_c and verify it by large scale
simulations.
