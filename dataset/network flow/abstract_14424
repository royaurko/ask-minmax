Recent PHOBOS measurements of the excitation function for the pseudo-rapidity
dependence of elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at RHIC, have posed a
significant theoretical challenge. Here we show that these differential
measurements, as well as the RHIC measurements on transverse momentum satisfy a
universal scaling relation predicted by the Buda-Lund model, based on exact
solutions of perfect fluid hydrodynamics. We also show that recently found
transverse kinetic energy scaling of the elliptic flow is a special case of
this universal scaling.
