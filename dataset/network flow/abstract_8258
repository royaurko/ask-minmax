Two dimensional square lattice general model of the magnetic dot array is
introduced. In this model the intradot self-energy is predicted via the neural
network and interdot magnetostatic coupling is approximated by the collection
of several dipolar terms. The model has been applied to disk-shaped cluster
involving 193 ultrathin dots and 772 interaction centers. In this case among
the intradot magnetic structures retrieved by neural networks the important
role play single-vortex magnetization modes. Several aspects of the model have
been understood numerically by means of the simulated annealing method.
