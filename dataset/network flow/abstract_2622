The purpose of this note is to give an example of stochastic flows of
kernels, which naturally interpolates between the Arratia coalescing flow
associated with systems of coalescing independent Brownian particles on the
circle and the deterministic diffusion flow (actually, the results are given in
the slightly more general framework of symmetric Levy processes for which
points are not polar). The construction is performed using Dirichlet form
theory and the extension of De Finetti's theorem given in the previous work by
the contributors. The sticky flows of kernels are associated with systems of sticky
independent Levy particles on the circle, for some fixed parameter of
stickyness. Some elementary asymptotic properties of the flow are also given.
