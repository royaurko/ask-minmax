The widespread proliferation of Internet and wireless applications has
produced a significant increase of ICT energy footprint. As a response, in the
last five years, significant efforts have been undertaken to include
energy-awareness into network management. Several green networking frameworks
have been proposed by carefully managing the network routing and the power
state of network devices.
  Even though approaches proposed differ based on network technologies and
sleep modes of nodes and interfaces, they all aim at tailoring the active
network resources to the varying traffic needs in order to minimize energy
consumption. From a modeling point of view, this has several commonalities with
classical network design and routing problems, even if with different
objectives and in a dynamic context.
  With most researchers focused on addressing the complex and crucial
technological aspects of green networking schemes, there has been so far little
attention on understanding the modeling similarities and differences of
proposed solutions. This paper fills the gap surveying the literature with
optimization modeling glasses, following a tutorial approach that guides
through the different components of the models with a unified symbolism. A
detailed classification of the previous work based on the modeling issues
included is also proposed.
