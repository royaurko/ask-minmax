This article investigates Kak neural networks, which can be instantaneously
trained, for complex and quaternion inputs. The performance of the basic
algorithm has been analyzed and shown how it provides a plausible model of
human perception and understanding of images. The motivation for studying
quaternion inputs is their use in representing spatial rotations that find
applications in computer graphics, robotics, global navigation, computer vision
and the spatial orientation of instruments. The problem of efficient mapping of
data in quaternion neural networks is examined. Some problems that need to be
addressed before quaternion neural networks find applications are identified.
