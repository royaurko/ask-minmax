The behaviour of D2-branes on the quintic under complex structure
deformations is analysed by combining Landau-Ginzburg techniques with methods
from conformal field theory. It is shown that the boundary renormalisation
group flow induced by the bulk deformations is realised as a gradient flow of
the effective space time superpotential which is calculated explicitly to all
orders in the boundary coupling constant.
