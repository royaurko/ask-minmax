We consider the spread of infectious disease through contact networks of
Configuration Model type. We assume that the disease spreads through contacts
and infected individuals recover into an immune state. We discuss a number of
existing mathematical models used to investigate this system, and show
relations between the underlying assumptions of the models. In the process we
offer simplifications of some of the existing models. The distinctions between
the underlying assumptions are subtle, and in many if not most cases this
subtlety is irrelevant. Indeed, under appropriate conditions the models are
equivalent. We compare the benefits and disadvantages of the different models,
and discuss their application to other populations (\emph{e.g.,} clustered
networks). Finally we discuss ongoing challenges for network-based epidemic
modeling.
