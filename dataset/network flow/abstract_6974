In this paper, under the constraints of the BKP(CKP) hierarchy, a crucial
observation is that the odd dynamical variable $u_{2k+1}$ can be explicitly
expressed by the even dynamical variable $u_{2k}$ in the Lax operator $L$
through a new operator $B$. Using operator $B$, the essential differences
between the BKP hierarchy and the CKP hierarchy are given by the flow equations
and the recursion operators under the $(2n+1)$-reduction. The formal formulas
of the recursion operators for the BKP and CKP hierarchy under
$(2n+1)$-reduction are given. To illustrate this method, the two recursion
operators are constructed explicitly for the 3-reduction of the BKP and CKP
hierarchies. The $t_7$ flows of $u_2$ are generated from $t_1$ flows by the
above recursion operators, which are consistent with the corresponding flows
generated by the flow equations under 3-reduction.
