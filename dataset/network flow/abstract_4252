Boolean networks have been used successfully in modeling biological networks
and provide a good framework for theoretical analysis. However, the analysis of
large networks is not trivial. In order to simplify the analysis of such
networks, several model reduction algorithms have been proposed; however, it is
not clear if such algorithms scale well with respect to the number of nodes.
The goal of this paper is to propose and implement an algorithm for the
reduction of AND-NOT network models for the purpose of steady state
computation. Our method of network reduction is the use of "steady state
approximations" that do not change the number of steady states. Our algorithm
is designed to work at the wiring diagram level without the need to evaluate or
simplify Boolean functions. Also, our implementation of the algorithm takes
advantage of the sparsity typical of discrete models of biological systems. The
main features of our algorithm are that it works at the wiring diagram level,
it runs in polynomial time, and it preserves the number of steady states. We
used our results to study AND-NOT network models of gene networks and showed
that our algorithm greatly simplifies steady state analysis. Furthermore, our
algorithm can handle sparse AND-NOT networks with up to 1000000 nodes.
