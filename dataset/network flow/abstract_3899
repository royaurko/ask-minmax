This article is addressing a recurrent problem in biology: mining newly built
large scale networks. Our approach consists in comparing these new networks to
well known ones. The visual backbone of this comparative analysis is provided
by a network classification hierarchy. This method makes sense when dealing
with metabolic networks since comparison could be done using pathways
(clusters). Moreover each network models an organism and it exists organism
classification such as taxonomies. Video demonstration:
