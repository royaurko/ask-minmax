The problem of parameterizing the interactions of disparate scales in fluid
flows is addressed by considering a property of two-dimensional incompressible
turbulence. The property we consider is selective decay, in which a Casimir of
the ideal formulation (enstrophy in 2D flows) decays in time, while the energy
stays essentially constant. This paper introduces a mechanism that produces
selective decay by enforcing Casimir dissipation in fluid dynamics. This
mechanism turns out to be related in certain cases to the numerical method of
anticipated vorticity discussed in \cite{SaBa1981,SaBa1985}. Several examples
are given and a general theory of selective decay is developed that uses the
Lie-Poisson structure of the ideal theory. A scale-selection operator allows
the resulting modifications of the fluid motion equations to be interpreted in
several examples as parameterizing the nonlinear, dynamical interactions
between disparate scales. The type of modified fluid equation systems derived
here may be useful in turbulent geophysical flows where it is computationally
prohibitive to rely on the slower, indirect effects of a realistic viscosity,
such as in large-scale, coherent, oceanic flows interacting with much smaller
eddies.
