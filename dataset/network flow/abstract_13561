We study an initial-boundary-value problem for time-dependent flows of
heat-conducting viscous incompressible fluids in channel-like domains on a time
interval $(0,T)$. For the parabolic system with strong nonlinearities and
including the artificial (the so called "do nothing") boundary conditions, we
prove the local in time existence, global uniqueness and smoothness of the
solution on a time interval $(0,T^*)$, where $0< T^* \leq T$.
