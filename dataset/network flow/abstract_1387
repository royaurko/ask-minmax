We have simulated the temporal evolution of pressure due to capillary and
viscous forces in two-phase drainage in porous media. We analyze our result in
light of macroscopic flow equations for two-phase flow. We also investigate the
effect of the trapped clusters on the pressure evolution and on the effective
permeability of the system. We find that the capillary forces play an important
role during the displacements for both fast and slow injection rates and both
when the invading fluid is more or less viscous than the defending fluid. The
simulations are based on a network simulator modeling two-phase drainage
displacements on a two-dimensional lattice of tubes.
