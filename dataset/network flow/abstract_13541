In this paper we consider the problem of a steady MHD flow of a non-Newtonian
power-law and electrically conducting fluid in presence of an applied magnetic
field. The boundary layer equations are solved in similarity form via the
Lyapunov energy method, we show that this problem has an infinite number of
positive global solutions.
