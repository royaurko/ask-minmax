A renormalization group method is developed with which thermodynamic
properties of a weakly interacting, confined Bose gas can be investigated.
Thereby effects originating from a confining potential are taken into account
by periodic boundary conditions and by treating the resulting discrete energy
levels of the confined degrees of freedom properly. The resulting density of
states modifies the flow equations of the renormalization group in momentum
space. It is shown that as soon as the characteristic length of confinement
becomes comparable to the thermal wave length of a weakly interacting and
trapped Bose gas its thermodynamic properties are changed significantly. This
is exemplified by investigating characteristic bunching properties of the
interacting Bose gas which manifest themselves in the second order coherence
factor.
