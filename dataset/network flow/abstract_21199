In this paper we give a brief introduction to five different distance vector
routing protocols (RIP, AODV, EIGRP, RIP-MTI and Babel) and give some of our
thoughts on how to solve the count to infinity problem. Our focus is how
distance vector routing protocols, based on limited information, can prevent
routing loops and the count to infinity problem.
