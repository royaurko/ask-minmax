Random intersection graphs (RIGs) are an important random structure with
applications in social networks, epidemic networks, blog readership, and
wireless sensor networks. RIGs can be interpreted as a model for large randomly
formed non-metric data sets. We analyze the component evolution in general
RIGs, and give conditions on existence and uniqueness of the giant component.
Our techniques generalize existing methods for analysis of component evolution:
we analyze survival and extinction properties of a dependent, inhomogeneous
Galton-Watson branching process on general RIGs. Our analysis relies on
bounding the branching processes and inherits the fundamental concepts of the
study of component evolution in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. The major challenge
comes from the underlying structure of RIGs, which involves its both the set of
nodes and the set of attributes, as well as the set of different probabilities
among the nodes and attributes.
