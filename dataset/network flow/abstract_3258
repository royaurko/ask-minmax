We present a calculation of the elliptic flow and azimuthal dependence of the
correlation radii in the ellipsoidally symmetric generalization of the
Buda-Lund model. The elliptic flow is shown to depend only on the flow
anisotropy while in case of correlation radii both flow and space anisotropy
play an important role in determining their azimuthal oscillation. We also
outline a simple procedure for determining the parameters of the model from
data.
