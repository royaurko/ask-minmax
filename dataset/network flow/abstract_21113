We present a new numerical approach to the study of disorder and interactions
in quasi-1D systems which combines aspects of the transfer matrix method and
the density matrix renormalization group which have been successfully applied
to disorder and interacting problems respectively. The method is applied to
spinless fermions in 1D and the existence of a conducting state is demonstrated
in the presence of attractive interactions.
