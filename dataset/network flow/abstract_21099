We report a numerical investigation of the fluctuations of the Lyapunov
exponent of a two dimensional non-interacting disordered system. While the
ratio of the mean to the variance of the Lyapunov exponent is not constant, as
it is in one dimension, its variation is consistent with the single parameter
scaling hypothesis.
