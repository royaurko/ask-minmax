We explore the possibility that the entire departure of galactic rotational
velocities from their luminous Newtonian expectation be cosmological in origin,
and show that within the framework of conformal gravity (but not Einstein
gravity apparently) every static observer sees the overall Hubble flow as a
local universal linear potential which is able to account for available data
without any need for dark matter. We find that the Universe is necessarily an
open one with 3-space scalar curvature given by
$k = -3.5\times 10^{-60}$cm$^{-2}$.
