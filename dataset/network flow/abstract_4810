Functional renormalization group (FRG) is applied to the three-body
scattering problem in the two-component fermionic system with an attractive
contact interaction. We establish a new and correct flow equation on the basis
of FRG and show that our flow equation is consistent with integral equations
obtained from the Dyson-Schwinger equation. In particular, the relation of our
flow equation and the Skornyakov and Ter-Martirosyan equation for the
atom-dimer scattering is made clear.
