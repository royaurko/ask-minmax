Max-plus based methods have been recently explored for solution of
first-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations by several contributors. In
particular, McEneaney's curse-of-dimensionality free method applies to the
equations where the Hamiltonian takes the form of a (pointwise) maximum of
linear/quadratic forms.
  In previous works of McEneaney and Kluberg, the approximation error of the
method was shown to be $O(1/(N\tau))+O(\sqrt{\tau})$ where $\tau$ is the time
discretization step and $N$ is the number of iterations. Here we use a recently
established contraction result for the indefinite Riccati flow in Thompson's
metric to show that under different technical assumptions, still covering an
important class of problems, the error is only of order $O(e^{-\alpha
N\tau})+O(\tau)$. This also allows us to obtain improved estimates of the
execution time and to tune the precision of the pruning procedure, which in
practice is a critical element of the method.
