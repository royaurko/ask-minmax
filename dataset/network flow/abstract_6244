In order to take the weight of connection into consideration and to find a
natural measurement of weight, we have collected papers in Econophysics and
constructed a network of scientific communication to integrate idea
transportation among econophysicists by collaboration, citation and personal
discussion. Some basic statistics such as weight per degree are discussed in
\cite{fan}. In this paper, by including the papers published recently, further
statistical results for the network are reported. Clustering coefficient of
weighted network is introduced and empirically studied in this network. We also
compare the typical statistics on this network under different weight
measurements, including random and inverse weight. The conclusion from
weight-randomized network is helpful to the investigation of the geometrical
role of weight.
