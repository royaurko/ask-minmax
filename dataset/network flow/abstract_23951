This paper has been withdrawn by the contributors. Cellular network data has
become a hot source of study for extraction of user-mobility and
spatio-temporal trends. Location binding in mobility data can be done through
different methods like GPS, service provider assisted faux-GPS and Cell Global
Identity (CGI). Among these Cell Global Identity is most inexpensive method and
readily available solution for mobility extraction; however exact spatial
extraction is somehow a problem in it. This paper presents the spatial
extraction technique of mobile phone user raw data which carries the
information like location information, proximity location and activity of
subjects. This work mainly focuses on the data pre-processing methodology and
technique to interpret the low level mobility data into high level mobility
information using the designed clustering methodology and publically available
Cell-IDs databases. Work proposed the semi- supervised strategy to derive the
missing locations thorough the usage of semantic tag information and removal of
spatial outliers for precise mobility profile building.
