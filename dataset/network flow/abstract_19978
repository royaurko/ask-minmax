We apply the postquasistatic approximation to study the evolution of
spherically symmetric fluid distributions undergoing dissipation in the form of
radial heat flow. For a model which corresponds to an incompressible fluid
departing from the static equilibrium, it is not possible to go far from the
initial state after the emission of a small amount of energy. Initially
collapsing distributions of matter are not permitted. Emission of energy can be
considered as a mechanism to avoid the collapse. If the distribution collapses
initially and emits one hundredth of the initial mass only the outermost layers
evolve. For a model which corresponds to a highly compressed Fermi gas, only
the outermost shell can evolve with a shorter hydrodynamic time scale.
