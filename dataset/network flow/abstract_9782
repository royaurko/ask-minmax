We study the dynamics of a self-gravitating cooling filamentary cloud using a
simplified model. We concentrate on the radial distribution and restrict
ourselves to quasi-hydrostatic, cylindrically symmetric cooling flows. For a
power-law dependence of cooling function on the temperature, self-similar
solutions which describe quasi-hydrostatic cooling flows are derived. We
consider obtically thin filaments with a constant mass per unit length and the
solutions are parameterized by their line masses. There is no polytropic
relation between the density and the pressure. The filament experiences
radiative condensation, irrespective of the \gamma, the gas specific heat
ratio. So, the filament becomes denser due to the quasi-hydrostatic flows and
the density at the center increases in proportion to (t_{0}-t)^{-1}, where t
denotes the time. The term, t_{0}, denotes an epoch at which the central
density increases infinitely. We also found that the radius of the filament
decreases in proportion to (t_{0}-t)^{0.5}.
