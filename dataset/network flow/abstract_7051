In this paper we introduce the notion of sc-action functionals and their
sc-gradient flow lines. Our approach is inspired by Floer's unregularized
gradient flow. The main result of this paper is that under a Morse condition
sc-gradient flow lines have uniform exponential decay towards critical points.
The ultimate goal for the future is to construct a M-polyfold bundle over a
M-polyfold such that the space of broken sc-gradient flow lines is the zero set
of a appropriate sc-section. Here uniform exponential decay is essential. Of
independent interest is that we derive exponential decay estimates using
interpolation inequalities as opposed to Sobolev inequalities. An advantage is
that interpolation inequalities are independent of the dimension of the source
space.
