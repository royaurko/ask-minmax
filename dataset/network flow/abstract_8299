We present a renormalization approach to solve the Sznajd opinion formation
model on complex networks. For the case of two opinions, we present an
expression of the probability of reaching consensus for a given opinion as a
function of the initial fraction of agents with that opinion. The calculations
reproduce the sharp transition of the model on a fixed network, as well as the
recently observed smooth function for the model when simulated on a growing
complex networks.
