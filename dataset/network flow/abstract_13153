The E895 experiment at the AGS measured strange particle production and
collective behavior in Au+Au collisions between 2--8 AGeV. The production of
$\Lambda$ Baryons and K$^0$ Mesons as function of energy rises smoothly and
exhibits a nonlinear impact parameter dependence. Neutral and positively
charged Kaons exhibit a strong anti-flow behavior. $\Lambda$ Baryons show a
smaller flow signal than protons.
