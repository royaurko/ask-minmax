In this paper we introduce a capacity allocation game which models the
problem of maximizing network utility from the perspective of distributed
noncooperative agents. Motivated by the idea of self-managed networks, in the
developed framework decision-making entities are associated with individual
transmission links, deciding on the way they split capacity among concurrent
flows. An efficient decentralized algorithm is given for computing strongly
Pareto-optimal strategies, constituting a pure Nash equilibrium. Subsequently,
we discuss the properties of the introduced game related to the Price of
Anarchy and Price of Stability. The paper is concluded with an experimental
study.
