There is an analogy between the propagation of fields on a curved spacetime
and shallow water waves in an open channel flow. By placing a streamlined
obstacle into an open channel flow we create a region of high velocity over the
obstacle that can include wave horizons. Long (shallow water) waves propagating
upstream towards this region are blocked and converted into short (deep water)
waves. This is the analogue of the stimulated Hawking emission by a white hole
(the time inverse of a black hole). The measurements of amplitudes of the
converted waves demonstrate that they appear in pairs and are classically
correlated; the spectra of the conversion process is described by a
Boltzmann-distribution; and the Boltzmann-distribution is determined by the
determined by the change in flow across the white hole horizon.
