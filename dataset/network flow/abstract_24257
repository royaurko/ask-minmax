We investigate the evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game in structured
populations by introducing dimers, which are defined as that two players in
each dimer always hold a same strategy. We find that influences of dimers on
cooperation depend on the type of dimers and the population structure. For
those dimers in which players interact with each other, the cooperation level
increases with the number of dimers though the cooperation improvement level
depends on the type of network structures. On the other hand, the dimers, in
which there are not mutual interactions, will not do any good to the
cooperation level in a single community, but interestingly, will improve the
cooperation level in a population with two communities. We explore the
relationship between dimers and self-interactions and find that the effects of
dimers are similar to that of self-interactions. Also, we find that the dimers,
which are established over two communities in a multi-community network, act as
one type of interaction through which information between communities is
communicated by the requirement that two players in a dimer hold a same
strategy.
