As a component of the Flash Center's validation program, we compare FLASH
simulation results with experimental results from Los Alamos National
Laboratory. The flow of interest involves the lateral interaction between a
planar Ma=1.2 shock wave with a cylinder of gaseous sulfur hexafluoride (SF_6)
in air, and in particular the development of primary and secondary
instabilities after the passage of the shock. While the overall evolution of
the flow is comparable in the simulations and experiments, small-scale features
are difficult to match. We focus on the sensitivity of numerical results to
simulation parameters.
