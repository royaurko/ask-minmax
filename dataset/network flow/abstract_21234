We discuss the role of random basis function approximators in modeling and
control. We analyze the published work on random basis function approximators
and demonstrate that their favorable error rate of convergence O(1/n) is
guaranteed only with very substantial computational resources. We also discuss
implications of our analysis for applications of neural networks in modeling
and control.
