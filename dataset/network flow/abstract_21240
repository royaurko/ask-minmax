Useful definitions and properties pertaining to static granular packings, in
which a contact network is able to support externally applied forces and
maintain equilibrium for varying loads, are reviewed and discussed. It is
explained how one may then compute force variations and displacements without
introducing inertia or any time-dependent forces.
