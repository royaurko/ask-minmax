An oscillatory magnetic field dependence of the DC voltage is observed when a
low-frequency current flows through superconducting Sn-Ge thin-film composites
near the percolation threshold. The paper also studies the experimental
realisations of temporal voltage fluctuations in these films. Both the
structure of the voltage oscillations against the magnetic field and the time
series of the electric "noise" possess a fractal pattern. With the help of the
fractal analysis procedure, the fluctuations observed have been shown to be
neither a noise with a large number of degrees of freedom, nor the realisations
of a well defined dynamic system. On the contrary the model of voltage
oscillations induced by the weak fluctuations of a magnetic field of arbitrary
nature gives the most appropriate description of the phenomenon observed. The
imaging function of such a transformation possesses a fractal nature, thus
leading to power-law spectra of voltage fluctuations even for the simplest
types of magnetic fluctuations including the monochromatic ones. Thus, the
paper suggests a new universal mechanism of a "1/f noise" origin. It consists
in a passive transformation of any natural fluctuations with a fractal-type
transformation function.
