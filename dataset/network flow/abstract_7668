In lattice gauge theory, there exist field transformations that map the
theory to the trivial one, where the basic field variables are completely
decoupled from one another. Such maps can be constructed systematically by
integrating certain flow equations in field space. The construction is worked
out in some detail and it is proposed to combine the Wilson flow (which
generates approximately trivializing maps for the Wilson gauge action) with the
HMC simulation algorithm in order to improve the efficiency of lattice QCD
simulations.
