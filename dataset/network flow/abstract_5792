This paper describes a network of teachers and students who form a living
system of education at all levels and achieve high standards. The key process
of the network is the process of effective learning by inquiry. Physics is
distinguished among sciences as the most transparent source of understanding
what it means to learn effectively by inquiry. We suggest that teachers and
others who are interested in building the network start from learning about the
contexts of productive learning by inquiry using specially designed and well
tested materials from education of physics. We provide an outline of the
process of creating the network.
