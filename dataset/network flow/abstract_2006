We examine the stability of magnetic order in a classical Heisenberg model
with quenched random exchange couplings. This system represents the spin
degrees of freedom in high-$T_\textrm{c}$ compounds with immobile dopants.
Starting from a replica representation of the nonlinear $\sigma$-model, we
perform a renormalization-group analysis. The importance of cumulants of the
disorder distribution to arbitrarily high orders necessitates a functional
renormalization scheme. From the renormalization flow equations we determine
the magnetic correlation length numerically as a function of the impurity
concentration and of temperature. From our analysis follows that
two-dimensional layers can be magnetically ordered for arbitrarily strong but
sufficiently diluted defects. We further consider the dimensional crossover in
a stack of weakly coupled layers. The resulting phase diagram is compared with
experimental data for La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
