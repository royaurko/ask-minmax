The stoichiometry of metabolic networks usually gives rise to a family of
conservation laws for the aggregate concentration of specific pools of
metabolites, which not only constrain the dynamics of the network, but also
provide key insight into a cell's production capabilities. When the conserved
quantity identifies with a chemical moiety, extracting all such conservation
laws from the stoichiometry amounts to finding all integer solutions to an
NP-hard programming problem. Here we propose a novel and efficient
computational strategy that combines Monte Carlo, message passing, and
relaxation algorithms to compute the complete set of irreducible integer
conservation laws of a given stoichiometric matrix, also providing a
certificate for correctness and maximality of the solution. The method is
deployed for the analysis of the complete set of irreducible integer pools of
two large-scale reconstructions of the metabolism of the bacterium Escherichia
coli in different growth media. In addition, we uncover a scaling relation that
links the size of the irreducible pool basis to the number of metabolites, for
which we present an analytical explanation.
