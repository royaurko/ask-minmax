The concept of describing RF circuits in terms of waves is discussed and the
S-matrix and related matrices are defined. The signal flow graph (SFG) is
introduced as a graphical means to visualize how waves propagate in an RF
network. The properties of the most relevant passive RF devices (hybrids,
couplers, non-reciprocal elements, etc.) are delineated and the corresponding
S-parameters are given. For microwave integrated circuits (MICs) planar
transmission lines such as the microstrip line have become very important.
