In this paper we propose a new routing protocol with low energy consumption
for wireless sensor networks based on the clustering approach. Our protocol is
based on a strategy which aims at providing a more equitable exploitation of
the selected nodes (cluster-heads) energy by distributing their load of the
managed sensors during the clustering process. In order to save the energy
dissipated while transmitting sensed data to the base station, the multi-hops
routing strategy is used to arrange the communication of the data between
cluster-heads nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed protocol
decreases the energy consumption and prolongs the network lifetime.
