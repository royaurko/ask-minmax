The charge of micrometer-sized dust particles suspended in plasma above the
powered electrode of radio-frequency (RF) discharges is studied. Using a
self-consistent fluid model, the plasma profiles above the electrode are
calculated and the electron depletion towards the electrode, as well as the
increasing flow speed of ions towards the electrode, are considered in the
calculation of the dust particle floating potential. The results are compared
with those reported in literature and the importance of the spatial dust charge
variation is investigated.
