This chapter provides an overview of the different techniques and methods
that exist for the analysis and visualization of dynamic networks. Basic
definitions and formal notations are discussed and important references are
cited.
  A major reason for the popularity of the field of dynamic networks is its
applicability in a number of diverse fields. The field of dynamic networks is
in its infancy and there are so many avenues that need to be explored. From
developing network generation models to developing temporal metrics and
measures, from structural analysis to visual analysis, there is room for
further exploration in almost every dimension where dynamic networks are
studied. Recently, with the availability of dynamic data from various fields,
the empirical study and experimentation with real data sets has also helped
maturate the field. Furthermore, researchers have started to develop
foundations and theories based on these datasets which in turn has resulted
lots of activity among research communities.
