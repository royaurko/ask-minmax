Nonlinear coupling between inter- and intra-element dynamics appears as a
collective behaviour of elements. The elements in this paper denote symptoms
such as a bacterium having an internal network of genes and proteins, a
reactive droplet, a neuron in networks, etc. In order to elucidate the
capability of such systems, a simple and reasonable model is derived. This
model exhibits the rich patterns of systems such as cell membrane, cell fusion,
cell growing, cell division, firework, branch, and clustered clusters
(self-organized hierarchical structure, modular network). This model is
extremely simple yet powerful; therefore, it is expected to impact several
disciplines.
