Centrality is an important notion in network analysis and is used to measure
the degree to which network structure contributes to the importance of a node
in a network. While many different centrality measures exist, most of them
apply to static networks. Most networks, on the other hand, are dynamic in
nature, evolving over time through the addition or deletion of nodes and edges.
A popular approach to analyzing such networks represents them by a static
network that aggregates all edges observed over some time period. This
approach, however, under or overestimates centrality of some nodes. We address
this problem by introducing a novel centrality metric for dynamic network
analysis. This metric exploits an intuition that in order for one node in a
dynamic network to influence another over some period of time, there must exist
a path that connects the source and destination nodes through intermediaries at
different times. We demonstrate on an example network that the proposed metric
leads to a very different ranking than analysis of an equivalent static
network. We use dynamic centrality to study a dynamic citations network and
contrast results to those reached by static network analysis.
