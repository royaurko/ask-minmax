We consider the probability that a dense wireless network confined within a
given convex geometry is fully connected. We exploit a recently reported theory
to develop a systematic methodology for analytically characterizing the
connectivity probability when the network resides within a convex right prism,
a polyhedron that accurately models many geometries that can be found in
practice. To maximize practicality and applicability, we adopt a general
point-to-point link model based on outage probability, and present example
analytical and numerical results for a network employing $2 \times 2$
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) maximum ratio combining (MRC) link level
transmission confined within particular bounding geometries. Furthermore, we
provide suggestions for extending the approach detailed herein to more general
convex geometries.
