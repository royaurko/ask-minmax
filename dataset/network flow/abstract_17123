Bibliometric techniques are not yet widely used to enhance retrieval
processes in digital libraries, although they offer value-added effects for
users. In this paper we will explore how statistical modelling of scholarship,
such as Bradfordizing or network analysis of cocontributorship network, can improve
retrieval services for specific communities, as well as for large, cross-domain
large collections. This paper aims to raise awareness of the missing link
between information retrieval (IR) and bibliometrics / scientometrics and to
create a common ground for the incorporation of bibliometric-enhanced services
into retrieval at the digital library interface.
