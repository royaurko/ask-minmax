The present business network infrastructure is quickly varying with latest
servers, services, connections, and ports added often, at times day by day, and
with a uncontrollably inflow of laptops, storage media and wireless networks.

is proposed for network vulnerability assessment derived from Unified Software
Development Process or Unified Process, it is a popular iterative and
incremental software development process framework.
