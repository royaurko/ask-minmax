Solvent shifting is a process in which a non-solvent is added to a
solvent/solute mixture and extracts the solvent. The solvent and the
non-solvent are miscible. Because of solution supersaturation a portion of the
solute transforms to droplets. In this paper, based on this process, we present
an investigation on droplet formation and their radial motion in a microfluidic
device in which a jet is injected in a co-flowing liquid stream. Thanks to the
laminar flow, the microfluidic setup enables studying diffusion mass transfer
in radial direction and obtaining well-defined concentration distributions.
Such profiles together with Ternary Phase Diagram (TPD) give detailed
information about the conditions for droplet formation condition as well as
their radial migration in the channel. The ternary system is composed of
ethanol (solvent), de-ionized water (non-solvent) and divinyle benzene
(solute). We employ analytical/numerical solutions of the diffusion equation to
obtain concentration profiles of the components. We show that in the system
under study droplets are formed in a region of the phase diagram between the
binodal and the spinodal, i.e. via a thermally activated process. The droplets
are driven to the channel centerline by the solutal Marangoni effect but are
not able to significantly penetrate into the single-phase region, where they
get rapidly dissolved. Therefore, the radial motion of the binodal surface
carries the droplets to the centerline where they get collected.
