Science is a social process with far-reaching impact on our modern society.
In the recent years, for the first time we are able to scientifically study the
science itself. This is enabled by massive amounts of data on scientific
publications that is increasingly becoming available. The data is contained in
several databases such as Web of Science or PubMed, maintained by various
public and private entities. Unfortunately, these databases are not always
consistent, which considerably hinders this study. Relying on the powerful
framework of complex networks, we conduct a systematic analysis of the
consistency among six major scientific databases. We found that identifying a
single "best" database is far from easy. Nevertheless, our results indicate
appreciable differences in mutual consistency of different databases, which we
interpret as recipes for future bibliometric studies.
