We explain how the formal aspects of the theory of Kahler-Einstein metrics
can be developed in the framework of moment maps. The central result we use is
the Berndtsson convexity theorem, which is interpreted as defining a metric on
the space of complex structures. We discuss some applications of these ideas to
the Kahler-Ricci flow.
