This study is focused on the mechanisms of rhythmogenesis and robustness of
anti-phase bursting in half-center-oscillators (HCOs) consisting of two
reciprocally inhibitory coupled neurons. There is a growing body of
experimental evidence that a HCO is a universal building block for larger
neural networks, including central pattern generators (CPGs) controlling a
variety of locomotion behaviors in spineless animals and mammals. It remains
unclear how CPGs achieve the level of robustness and stability observed in
nature. There has been a vastly growing consensus in the community of
neurophysiologists and computational researchers that some basic structural and
functional elements are likely shared by CPGs of both invertebrate and
vertebrate animals. In this study we consider several configurations of HCOs
including coupled endogenous bursters, tonic spiking, and quiescent neurons,
that become network bursters only when coupled by fast inhibitory synapses
through the mechanism of post-inhibitory-rebound (PIR). The goal is better
understanding the PIR mechanism as a key component for robust anti-phase
bursting in generic HCOs
