Sequencing by synthesis is the underlying technology for many next-generation
DNA sequencing platforms. We developed a new model, the fixed flow cycle model,
to derive the distributions of sequence length for a given number of flow
cycles under the general conditions where the nucleotide incorporation is
probabilistic and may be incomplete, as in some single-molecule sequencing
technologies. Unlike the previous model, the new model yields the probability
distribution for the sequence length. Explicit closed form formulas are derived
for the mean and variance of the distribution.
