The accurate description of molecule-surface interactions requires a detailed
knowledge of the underlying potential-energy surface (PES). Recently, neural
networks (NNs) have been shown to be an efficient technique to accurately
interpolate the PES information provided for a set of molecular configurations,
e.g. by first-principles calculations. Here, we further develop this approach
by building the NN on a new type of symmetry functions, which allows to take
the symmetry of the surface exactly into account. The accuracy and efficiency
of such symmetry-adapted NNs is illustrated by the application to a
six-dimensional PES describing the interaction of oxygen molecules with the
Al(111) surface.
