Recent X-ray observations have highlighted clusters that lack entropy cores.
At first glance, these results appear to invalidate the preheated ICM models.
We show that a self-consistent preheating model, which factors in the effects
of radiative cooling, is in excellent agreement with the observations.
Moreover, the model naturally explains the intrinsic scatter in the L-T
relation, with ``cooling flow'' and ``non-cooling flow'' systems corresponding
to mildly and strongly preheated systems, respectively. We discuss why
preheating ought to be favoured over merging as a mechanism for the origin of
``non-cooling flow'' clusters.
