Real life networks are generally modelled as scale free networks. Information
diffusion in such networks in decentralised environment is a difficult and
resource consuming affair. Gossip algorithms have come up as a good solution to
this problem. In this paper, we have proposed Adaptive First Push Then Pull
gossip algorithm. We show that algorithm works with minimum cost when the
transition round to switch from Adaptive Push to Adaptive Pull is close to
Round(log(N)). Furthermore, we compare our algorithm with Push, Pull and First
Push Then Pull and show that the proposed algorithm is the most cost efficient
in Scale Free networks.
