We give the following results for Pinkall's central affine curve flow on the
plane: (i) a systematic and simple way to construct the known higher commuting
curve flows, conservation laws, and a bi-Hamiltonian structure, (ii) Baecklund
transformations and a permutability formula, (iii) infinitely many families of
explicit solutions. We also solve the Cauchy problem for periodic initial data.
