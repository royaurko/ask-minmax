In this note, we use the first order formalism for attractor flows in N=2
SUGRA extremal black hole backgrounds to establish a formal correspondence
between the RG flow of moduli in the underlying N=(2,2) SCFT and bulk attractor
flows. Starting from a study of moduli flow trajectories in the CFT, we derive
a potential which generates the aforesaid flow. This potential is shown to be a
symplectic invariant with the same form as the black hole potential which
drives the attractor flows in the bulk. We use these results to make comments
on the non-renormalization of extremal black hole entropy and indicate a
similar correspondence for two-centered forked flows in CFT.
