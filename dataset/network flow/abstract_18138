In societal-scale decision-making systems the collective is faced with the
problem of ensuring that the derived group decision is in accord with the
collective's intention. In modern systems, political institutions have
instatiated representative forms of decision-making to ensure that every
individual in the society has a participatory voice in the decision-making
behavior of the whole--even if only indirectly through representation. An
agent-based simulation demonstrates that in modern representative systems, as
the ratio of representatives increases, there exists an exponential decrease in
the ability for the group to behave in accord with the desires of the whole. To
remedy this issue, this paper provides a novel representative power structure
for decision-making that utilizes a social network and power distribution
algorithm to maintain the collective's perspective over varying degrees of
participation and/or ratios of representation. This work shows promise for the
future development of policy-making systems that are supported by the computer
and network infrastructure of our society.
