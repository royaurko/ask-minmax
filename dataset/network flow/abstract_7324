We show, analytically and numerically, that wealth distribution in the
Bouchaud-M\'ezard network model of the economy is described by a
three-parameter generalized inverse gamma distribution. In the mean-field limit
of a network with any two agents linked, it reduces to the inverse gamma
distribution.
