In this paper we report numerical and experimental results on the scaling
properties of the velocity turbulent fields in several flows. The limits of a
new form of scaling, named Extended Self Similarity(ESS), are discussed. We
show that, when a mean shear is absent, the self scaling exponents are
universal and they do not depend on the specific flow (3D homogeneous
turbulence, thermal convection , MHD). In contrast, ESS is not observed when a
strong shear is present. We propose a generalized version of self scaling which
extends down to the smallest resolvable scales even in cases where ESS is not
present. This new scaling is checked in several laboratory and numerical
experiment. A possible theoretical interpretation is also proposed. A synthetic
turbulent signal having most of the properties of a real one has been
generated.
