Wireless Sensor Nodes (SNs), the key elements for building Internet of Things
(IOT), have been deployed widely in order to get and transmit information over
the internet. With the introduction of IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal
Area Network (6LoWPAN), it is possible to connect these constrained devices to
IPv6 Networks and transmit IPv6 packets. The sensor nodes are being
deployed/installed on many objects and some of them are mobile (moving)
including mobile gadgets, physical objects (living or non-living) etc. These
mobile objects require sufficient Mobility Management Schemes to take care of
data transmission. Host based mobility protocols; MIPv6 and its extensions are
not suitable for these resource constrained devices. In this paper our focus is
to study PMIPv6 based mobility management and different Scenarios based on it
along with sensor devices. Existing research has made many improvements in
terms of HO latency but less attention has paid towards signaling cost and
packet loss particularly in time critical areas. The study provides the
complete survey of network based mobility management schemes, 6LoWPAN mobility,
challenges associated with them and solutions to meet these challenges.
