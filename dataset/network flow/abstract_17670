The implementation of the kinetic diffuse boundary condition with the
characteristic streaming-collision mechanism is studied for the high-order
lattice Boltzmann (LB) models. The obtained formulation is also tested and
validated numerically for three high-order LB models for both isothermal and
thermal Couette flows. The streaming-collision mechanism ensures that
high-order LB models can retain particle feature while go beyond the
Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics.
