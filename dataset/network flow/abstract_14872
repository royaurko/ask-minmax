We study a homotopical growth rate for a version of Legendrian contact
homology, called strip Legendrian contact homology, in 3-dimensional contact
manifolds and its relation to the topological entropy of Reeb flows. We show
that if, for a pair of Legendrian knots in a contact 3-manifold, the strip
Legendrian contact homology is defined and has exponential homotopical growth
with respect to the action, then every Reeb flow on this contact manifold has
positive topological entropy. This implies that on such a contact manifold, for
all Reeb flows (even degenerate ones) the number of hyperbolic periodic orbits
grows exponentially with respect to the period. We show that for an infinite
family of different 3-manifolds, infinitely many different contact structures
exist which present exponential growth rate of strip Legendrian contact
homology for certain pairs of Legendrian knots.
