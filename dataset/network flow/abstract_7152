A framework is developed for analyzing capacity gains from user cooperation
in slow fading wireless networks when the number of nodes (network size) is
large. The framework is illustrated for the case of a simple multipath-rich
Rayleigh fading channel model. Both unicasting (one source and one destination)
and multicasting (one source and several destinations) scenarios are
considered. We introduce a meaningful notion of Shannon capacity for such
systems, evaluate this capacity as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
and develop a simple two-phase cooperative network protocol that achieves it.
We observe that the resulting capacity is the same for both unicasting and
multicasting, but show that the network size required to achieve any target
error probability is smaller for unicasting than for multicasting. Finally, we
introduce the notion of a network ``scaling exponent'' to quantify the rate of
decay of error probability with network size as a function of the targeted
fraction of the capacity. This exponent provides additional insights to system
designers by enabling a finer grain comparison of candidate cooperative
transmission protocols in even moderately sized networks.
