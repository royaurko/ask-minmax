The pseudo-rapidity dependence of the elliptic flow at various excitation
energies measured by the PHOBOS Collaboration in Au+Au collisions at RHIC is
one of the surprising results that has not been explained before in terms of
hydrodynamical models. Here we show that these data are in agreement with
theoretical predictions based on perfect fluid hydrodynamics.
  We also show that these PHOBOS data satisfy the universal scaling relation
predicted by the Buda-Lund hydrodynamical model, based on exact solutions of
perfect fluid hydrodynamics.
