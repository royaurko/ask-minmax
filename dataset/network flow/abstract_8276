In a graph, nodes can be characterized locally (with their degree $k$) or
globally (e.g. with their average length path $\xi$ to other nodes). Here we
investigate how $\xi$ depends on $k$. Our earlier algorithm of the construction
of the distance matrix is applied to the random graphs. Numerical calculations
are performed for the random graphs and the growing networks: the scale-free
ones and the exponential ones. The results are relevant for search strategies
in different networks.
