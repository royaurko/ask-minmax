Significant microstructural anisotropy is known to develop during shearing
flow of attractive particle suspensions. These suspensions, and their capacity
to form conductive networks, play a key role in flow-battery technology, among
other applications. Herein, we present and test an analytical model for the
tensorial conductivity of attractive particle suspensions. The model utilizes
the mean fabric of the network to characterize the structure, and the
relationship to the conductivity is inspired by a lattice argument. We test the
accuracy of our model against a large number of computer-generated suspension
networks, based on multiple in-house generation protocols, giving rise to
particle networks that emulate the physical system. The model is shown to
adequately capture the tensorial conductivity, both in terms of its invariants
and its mean directionality.
