We study the flow-level performance of random wireless networks. The
locations of base stations (BSs) follow a Poisson point process. The number and
positions of active users are dynamic. We associate a queue to each BS. The
performance and stability of a BS depend on its load. In some cases, the full
distribution of the load can be derived. Otherwise we derive formulas for the
first and second moments. Networks on the line and on the plane are considered.
Our model is generic enough to include features of recent wireless networks
such as 4G (LTE) networks. In dense networks, we show that the inter-cell
interference power becomes normally distributed, simplifying many computations.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that in cases of practical interest, the
loads distribution can be well approximated by a gamma distribution with known
mean and variance.
