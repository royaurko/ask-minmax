Wavelet analysis and compression tools are reviewed and different
applications to study MHD and plasma turbulence are presented. We introduce the
continuous and the orthogonal wavelet transform and detail several statistical
diagnostics based on the wavelet coefficients. We then show how to extract
coherent structures out of fully developed turbulent flows using wavelet-based
denoising. Finally some multiscale numerical simulation schemes using wavelets
are described. Several examples for analyzing, compressing and computing one,
two and three dimensional turbulent MHD or plasma flows are presented.
