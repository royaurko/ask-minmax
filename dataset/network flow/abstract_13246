This paper presents the large-eddy simulation of the lid-driven cubic cavity
flow by the spectral element method (SEM) using the dynamic model. Two spectral
filtering techniques suitable for these simulations have been implemented.
Numerical results for Reynolds number $\text{Re}=12'000$ are showing very good
agreement with other experimental and DNS results found in the literature.
