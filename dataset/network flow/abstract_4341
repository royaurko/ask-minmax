A Virtual Private Network (VPN) provides private network connections over a
publicly accessible shared network. The effective allocation of bandwidth for
VPNs assumes significance in the present scenario due to varied traffic. Each
VPN endpoint specifies bounds on the total amount of traffic that it is likely
to send or receive at any time. The network provider tailors the VPN so that
there is sufficient bandwidth for any traffic matrix that is consistent with
these bounds. The approach incorporates the use of Ad-hoc On demand Distance
Vector (AODV) protocol, with a view to accomplish an enhancement in the
performance of the mobile networks. The NS2 based simulation results are
evaluated in terms of its metrics for different bandwidth allocations, besides
analyzing its performance in the event of exigencies such as link failures. The
results highlight the suitability of the proposed strategy in the context of
real time applications.
