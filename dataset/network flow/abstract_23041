Heavy Ion Collisions (HIC) represent a unique tool to probe the in-medium
nuclear interaction in regions away from saturation and at high nucleon
momenta. In this report we present a selection of reaction observables
particularly sensitive to the isovector part of the interaction, i.e. to the
symmetry term of the nuclear Equation of State (EoS) At low energies the
behavior of the symmetry energy around saturation influences dissipation and
fragment production mechanisms. Predictions are shown for deep-inelastic and
fragmentation collisions induced by neutron rich projectiles. Differential flow
measurements will also shed lights on the controversial neutron/proton
effective mass splitting in asymmetric matter. The high density symmetry term
can be derived from isospin effects on heavy ion reactions at relativistic
energies (few AGeV range), that can even allow a ``direct'' study of the
covariant structure of the isovector interaction in the hadron medium. Rather
sensitive observables are proposed from collective flows and from pion/kaon
production. The possibility of the transition to a mixed hadron-quark phase, at
high baryon and isospin density, is finally suggested. Some signatures could
come from an expected ``neutron trapping'' effect.
