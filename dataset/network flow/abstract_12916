Using the strong temperature dependent resistance of a normal metal wire in
proximity to a superconductor, we have been able to measure the local
temperature of electrons heated by flowing a dc current in a metallic wire to
within a few tens of millikelvin at low temperatures. By placing two such
thermometers at different parts of a sample, we have been able to measure the
temperature difference induced by a dc current flowing in the sample. This
technique may provide a flexible means of making quantitative thermal and
thermoelectric measurements on mesoscopic metallic samples.
