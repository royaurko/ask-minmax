In this paper, we present methods in deep multimodal learning for fusing
speech and visual modalities for Audio-Visual Automatic Speech Recognition
(AV-ASR). First, we study an approach where uni-modal deep networks are trained
separately and their final hidden layers fused to obtain a joint feature space
in which another deep network is built. While the audio network alone achieves
a phone error rate (PER) of $41\%$ under clean condition on the IBM large
vocabulary audio-visual studio dataset, this fusion model achieves a PER of
$35.83\%$ demonstrating the tremendous value of the visual channel in phone
classification even in audio with high signal to noise ratio. Second, we
present a new deep network architecture that uses a bilinear softmax layer to
account for class specific correlations between modalities. We show that
combining the posteriors from the bilinear networks with those from the fused
model mentioned above results in a further significant phone error rate
reduction, yielding a final PER of $34.03\%$.
