We present a conformal theory for intermittent scalar fields. As an example,
we consider the energy flux from large to small scales in the developed
turbulent flow. The conformal correlation functions are found in the inertial
range of scales. In the simplest case, the theory leads to the log-normal
model. Parameters of the model are expressed via integrals of the conformal
correlation functions. Non-Gaussian conformal correlation functions of high
order are studied.
