The emergence of chirality in enantioselective autocatalysis for compounds
unable to transform according to the Frank-like reaction network is discussed
with respect to the controversial limited enantioselectivity (LES) model
composed of coupled enantioselective and non-enantioselective autocatalyses.
The LES model cannot lead to spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking (SMSB) either
in closed systems with a homogeneous temperature distribution nor in closed
systems with a stationary non-uniform temperature distribution. However,
simulations of chemical kinetics in a two-compartment model demonstrate that
SMSB may occur if both autocatalytic reactions are spatially separated at
different temperatures in different compartments but coupled under the action
of a continous internal flow. In such conditions the system can evolve, for
certain reaction and system parameters, towards a chiral stationary state,
i.e., the system is able to reach a bifurcation point leading to SMSB.
Numerical simulations using reasonable chemical parameters suggest that an
adequate scenario for such a SMSB would be that of abyssal hydrothermal vents,
by virtue of the typical temperature gradients found there and the role of
inorganic solids mediating chemical reactions in an enzyme-like role.
