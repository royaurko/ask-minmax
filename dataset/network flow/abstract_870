Using a stochastic cellular automaton model for urban traffic flow, we study
and compare Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs) of arterial road networks
governed by different types of adaptive traffic signal systems, under various
boundary conditions. In particular, we simulate realistic signal systems that
include signal linking and adaptive cycle times, and compare their performance
against a highly adaptive system of self-organizing traffic signals which is
designed to uniformly distribute the network density. We find that for networks
with time-independent boundary conditions, well-defined stationary MFDs are
observed, whose shape depends on the particular signal system used, and also on
the level of heterogeneity in the system. We find that the spatial
heterogeneity of both density and flow provide important indicators of network
performance. We also study networks with time-dependent boundary conditions,
containing morning and afternoon peaks. In this case, intricate hysteresis
loops are observed in the MFDs which are strongly correlated with the density
heterogeneity. Our results show that the MFD of the self-organizing traffic
signals lies above the MFD for the realistic systems, suggesting that by
adaptively homogenizing the network density, overall better performance and
higher capacity can be achieved.
