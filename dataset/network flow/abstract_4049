Recent PHENIX elliptic flow ($v_2$) measurements for identified particles
produced in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV are presented
and compared to other RHIC measurements. They indicate universal scaling of
$v_2$ compatible with partonic collectivity leading to the flow of light,
strange and heavy quarks with a common expansion velocity field.
