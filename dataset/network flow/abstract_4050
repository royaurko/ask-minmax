The effects of an interplay of radial expansion of the thermalized system
created in a heavy ion collision and directed flow are discussed. It is shown
that the study of azimuthal anisotropy of particle distribution as a function
of rapidity and transverse momentum could reveal important information on both
radial and directed flow.
