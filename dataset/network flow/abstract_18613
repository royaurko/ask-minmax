The increasing use of social networks generates enormous amounts of data that
can be used for many types of analysis. Some of these data have temporal and
geographical information, which can be used for comprehensive examination. In
this paper, we propose a new method to analyze the massive volume of messages
available in Twitter to identify places in the world where topics such as TV
shows, climate change, disasters, and sports are emerging. The proposed method
is based on a neural network that is used to detect outliers from a time
series, which is built upon statistical data from tweets located on different
political divisions (i.e., countries, cities). The outliers are used to
identify topics within an abnormal behavior in Twitter. The effectiveness of
our method is evaluated in an online environment indicating new findings on
modeling local people's behavior from different places.
