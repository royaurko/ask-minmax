At the eight-year anniversary of Watts & Strogatz's work on the collective
dynamics of small-world networks and seven years after Barabasi & Albert's
discovery of scale-free networks, the area of dynamical processes on complex
networks is at the forefront of the current research on nonlinear dynamics and
complex systems. This volume brings together a selection of original
contributions in complementary topics of statistical physics, nonlinear
dynamics and biological sciences, and is expected to provide the reader with a
comprehensive up-to-date representation of this rapidly developing area.
