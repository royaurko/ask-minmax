The massive amounts of geolocation data collected from mobile phone records
has sparked an ongoing effort to understand and predict the mobility patterns
of human beings. In this work, we study the extent to which social phenomena
are reflected in mobile phone data, focusing in particular in the cases of
urban commute and major sports events. We illustrate how these events are
reflected in the data, and show how information about the events can be used to
improve predictability in a simple model for a mobile phone user's location.
