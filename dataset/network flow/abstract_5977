We prove that complex networks of interactions have the capacity to regulate
and buffer unpredictable fluctuations in production events. We show that
non-bursty network-driven activation dynamics can effectively regulate the
level of burstiness in the production of nodes, which can be enhanced or
reduced. Burstiness can be induced even when the endogenous inter-event time
distribution of nodes' production is non-bursty. We found that hubs tend to be
less controllable than low degree nodes, which are more susceptible to the
networked regulatory effects. Our results have important implications for the
analysis and engineering of bursty activity in a range of systems, from
telecommunication networks to transcription and translation of genes into
proteins in cells.
