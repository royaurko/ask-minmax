Social status, defined as the relative rank or position that an individual
holds in a social hierarchy, is known to be among the most important motivating
forces in social behaviors. In this paper, we consider the notion of status
from the perspective of a position or title held by a person in an enterprise.
We study the intersection of social status and social networks in an
enterprise. We study whether enterprise communication logs can help reveal how
social interactions and individual status manifest themselves in social
networks. To that end, we use two enterprise datasets with three communication
channels --- voice call, short message, and email --- to demonstrate the
social-behavioral differences among individuals with different status. We have
several interesting findings and based on these findings we also develop a
model to predict social status. On the individual level, high-status
individuals are more likely to be spanned as structural holes by linking to
people in parts of the enterprise networks that are otherwise not well
connected to one another. On the community level, the principle of homophily,
social balance and clique theory generally indicate a "rich club" maintained by
high-status individuals, in the sense that this community is much more
connected, balanced and dense. Our model can predict social status of
individuals with 93% accuracy.
