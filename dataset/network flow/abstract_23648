We investigate the cosmological evolution of global monopoles in the
radiation dominated (RD) and matter dominated (MD) universes by numerically
solving field equations of scalar fields. It is shown that the global monopole
network relaxes into the scaling regime, unlike the gauge monopole network. The
number density of global monopoles is given by $n(t) \simeq (0.43\pm0.07) /
t^{3}$ during the RD era and $n(t) \simeq (0.25\pm0.05) / t^{3}$ during the MD
era. Thus, we have confirmed that density fluctuations produced by global
monopoles become scale invariant and are given by $\delta \rho \sim 7.2(5.0)
\sigma^{2} / t^{2} $ during the RD (MD) era, where $\sigma$ is the breaking
scale of the symmetry.
