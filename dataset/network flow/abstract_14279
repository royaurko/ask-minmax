With the recent important development of microfluidic systems,
miniaturization of flow devices has become a real challenge. Microchannels,
however, are characterized by a large surface to volume ratio, so that surface
properties strongly affect flow resistance in submicrometric devices. We
present here results showing that the concerted effect of wetting . properties
and surface roughness may considerably reduce friction of the fluid past the
boundaries. The slippage of the fluid at the channel boundaries is shown to be
drastically increased by using surfaces that are patterned at the nanometer
scale. This effect occurs in the regime where the surface pattern is partially
dewetted, in the spirit of the 'superhydrophobic' effects that have been
recently discovered at the macroscopic scales. Our results show for the first
time that, in contrast to the common belief, surface friction may be reduced by
surface roughness. They also open the possibility of a controlled realization
of the 'nanobubbles' that have long been suspected to play a role in
interfacial slippage
