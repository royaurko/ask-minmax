Decay times of plasma flows and plasma profiles have been measured after a
sudden biasing switch-off in experiments on the CASTOR tokamak. A biased
electrode has been used to polarize the edge plasma. The edge plasma potential
and flows have been characterized by means of Langmuir and Mach probes, the
radiation was measured using an array of bolometers. Potential profiles and
poloidal flows can be well fitted by an exponential decay time in the range of
10 - 30 microseconds when the electrode biasing is turn off in the CASTOR
tokamak. The radiation shows a slower time scale (about 1 ms), which is linked
to the evolution in the plasma density and paticle confinement.
