The cumulative probability distribution of sparseness time interval in the
Internet is studied by the method of data analysis. Round-trip time between a
local host and a destination host through ten odd routers is measured using the
Ping Command, i.e., doing echo experiment. It is found that the data are well
described by the q-exponential destributions, which maximize the Tsallis
entropy indexed by q less or larger than unity. The network is observed to
itinerate over a series of the nonequilibrium stationary states characterized
by Tsallis statistics.
