The morphology of adiabatic accretion flows with small non-zero specific
angular momentum has been investigated in the axisymmetric and nonviscous
limit. For an initial state characterized by a Bondi flow with the specific
angular momentum distributed with respect to polar angle, a travelling shock
wave forms which propagates more rapidly in the equatorial plane than in the
plane perpendicular to it resulting in the formation of a hot torus. In cases
where the incoming flow is restricted to lie near the equatorial plane, a
strong wind forms directed away from this plane with the tendency for the
formation of a nonsteady shock structure. As the height of the incoming flow is
increased it is found that the resultant wind weakens. The parameter regime
which delineates accretion flows characterized by a travelling shock and a
nearly standing shock structure is presented.
