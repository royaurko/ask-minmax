We establish the global existence of $L^\infty$ solutions for a model of
polytropic gas flow with diffusive entropy. The result is obtained by showing
the convergence of a class of finite difference schemes, which includes the
Lax-Friedrichs and Godunov schemes. Such convergence is achieved by proving the
estimates required for the application of the compensated compactness theory.
