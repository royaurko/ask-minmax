In this article, by following the method in \cite{PT}, combining Willmore
energy with isoperimetric inequalities, we construct two examples of
singularities under mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{H}^3$. More precisely,
there exists a torus, which must develop a singularity under MCF before the
volume it encloses decreases to zero. There also exists a topological sphere in
the shape of a dumbbell, which must develop a singularity in the flow before
its area shrinks to zero. Simultaneously, by using the flow, we proved an
isoperimetric inequality for some domains in $\mathbb{H}^3$.
