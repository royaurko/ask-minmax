In this contribution we introduce local attachment as an universal
network-joining protocol for peer-to-peer networks, social networks, or other
kinds of networks. Based on this protocol nodes in a finite-size network
dynamically create power-law connectivity distributions. Nodes or peers
maintain them in a self-organized statistical way by incorporating local
information only. We investigate the structural and macroscopic properties of
such local attachment networks by extensive numerical simulations, including
correlations and scaling relations between exponents. The emergence of the
power-law degree distribution is further investigated by considering
preferential attachment with a nonlinear attractiveness function as an
approximative model for local attachment. This study suggests the local
attachment scheme as a procedure to be included in future peer-to-peer
protocols to enable the efficient production of stable network topologies in a
continuously changing environment.
