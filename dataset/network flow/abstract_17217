In this paper, we first propose a concept of weighted pseudo-almost periodic
functions on time scales and study some basic properties of weighted
pseudo-almost periodic functions on time scales. Then, we establish some
results about the existence of weighted pseudo-almost periodic solutions to
linear dynamic equations on time scales. Finally, as an application of our
results, we study the existence and global exponential stability of weighted
pseudo-almost periodic solutions for a class of cellular neural networks with
discrete delays on time scales. The results of this paper are completely new.
