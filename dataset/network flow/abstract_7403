We use an off-lattice microscopic model for solutions of equilibrium polymers
(EP) in a lamellar shear flow generated by means of a self-consistent external
field between parallel hard walls.
  The individual conformations of the chains are found to elongate in flow
direction and shrink perpendicular to it while the average polymer length
decreases with increasing shear rate.
  The Molecular Weight Distribution of the chain lengths retains largely its
exponential form in dense solutions whereas in dilute solutions it changes from
a power-exponential Schwartz distribution to a purely exponential one upon an
increase of the shear rate.
