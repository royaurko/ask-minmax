The probability distribution functions (PDFs) of momentum flux and zonal flow
formation in ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) turbulence are investigated,
including the effect of the shear flow on the PDFs. While ITG turbulence
maintains high level of transport, this may be suppressed by shear flow. Zonal
flows are also shown here to have an enhanced likelihood of generation further
from marginal stability which will then regulate the ITG turbulence, which is
more prominent with increased shear flow, leading to a self-regulating system.
