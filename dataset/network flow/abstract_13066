We study the transport of a passive tracer particle in a steady strongly
mixing flow with a nonzero mean velocity. We show that there exists a
probability measure under which the particle Lagrangian velocity process is
stationary. This measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the
underlying probability measure for the Eulerian flow.
