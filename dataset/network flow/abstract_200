In this paper we consider Riemannian manifolds $(M^n,g)$ of dimension $n \geq
5$, with semi-positive $Q$-curvature and non-negative scalar curvature. Under
these assumptions we prove $(i)$ the Paneitz operator satisfies a strong
maximum principle; $(ii)$ the Paneitz operator is a positive operator; and
$(iii)$ its Green's function is strictly positive. We then introduce a
non-local flow whose stationary points are metrics of constant positive
$Q$-curvature. Modifying the test function construction of Esposito-Robert, we
show that it is possible to choose an initial conformal metric so that the flow
has a sequential limit which is smooth and positive, and defines a conformal
metric of constant positive $Q$-curvature.
