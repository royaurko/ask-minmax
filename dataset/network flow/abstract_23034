We solve analytically the ellipsoidally expanding fireball hydrodynamics with
source terms in the momentum and the energy equations, using the
non-relativistic approximation. We find that energy transport from high pt jets
of gluons to the medium leads to a transient, exponential inflation of the
fireballs created in high energy heavy ion collisions. In this transient,
inflatory period, the slopes of the single particle spectra increase, while the
HBT radius parameters decrease exponentially with time. This effect is shown to
be similar to the development of the homogeneity of our Universe due to an
inflatory period. Independently of the initial conditions, and the exact value
of the freeze-out time and temperature, the meausurables (single particle
spectra, the correlation functions, the slope parameters, elliptic flow, HBT
radii and cross terms) become time independent during the late, non-inflatory
stages of the expansion, and they satisfy new kind of scaling laws. If the
expansion starts with a transient inflation caused by the gluon wind, it leads
naturally to large transverse flows and the simultaneous equality and scaling
behaviour of the HBT radius parameters, R_{side} \approx R_{out} \approx
R_{long} \approx t_f \sqrt{T_f/m}. With certain relativistic corrections, the
scaling limit is \tau_f \sqrt{T_f/m_t}, where m_t is the mean transverse mass
of the pair.
