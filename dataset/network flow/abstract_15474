Complex systems and their underlying convoluted networks are ubiquitous, all
we need is an eye for them. They pose problems of organized complexity which
cannot be approached with a reductionist method. Complexity science and its
emergent sister network science both come to grips with the inherent complexity
of complex systems with an holistic strategy. The relevance of complexity,
however, transcends the sciences. Complex systems and networks are the focal
point of a philosophical, cultural and artistic turn of our tightly
interrelated and interdependent postmodern society. Here I take a different,
aesthetic perspective on complexity. I argue that complex systems can be
beautiful and can the object of artification - the neologism refers to
processes in which something that is not regarded as art in the traditional
sense of the word is changed into art. Complex systems and networks are
powerful sources of inspiration for the generative designer, for the artful
data visualizer, as well as for the traditional artist. I finally discuss the
benefits of a cross-fertilization between science and art.
