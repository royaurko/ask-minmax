Spontaneous rotation of a droplet induced by the Marangoni flow is analyzed
in a two-dimensional system. The droplet with the small particle which supplies
a surfactant at the interface is considered. We calculated flow field around
the droplet using Stokes equation and found that advective nonlinearity breaks
symmetry for rotation. Theoretical calculation indicates that the droplet
spontaneously rotates when the radius of the droplet is an appropriate size.
The theoretical results were validated through comparison with the experiments.
