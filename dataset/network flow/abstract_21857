Non-equilibrium modifications of the nuclear equation of state are assessed
in the framework of Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics. The expected size of
the non-equilibrium corrections to quantities like the nuclear-matter
incompressibility $K$ and the liquid-vapor critical temperature $T_c$ are
compared to the uncertainties associated at present with the usual equilibrium
values. The quantitative estimates are obtained in situations characterized by
a stationary planar shear flow of realistic magnitude, or by a stationary
temperature gradient.
