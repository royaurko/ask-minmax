A multiple access relay channel (MARC) is considered in which an
analogue-like network coding is implemented in the relay node. This analogue
coding is a simple addition of the received signals at the relay node. Using
"nulling detection" structure employed in V-BLAST receiver, we propose a
detection scheme in the destination which is able to provide a diversity order
of two for all users. We analytically evaluate the performance of our proposed
scheme for the MARC with two users where tight upper bounds for both uncoded
and Convolutionally coded transmission blocks are provided. We verify our
analytical evaluations by simulations and compare the results with those of
noncooperative transmission and Alamouti's scheme for the same power and rate
transmission. Our results indicate that while our proposed scheme shows a
comparable performance compared to the Alamouti's scheme, it substantially
outperforms the non-cooperate transmission.
