Newell-Whitham type car-following model with hyperbolic tangent optimal
velocity function in a one-lane circuit has a finite set of the exact solutions
for steady traveling wave, which expressed by elliptic theta function. Each
solution of the set describes a density wave with definite number of
car-bunches in the circuit. By the numerical simulation, we observe a
transition process from a uniform flow to the one-bunch analytic solution,
which seems to be an attractor of the system. In the process, the system shows
a series of cascade transitions visiting the configurations closely similar to
the higher multi-bunch solutions in the set.
