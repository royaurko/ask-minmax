In this paper we describe the emergence of scale-free degree distributions
from statistical mechanics principles. We define an energy associated to a
degree sequence as the logarithm of the number of indistinguishable simple
networks it is possible to draw given the degree sequence. Keeping fixed the
total number of nodes and links, we show that the energy of scale-free
distribution is much higher than the energy associated to the degree sequence
of regular random graphs. This results unable us to estimate the annealed
average of the number of distinguishable simple graphs it is possible to draw
given a scale-free distribution with structural cutoff. In particular we shaw
that this number for large networks is strongly suppressed for power -law
exponent \gamma->2.
