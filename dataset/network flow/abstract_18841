We study the class of cooperative Boolean networks whose only regulatory
functions are COPY, binary AND, and binary OR. We prove that for all
sufficiently large N and c < 2 there exist Boolean networks in this class that
have an attractor of length > c^N whose basin of attraction comprises an
arbitrarily large fraction of the state space. The existence of such networks
contrasts with results on various other types of dynamical systems that show
nongenericity or absence of non-steady state attractors under the assumption of
cooperativity.
