We consider the design of cognitive Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols
enabling a secondary (unlicensed) transmitter-receiver pair to communicate over
the idle periods of a set of primary (licensed) channels. More specifically, we
propose cognitive MAC protocols optimized for both slotted and un-slotted
primary networks. For the slotted structure, the objective is to maximize the
secondary throughput while maintaining synchronization between the secondary
pair and not causing interference to the primary network. Our investigations
differentiate between two sensing scenarios. In the first, the secondary
transmitter is capable of sensing all the primary channels, whereas it senses
only a subset of the primary channels in the second scenario. In both cases, we
propose blind MAC protocols that efficiently learn the statistics of the
primary traffic on-line and asymptotically achieve the throughput obtained when
prior knowledge of primary traffic statistics is available. For the un-slotted
structure, the objective is to maximize the secondary throughput while
satisfying an interference constraint on the primary network. Sensing-dependent
periods are optimized for each primary channel yielding a MAC protocol which
outperforms previously proposed techniques that rely on a single sensing period
optimization.
