In the recent years it turned out that multidimensional recurrent neural
networks (MDRNN) perform very well for offline handwriting recognition tasks
like the OpenHaRT 2013 evaluation DIR. With suitable writing preprocessing and
dictionary lookup, our ARGUS software completed this task with an error rate of
26.27% in its primary setup.
