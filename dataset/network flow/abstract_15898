In the context of preventing and fighting crime, the analysis of mobile phone
traffic, among actors of a criminal network, is helpful in order to reconstruct
illegal activities on the base of the relationships connecting those specific
individuals. Thus, forensic analysts and investigators require new advanced
tools and techniques which allow them to manage these data in a meaningful and
efficient way. In this paper we present LogAnalysis, a tool we developed to
provide visual data representation and filtering, statistical analysis features
and the possibility of a temporal analysis of mobile phone activities. Its
adoption may help in unveiling the structure of a criminal network and the
roles and dynamics of communications among its components. By using
LogAnalysis, forensic investigators could deeply understand hierarchies within
criminal organizations, for example discovering central members that provide
connections among different sub-groups, etc. Moreover, by analyzing the
temporal evolution of the contacts among individuals, or by focusing on
specific time windows they could acquire additional insights on the data they
are analyzing. Finally, we put into evidence how the adoption of LogAnalysis
may be crucial to solve real cases, providing as example a number of case
studies inspired by real forensic investigations led by one of the contributors.
