Interference in wireless networks degrades the signal quality at the
terminals. However, it can potentially enhance the secrecy rate. This paper
investigates the secrecy rate in a two-user interference network where one of
the users, namely user 1, requires to establish a confidential connection. User
1 wants to prevent an unintended user of the network to decode its
transmission. User 1 has to transmit such that its secrecy rate is maximized
while the quality of service at the destination of the other user, user 2, is
satisfied, and both user's power limits are taken into account. We consider two
scenarios: 1) user 2 changes its power in favor of user 1, an altruistic
scenario, 2) user 2 is selfish and only aims to maintain the minimum quality of
service at its destination, an egoistic scenario. It is shown that there is a
threshold for user 2's transmission power that only below or above which,
depending on the channel qualities, user 1 can achieve a positive secrecy rate.
Closed-form solutions are obtained in order to perform joint optimal power
control. Further, a new metric called secrecy energy efficiency is introduced.
We show that in general, the secrecy energy efficiency of user 1 in an
interference channel scenario is higher than that of an interference-free
channel.
