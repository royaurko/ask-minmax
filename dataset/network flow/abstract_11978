We investigate numerically the dynamics of large networks of $N$ globally
pulse-coupled integrate and fire neurons in a noise-induced synchronized state.
The powerspectrum of an individual element within the network is shown to
exhibit in the thermodynamic limit ($N\to \infty$) a broadband peak and an
additional delta-function peak that is absent from the powerspectrum of an
isolated element. The powerspectrum of the mean output signal only exhibits the
delta-function peak. These results are explained analytically in an exactly
soluble oscillator model with global phase coupling.
