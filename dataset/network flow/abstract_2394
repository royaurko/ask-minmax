The question of the onset of the homochirality on prebiotic Earth still
remains a fundamental question in the quest for the origin of life. Recent
works in this field introduce the concept of recycling, rather than the
traditional open-flow system described by Frank. This approach has been
criticized by Blackmond et al. They claimed that such systems are
thermodynamically impossible, except in the cases where non-microreversible
reactions are introduced, like in photochemical reactions, or under the
influence of physical actions (e.g. by crystal crushing). This point of view
reveals misunderstandings about this model of a recycled system, overlooks the
possibility of energy exchanges that could take place in prebiotic systems, and
leads the contributors to unawarely remove the activation reaction and energy source
from their "non-equilibrium" models. It is especially important to understand
what are the concepts behind the notion of recycled systems, and of activation
reactions. These points are fundamental to comprehending how chemical systems
-- and especially prebiotic chemical systems -- can be maintained in
non-equilibrium steady states, and how free energy can be used and exchanged
between systems. The proposed approach aims at the decomposition of the
problem, avoiding to embrace the whole system at the same time.
