We study the mean traversal time for a class of random walks on Newman-Watts
small-world networks, in which steps around the edge of the network occur with
a transition rate F that is different from the rate f for steps across
small-world connections. When f >> F, the mean time to traverse the network
exhibits a transition associated with percolation of the random graph (i.e.,
small-world) part of the network, and a collapse of the data onto a universal
curve. This transition was not observed in earlier studies in which equal
transition rates were assumed for all allowed steps. We develop a simple
self-consistent effective medium theory and show that it gives a quantitatively
correct description of the traversal time in all parameter regimes except the
immediate neighborhood of the transition, as is characteristic of most
effective medium theories.
