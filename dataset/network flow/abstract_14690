The physical meaning of the vorticity of the matter content in G\"{o}del
spacetime is analyzed in some detail. As we shall see, unlike the situation in
general stationnary axially symmetric spacetimes (Lewis--Papapetrou), the
vorticity in G\"{o}del spacetime is not associated to a circular flow of
superenergy on the plane orthogonal to the vorticity vector. This fact might be
at the origin of the strange behaviour of gyroscopes in such spacetime. The
analysis emerging from the tilted version of G\"{o}del spacetime supports
further this point of view. In order to tell apart the two situations (with and
without circular flow of superenergy) we introduce two different definitions of
vorticity, related to the presence (absence) of such a flow.
