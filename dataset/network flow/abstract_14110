We write down and solve equations describing steady state, optically thin,
advection-dominated accretion onto a Kerr black hole. The mean flow, described
by the relativistic fluid equations, is axisymmetric and vertically averaged.
The effect of turbulence in the flow is represented by a viscous shear stress.
Our treatment differs in several important ways from earlier work: we use a
causal prescription for the shear stress, we do not assume the relativistic
enthalpy is unity (this is important for rapidly rotating holes), and we use a
relativistic equation of state. We present several representative solutions and
use them to evaluate the importance of relativistic effects, to check our
approximations, and to evaluate the robustness of the input physics. Detailed
properties of the solutions are described in an accompanying paper.
