This paper proposes an improved lattice Boltzmann scheme for incompressible
axisymmetric flows. The scheme has the following features. First, it is still
within the framework of the standard lattice Boltzmann method using the
single-particle density distribution function and consistent with the
philosophy of the lattice Boltzmann method. Second, the source term of the
scheme is simple and contains no velocity gradient terms. Owing to this
feature, the scheme is easy to implement. In addition, the singularity problem
at the axis can be appropriately handled without affecting an important
advantage of the lattice Boltzmann method: the easy treatment of boundary
conditions. The scheme is tested by simulating Hagen-Poiseuille flow,
three-dimensional Womersley flow, Wheeler benchmark problem in crystal growth,
and lid-driven rotational flow in cylindrical cavities. It is found that the
numerical results agree well with the analytical solutions and/or the results
reported in previous studies.
