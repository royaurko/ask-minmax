We study the one-loop renormalization of high-energy Lorentz violating four
fermion models. We derive general formulas and then consider a number of
specific models. We study the conditions for asymptotic freedom and give a
practical method to determine the asymptotic-freedom domain. We also point out
that in some models the RG flow contains "rational" Zimmermann trajectories
that might hide new symmetries.
