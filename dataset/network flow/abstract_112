A graph (digraph) $G=(V,E)$ with a set $T\subseteq V$ of terminals is called
inner Eulerian if each nonterminal node $v$ has even degree (resp. the numbers
of edges entering and leaving $v$ are equal). Cherkassky and Lov\'asz showed
that the maximum number of pairwise edge-disjoint $T$-paths in an inner
Eulerian graph $G$ is equal to $\frac12\sum_{s\in T} \lambda(s)$, where
$\lambda(s)$ is the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects $s$ and
$T-\{s\}$. A similar relation for inner Eulerian digraphs was established by
Lomonosov. Considering undirected and directed networks with ``inner Eulerian''
edge capacities, Ibaraki, Karzanov, and Nagamochi showed that the problem of
finding a maximum integer multiflow (where partial flows connect arbitrary
pairs of distinct terminals) is reduced to $O(\log T)$ maximum flow
computations and to a number of flow decompositions. In this paper we extend
the above max-min relation to inner Eulerian bidirected and skew-symmetric
graphs and develop an algorithm of complexity $O(VE\log T\log(2+V^2/E))$ for
the corresponding capacitated cases. In particular, this improves the known
bound for digraphs. Our algorithm uses a fast procedure for decomposing a flow
with O(1) sources and sinks in a digraph into the sum of one-source-one-sink
flows.
