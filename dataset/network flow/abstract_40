A blowup criteria along maximum point of the 3D-Navier-Stokes flow in terms
of function spaces with variable growth condition is constructed. This
criterion is different from the Beale-Kato-Majda type and Constantin-Fefferman
type criterion. If geometric behavior of the velocity vector field near the
maximum point has a kind of symmetry up to a possible blowup time, then the
solution can be extended to be the strong solution beyond the possible blowup
time.
