The structure of the layers of a phthalocyanines is studied through a
measurement of surface pressure-area isotherms at various initial surface
concentrations of the spreaded compound. Layer characteristics are determined
from experimental data by replotting the isotherms in accordance with M. Volmer
s equation. Neural networks taught on approximations of the isoterms. The
method is compared with the traditional least square one. Another task for NN
is a forecast of main characteristics of the layers.
