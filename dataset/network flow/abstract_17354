We present a class of solutions for a heat conducting fluid sphere, which
radiates energy during collapse without the appearance of horizon at the
boundary at any stage of the collapse. A simple model shows that there is no
accumulation of energy due to collapse since it radiates out at the same rate
as it is being generated.
