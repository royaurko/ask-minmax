General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a complex data network which upgrades
current second generation GSM networks, offering true high-speed internet (IP)
and network connectivity over existing GSM cellular networks. The increasing
population of mobile users leads to congestion problems in these systems, and
motivates the development of more efficient management schemes. This project
deals with radio resource and mobility management such as location management
and handoff management using distance method in GPRS networks. A simulator
based on MATLAB which can study the location updating is used in this GPRS
system.
