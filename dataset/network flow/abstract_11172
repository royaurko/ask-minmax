We derive analytic expressions for the possibility, probability, and expected
size of global spreading events starting from a single infected seed for a
broad collection of contagion processes acting on random networks with both
directed and undirected edges and arbitrary degree-degree correlations. Our
work extends previous theoretical developments for the undirected case, and we
provide numerical support for our findings by investigating an example class of
networks for which we are able to obtain closed-form expressions.
