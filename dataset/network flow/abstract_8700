We prove that singular vectors have measure zero with respect to any friendly
measure on $\Bbb R^n$ (e.g. the volume measure on a nondegenerate submanifold).
This generalizes special cases considered by Davenport-Schmidt, Baker and
Bugeaud. The main tool is quantitative nondivergence estimates for
quasi-polynomial flows on homogeneous spaces.
