We propose a new integrable N=2 supersymmetric Toda lattice hierarchy which
may be relevant for constructing a supersymmetric one-matrix model. We define
its first two Hamiltonian structures, the recursion operator and Lax--pair
representation. We provide partial evidence for the existence of an
infinite-dimensional N=2 superalgebra of its flows. We study its bosonic limit
and introduce new Lax-pair representations for the bosonic Toda lattice
hierarchy. Finally we discuss the relevance this approach for constructing N=2
supersymmetric generalized Toda lattice hierarchies.
