Reputation is a valuable asset in online social lives and it has drawn
increased attention. How to evaluate user reputation in online rating systems
is especially significant due to the existence of spamming attacks. To address
this issue, so far, a variety of methods have been proposed, including
network-based methods, quality-based methods and group-based ranking method. In
this paper, we propose an iterative group-based ranking (IGR) method by
introducing an iterative reputation-allocation process into the original
group-based ranking (GR) method. More specifically, users with higher
reputation have higher weights in dominating the corresponding group sizes. The
reputation of users and the corresponding group sizes are iteratively updated
until they become stable. Results on two real data sets suggest that the
proposed IGR method has better performance and its robustness is considerably
improved comparing with the original GR method. Our work highlights the
positive role of users' grouping behavior towards a better reputation
evaluation.
