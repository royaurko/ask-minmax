A geometric flow on $(2,2)$-forms is introduced which preserves the balanced
condition of metrics, and whose stationary points satisfy the anomaly equation
in Strominger systems. The existence of solutions for a short time is
established, using Hamilton's version of the Nash-Moser implicit function
theorem.
