The increasing number of cameras and a handful of human operators to monitor
the video inputs from hundreds of cameras leave the system ill equipped to
fulfil the task of detecting anomalies. Thus, there is a dire need to
automatically detect regions that require immediate attention for a more
effective and proactive surveillance. We propose a framework that utilises the
temporal variations in the flow field of a crowd scene to automatically detect
salient regions, while eliminating the need to have prior knowledge of the
scene or training. We deem the flow fields to be a dynamic system and adopt the
stability theory of dynamical systems, to determine the motion dynamics within
a given area. In the context of this work, salient regions refer to areas with
high motion dynamics, where points in a particular region are unstable.
Experimental results on public, crowd scenes have shown the effectiveness of
the proposed method in detecting salient regions which correspond to unstable
flow, occlusions, bottlenecks, entries and exits.
