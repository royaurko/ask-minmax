A low flow, $\delta f$ gyrokinetic formulation to obtain the intrinsic
rotation profiles is presented. The momentum conservation equation in the low
flow ordering contains new terms, neglected in previous first principles
formulations, that may explain the intrinsic rotation observed in tokamaks in
the absence of external sources of momentum. The intrinsic rotation profile
depends on the density and temperature profiles and on the up-down asymmetry.
