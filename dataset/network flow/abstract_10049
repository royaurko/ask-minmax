The effect of flow shear on turbulent transport in tokamaks is studied
numerically in the experimentally relevant limit of zero magnetic shear. It is
found that the plasma is linearly stable for all non-zero flow shear values,
but that subcritical turbulence can be sustained nonlinearly at a wide range of
temperature gradients. Flow shear increases the nonlinear temperature gradient
threshold for turbulence but also increases the sensitivity of the heat flux to
changes in the temperature gradient, except over a small range near the
threshold where the sensitivity is decreased. A bifurcation in the equilibrium
gradients is found: for a given input of heat, it is possible, by varying the
applied torque, to trigger a transition to significantly higher temperature and
flow gradients.
