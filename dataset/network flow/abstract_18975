We are interested in high data rates internet access, by the mean of LTE
based wireless networks. In the aim to improve performance of wireless
networks, we propose an approach focused on the use of UE equipped by
directional receiving antennas. Indeed, these antennas allow to mitigate the
interference and to improve the link budget. Therefore, the Signal to
Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) can be improved, and consequently the
performance and quality of service (QoS), too. We establish the analytical
expression of the SINR reached by a user with directional antenna, whatever its
location. This expression shows that directional antennas allow an improvement
of the SINR, and to quantify it. We develop different scenarios to compare the
use of directional antennas instead of omnidirectional ones. They allow to
quantify the impact of directional antennas in terms of performance and QoS.
