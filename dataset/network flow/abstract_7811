Given a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M with a quasigeodesic flow we construct
a \pi_1-equivariant sphere-filling curve in the boundary of hyperbolic space.
Specifically, we show that any complete transversal P to the lifted flow on H^3
has a natural compactification as a closed disc that inherits a \pi_1 action.
The embedding of P in H^3 extends continuously to the compactification and the
restriction to the boundary is a surjective \pi_1-equivariant map from S^1 to
S^2_\infty. This generalizes the result of Cannon and Thurston for fibered
hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
