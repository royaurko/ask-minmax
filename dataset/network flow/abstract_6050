Random walks are gaining much attention from the networks research community.
They are the basis of many proposals aimed to solve a variety of
network-related problems such as resource location, network construction, nodes
sampling, etc. This interest on random walks is justified by their inherent
properties. They are very simple to implement as nodes only require local
information to take routing decisions. Also, random walks demand little
processing power and bandwidth. Besides, they are very resilient to changes on
the network topology.
  Here, we quantify the effectiveness of random walks as a search mechanism in
one-hop replication networks: networks where each node knows its neighbors'
identity/resources, and so it can reply to queries on their behalf. Our model
focuses on estimating the expected average search time of the random walk by
applying network queuing theory. To do this, we must provide first the expected
average search length. This is computed by means of estimations of the expected
average coverage at each step of the random walk. This model takes into account
the revisiting effect: the fact that, as the random walk progresses, the
probability of arriving to nodes already visited increases, which impacts on
how the network coverage evolves. That is, we do not model the coverage as a
memoryless process. Furthermore, we conduct a series of simulations to
evaluate, in practice, the above mentioned metrics. Our results show a very
close correlation between the analytical and the experimental results.
