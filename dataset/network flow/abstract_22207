In this work, we show that the periodic defocusing Ablowitz-Ladik equation
can be expressed as an isospectral deformation of Floquet CMV matrices. We then
introduce a Poisson Lie group whose underlying group is a loop group and show
that the set of Floquet CMV matrices is a Coxeter dressing orbit of this
Poisson Lie group. By using the group-theoretic framework, we establish the
Liouville integrability of the equation by constructing action-angle variables,
we also solve the Hamiltonian equations generated by the commuting flows via
Riemann-Hilbert factorization problems.
