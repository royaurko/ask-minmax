In this paper we study the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with artificial
compressibility. The main results of this work are the existence and uniqueness
theorem for strong solutions and the limit to incompressible flow. These
results are obtained by utilizing a local monotonicity property of the sum of
the Stokes operator and the nonlinearity.
