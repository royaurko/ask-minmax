We consider a class of dynamical systems on a Lie group $G$ with a
left-invariant metric and right-invariant nonholonomic constraints (so called
LR systems) and show that, under a generic condition on the constraints, such
systems can be regarded as generalized Chaplygin systems on the principle
bundle $G \to Q=G/H$, $H$ being a Lie subgroup. In contrast to generic
Chaplygin systems, the reductions of our LR systems onto the homogeneous space
$Q$ always possess an invariant measure.
  We study the case $G=SO(n)$, when LR systems are multidimensional
generalizations of the Veselova problem of a nonholonomic rigid body motion,
which admit a reduction to systems with an invariant measure on the (co)tangent
bundle of Stiefel varieties $V(k,n)$ as the corresponding homogeneous spaces.
  For $k=1$ and a special choice of the left-invariant metric on SO(n), we
prove that under a change of time, the reduced system becomes an integrable
Hamiltonian system describing a geodesic flow on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$.
This provides a first example of a nonholonomic system with more than two
degrees of freedom for which the celebrated Chaplygin reducibility theorem is
applicable. In this case we also explicitly reconstruct the motion on the group
SO(n).
