We calculate a series of synthetic X-ray spectra from outflows originating
from the obscuring torus in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Such modeling
includes 2.5D hydrodynamical simulations of an X-ray excited torus wind,
including the effects of X-ray heating, ionization, and radiation pressure. 3D
radiation transfer calculations are performed in the 3D Sobolev approximation.
Synthetic X-ray line spectra and individual profiles of several strong lines
are shown at different inclination angles, observing times, and for different
characteristics of the torus.
  Our calculations show that rich synthetic warm absorber spectra from 3D
modeling are typically observed at a larger range of inclinations than was
previously inferred from simple analysis of the transmitted spectra. In
general, our results are supportive of warm absorber models based on the
hypothesis of an "X-ray excited funnel flow" and are consistent with
characteristics of such flows inferred from observations of warm absorbers from
Seyfert 1 galaxies.
