An isospectral hierarchy of commutative integrable systems associated with a
polynomial spectral problem is proposed. The resulting hierarchy possesses a
recursion structure controlled by a hereditary operator. The nonisospectral
flows generate the time first order dependent symmetries of the isospectral
hierarchy, which constitute Virasoro symmetry algebras together with
commutative symmetries.
