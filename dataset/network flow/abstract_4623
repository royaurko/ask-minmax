We analyse the homogeneous instabilities in a nematic liquid crystal
subjected to plane steady Couette or Poiseuille flow in the case when the
director is pre-aligned perpendicular to the flow plane taking into account
weak anchoring at the confining surfaces. The critical shear rate decreases for
decreasing anchoring strength and goes to zero in the limit of torque-free
boundary conditions. For Poiseuille flow one has two types of instability
depending on the values of the azimuthal ($W_a$) and polar ($W_p$) surface
anchoring strengths. The critical line in $(W_a,W_p)$ space which separates the
two instabilities regimes is obtained.
