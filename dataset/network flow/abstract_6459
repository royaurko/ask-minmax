Transmission control protocol (TCP) is a connection oriented protocol for
several types of distributed applications. TCP is reliable particularly for
traditional fixed networks. With emergence of faster wireless networks, TCP has
been performing poorly in its original format. The performance of TCP is
affected due to assorted factors including congestion window, maximum packet
size, retry limit, recovery mechanism, backup mechanism and mobility. To
overcome deficiency of original TCP, Several modifications have been introduced
to improve network quality. The mobility is a major hurdle in degrading the
performance of mobile wireless networks. In this paper, we introduce and
implement new TCP variant University of Bridgeport (UB) that combines the
features of TCP Westwood and Vegas. We examine the performance of TCP-UB, Vegas
and Westwood using different realistic scenarios. NS2 simulator demonstrates
the stability of TCP-UB as compared with TCP Vegas and Westwood in highly
congested networks from the mobility point of view.
