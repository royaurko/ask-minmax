We present mesoscopic simulations of the counterion-induced electroosmotic
flow in different electrostatic coupling regimes. Two simulation methods are
compared, Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) and coupled
Lattice-Boltzmann/Molecular Dynamics (LB/MD). A general mapping scheme to match
DPD to LB/MD is developed. For the weak-coupling regime, analytic expressions
for the flow profiles in the presence of partial-slip as well as no-slip
boundary conditions are derived from the Poisson-Boltzmann and Stokes
equations, which are in good agreement with the numerical results. The
influence of electrofriction and partial slip on the flow profiles is
discussed.
