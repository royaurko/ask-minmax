Plankton research has always been an important area of biology. Due to
various environmental issues and other research interests, plankton hatching
and harnessing has been extremely red-marked zone for bio-aqua scientists
recently. To counter this problem, no wireless sensor assisted technique or
mechanism has yet not been devised. In this literature, we propose a novel
approach to pursue this task by the virtue of a theoretical Bio-inspired model
named Hatch-Sens, to automatically monitor different parameters of plankton
hatching in laboratory environment. This literature illustrates the concepts
and detailed mechanisms to accumulate this given problem. Hatch-Sens is a novel
idea which combines the biology with computer in its sensing network to monitor
hatching parameters of Artemia salina. This model reduces the manual tiresome
monitoring of hatching of plankton culture by wireless sensor network.
