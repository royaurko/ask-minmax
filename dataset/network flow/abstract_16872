We consider Content Centric Network (CCN) interest forwarding problem as a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem with delays. We investigate the transient
behaviour of the $\eps$-greedy, tuned $\eps$-greedy and Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) interest forwarding policies. Surprisingly, for all the three policies
very short initial exploratory phase is needed. We demonstrate that the tuned
$\eps$-greedy algorithm is nearly as good as the UCB algorithm, the best
currently available algorithm. We prove the uniform logarithmic bound for the
tuned $\eps$-greedy algorithm. In addition to its immediate application to CCN
interest forwarding, the new theoretical results for MAB problem with delays
represent significant theoretical advances in machine learning discipline.
