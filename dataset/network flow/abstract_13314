We prove resolvent estimates for semiclassical operators such as $-h^2
\Delta+V(x)$ in scattering situations. Provided the set of trapped classical
trajectories supports a chaotic flow and is sufficiently filamentary, the
analytic continuation of the resolvent is bounded by $h^{-M}$ in a strip whose
width is determined by a certain topological pressure associated with the
classical flow. This polynomial estimate has applications to local smoothing in
Schr\"odinger propagation and to energy decay of solutions to wave equations.
