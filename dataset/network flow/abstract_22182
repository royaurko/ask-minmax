In this fluid dynamics video, we present a visualization of the primary
atomization of a turbulent liquid jet injected into a turbulent gaseous
crossflow. It is based on a detailed numerical simulation of the primary
atomization region of the jet using a finite volume, balanced force,
incompressible LES/DNS flow solver coupled to a Refined Level Set Grid (RLSG)
solver to track the phase interface position. The visualization highlights the
two distinct breakup modes of the jet: the column breakup mode of the main
liquid column and the ligament breakup mode on the sides of the jet and
highlights the complex evolution of the phase interface geometry.
