Recent measurement studies show that there are massively distributed hosting
and computing infrastructures deployed in the Internet. Such infrastructures
include large data centers and organizations' computing clusters. When idle,
these resources can readily serve local users. Such users can be smartphone or
tablet users wishing to access services such as remote desktop or CPU/bandwidth
intensive activities. Particularly, when they are likely to have high latency
to access, or may have no access at all to, centralized cloud providers. Today,
however, there is no global marketplace where sellers and buyers of available
resources can trade. The recently introduced marketplaces of Amazon and other
cloud infrastructures are limited by the network footprint of their own
infrastructures and availability of such services in the target country and
region. In this article we discuss the potentials for a federated cloud
marketplace where sellers and buyers of a number of resources, including
storage, computing, and network bandwidth, can freely trade. This ecosystem can
be regulated through brokers who act as service level monitors and auctioneers.
We conclude by discussing the challenges and opportunities in this space.
