In this study, we provide a novel approach for modelling the mixed traffic
flow. The basic idea is to integrate models for nonmotorized vehicles
(nm-vehicles) with models for motorized vehicles (m-vehicles). Based on the
idea, a model for mix traffic flow is realized in in the following two steps.
At a first step, the models that can be integrated should be chosen. The famous
NaSch cellular automata (NCA) model for m-vehicles and the Burgur cellular
automata (BCA) model for nm-vehicles are used in this paper, since the two
models are similar and comparable. At a second step, we should study coupling
rules between m-vehicles and nm-vehicles to represent their interaction.
Special lane changing rules are designed for the coupling process. The proposed
model is named as the combined cellular automata (CCA) model. The model is
applied to a typical mixed traffic scenario, where a bus stop without special
stop bay is set on nonmotorized lanes. The simulation results show that the
model can describe both the interaction between the flow of nm-vehicles and
m-vehicles and their characters.
