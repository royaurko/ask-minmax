In order to compare social organization of a medieval peasantry before and
after the Hundred Years' War we study the sructure of social networks built
from a corpus of agrarian contracts. Low diameters and high clusterings show
small-world graphs. Like many other networks studied these last years these
graphs are scale-free. The distributions of the vertex degrees are fitted by a
truncated power law. Moreover they have a rich-club : a dense core with a low
diameter consisting of vertices with high degree. The particular shape of the
laplacian spectrum allows us to extract communities that are spread along a
star whose center is the rich-club.
