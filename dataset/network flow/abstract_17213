An automatic method for the selection of subsets of images, both modern and
historic, out of a set of landmark large images collected from the Internet is
presented in this paper. This selection depends on the extraction of dominant
features using Gabor filtering. Features are selected carefully from a
preliminary image set and fed into a neural network as a training data. The
method collects a large set of raw landmark images containing modern and
historic landmark images and non-landmark images. The method then processes
these images to classify them as landmark and non-landmark images. The
classification performance highly depends on the number of candidate features
of the landmark.
