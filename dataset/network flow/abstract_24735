Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) require flexible probability
models that can be efficiently learned and sampled. Autoencoders (AE) are
generative stochastic networks with these desired properties. We integrate a
special type of AE, the Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), into an EDA and evaluate
the performance of DAE-EDA on several combinatorial optimization problems with
a single objective. We asses the number of fitness evaluations as well as the
required CPU times. We compare the results to the performance to the Bayesian
Optimization Algorithm (BOA) and RBM-EDA, another EDA which is based on a
generative neural network which has proven competitive with BOA. For the
considered problem instances, DAE-EDA is considerably faster than BOA and
RBM-EDA, sometimes by orders of magnitude. The number of fitness evaluations is
higher than for BOA, but competitive with RBM-EDA. These results show that DAEs
can be useful tools for problems with low but non-negligible fitness evaluation
costs.
