We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the subalgebra of analytic
elements associated with a periodic C*-dynamical system to be a maximal
norm-closed subalgebra. Our conditions are in terms of the Arveson spectrum of
the action. We also describe equivalent properties of the system in terms of
the strong Connes spectrum and the simplicity of the crossed product.
