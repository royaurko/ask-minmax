This paper studies linear classes of planar quasiregular mappings. We give a
positive answer to a conjecture of K. Astala, T. Iwaniec, and G. Martin (2009)
on reduced Beltrami equations. Moreover, we use it to prove a Wronsky-type
theorem for general linear Beltrami systems. This is a key to show that the
associated Beltrami equation of a linear quasiregular family is unique.
