We have performed a detailed investigation on the world investment networks
constructed from the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) data of the
International Monetary Fund, ranging from 2001 to 2006. The distributions of
degrees and node strengthes are scale-free. The weight distributions can be
well modeled by the Weibull distribution. The maximum flow spanning trees of
the world investment networks possess two universal allometric scaling
relations, independent of time and the investment type. The topological scaling
exponent is $1.17\pm0.02$ and the flow scaling exponent is $1.03\pm0.01$.
