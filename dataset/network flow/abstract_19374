Taylor--Couette flow in the presence of a magnetic field is a problem
belonging to classical hydromagnetics and deserves to be more widely studied
than it has been to date. In the nonlinear regime the literature is scarce. We
develop a formulation suitable for solution of the full three dimensional
nonlinear hydromagnetic equations in cylindrical geometry, which is motived by
the formulation for the magnetic field. It is suitable for study at finite
magnetic Prandtl numbers and in the small Prandtl number limit, relevant to
laboratory liquid metals. The method is used to determine the onset of
axisymmetric Taylor vortices, and finite amplitude solutions. Our results
compare well with existing linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic calculations and
with hydromagnetic experiments.
