In this paper, a steady axisymmetric MHD flow of two dimensional in-
compressible fluids has been investigated. Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
Method (RKHSM) is implemented to obtain solution of reduced fourth order
nonlinear boundary value problem. Numerical results have been compared with the
resutls that obtained by the Range-Kutta Method (RK-4) and Optimal Homotopy
Asymptotic Method (OHAM).
