In this paper we investigate a kind of generalized Ricci flow which possesses
a gradient form. We study the monotonicity of the given function under the
generalized Ricci flow and prove that the related system of partial
differential equations are strictly and uniformly parabolic. Based on this, we
show that the generalized Ricci flow defined on a $n$-dimensional compact
Riemannian manifold admits a unique short-time smooth solution. Moreover, we
also derive the evolution equations for the curvatures, which play an important
role in our future study.
