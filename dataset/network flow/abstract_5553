In recent years, video-related services such as YouTube and Netflix have
generated huge amounts of traffic and the network neutrality debate has emerged
as a major issue. In this paper, we consider feasibility of using a hybrid of
unicast and broadcast in cellular networks for high-traffic services (e.g.,
video streaming), from the perspective of cost effectiveness. To reflect
spatial characteristics of base stations (BSs) and mobile users (MUs), we use
the stochastic geometry approach where BSs and MUs are modeled as independent
homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs). With these assumptions and results,
we show how to cope with the trade-off between broadcast and unicast for
providing the service with affordable cost levels and reduced network load.
Moreover, we propose the so called periodic broadcasting service, where popular
video contents are periodically broadcast over cellular networks. This service
will make a positive impact on the network neutrality debate by stimulating
cooperation between mobile network operators (MNOs) and content providers
(CPs).
