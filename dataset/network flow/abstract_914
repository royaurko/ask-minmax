In the paper we consider the linear underdetermined system of a special type.
Systems of this type appear in non-homogeneous network flow programming
problems in the form of systems of constraints and can be characterized as
systems with a large sparse submatrix representing the embedded network
structure. We develop a direct method for finding solutions of the system. The
algorithm is based on the theoretic-graph specificities for the structure of
the support and properties of the basis of a solution space of a homogeneous
system. One of the key steps is decomposition of the system. A simple example
is regarded at the end of the paper.
