A hydrodynamic formulation for accretion flow channeled by a dipolar magnetic
field is constructed using a curvi-linear coordinate system natural to the
field structure. We solve the hydrodynamic equations and determine the
velocity, density and temperature profiles of the post-shock accretion flow.
The results are applied to accretion flows in intermediate polars. We have
found that for systems with massive white dwarfs (~1Msolar) the temperature
profiles in the flow can differ significantly to those obtained from models in
which the accretion column is assumed to be cylindrical.
