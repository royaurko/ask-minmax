We consider the problem of scheduling in multihop wireless networks subject
to interference constraints. We consider a graph based representation of
wireless networks, where scheduled links adhere to the K-hop link interference
model. We develop a distributed greedy heuristic for this scheduling problem.
Further, we show that this distributed greedy heuristic computes the exact same
schedule as the centralized greedy heuristic.
