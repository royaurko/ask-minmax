We propose a technique to realize a tachyonic band structure in a coherent
network, such as an array of coupled ring resonators. This is achieved by
adding "PT symmetric" spatially-balanced gain and loss to each node of the
network. In a square-lattice network, the quasi-energy bandstructure exhibits a
tachyonic dispersion relation, centered at either the center or corner of the
Brillouin zone. There is one tachyonic hyperboloid in each gap, unlike in
PT-symmetric tight-binding honeycomb lattices where the hyperboloids occur in
pairs. The dispersion relation can be probed by measuring the peaks in
transmission across a finite network as the gain/loss parameter is varied.
