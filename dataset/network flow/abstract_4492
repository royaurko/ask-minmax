We show that the network coding and index coding problems are equivalent.
This equivalence holds in the general setting which includes linear and
non-linear codes. Specifically, we present an efficient reduction that maps a
network coding instance to an index coding one while preserving feasibility.
Previous connections were restricted to the linear case.
