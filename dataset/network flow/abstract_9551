Reconstructing the connections between the nodes of a network is a problem of
fundamental importance in the study of neuronal and genetic networks. An
underlying related problem is that of observability, i.e., identifying the
conditions under which such a reconstruction is possible. In this paper we
consider observability of complex dynamical networks,for which we aim at
identifying both node and edge states. We use a graphical approach, which we
apply to both the Node Inference Diagram (NID) and the Node Edge Inference
Diagram (NEID) of the network. We investigate the relationship between the
observability of the NID and that of the NEID network representations and
conclude that the latter can be derived from the former, under general
assumptions. We further consider the effects of graph symmetries on
observability and we show how a minimal set of outputs can be selected to
obtain observability in the presence of graph symmetries.
