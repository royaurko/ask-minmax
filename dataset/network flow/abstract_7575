An experimental analysis of small-scales anisotropic turbulent fluctuations
has been performed in two different flows. We analyzed anisotropic properties
of an homogeneous shear flows and of a turbulent boundary layer by means of two
cross-wire probes to obtain multi-point multi-component measurements. Data are
analyzed at changing inter-probe separation without the use of Taylor
hypothesis. The results are consistent with the ``exponent-only'' scenario for
universality, i.e. all experimental data can be fit by fixing the same set of
anisotropic scaling exponents at changing only prefactors, for different shear
intensities and boundary conditions.
