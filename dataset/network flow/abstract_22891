In this article we will introduce a new model to describe the leading order
behavior of an ideal and axisymmetric fluid moving in a very narrow domain.
After providing a formal derivation of the model, we will prove the
well-posedness and provide a rigorous mathematical justification for the formal
derivation under a new sign condition. Finally, a blowup result regarding this
model will be discussed as well.
