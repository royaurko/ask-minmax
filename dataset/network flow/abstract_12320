Recently, Harrington et al.\ (2013) presented an outreach effort to introduce
school students to network science and explain why researchers who study
networks should be involved in such outreach activities. Based on the modules
they designed and their comments on the success and failures of the activity,
we have carried out a sequel with students from a high school in Madrid, Spain.
We report on how we developed it and the changes we made to the original
material.
