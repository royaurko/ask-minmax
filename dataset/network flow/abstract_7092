Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold and $\Omega$ a compact domain of $M$ with
smooth boundary. We study the solution of the heat equation on $\Omega$ having
constant unit initial conditions and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The purpose
of this paper is to study the geometry of domains for which, at any fixed value
of time, the normal derivative of the solution (heat flow) is a constant
function on the boundary. We express this fact by saying that such domains have
the constant flow property. In constant curvature spaces known examples of such
domains are given by geodesic balls and, more generally, by domains whose
boundary is connected and isoparametric. The question is: are they all like
that?
  In this paper we give an affirmative answer to this question: in fact we
prove more generally that, if a domain in an analytic Riemannian manifold has
the constant flow property, then every component of its boundary is an
isoparametric hypersurface. For space forms, we also relate the order of
vanishing of the heat content with fixed boundary data with the constancy of
the $r$-mean curvatures of the boundary and with the isoparametric property.
Finally, we discuss the constant flow property in relation to other well-known
overdetermined problems involving the Laplace operator, like the Serrin problem
or the Schiffer problem.
