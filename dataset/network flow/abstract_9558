We investigate assortativity of functional brain networks before, during, and
after one-hundred epileptic seizures with different anatomical onset locations.
We construct binary functional networks from multi-channel
electroencephalographic data recorded from 60 epilepsy patients, and from
time-resolved estimates of the assortativity coefficient we conclude that
positive degree-degree correlations are inherent to seizure dynamics. While
seizures evolve, an increasing assortativity indicates a segregation of the
underlying functional network into groups of brain regions that are only
sparsely interconnected, if at all. Interestingly, assortativity decreases
already prior to seizure end. Together with previous observations of
characteristic temporal evolutions of global statistical properties and
synchronizability of epileptic brain networks, our findings may help to gain
deeper insights into the complicated dynamics underlying generation,
propagation, and termination of seizures.
