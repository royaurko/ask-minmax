We introduce a ``spatial'' Lyapunov exponent to characterize the complex
behavior of non chaotic but convectively unstable flow systems. This complexity
is of spatial type and is due to sensitivity to the boundary conditions. We
show that there exists a relation between the spatial-complexity index we
define and the comoving Lyapunov exponents. In these systems the transition to
chaos, i.e. the appearing of a positive Lyapunov exponent, can take place in
two different ways. In the first one (from neither chaotic nor spatially
complex behavior to chaos) one has the typical scenario; that is, as the system
size grows up the spectrum of the Lyapunov exponents gives rise to a density.
In the second one (when the chaos develops from a convectively unstable
situation) one observes only a finite number of positive Lyapunov exponents.
