Based on two dissipative models, universal asymptotic behavior of flow
equations for Hamiltonians is found and discussed. Universal asymptotic
behavior only depends on fundamental bath properties but not on initial system
parameters, and the integro-differential equations possess an universal
attractor. The asymptotic flow of the Hamiltonian can be characterized by a
non-local differential equation which only depends on one parameter -
independent of the dissipative system or truncation scheme. Since the fixed
point Hamiltonian is trivial, the physical information is completely
transferred to the transformation of the observables. This yields a more stable
flow which is crucial for the numerical evaluation of correlation functions.
Furthermore, the low energy behavior of correlation functions is determined
analytically. The presented procedure can also be applied if relevant
perturbations are present as is demonstrated by evaluating dynamical
correlation functions for sub-Ohmic environments. It can further be generalized
to other dissipative systems.
