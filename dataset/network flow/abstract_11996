We study the distribution function for minimal paths in small-world networks.
Using properties of this distribution function, we derive analytic results
which greatly simplify the numerical calculation of the average minimal
distance, $\bar{\ell}$, and its variance, $\sigma^2$. We also discuss the
scaling properties of the distribution function. Finally, we study the limit of
large system sizes and obtain some analytic results.
