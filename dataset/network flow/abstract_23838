We investigate the consensus problem in a network where nodes communicate via
diffusion-based molecular communication (DbMC). In DbMC, messages are conveyed
via the variation in the concentration of molecules in the medium. Every node
acquires sensory information about the environment. Communication enables the
nodes to reach the best estimate for that measurement, e.g., the average of the
initial estimates by all nodes. We consider an iterative method for
communication among nodes that enables information spreading and averaging in
the network. We show that the consensus can be attained after a finite number
of iterations and variance of estimates of nodes can be made arbitrarily small
via communication.
