We study vibrated granular media, investigating each of the three components
of the energy flow: particle-particle dissipation, energy input at the
vibrating wall, and particle-wall dissipation. Energy dissipated by
interparticle collisions is well estimated by existing theories when the
granular material is dilute, and these theories are extended to include
rotational kinetic energy. When the granular material is dense, the observed
particle-particle dissipation rate decreases to as little as 2/5 of the
theoretical prediction. We observe that the rate of energy input is the weight
of the granular material times an average vibration velocity times a function
of the ratio of particle to vibration velocity. `Particle-wall' dissipation has
been neglected in all theories up to now, but can play an important role when
the granular material is dilute. The ratio between gravitational potential
energy and kinetic energy can vary by as much as a factor of 3. Previous
simulations and experiments have shown that E ~ V^delta, with delta=2 for
dilute granular material, and delta ~ 1.5 for dense granular material. We
relate this change in exponent to the departure of particle-particle
dissipation from its theoretical value.
