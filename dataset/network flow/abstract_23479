In order to address basic questions of importance to microrheology, we study
the dynamics of a rigid sphere embedded in a model viscoelastic medium
consisting of an elastic network permeated by a viscous fluid. We calculate the
complete response of a single bead in this medium to an external force and
compare the result to the commonly-accepted, generalized Stokes-Einstein
relation (GSER). We find that our response function is well approximated by the
GSER only within a particular frequency range determined by the material
parameters of both the bead and the network. We then discuss the relevance of
this result to recent experiments. Finally we discuss the approximations made
in our solution of the response function by comparing our results to the exact
solution for the response function of a bead in a viscous (Newtonian) fluid.
