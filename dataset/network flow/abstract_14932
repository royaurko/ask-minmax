The small-world network model is a simple model of the structure of social
networks, which simultaneously possesses characteristics of both regular
lattices and random graphs. The model consists of a one-dimensional lattice
with a low density of shortcuts added between randomly selected pairs of
points. These shortcuts greatly reduce the typical path length between any two
points on the lattice. We present a mean-field solution for the average path
length and for the distribution of path lengths in the model. This solution is
exact in the limit of large system size and either large or small number of
shortcuts.
