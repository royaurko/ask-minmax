The whole frame of interconnections in complex networks hinges on a specific
set of structural nodes, much smaller than the total size, which, if activated,
would cause the spread of information to the whole network [1]; or, if
immunized, would prevent the diffusion of a large scale epidemic [2,3].
Localizing this optimal, i.e. minimal, set of structural nodes, called
influencers, is one of the most important problems in network science [4,5].
Despite the vast use of heuristic strategies to identify influential spreaders
[6-14], the problem remains unsolved. Here, we map the problem onto optimal
percolation in random networks to identify the minimal set of influencers,
which arises by minimizing the energy of a many-body system, where the form of
the interactions is fixed by the non-backtracking matrix [15] of the network.
Big data analyses reveal that the set of optimal influencers is much smaller
than the one predicted by previous heuristic centralities. Remarkably, a large
number of previously neglected weakly-connected nodes emerges among the optimal
influencers. These are topologically tagged as low-degree nodes surrounded by
hierarchical coronas of hubs, and are uncovered only through the optimal
collective interplay of all the influencers in the network. Eventually, the
present theoretical framework may hold a larger degree of universality, being
applicable to other hard optimization problems exhibiting a continuous
transition from a known phase [16].
