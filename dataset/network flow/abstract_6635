A fundamental process in the implementation of any numerical tensor network
algorithm is that of contracting a tensor network. In this process, a network
made up of multiple tensors connected by summed indices is reduced to a single
tensor or a number by evaluating the index sums. This article presents a MATLAB
function ncon(), or "Network CONtractor", which accepts as its input a tensor
network and a contraction sequence describing how this network may be reduced
to a single tensor or number. As its output it returns that single tensor or
number. The function ncon() may be obtained by downloading the source of this
preprint.
