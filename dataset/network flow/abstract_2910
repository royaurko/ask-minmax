One of the main objectives of cloud computing providers is increasing the
revenue of their cloud datacenters by accommodating virtual network requests as
many as possible. However, arrival and departure of virtual network requests
fragment physical network's resources and reduce the possibility of accepting
more virtual network requests. To increase the number of virtual network
requests accommodated by fragmented physical networks, we propose two virtual
network embedding algorithms, which coarsen virtual networks using Heavy Edge
Matching (HEM) technique and embed coarsened virtual networks on best-fit
sub-substrate networks. The performance of the proposed algorithms are
evaluated and compared with existing algorithms using extensive simulations,
which show that the proposed algorithms increase the acceptance ratio and the
revenue.
