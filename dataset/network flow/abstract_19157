Wireless sensor network (WSN) has attracted researchers worldwide to explore
the research opportunities, with application mainly in health monitoring,
industry automation, battlefields, home automation and environmental
monitoring. A WSN is highly resource constrained in terms of energy,
computation and memory. WSNs deployment ranges from the normal working
environment up to hostile and hazardous environment such as in volcano
monitoring and underground mines. These characteristics of WSNs hold additional
set of challenges in front of the operating system designer. The objective of
this survey is to highlight the features and weakness of the opearting system
available for WSNs, with the focus on the current application demands. The
paper also discusses the operating system design issues in terms of
architecture, programming model, scheduling and memory management and support
for real time applications.
