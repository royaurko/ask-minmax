The Small World phenomenon has inspired researchers across a number of
fields. A breakthrough in its understanding was made by Kleinberg who
introduced Rank Based Augmentation (RBA): add to each vertex independently an
arc to a random destination selected from a carefully crafted probability
distribution. Kleinberg proved that RBA makes many networks navigable, i.e., it
allows greedy routing to successfully deliver messages between any two vertices
in a polylogarithmic number of steps. We prove that navigability is an inherent
property of many random networks, arising without coordination, or even
independence assumptions.
