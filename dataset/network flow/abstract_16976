We consider a stochastic network with mobile users in a heavy-traffic regime.
We derive the scaling limit of the multi-dimensional queue length process and
prove a form of spatial state space collapse. The proof exploits a recent
result by Lambert and Simatos which provides a general principle to establish
scaling limits of regenerative processes based on the convergence of their
excursions. We also prove weak convergence of the sequences of stationary joint
queue length distributions and stationary sojourn times.
