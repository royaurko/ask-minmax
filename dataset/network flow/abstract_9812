Flux flow properties for clean and dirty superconducting limits in strong
pinning niobium films are studied. Measurements of electric field vs current
density characteristics at high J values (J = 10^{6} A/cm^{2}) are successfully
compared to theoretical models of flux flow and of flux flow instability in a
large range of temperatures and magnetic fields. The non-linear regime at high
dissipation is analysed in the frame of a modified Larkin Ovchinnikov model
that takes into account a quasiparticles heating effect. This model elaborated
by Bezuglyj and Shklovskij (BS) defines a transition magnetic field Bt above
which the quasiparticles distribution became non uniform due to a finite heat
removal from the substrate. From the BS model, we can deduce values of the
non-equilibrium lifetime of quasiparticles, which are 10 to 100 times shorter
in the dirty sample compared to the clean one and whose temperature dependance
is specific to the electronic nature of the Nb film. The study of the
non-linear regime provides also a quantitative determination of the thermal
transparency of the film-substrate interface.
