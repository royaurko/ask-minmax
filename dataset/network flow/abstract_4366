Providing service continuity to the end users with best quality is a very
important issue in the next generation wireless communications. With the
evolution of the mobile devices towards a multimode architecture and the
coexistence of multitude of radio access technologies (RAT's), the users are
able to benefit simultaneously from these RAT's. However, the major issue in
heterogeneous wireless communications is how to choose the most suitable access
network for mobile's user which can be used as long as possible for
communication. To achieve this issue, this paper proposes an intelligent
network selection strategy which combines two multi attribute decision making
(MADM) methods such as analytic network process (ANP) and the technique for
order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. The ANP
method is used to find the differentiate weights of available networks by
considering each criterion and the TOPSIS method is applied to rank the
alternatives. Our new strategy for network selection can dealing with the
limitations of MADM methods which are the ranking abnormality and the ping-ponf
effect.
