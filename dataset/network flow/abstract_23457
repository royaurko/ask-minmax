For $N$ interacting particles in a one dimensional random potential, we study
the structure of the corresponding network in Hilbert space. The states without
interaction play the role of the ``sites''. The hopping terms are induced by
the interaction. When the one body states are localized, we numerically find
that the set of directly connected ``sites'' is multifractal. For the case of
two interacting particles, the fractal dimension associated to the second
moment of the hopping term is shown to characterize the Golden rule decay of
the non interacting states and the enhancement factor of the localization
length.
