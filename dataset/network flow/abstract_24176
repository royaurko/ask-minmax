Traffic and channel-data rate combined with the stream oriented methodology
can provide a scheme for offering optimized and guaranteed QoS. In this work a
stream oriented modeled scheme is proposed based on each node's self-scheduling
energy management. This scheme is taking into account the overall packet loss
in order to form the optimal effective -for the end-to-end connection-
throughput response. The scheme also -quantitatively- takes into account the
asymmetrical nature of wireless links and the caching activity that is used for
data revocation in the ad-hoc based connectivity scenario. Through the designed
middleware and the architectural layering and through experimental simulation,
the proposed energy-aware management scheme is thoroughly evaluated in order to
meet the parameters' values where the optimal throughput response for each
device/user is achieved.
