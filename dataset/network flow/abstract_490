The size of modern data centers is constantly increasing. As it is not
economic to interconnect all machines in the data center using a
full-bisection-bandwidth network, techniques have to be developed to increase
the efficiency of data-center networks. The Software-Defined Network paradigm
opened the door for centralized traffic engineering (TE) in such environments.
Up to now, there were already a number of TE proposals for SDN-controlled data
centers that all work very well. However, these techniques either use a high
amount of flow table entries or a high flow installation rate that overwhelms
available switching hardware, or they require custom or very expensive
end-of-line equipment to be usable in practice.
  We present HybridTE, a TE technique that uses (uncertain) information about
large flows. Using this extra information, our technique has very low hardware
requirements while maintaining better performance than existing TE techniques.
This enables us to build very low-cost, high performance data-center networks.
