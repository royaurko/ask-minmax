Clustering coefficient is an important topological feature of complex
networks. It is, however, an open question to give out its analytic expression
on weighted networks yet. Here we applied an extended mean-field approach to
investigate clustering coefficients in the typical weighted networks proposed
by Barrat, Barth\'elemy and Vespignani (BBV networks). We provide analytical
solutions of this model and find that the local clustering in BBV networks
depends on the node degree and strength. Our analysis is well in agreement with
results of numerical simulations.
