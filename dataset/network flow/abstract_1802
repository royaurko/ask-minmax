We study the relation between the average traffic flow and the vehicle
density on road networks that we call 2D-traffic fundamental diagram. We show
that this diagram presents mainly four phases. We analyze different cases.
First, the case of a junction managed with a priority rule is presented, four
traffic phases are identified and described, and a good analytic approximation
of the fundamental diagram is obtained by computing a generalized eigenvalue of
the dynamics of the system. Then, the model is extended to the case of two
junctions, and finally to a regular city. The system still presents mainly four
phases. The role of a critical circuit of non-priority roads appears clearly in
the two junctions case. In Section 4, we use traffic light controls to improve
the traffic diagram. We present the improvements obtained by open-loop, local
feedback, and global feedback strategies. A comparison based on the response
times to reach the stationary regime is also given. Finally, we show the
importance of the design of the junction. It appears that if the junction is
enough large, the traffic is almost not slowed down by the junction.
