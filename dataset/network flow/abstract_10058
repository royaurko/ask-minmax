It seems intuitively correct to describe fluid flows by using fictitious
particles hopping on homogeneously separated nodes with a given finite set of
discrete velocities, however, it is not clear how many discrete velocities are
needed for the motion of the fictitious particles to satisfy a certain level of
accuracy with acceptable stability. This question is clarified by the discrete
Boltzmann equation, which is originally developed from the cellular automata to
fluid flows. Here we show that we can describe a compressible thermal flow of
the level of accuracy of the Navier-Stokes equation by only 33 discrete
velocities for two-dimensional space comprised of a square lattice. As a
result, we have broken the previously known minimal number by sparsely and
widely distributing the discrete velocities.
