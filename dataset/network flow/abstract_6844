The geometric non-linear Schrodinger equation (GNLS) on the complex
Grassmannian manifold M is the Hamiltonian equation for the energy functional
on C(R,M) with respect to the symplectic form induced from the Kahler form on
M. It has a Lax pair that is gauge equivalent to the Lax pair of the matrix
non-linear Schrodinger equation (MNLS). We construct via gauge transformations
an isomorphism from C(R,M) to the phase space of the MNLS equation so that the
GNLS flow corresponds to the MNLS flow. The existence of global solutions to
the Cauchy problem for GNLS and the hierarchy of commuting flows follows from
the correspondence. Direct geometric constructions show the flows are given by
geometric partial differential equations, and the space of conservation laws
has a structure of a non-abelian Poisson group. We also construct a hierarchy
of symplectic structures for GNLS. Under pullback, the known order k symplectic
structures correspond to the order (k-2) symplectic structures that we find.
The shift by two is a surprise, and is due to the fact that the group
structures depend on gauge choice.
