We consider a two-dimensional motion of a thin film flowing down an inclined
plane under the influence of the gravity and the surface tension. In order to
investigate the stability of such flow, we often use a thin film approximation,
which is an approximation obtained by the perturbation expansion with respect
to the aspect ratio of the film. The famous example of the approximate
equations are the Burgers equation, Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation,
KdV--Burgers equation, KdV--Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and so on. In this
paper, we give a mathematically rigorous justification of a thin film
approximation by establishing an error estimate between the solution of the
Navier--Stokes equations and those of approximate equations.
