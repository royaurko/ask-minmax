A locally iterative learning (LIL) rule is adapted to a model of the
associative memory based on the evolving recurrent-type neural networks
composed of growing neurons. There exist extremely different scale parameters
of time, the individual learning time and the generation in evolution. This
model allows us definite investigation on the interaction between learning and
evolution. And the reinforcement of the robustness against the noise is also
achieved in the evolutional scheme.
