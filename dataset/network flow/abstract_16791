The growth of two-dimensional lattice bond percolation clusters through a
cooperative Achlioptas-type of process, where the choice of which bond to
occupy next depends upon the masses of the clusters it connects, is shown to go
through an explosive, first-order kinetic phase transition with a sharp jump in
the mass of the largest cluster as the number of bonds is increased. The
critical behavior of this growth model is shown to be of a different
universality class than standard percolation.
