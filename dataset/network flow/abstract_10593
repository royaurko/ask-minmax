For successful estimation, the usual network tomography algorithms crucially
require i) end-to-end data generated using multicast probe packets, real or
emulated, and ii) the network to be a tree rooted at a single sender with
destinations at leaves. These requirements, consequently, limit their scope of
application. In this paper, we address successfully a general problem,
henceforth called generalized network tomography, wherein the objective is to
estimate the link performance parameters for networks with arbitrary topologies
using only end-to-end measurements of pure unicast probe packets.
Mathematically, given a binary matrix $A,$ we propose a novel algorithm to
uniquely estimate the distribution of $X,$ a vector of independent non-negative
random variables, given only IID samples of the components of the random vector
$Y = AX.$ This algorithm, in fact, does not even require any prior knowledge of
the unknown distributions. The idea is to approximate the distribution of each
component of $X$ using linear combinations of known exponential bases and
estimate the unknown weights. These weights are obtained by solving a set of
polynomial systems based on the moment generating function of the components of
$Y.$ For unique identifiability, it is only required that every pair of columns
of the matrix $A$ be linearly independent, a property that holds true for the
routing matrices of all multicast tree networks. Matlab based simulations have
been included to illustrate the potential of the proposed scheme.
