We consider Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG), which is three dimensional
general relativity with a cosmological constant and a gravitational
Chern-Simons term. When the cosmological constant is negative the theory has
two potential vacuum solutions: Anti-de Sitter space and Warped Anti-de Sitter
space. The theory also contains a massive graviton state which renders these
solutions unstable for certain values of the parameters and boundary
conditions. We study the decay of these solutions due to the condensation of
the massive graviton mode using Ricci-Cotton flow, which is the appropriate
generalization of Ricci flow to TMG. When the Chern-Simons coupling is small
the AdS solution flows to warped AdS by the condensation of the massive
graviton mode. When the coupling is large the situation is reversed, and warped
AdS flows to AdS. Minisuperspace models are constructed where these flows are
studied explicitly.
