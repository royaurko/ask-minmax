While much of the focus of observational cosmology is on the high redshift
universe it is important not to neglect the very local universe as a source of
cosmological information. The inner profiles and number counts of low mass
halos have provided the biggest stumbling blocks so far for LCDM. These small
structures can only be seen nearby where the component of a galaxy's redshift
which is due to motions under gravity can be comparable to (or even larger
than) its cosmological redshift. We report on a new sample of Tully-Fisher
distances (the SFI++) which is being used in combination with publicly
available primary distances to model galaxy flows in and around the Local
Supercluster. This sample has ~10 times as many tracers as were used for the
current best model. Initially a parametric model including infall onto multiple
attractors will be used. Such models are not realistic representations of the
true velocity field, but provide useful first order corrections. We explore the
typical errors in distances from such a flow model and how they vary in
different regions of the local supercluster by fitting the same parametric
model to mock catalogs derived from a constrained simulation of the volume.
