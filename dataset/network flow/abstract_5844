We give a livelock free routing algorithm for any allowed network. Unlike
some other solutions to this problem:
  1) packets entering the network have an absolute upper bound on the time to
reach their destination; 2) under light loads, packets are delivered to their
destinations in nearly optimal time; 3) packets with desired paths far away
from congested areas will have routing times far shorter than packets wanting
to access congested areas; 4) if the network becomes congested and later
clears, the network operates just as it would have when it was initially under
a light load.
  The main ideas of this note appear in a different form in my 1994 patent
5,369,745. This note adds to those results and makes them more mathematical.
