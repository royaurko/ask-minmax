Transportation infrastructure of a country is one of the most important
indicators of its economic growth. Here we study the Airport Network of India
(ANI), which represents India's domestic civil aviation infrastructure, as a
complex network. We find that ANI, a network of domestic airports connected by
air links, is a small-world network characterized by a truncated power-law
degree distribution, and has a signature of hierarchy. We investigate ANI as a
weighted network to explore its various properties and compare them with their
topological counterparts. The traffic in ANI, as in the World-wide Airport
Network (WAN), is found to be accumulated on interconnected groups of airports
and is concentrated between large airports. In contrast to WAN, ANI is found to
be having disassortative mixing which is offset by the traffic dynamics. The
analysis indicates toward possible mechanism of formation of a national
transportation network, which is different from that on a global scale.
