Using renormalization group methods we study multifractality in directed
percolation. Our approach is based on random lattice networks consisting of
resistor like and diode like bonds with microscopic noise. These random
resistor diode networks capture the features of isotropic as well as directed
percolation. In this note we introduce a field theoretic Hamiltonian for the
multifractal properties at the transition from the non-percolating to the
directed percolating phase. We investigate the multifractal moments of the
current distribution and determine a family of critical exponents for these
moments to two-loop order.
