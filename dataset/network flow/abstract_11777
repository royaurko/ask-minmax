This paper addresses some aspects of the general problem of information
transfer and distributed function computation in wireless networks. Many
applications of wireless technology foresee networks of autonomous devices
executing tasks that can be posed as distributed function computation. In
today's wireless networks, the tasks of communication and (distributed)
computation are performed separately, although an efficient network operation
calls for approaches in which the information transfer is dynamically adapted
to time-varying computation objectives. Thus, wireless communications and
function computation must be tightly coupled and it is shown in this paper that
information theory may play a crucial role in the design of efficient
computation-aware wireless communication and networking strategies. This is
explained in more detail by considering the problem of computing $\ell_p$-norms
over multiple access channels.
