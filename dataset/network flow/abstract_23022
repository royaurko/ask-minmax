We present experimental results on hydrothermal traveling-waves dynamics in
long and narrow 1D channels. The onset of primary traveling-wave patterns is
briefly presented for different fluid heights and for annular or bounded
channels, i.e., within periodic or non-periodic boundary conditions. For
periodic boundary conditions, by increasing the control parameter or changing
the discrete mean-wavenumber of the waves, we produce modulated waves patterns.
These patterns range from stable periodic phase-solutions, due to supercritical
Eckhaus instability, to spatio-temporal defect-chaos involving traveling holes
and/or counter-propagating-waves competition, i.e., traveling sources and
sinks. The transition from non-linearly saturated Eckhaus modulations to
transient pattern-breaks by traveling holes and spatio-temporal defects is
documented. Our observations are presented in the framework of coupled complex
Ginzburg-Landau equations with additional fourth and fifth order terms which
account for the reflection symmetry breaking at high wave-amplitude far from
onset. The second part of this paper (nlin.PS/0208030) extends this study to
spatially non-periodic patterns observed in both annular and bounded channel.
