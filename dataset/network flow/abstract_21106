We present exact expressions for hysteresis loops in the ferromagnetic random
field Ising model in the limit of zero temperature and zero driving frequency
for an arbitrary initial state of the model on a Bethe lattice. This work
extends earlier results that were restricted to an initial state with all spins
pointing parallel to each other.
