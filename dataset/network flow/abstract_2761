The problem of reliability of the dynamics in biological regulatory networks
is studied in the framework of a generalized Boolean network model with
continuous timing and noise. Using well-known artificial genetic networks such
as the repressilator, we discuss concepts of reliability of rhythmic
attractors. In a simple evolution process we investigate how overall network
structure affects the reliability of the dynamics. In the course of the
evolution, networks are selected for reliable dynamics. We find that most
networks can be easily evolved towards reliable functioning while preserving
the original function.
