The current theory of alternating-current electro-osmosis (ACEO) is unable to
explain the experimentally observed flow reversal of planar ACEO pumps at high
frequency (above the peak, typically 10-100 kHz), low salt concentration
(1-1000 $\mu$M), and moderate voltage (2-6 V), even if taking into account
Faradaic surface reactions, nonlinear double-layer capacitance and bulk
electrothermal flows. We attribute this failure to the breakdown of the
classical Poisson-Boltzmann model of the diffuse double layer, which assumes a
dilute solution of point-like ions. In spite of low bulk salt concentration,
the large voltage induced across the double layer leads to crowding of the ions
and a related decrease in surface capacitance. Using several mean-field models
for finite-sized ions, we show that steric effects generally lead to high
frequency flow reversal of ACEO pumps, similar to experiments. For quantitative
agreement, however, an unrealistically large effective ion size (several nm)
must be used, which we attribute to neglected correlation effects.
