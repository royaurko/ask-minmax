Under the assumption of the uniform local Sobolev inequality, it is proved
that Riemannian metrics with an absolute Ricci curvature bound and a small
Riemannian curvature integral bound can be smoothed to having a sectional
curvature bound. This partly extends previous a priori estimates of Ye Li (J.
Geom. Anal. 17 (2007) 495-511; Advances in Mathematics 223 (2010) 1924-1957).
