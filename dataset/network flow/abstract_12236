The capacitance between any two arbitrary lattice sites in an infinite square
lattice is studied when one bond is removed (i.e. perturbed). A connection is
made between the capacitance and the Lattice Green's Function of the perturbed
network, where they are expressed in terms of those of the perfect network. The
asymptotic behavior of the perturbed capacitance is investigated as the
separation between the two sites goes to infinity. Finally, numerical results
are obtained along different directions and a comparison is carried out with
the perfect capacitances
