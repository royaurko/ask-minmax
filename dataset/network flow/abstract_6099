Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technology that allows you to make
voice calls using a broadband Internet connection instead of a regular (or
analog) phone line. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) has led human speech to
a new level, where conversation across continents can be much cheaper & faster.
However, as IP networks are not designed for real-time applications, the
network impairments such as packet loss, jitter and delay have a severe impact
on speech quality. The playout buffer at the receiver side is used to
compensate jitter at a trade-off of delay and loss. We found the
characteristics of delay and loss are dependent on IP network and sudden
variable delay (spike) often performs both regular and irregular
characteristics. Different playout buffer algorithms can have different impacts
on the achievement speech quality. It is important to design a playout buffer
algorithm which can help achieve an optimum speech quality. In this paper, we
investigate to the understanding how network impairments and existing adaptive
buffer algorithms affect the speech quality and further to design a modified
buffer algorithm to obtain an optimized voice quality. We conduct experiments
to existing algorithms and compared their performance under different network
conditions with high and low network delay variations. Preliminary results show
that the new algorithm can enhance the perceived speech quality in most network
conditions and it is more efficient and suitable for real buffer mechanism.
