There have been great efforts in studying the cascading behavior in social
networks such as the innovation diffusion, etc. Game theoretically, in a social
network where individuals choose from two strategies: A (the innovation) and B
(the status quo) and get payoff from their neighbors for coordination, it has
long been known that the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of this game is not 1, since
the Nash equilibrium (NE) where all players take B (B Nash) is inferior to the
one all players taking A (A Nash). However, no quantitative analysis has been
performed to give an accurate upper bound of PoA in this game.
  In this paper, we adopt a widely used networked coordination game setting [3]
to study how bad a Nash equilibrium can be and give a tight upper bound of the
PoA of such games. We show that there is an NE that is slightly worse than the
B Nash. On the other hand, the PoA is bounded and the worst NE cannot be much
worse than the B Nash. In addition, we discuss how the PoA upper bound would
change when compatibility between A and B is introduced, and show an intuitive
result that the upper bound strictly decreases as the compatibility is
increased.
