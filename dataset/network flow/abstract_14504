We consider R and NS spectral flow sectors of type IIB superstring theory on
AdS(3)xS(3)xT(4) in the context of the AdS(3)/CFT(2) correspondence. We present
a derivation of the vertex operators creating spectral flow images of chiral
primary states previously proposed in the literature. We compute spectral flow
conserving three-point functions involving these operators on the sphere. Using
the bulk-to-boundary dictionary, we compare the results with the corresponding
correlators in the dual conformal field theory, the symmetric product orbifold
of T(4). In the limit of small string coupling, agreement is found in all the
cases considered.
