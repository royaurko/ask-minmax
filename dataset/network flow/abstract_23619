In future mobility support will require handling roaming in heterogeneous
access networks. In order to enable seamless roaming it is necessary to
minimize the impact of the vertical handoffs. Localized mobility management
schemes such as FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 do not provide sufficient handoff
performance, since they have been designed for horizontal handoffs. In this
paper, we propose the SafetyNet protocol, which allows a Mobile Node to perform
seamless vertical handoffs. Further, we propose a handoff timing algorithm
which allows a Mobile Node to delay or even completely avoid upward vertical
handoffs. We implement the SafetyNet protocol and compare its performance with
the Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 protocol in our wireless test bed and
analyze the results. The experimental results indicate that the proposed
SafetyNet protocol can provide an improvement of up to 95% for TCP performance
in vertical handoffs, when compared with FMIPv6 and an improvement of 64% over
FMIPv6 with bicasting. We use numerical analysis of the protocol to show that
its signaling and data transmission overhead is comparable to Fast Mobile IPv6
and significantly smaller than that of FMIPv6 with bicasting.
