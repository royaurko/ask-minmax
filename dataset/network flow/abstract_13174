We show that either mass ordering or quark number scaling of anisotropic flow
can result from quark coalescence, depending on the nature of phase space
correlations at hadronization. Quark number scaling signals nonequilibrium
dynamics because it can only appear when hydrodynamic correlations break down.
However, the scaling does not hold for all nonthermal distributions, and is
compatible with covariant transport theory only if remarkable cancellations
occur at RHIC.
