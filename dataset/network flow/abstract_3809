In this letter, we consider the effect of clustering coefficient on the
synchronizability of coupled oscillators located on scale-free networks. The
analytic result for the value of clustering coefficient aiming at a highly
clustered scale-free network model, the Holme-Kim is obtained, and the
relationship between network synchronizability and clustering coefficient is
reported. The simulation results strongly suggest that the more clustered the
network, the poorer its synchronizability.
