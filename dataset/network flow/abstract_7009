This paper presents one MEMS design tool with total six design flows, which
makes it possible that the MEMS designers are able to choose the most suitable
design flow for their specific devices. The design tool is divided into three
levels and interconnected by six interfaces. The three levels are
lumped-element model based system level, finite element analysis based device
level and process level, which covers nearly all modeling and simulation
functions for MEMS design. The six interfaces are proposed to automatically
transmit the design data between every two levels, thus the maximal six design
flows could be realized. The interfaces take the netlist, solid model and
layout as the data inlet and outlet for the system, device and process level
respectively. The realization of these interfaces are presented and verified by
design examples, which also proves that the enough flexibility in the design
flow can really increase the design efficiency.
