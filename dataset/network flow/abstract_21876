The fast simultaneous hadronization and chemical freeze out of supercooled
quark-gluon plasma, created in relativistic heavy ion collisions, leads to the
re-heating of the expanding matter and to the change in a collective flow
profile. We use the assumption of statistical nature of the hadronization
process, and study quantitatively the freeze out in the framework of
hydrodynamical Bjorken model with different quark-gluon plasma equations of
state.
