In the paper we extend the Multiple-Relaxation-Time (MRT) Lattice Boltzmann
(LB) model proposed in [Europhys. Lett. \textbf{90}, 54003 (2010)] so that it
is suitable also for incompressible flows. To decrease the artificial
oscillations, the convection term is discretized by the flux limiter scheme
with splitting technique. New model is validated by some well-known benchmark
tests, including Riemann problem and Couette flow, and satisfying agreements
are obtained between the simulation results and analytical ones. In order to
show the merit of LB model over traditional methods, the non-equilibrium
characteristics of system are solved. The simulation results are consistent
with physical analysis.
