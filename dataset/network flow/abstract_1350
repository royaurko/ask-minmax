In this paper, we continue our development of algorithms used for topological
network discovery. We present native P system versions of two fundamental
problems in graph theory: finding the maximum number of edge- and node-disjoint
paths between a source node and target node. We start from the standard
depth-first-search maximum flow algorithms, but our approach is totally
distributed, when initially no structural information is available and each P
system cell has to even learn its immediate neighbors. For the node-disjoint
version, our P system rules are designed to enforce node weight capacities (of
one), in addition to edge capacities (of one), which are not readily available
in the standard network flow algorithms.
