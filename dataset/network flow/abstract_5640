Coverage and connectivity both are important in wireless sensor network
(WSN). Coverage means how well an area of interest is being monitored by the
deployed network. It depends on sensing model that has been used to design the
network model. Connectivity ensures the establishment of a wireless link
between two nodes. A link model studies the connectivity between two nodes. The
probability of establishing a wireless link between two nodes is a
probabilistic phenomenon. The connectivity between two nodes plays an important
role in the determination of network connectivity. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of sensing model of nodes on the network coverage. Also,
we investigate the dependency of the connectivity and coverage on the shadow
fading parameters. It has been observed that shadowing effect reduces the
network coverage while it enhances connectivity in a multi-hop wireless
network.
