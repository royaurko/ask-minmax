In an IEEE 802.11 Infrastructure network, as the mobile node is moving from
one access point to another, the resource allocation and smooth hand off may be
a problem. If some reliable prediction is done on mobile nodes next move, then
resources can be allocated optimally as the mobile node moves around. This
would increase the performance throughput of wireless network. We plan to
investigate on a hybrid mobility prediction scheme that uses location tracking
and data mining to predict the future path of the mobile node. We also propose
a secure version of the same scheme. Through simulation and analysis, we
present the prediction accuracy of our proposal.
