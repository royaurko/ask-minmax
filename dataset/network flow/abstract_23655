In this book we study the concepts of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) and their
Neutrosophic analogue, the Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps (NCMs).Fuzzy Cognitive
Maps are fuzzy structures that strongly resemble neural networks, and they have
powerful and far-reaching consequences as a mathematical tool for modeling
complex systems. Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps are generalizations of FCMs, and
their unique feature is the ability to handle indeterminacy in relations
between two concepts thereby bringing greater sensitivity into the results.
  Some of the varied applications of FCMs and NCMs which has been explained by
us, in this book, include: modeling of supervisory systems; design of hybrid
models for complex systems; mobile robots and in intimate technology such as
office plants; analysis of business performance assessment; formalism debate
and legal rules; creating metabolic and regulatory network models; traffic and
transportation problems; medical diagnostics; simulation of strategic planning
process in intelligent systems; specific language impairment; web-mining
inference application; child labor problem; industrial relations: between
employer and employee, maximizing production and profit; decision support in
intelligent intrusion detection system; hyperknowledge representation in
strategy formation; female infanticide; depression in terminally ill patients
and finally, in the theory of community mobilization and women empowerment.
