This is a review of the parton cascade model (PCM) which provides a QCD-based
description of nucleus-nucleus reactions at very high energy. The PCM describes
the collision dynamics within the early and dense phase of the reaction in
terms of the relativistic, probabilistic transport of perturbative excitations
(partons) of the QCD vacuum, combined with the renormalization group flow of
the parton virtuality. The current state of numerical implementations of the
model, as well as its predictions for nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC are
discussed.
