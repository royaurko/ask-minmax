The fast evolving nature of modern cyber threats and network monitoring needs
calls for new, "software-defined", approaches to simplify and quicken
programming and deployment of online (stream-based) traffic analysis functions.
StreaMon is a carefully designed data-plane abstraction devised to scalably
decouple the "programming logic" of a traffic analysis application (tracked
states, features, anomaly conditions, etc.) from elementary primitives
(counting and metering, matching, events generation, etc), efficiently
pre-implemented in the probes, and used as common instruction set for
supporting the desired logic. Multi-stage multi-step real-time tracking and
detection algorithms are supported via the ability to deploy custom states,
relevant state transitions, and associated monitoring actions and triggering
conditions. Such a separation entails platform-independent, portable, online
traffic analysis tasks written in a high level language, without requiring
developers to access the monitoring device internals and program their custom
monitoring logic via low level compiled languages (e.g., C, assembly, VHDL). We
validate our design by developing a prototype and a set of simple (but
functionally demanding) use-case applications and by testing them over real
traffic traces.
