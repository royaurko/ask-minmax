The ATM Guaranteed Frame Rate (GFR) service is intended for best effort
traffic that can benefit from minimum throughput guarantees. Edge devices
connecting LANs to an ATM network can use GFR to transport multiple TCP/IP
connections over a single GFR VC.These devices would typically multiplex VCs
into a single FIFO queue. It has been shown that in general, FIFO queuing is
not sufficient to provide rate guarantees, and per-VC queuing with scheduling
is needed. We show that under conditions of low buffer allocation, it is
possible to control TCP rates with FIFO queuing and buffer management. We
present analysis and simulation results on controlling TCP rates by buffer
management. We present a buffer management policy that provides loose rate
guarantees to SACK TCP sources when the total buffer allocation is low. We
study the performance of this buffer management scheme by simulation.
