The constitutive behavior of aluminum alloy A356 in the as-cast condition has
been characterized using compression tests performed over a wide range of
deformation temperatures (30-500{\deg}C) and strain rates (\approx0.1-10 /s).
This work is intended to support the development of process models for a wide
range of conditions including those relevant to casting, forging and machining.
The flow stress behavior as a function of temperature and strain rate has been
fit to a modified Johnson-Cook and extended Ludwik-Hollomon expression. The
data has also been assessed with both the strain-independent Kocks-Mecking and
Zener-Hollomon frameworks. The predicted plastic flow stress for each
expression are compared. The results indicate that the extended Ludwik-Hollomon
is best suited to describe small strain conditions (stage III hardening), while
the Kocks-Mecking is best employed for large strain (stage IV). At elevated
temperatures, it was found that the Zener-Hollomon model provides the best
prediction of flow stress.
