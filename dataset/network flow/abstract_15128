Hybrid systems, and especially piecewise affine (PWA) systems, are often used
to model gene regulatory networks. In this paper we elaborate on previous work
about control problems for this class of models, using also some recent results
guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of limit cycles, based solely on a
discrete abstraction of the system and its interaction structure. Our aim is to
control the transition graph of the PWA system to obtain an oscillatory
behaviour, which is indeed of primary functional importance in numerous
biological networks; we show how it is possible to control the appearance or
disappearance of a unique stable limit cycle by hybrid qualitative action on
the degradation rates of the PWA system, both by static and dynamic feedback,
i.e. the adequate coupling of a controlling subnetwork. This is illustrated on
two classical gene network modules, having the structure of mixed feedback
loops.
