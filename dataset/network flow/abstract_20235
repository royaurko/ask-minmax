The interpretation of seismoelectric observations involves the dynamic
electrokinetic coupling, which is related to the streaming potential
coefficient. We describe the different models of the frequency-dependent
streaming potential, mainly the Packard's and the Pride's model. We compare the
transition frequency separating low-frequency viscous flow and high-frequency
inertial flow, for dynamic permeability and dynamic streaming potential. We
show that the transition frequency, on a various collection of samples for
which both formation factor and permeability are measured, is predicted to
depend on the permeability as inversely proportional to the permeability. We
review the experimental setups built to be able to perform dynamic
measurements. And we present some measurements and calculations of the dynamic
streaming potential.
