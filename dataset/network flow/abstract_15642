An artificial neural network is presented where each link is represented by a
grid of weights defining a series of piecewise polynomial functions with
discontinuities between each polynomial. The polynomial order ranges from first
to fifth order. The unit averages the input values from each link. A back
propagation technique that works with discontinuous link functions and
activation functions is presented. The use of discontinuous links function
means that only a subset of the network is active for a given input and so only
a subset of the network is trained for a particular training example. Unit
dropout is used for regularization and a parameter free weight update is used.
Better performance is obtained by moving from piecewise linear links to
piecewise quadratic and higher order links. The algorithm is tested on the
MNIST data set, using multiple autoencoders, with good results.
