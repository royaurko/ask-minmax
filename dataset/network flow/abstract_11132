Multi-access networks may exhibit severe unfairness in throughput. Recent
studies show that this unfairness is due to local differences in the
neighborhood structure: Nodes with less neighbors receive better access. We
study the unfairness in saturated linear networks, and adapt the multi-access
CSMA protocol to remove the unfairness completely, by choosing the activation
rates of nodes appropriately as a function of the number of neighbors. We then
investigate the consequences of this choice of activation rates on the
network-average saturated throughput, and we show that these rates perform well
in a non-saturated setting.
