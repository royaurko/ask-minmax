In the framework of the evolutionary dynamics of the Prisoner's Dilemma game
on complex networks, we investigate the possibility that the average level of
cooperation shows hysteresis under quasi-static variations of a model parameter
(the "temptation to defect"). Under the "discrete replicator" strategy updating
rule, for both Erdos-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert graphs we observe cooperation
hysteresis cycles provided one reaches tipping point values of the parameter;
otherwise, perfect reversibility is obtained. The selective fixation of
cooperation at certain nodes and its organization in cooperator clusters, that
are surrounded by fluctuating strategists, allows the rationalization of the
"lagging behind" behavior observed.
