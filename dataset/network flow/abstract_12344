We study synchronous phenomena of a coarse-grained power grid model, the
swing equation, on small-world networks. We show that its steady state, which
stands for the normal operation of the power systems, can be realized even if
the phases are disordered. In addition, we prove the linear stability of steady
state with small-different phases between the adjacent oscillators. On the
other hand, a trigger of instantaneous power failure, which is described by the
hysteretic transition, might disappear on an appropriate small-world network.
This result suggests that the small-world connection would potentially prevent
the massive blackouts.
