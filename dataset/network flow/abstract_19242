Network or graph structures are ubiquitous in the study of complex systems.
Often, we are interested in complexity trends of these system as it evolves
under some dynamic. An example might be looking at the complexity of a food web
as species enter an ecosystem via migration or speciation, and leave via
extinction.
  In a previous paper, a complexity measure of networks was proposed based on
the {\em complexity is information content} paradigm. To apply this paradigm to
any object, one must fix two things: a representation language, in which
strings of symbols from some alphabet describe, or stand for the objects being
considered; and a means of determining when two such descriptions refer to the
same object. With these two things set, the information content of an object
can be computed in principle from the number of equivalent descriptions
describing a particular object.
  The previously proposed representation language had the deficiency that the
fully connected and empty networks were the most complex for a given number of
nodes. A variation of this measure, called zcomplexity, applied a compression
algorithm to the resulting bitstring representation, to solve this problem.
Unfortunately, zcomplexity proved too computationally expensive to be
practical.
  In this paper, I propose a new representation language that encodes the
number of links along with the number of nodes and a representation of the
linklist. This, like zcomplexity, exhibits minimal complexity for fully
connected and empty networks, but is as tractable as the original measure.
