In this paper, we consider the gradient flow of the Yang-Mills-Higgs
functional for Higgs pairs on a Hermitian vector bundle $(E, H_{0})$ over a
compact K\"ahler manifold $(M, \omega )$. We study the asymptotic behavior of
the Yang-Mills-Higgs flow for Higgs pairs at infinity, and show that the
limiting Higgs sheaf is isomorphic to the double dual of the graded Higgs
sheaves associated to the Harder-Narasimhan-Seshadri filtration of the initial
Higgs bundle.
