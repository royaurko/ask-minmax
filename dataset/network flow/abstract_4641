We consider the inverse mean curvature flow in Robertson-Walker spacetimes
that satisfy the Einstein equations and have a big crunch singularity and prove
that under natural conditions the rescaled inverse mean curvature flow provides
a smooth transition from big crunch to big bang. We also construct an example
showing that in general the transition flow is only of class $C^3$.
