This article introduces the novel concept of Spatiotemporal Multicast (STM),
which is the issue of sending a message to mobile devices that have been
residing at a specific area during a certain time span in the past. A wide
variety of applications can be envisioned for this concept, including crime
investigation, disease control, and social applications. An important aspect of
these applications is the need to protect the privacy of its users. In this
article, we present an extensive overview of applications and objectives to be
fulfilled by an STM service. Furthermore, we propose a first Cluster-based
Spatiotemporal Multicast (CSTM) approach and provide a detailed discussion of
its privacy features. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our scheme in a
large-scale simulation setup.
