For compressed sensing over arbitrarily connected networks, we consider the
problem of estimating underlying sparse signals in a distributed manner. We
introduce a new signal model that helps to describe inter-signal correlation
among connected nodes. Based on this signal model along with a brief survey of
existing greedy algorithms, we develop distributed greedy algorithms with low
communication overhead. Incorporating appropriate modifications, we design two
new distributed algorithms where the local algorithms are based on
appropriately modified existing orthogonal matching pursuit and subspace
pursuit. Further, by combining advantages of these two local algorithms, we
design a new greedy algorithm that is well suited for a distributed scenario.
By extensive simulations we demonstrate that the new algorithms in a sparsely
connected network provide good performance, close to the performance of a
centralized greedy solution.
