Simple cellular automata models are able to reproduce the basic properties of
highway traffic. The comparison with empirical data for microscopic quantities
requires a more detailed description of the elementary dynamics. Based on
existing cellular automata models we propose an improved discrete model
incorporating anticipation effects, reduced acceleration capabilities and an
enhanced interaction horizon for braking. The modified model is able to
reproduce the three phases (free-flow, synchronized, and stop-and-go) observed
in real traffic. Furthermore we find a good agreement with detailed empirical
single-vehicle data in all phases.
