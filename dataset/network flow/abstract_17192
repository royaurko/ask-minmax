Secure communications are playing increasing roles in society, particularly
in finance, journalism, and military projects. Current methods of securing
e-mail and similar messaging methods rely on encryption of the message body,
but the header with addressing information remains plaintext. This allows third
party eavesdroppers to collect and analyse the header metadata and construct a
network model of the participants in conversations (who, where, when, subject).
In this article, we describe a method of communication where the header is also
encrypted, hindering the assembly of the communication network models, which is
verified with a working prototype application. This provides a useful tool to
journalists and proponents of free speech in oppressed countries, protecting
both the messages and their sources.
