The formalism of frozen-in vortex lines for two-dimensional (2D) flows in
ideal incompressible electron magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) is formulated. A
localized approximation for nonlinear dynamics of two close sheets of the
generalized vorticity is suggested and its integrability by the hodograph
method is demonstrated.
