Traditional end-to-end congestion control mechanisms assume data transferring
happens between each pair user. In contrast, in a P2P network, many peers may
locally keep a copy of a specific data object. If the path between a pair of
peers is congested, the requesting peer who wants to download data will switch
to another peer in its neighbor peer list to fetch the data instead of
decreasing the download rate from the current peer. Thus, it is critical to
study the performance in multi-point-to-multi-point (M2M) transport protocol in
a P2P network. In this paper, we build a mathematical model for identifying the
key parameters for the M2M transport protocol and also the relationships among
these parameters. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to validate our
model.
