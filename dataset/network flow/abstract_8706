The contributor has previously constructed a class of admissible vector fields on
the path space of an elliptic diffusion process $x$ taking values in a closed
compact manifold. In this Note the existence of flows for this class of vector
fields is established and it is shown that the law of $x$ is quasi-invariant
under these flows.
