Stochastic network calculus is the probabilistic version of the network
calculus, which uses envelopes to perform probabilistic analysis of queueing
networks. The accuracy of probabilistic end-to-end delay or backlog bounds
computed using network calculus has always been a concern. In this paper, we
propose novel end-to-end probabilistic bounds based on demisubmartingale
inequalities which improve the existing bounds for the tandem networks of
GI/GI/1 queues. In particular, we show that reasonably accurate bounds are
achieved by comparing the new bounds with the existing results for a network of
M/M/1 queues.
