This note corrects a pretty serious mistake and some inaccuracies in
"Consensus and cooperation in networked multi-agent systems" by R.
Olfati-Saber, J.A. Fax, and R.M. Murray, published in Vol. 95 of the
Proceedings of the IEEE (2007, No. 1, P. 215-233). It also mentions several
stronger results applicable to the class of problems under consideration and
addresses the issue of priority whose interpretation in the above-mentioned
paper is not exact.
