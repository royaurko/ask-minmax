Multiplex is a set of graphs on the same vertex set, i.e.
$\{G(V,E_1),\ldots,G(V,E_m)\}$. It is a generalized graph to model multiple
relationships with parallel edges between vertices. This paper is a literature
review of existing communities detection algorithms for multiplex and a
comparative analysis of them.
