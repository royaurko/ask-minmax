We derive an exact functional renormalization group equation for the
projectable version of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. The flow equation encodes
the gravitational degrees of freedom in terms of the lapse function, shift
vector and spatial metric and is manifestly invariant under background
foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms. Its relation to similar flow equations
for gravity in the metric formalism is discussed in detail, and we argue that
the space of action functionals, invariant under the full diffeomorphism group,
forms a subspace of the latter invariant under renormalization group
transformations. As a first application we study the RG flow of the Newton
constant and the cosmological constant in the ADM formalism. In particular we
show that the non-Gaussian fixed point found in the metric formulation is
qualitatively unaffected by the change of variables and persists also for
Lorentzian signature metrics.
