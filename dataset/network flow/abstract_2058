The nonlinear rheological properties of dense colloidal suspensions under
steady shear are discussed within a first principles approach. It starts from
the Smoluchowski equation of interacting Brownian particles in a given shear
flow, derives generalized Green-Kubo relations, which contain the transients
dynamics formally exactly, and closes the equations using mode coupling
approximations. Shear thinning of colloidal fluids and dynamical yielding of
colloidal glasses arise from a competition between a slowing down of structural
relaxation, because of particle interactions, and enhanced decorrelation of
fluctuations, caused by the shear advection of density fluctuations. The
integration through transients approach takes account of the dynamic
competition, translational invariance enters the concept of wavevector
advection, and the mode coupling approximation enables to quantitatively
explore the shear-induced suppression of particle caging and the resulting
speed-up of the structural relaxation. Extended comparisons with shear stress
data in the linear response and in the nonlinear regime measured in model
thermo-sensitive core-shell latices are discussed. Additionally, the single
particle motion under shear observed by confocal microscopy and in computer
simulations is reviewed and analysed theoretically.
