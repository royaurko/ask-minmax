We have measured the meridional motions of the magnetic elements in the Sun's
surface layers since 1996 and find systematic and substantial variations. In
general the meridional flow speed is fast at cycle minima and slow at cycle
maxima. We find that these systematic variations are characterized by a
weakening of the meridional flow on the poleward sides of the active (sunspot)
latitudes. This can be interpreted as a inflow toward the sunspot zones
superimposed on a more general poleward meridional flow profile. We also find
variations in the meridional flow which vary from cycle-to-cycle. The
meridional flow was slower at both the minimum and maximum of cycle 23 compared
to similar phases of cycles 21, 22, and 24. Models of the magnetic flux
transport by a variable meridional flow suggest that it can significantly
modulate the size and timing of the following sunspot cycle through its impact
on the Sun's polar magnetic fields. We suggest that the meridional flow
variations observed in cycle 23 contributed to the weak polar fields at the end
of the cycle which then produced a weak cycle 24 and the extraordinary cycle
23/24 minimum.
