The problem of oscillating flows inside pipes under periodic forcing of
viscoelastic fluids is addressed here. Starting from the linear Oldroyd-B
model, a generalized Darcy's law is obtained in frequency domain and an
explicit expression for the dependence of the dynamic permeability on fluid
parameters and forcing frequency is derived. Previous results in both
viscoelastic and Newtonian fluids are here shown to be particular cases of our
results. On the basis of our calculations, a possible explanation for the
observed damping of local dynamic response as the forcing frequency increases
is given. Good fitting with recent experimental studies of wave propagation in
viscoelastic media is here exhibited. Sound wave propagation in viscoelastic
media flowing inside straight pipes is investigated. In particular, we obtain
the local dynamic response for weakly compressible flows.
