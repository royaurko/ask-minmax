In this paper, we investigate the problem of how beliefs diffuse among
members of social networks. We propose an information flow model (IFM) of
belief that captures how interactions among members affect the diffusion and
eventual convergence of a belief. The IFM model includes a generalized Markov
Graph (GMG) model as a social network model, which reveals that the diffusion
of beliefs depends heavily on two characteristics of the social network
characteristics, namely degree centralities and clustering coefficients. We
apply the IFM to both converged belief estimation and belief control strategy
optimization. The model is compared with an IFM including the Barabasi-Albert
model, and is evaluated via experiments with published real social network
data.
