We consider flow rounding: finding an integral flow from a fractional flow.
Costed flow rounding asks that we find an integral flow with no worse cost.
Randomized flow rounding requires we randomly find an integral flow such that
the expected flow along each edge matches the fractional flow. Both problems
are reduced to cycle canceling, for which we develop an $O(m \log(n^2/m))$
algorithm.
