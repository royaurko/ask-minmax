Global data traffic is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years
with video and smartphone applications driving data growth. Many mobile network
providers in the UK have either deployed or planning to deploy 4th generation
Long-Term-Evolution (LTE) mobile technology as the solution to meet capacity
demands. This study evaluates the technological improvements in 4G LTE in
comparison to 3G High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) and further conducts a
techno-economic analysis using primary researched tariff data to determine
network operator profitability and mobile tariff strategy to meet user demand.
To ensure holistic analysis, the study also considers the environmental impacts
of LTE by determining the annual carbon emission for a network operator. The
study results shows LTE will prove profitable; however a trade-off has to be
made by network operators between meeting consumer tariff demands or increasing
profitability. Analysis also shows a 63% reduced in carbon emissions is
possible with migration to 4G services with implication of further financial
benefits for network operators as a result.
