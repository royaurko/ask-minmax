We investigate simulated turbulent flow within thermally driven stellar
convection zones. Different driving sources are studied, including cooling at
the top of the convectively unstable region, as occurs in surface convection
zones; and heating at the base by nuclear burning. The transport of enthalpy
and kinetic energy, and the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy
dissipation are studied. We emphasize the importance of global constraints on
shaping the quasi-steady flow characteristics, and present an analysis of
turbulent convection which is posed as a boundary value problem that can be
easily incorporated into standard stellar evolution codes for deep, efficient
convection. Direct comparison is made between the theoretical analysis and the
simulated flow and very good agreement is found. Some common assumptions
traditionally used to treat quasi-steady turbulent flow in stellar models are
briefly discussed. The importance and proper treatment of convective boundaries
are indicated.
