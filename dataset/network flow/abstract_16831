Keyphrases provide a simple way of describing a document, giving the reader
some clues about its contents. Keyphrases can be useful in a various
applications such as retrieval engines, browsing interfaces, thesaurus
construction, text mining etc.. There are also other tasks for which keyphrases
are useful, as we discuss in this paper. This paper describes a neural network
based approach to keyphrase extraction from scientific articles. Our results
show that the proposed method performs better than some state-of-the art
keyphrase extraction approaches.
