We study the phonon fluxes emitted when the condensate velocity crosses the
speed of sound, i.e., in backgrounds which are analogous to that of a black
hole. We focus on elongated one dimensional condensates and on stationary
flows. Our theoretical analysis and numerical results are based on the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation without further approximation. The spectral
properties of the fluxes and of the long distance density-density correlations
are obtained, both with and without an initial temperature. In realistic
conditions, we show that the condensate temperature dominates the fluxes and
thus hides the presence of the spontaneous emission (the Hawking effect). We
also explain why the temperature amplifies the long distance correlations which
are intrinsic to this effect. This confirms that the correlation pattern offers
a neat signature of the Hawking effect. Optimal conditions for observing the
pattern are discussed, as well as correlation patterns associated with
scattering of classical waves. Flows associated with white holes are also
considered.
