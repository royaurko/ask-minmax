Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar have received much attention
in recent years and large amount of renewable generation is being integrated to
the electricity networks. A fundamental challenge in power system operation is
to handle the intermittent nature of the renewable generation. In this paper we
present a stochastic programming approach to solve a multiperiod optimal power
flow problem under renewable generation uncertainty. The proposed approach
consists of two stages. In the first stage operating points for conventional
power plants are determined. Second stage realizes the generation from
renewable resources and optimally accommodates it by relying on demand-side
flexibility. The benefits from its application are demonstrated and discussed
on a 4-bus and a 39-bus systems. Numerical results show that with limited
flexibility on the demand-side substantial benefits in terms of potential
additional re-dispatch costs can be achieved. The scaling properties of the
approach are finally analysed based on standard IEEE test cases upto 300 buses,
allowing to underlined its computational efficiency.
