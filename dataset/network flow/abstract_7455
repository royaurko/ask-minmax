We use a lattice Boltzmann (LB) kinetic scheme for modelling amphiphilic
fluids that correctly predicts rheological effects in flow. No macroscopic
parameters are included in the model. Instead, three-dimensional hydrodynamic
and rheological effects are emergent from the underlying particulate
conservation laws and interactions. We report evidence of shear thinning and
viscoelastic flow for a self-assembled gyroid mesophase. This purely kinetic
approach is of general importance for the modelling and simulation of complex
fluid flows in situations when rheological properties cannot be predicted {\em
a priori}.
