The evolution of an instability at the interface of active and passive media
is considered. An asymptotic form of a collision integral is found and the
limitations of hydrodynamic approach are determined. A growth increment of
small perturbations of the interface is found using the potential flows theory.
The obtained results were applied to estimation of the instability contribution
to the development of some known physical processes.
