We investigate the AC conductivity of binary random impedance networks, with
emphasis on its dependence on the ratio of the complex conductances of both
phases. We propose an algorithm to determine the conductance of a finite
network, in terms of its poles and of the associated residues. A numerical
implementation of the algorithm, on the example of the square lattice, allows a
detailed investigation of the resonant dielectric response of the binary model,
including the density of resonances, the spectral function, the distribution of
spacings between resonances. The distribution of local electric fields at
resonance is found to be multifractal.
