We investigate nuclear suppression and elliptic flow in A+A reactions using
Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev (GLV) radiative energy loss with the covariant transport
MPC for bulk medium evolution. At both RHIC and LHC energies, we find that
inclusion of realistic transverse expansion for the medium strongly suppresses
elliptic flow at high p_T compared to calculations with longitudinal Bjorken
expansion only. We argue that this is a generic feature of GLV energy loss.
Transverse expansion also enhances the high-p_T suppression, while fluctuations
in energy loss with the rescattering location of the jet parton in the medium
lead to weaker suppression and smaller elliptic flow. However, unlike the
strong reduction of elliptic flow with transverse expansion, these latter
effects get nearly washed out once calculations are adjusted to reproduce R_AA
in central collisions.
