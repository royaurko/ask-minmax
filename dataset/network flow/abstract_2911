In this paper, we propose a network adaptation mechanism to control spreading
processes over switching contact networks. According to this adaptation
mechanism, edges in the network are randomly removed or added, depending on the
risk of spread through them. This adaptation mechanism induces a stochastic
switching dynamics in the structure of the network that depends on the state of
the spread. In this paper, we analyze the joint evolution of the spreading
dynamics "in the network" and the structural dynamics "of the network". We
derive conditions on the adaptation law to control the dynamics of the spread
in the resulting switching network. Furthermore, assuming there is a cost
associated to switching edges in the network, we propose an optimization
framework to find the cost-optimal network adaptation law, i.e., the
cost-optimal edge switching probabilities. Under certain conditions on the
switching costs, we show that the optimal adaptation law can be found using
convex optimization. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations in a
real human contact network.
