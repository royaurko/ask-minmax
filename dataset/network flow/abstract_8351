In this work we present a model for evolving networks, where the driven force
is related to the social affinity between individuals in a population. In the
model, a set of individuals initially arranged on a regular ordered network and
thus linked with their closest neighbors are allowed to rearrange their
connections according to a dynamics closely related to that of the stable
marriage problem. We show that the behavior of some topological properties of
the resulting networks follows a non trivial pattern.
