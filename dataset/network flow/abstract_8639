This paper surveys research on applying neuroevolution (NE) to games. In
neuroevolution, artificial neural networks are trained through evolutionary
algorithms, taking inspiration from the way biological brains evolved. We
analyse the application of NE in games along five different axes, which are the
role NE is chosen to play in a game, the different types of neural networks
used, the way these networks are evolved, how the fitness is determined and
what type of input the network receives. The article also highlights important
open research challenges in the field.
