Background: The evolution of microRNA regulation in metazoans is a mysterious
process: MicroRNA sequences are highly conserved among distal organisms, but on
the other hand, there is no evident conservation of their targets. Results: We
study this extensive rewiring of the microRNA regulatory network by analyzing
the evolutionary trajectories of duplicated genes in D. melanogatser. We find
that in general microRNA-targeted genes tend to avoid gene duplication.
However, in cases where gene duplication is evident, we find that the gene that
displays high divergence from the ancestral gene at the sequence level is also
likely to be associated in an opposing manner with the microRNA regulatory
system - if the ancestral gene is a miRNA target then the divergent gene tends
not to be, and vice versa. Conclusions: This suggests that miRNAs not only have
a role in conferring expression robustness, as was suggested by previous works,
but are also an accessible tool in evolving expression divergence.
