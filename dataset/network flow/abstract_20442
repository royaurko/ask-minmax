Even in simple geometries many complex fluids display non-trivial flow
fields, with regions where shear is concentrated. The possibility for such
shear banding has been known since several decades, but the recent years have
seen an upsurge of studies offering an ever more precise understanding of the
phenomenon. The development of new techniques to probe the flow on multiple
scales and with increasing spatial and temporal resolution has opened the
possibility for a synthesis of the many phenomena that could only have been
thought of separately before. In this review, we bring together recent research
on shear banding in polymeric and on soft glassy materials, and highlight their
similarities and disparities.
