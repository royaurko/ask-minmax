This paper addresses the fundamental characteristics of information exchange
via multihop network coding over two-way relaying in a wireless ad hoc network.
The end-to-end rate regions achieved by time-division multihop (TDMH),
MAC-layer network coding (MLNC) and PHY-layer network coding (PLNC) are first
characterized. It is shown that MLNC does not always achieve better rates than
TDMH, time sharing between TDMH and MLNC is able to achieve a larger rate
region, and PLNC dominates the rate regions achieved by TDMH and MLNC. An
opportunistic scheduling algorithm for MLNC and PLNC is then proposed to
stabilize the two-way relaying system for Poisson arrivals whenever the rate
pair is within the Shannon rate regions of MLNC and PLNC. To understand the
two-way transmission limits of multihop network coding, the sum-rate
optimization with or without certain traffic pattern and the end-to-end
diversity-multiplexing tradeoffs (DMTs) of two-way transmission over multiple
relay nodes are also analyzed.
