We study a one-dimensional electron gas in a special antiferromagnetic
environment made by two spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains and the one-dimensional
two-channel Kondo-Heisenberg lattice away from half-filling. These models flow
to an intermediate fixed point which belongs to the universality class of
chirally stabilized liquids. Using a Toulouse point approach, the universal
properties of the models are determined as well as the identification of the
leading instabilities. It is shown that these models exhibit a non-Fermi liquid
behavior with strong enhanced composite pairing correlations.
