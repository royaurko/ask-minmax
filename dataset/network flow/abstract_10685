We use Tully--Fisher distances for a sample of field late spiral galaxies to
test the Lauer and Postman (1994; hereinafter LP) result suggestive of a bulk
flow with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background reference frame, of
amplitude of +689 km/s in the direction l=343, b=+52. A total of 432 galaxies
are used, subdivided between two cones, of 30deg semiaperture each and pointed
respectively toward the apex and antapex of the LP motion. The peculiar
velocities in the two data sets are inconsistent with a bulk flow of the
amplitude claimed by LP. When combined in opposition, the peculiar velocity
medians in shells of constant redshift width are never larger than half the
amplitude of the LP bulk flow. Out to 5000 km/s the median bulk velocity in the
LP apex--antapex cones is about 200 km/s or less, dropping to a value
indistinguishable from zero beyond that distance. It can be excluded that field
spiral galaxies within 8000 km/s partake of a bulk flow of the amplitude and
direction reported by LP.
