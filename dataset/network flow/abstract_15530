In the wake of the still ongoing global financial crisis, bank
interdependencies have come into focus in trying to assess linkages among banks
and systemic risk. To date, such analysis has largely been based on numerical
data. By contrast, this study attempts to gain further insight into bank
interconnections by tapping into financial discourse. We present a
text-to-network process, which has its basis in co-occurrences of bank names
and can be analyzed quantitatively and visualized. To quantify bank importance,
we propose an information centrality measure to rank and assess trends of bank
centrality in discussion. For qualitative assessment of bank networks, we put
forward a visual, interactive interface for better illustrating network
structures. We illustrate the text-based approach on European Large and Complex
Banking Groups (LCBGs) during the ongoing financial crisis by quantifying bank
interrelations and centrality from discussion in 3M news articles, spanning
2007Q1 to 2014Q3.
