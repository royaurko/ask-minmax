Community structures are an important feature of many social, biological and
technological networks. Here we study a variation on the method for detecting
such communities proposed by Girvan and Newman and based on the idea of using
centrality measures to define the community boundaries (M. Girvan and M. E. J.
Newman, Community structure in social and biological networks Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA 99, 7821-7826 (2002)). We develop an algorithm of hierarchical
clustering that consists in finding and removing iteratively the edge with the
highest information centrality. We test the algorithm on computer generated and
real-world networks whose community structure is already known or has been
studied by means of other methods. We show that our algorithm, although it runs
to completion in a time O(n^4), is very effective especially when the
communities are very mixed and hardly detectable by the other methods.
