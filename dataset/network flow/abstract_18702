In this report a computational study of ConceptNet 4 is performed using tools
from the field of network analysis. Part I describes the process of extracting
the data from the SQL database that is available online, as well as how the
closure of the input among the assertions in the English language is computed.
This part also performs a validation of the input as well as checks for the
consistency of the entire database. Part II investigates the structural
properties of ConceptNet 4. Different graphs are induced from the knowledge
base by fixing different parameters. The degrees and the degree distributions
are examined, the number and sizes of connected components, the transitivity
and clustering coefficient, the cores, information related to shortest paths in
the graphs, and cliques. Part III investigates non-overlapping, as well as
overlapping communities that are found in ConceptNet 4. Finally, Part IV
describes an investigation on rules.
