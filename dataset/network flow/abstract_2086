The shear-modulus and yield-stress of amorphous solids are important material
parameters, with the former determining the rate of increase of stress under
external strain and the latter being the stress value at which the material
flows in a plastic manner. It is therefore important to understand how these
parameters can be related to the inter-particle potential. Here a scaling
theory is presented such that given the inter-particle potential, the
dependence of the yield stress and the shear modulus on the density of the
solid can be predicted in the athermal limit. It is explained when such
prediction is possible at all densities and when it is only applicable at high
densities. These results open up exciting possibilities for designing in
principle new materials with desirable mechanical properties.
