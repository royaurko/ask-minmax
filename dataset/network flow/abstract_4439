Multi-layered social networks reflect complex relationships existing in
modern interconnected IT systems. In such a network each pair of nodes may be
linked by many edges that correspond to different communication or
collaboration user activities. Multi-layered degree centrality for
multi-layered social networks is presented in the paper. Experimental studies
were carried out on data collected from the real Web 2.0 site. The
multi-layered social network extracted from this data consists of ten distinct
layers and the network analysis was performed for different degree centralities
measures.
