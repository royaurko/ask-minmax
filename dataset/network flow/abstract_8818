We examine the scaling trends in particle multiplicity and flow observables
between SPS, RHIC and LHC, and discuss their compatibility with popular
theoretical models. We examine the way scaling trends between SPS and RHIC are
broken at LHC energies, and suggest experimental measurements which can further
clarify the situation
