Radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres is usually treated in the static
limit, i.e., neglecting atmospheric motions. We argue that hot Jupiter
atmospheres, with possibly fast (sonic) wind speeds, may require a more
strongly coupled treatment, formally in the regime of radiation-hydrodynamics.
To lowest order in v/c, relativistic Doppler shifts distort line profiles along
optical paths with finite wind velocity gradients. This leads to flow-dependent
deviations in the effective emission and absorption properties of the
atmospheric medium. Evaluating the overall impact of these distortions on the
radiative structure of a dynamic atmosphere is non-trivial. We present
transmissivity and systematic equivalent width excess calculations which
suggest possibly important consequences for radiation transport in hot Jupiter
atmospheres. If winds are fast and bulk Doppler shifts are indeed important for
the global radiative balance, accurate modeling and reliable data
interpretation for hot Jupiter atmospheres may prove challenging: it would
involve anisotropic and dynamic radiative transfer in a coupled
radiation-hydrodynamical flow. On the bright side, it would also imply that the
emergent properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres are more direct tracers of their
atmospheric flows than is the case for Solar System planets.
Radiation-hydrodynamics may also influence radiative transfer in other classes
of hot exoplanetary atmospheres with fast winds.
