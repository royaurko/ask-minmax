In jet quenching, a hard QCD parton, before fragmenting into a jet of
hadrons, deposits a fraction of its energy in the medium, leading to suppressed
production of high-$p_T$ hadrons. Assuming that the deposited energy quickly
thermalizes, we simulate the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP
fluid. Explicit simulation of Au+Au collision with and without a quenching jet
indicate that elliptic flow is greatly reduced in a jet event. The result can
be used to identify the jet events in heavy ion collisions.
