The nature of pre-determined and on-demand mobile network fabrics can be
exploited for real time Position Location and Tracking (PL&T) of radios and
sensors (nodes) for Global Positioning System (GPS) denied or GPS-free systems.
This issue is addressed by a novel system of integrated zone finding and
triangulation method for determining the PL&T of nodes when mobile network
fabrics are employed based on using directional antennas for radio
communications. Each mobile node is switched dynamically between being a
reference and a target node in PL&T operation to improve the PL&T accuracy of a
target node. This paper presents the Baseline PL&T with predictive Kalman
filter and Integrated Zone based PL&T algorithm design that integrates zone
finding and triangulation method. The performance of the proposed algorithm is
analysed using Interleaving-KV sample coding & error correction in Rayleigh and
Rician channel using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system
under the severe multipath fading.
