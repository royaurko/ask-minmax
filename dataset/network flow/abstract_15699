Recently, Estrada and Sheerin (Phys. Rev. E 91, 042805 (2015)) developed the
random rectangular graph (RRG) model to account for the spatial distribution of
nodes in a network allowing the variation of the shape of the unit square
commonly used in random geometric graphs (RGGs). Here, we consider an epidemics
dynamics taking place on the nodes and edges of an RRG and we derive
analytically a lower bound for the epidemic threshold for a
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
model on these networks. Using extensive numerical simulations of the SIS
dynamics we show that the lower bound found is very tight. We conclude that the
elongation of the area in which the nodes are distributed makes the network
more resilient to the propagation of an epidemics due to the fact that the
epidemic threshold increases with the elongation of the rectangle. On the other
hand, using the "classical" RGG for modeling epidemics on non-squared cities
generates a larger error due to the effects produced by the geometrical shapes
of the city areas.
