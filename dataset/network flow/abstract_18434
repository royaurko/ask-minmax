Motivated by providing quality-of-service differentiated services in the
Internet, we consider buffer management algorithms for network switches. We
study a multi-buffer model. A network switch consists of multiple size-bounded
buffers such that at any time, the number of packets residing in each
individual buffer cannot exceed its capacity. Packets arrive at the network
switch over time; they have values, deadlines, and designated buffers. In each
time step, at most one pending packet is allowed to be sent and this packet can
be from any buffer. The objective is to maximize the total value of the packets
sent by their respective deadlines. A 9.82-competitive online algorithm has
been provided for this model (Azar and Levy. SWAT 2006), but no offline
algorithms have been known yet. In this paper, We study the offline setting of
the multi-buffer model. Our contributions include a few optimal offline
algorithms for some variants of the model. Each variant has its unique and
interesting algorithmic feature. These offline algorithms help us understand
the model better in designing online algorithms.
