We generalize the results of Ambrosio [Invent. Math. 158 (2004), 227--260] on
the existence, uniqueness and stability of regular Lagrangian flows of ordinary
differential equations to Stratonovich stochastic differential equations with
BV drift coefficients. Then we construct an explicit solution to the
corresponding stochastic transport equation in terms of the stochastic flow.
The approximate differentiability of the flow is also studied when the drift is
a Sobolev vector field.
