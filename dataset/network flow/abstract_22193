We show that recent results on the interaction of causality-respecting
particles with particles on closed timelike curves derived in [Phys. Rev. A 82,
062330 (2010)] depend on ambiguous assumption about the form of the state which
is inputted into the proposed equivalent circuit. Choosing different form of
this state leads to opposite conclusion on the power of closed timelike curves.
