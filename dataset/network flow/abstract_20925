This paper proposes an interference alignment method with distributed and
delayed channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) for a class of
interference networks. The core idea of the proposed method is to align
interference signals over time at the unintended receivers in a distributed
manner. With the proposed method, achievable trade-offs between the sum of
degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) and feedback delay of CSI are characterized in
both the X-channel and three-user interference channel to reveal the impact on
how the CSI feedback delay affects the sum-DoF of the interference networks. A
major implication of derived results is that distributed and moderately-
delayed CSIT is useful to strictly improve the sum-DoF over the case of no CSI
at the transmitter in a certain class of interference networks. For a class of
X-channels, the results show how to optimally use distributed and
moderately-delayed CSIT to yield the same sum-DoF as instantaneous and global
CSIT. Further, leveraging the proposed transmission method and the known outer
bound results, the sum-capacity of the two-user X-channel with a particular set
of channel coefficients is characterized within a constant number of bits.
