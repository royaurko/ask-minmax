Consider a Riemannian metric on two-torus. We prove that the question of
existence of polynomial first integrals leads naturally to a remarkable system
of quasi-linear equations which turns out to be a Rich system of conservation
laws. This reduces the question of integrability to the question of existence
of smooth (quasi-) periodic solutions for this Rich quasi-linear system.
