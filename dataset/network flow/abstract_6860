An overview is given over recent measurements of flow and particle production
in the energy range from 0.1 to 2AGeV. Excitation functions for the directed
sideward and the azimuthally symmetric transverse flow are presented and show
the importance of flow phenomena in this incident energy regime. Rapidity
density distributions are indicative of a system size dependence of the
stopping process. The role of strange particles as a probe for the hot and
dense phase of hadronic matter is discussed with respect to the production and
propagation. The spectra of Kaons indicate an equilibration with the
surrounding baryons during the expansion while their directed flow pattern is
different from that of the nucleons.
