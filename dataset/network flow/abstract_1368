We present a near-optimal distributed algorithm for $(1+o(1))$-approximation
of single-commodity maximum flow in undirected weighted networks that runs in
$(D+ \sqrt{n})\cdot n^{o(1)}$ communication rounds in the \Congest model. Here,
$n$ and $D$ denote the number of nodes and the network diameter, respectively.
This is the first improvement over the trivial bound of $O(n^2)$, and it nearly
matches the $\tilde{\Omega}(D+ \sqrt{n})$ round complexity lower bound.
  The development of the algorithm contains two results of independent
interest:
  (i) A $(D+\sqrt{n})\cdot n^{o(1)}$-round distributed construction of a
spanning tree of average stretch $n^{o(1)}$.
  (ii) A $(D+\sqrt{n})\cdot n^{o(1)}$-round distributed construction of an
$n^{o(1)}$-congestion approximator consisting of the cuts induced by $O(\log
n)$ virtual trees. The distributed representation of the cut approximator
allows for evaluation in $(D+\sqrt{n})\cdot n^{o(1)}$ rounds.
  All our algorithms make use of randomization and succeed with high
probability.
