Modularity Q is an important function for identifying community structure in
complex networks. In this paper, we prove that the modularity maximization
problem is equivalent to a nonconvex quadratic programming problem. This result
provide us a simple way to improve the efficiency of heuristic algorithms for
maximizing modularity Q. Many numerical results demonstrate that it is very
effective.
