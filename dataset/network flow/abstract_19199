In this paper we study the differences in historical World View between
Western and Eastern cultures, represented through the English, the Chinese,
Japanese, and German Wikipedia. In particular, we analyze the historical
networks of the World's leaders since the beginning of written history,
comparing them in the different Wikipedias and assessing cultural chauvinism.
We also identify the most influential female leaders of all times in the
English, German, Spanish, and Portuguese Wikipedia. As an additional lens into
the soul of a culture we compare top terms, sentiment, emotionality, and
complexity of the English, Portuguese, Spanish, and German Wikinews.
