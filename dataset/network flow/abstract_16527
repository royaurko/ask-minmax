We recently presented a methodology for quantitatively reducing the risk and
cost of executing electronic transactions in a bursty network environment such
as the Internet. In the language of portfolio theory, time to complete a
transaction and its variance replace the expected return and risk associated
with a security, whereas restart times replace combinations of securities.
While such a strategy works well with single users, the question remains as to
its usefulness when used by many. By using mean field arguments and agent-based
simulations, we determine that a restart strategy remains advantageous even if
everybody uses it.
