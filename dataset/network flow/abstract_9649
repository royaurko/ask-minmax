We present a data compression and dimensionality reduction scheme for data
fusion and aggregation applications to prevent data congestion and reduce
energy consumption at network connecting points such as cluster heads and
gateways. Our in-network approach can be easily tuned to analyze the data
temporal or spatial correlation using an unsupervised neural network scheme,
namely the autoencoders. In particular, our algorithm extracts intrinsic data
features from previously collected historical samples to transform the raw data
into a low dimensional representation. Moreover, the proposed framework
provides an error bound guarantee mechanism. We evaluate the proposed solution
using real-world data sets and compare it with traditional methods for temporal
and spatial data compression. The experimental validation reveals that our
approach outperforms several existing wireless sensor network's data
compression methods in terms of compression efficiency and signal
reconstruction.
