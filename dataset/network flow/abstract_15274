Optimization algorithms are normally influenced by meta-heuristic approach.
In recent years several hybrid methods for optimization are developed to find
out a better solution. The proposed work using meta-heuristic Nature Inspired
algorithm is applied with back-propagation method to train a feed-forward
neural network. Firefly algorithm is a nature inspired meta-heuristic
algorithm, and it is incorporated into back-propagation algorithm to achieve
fast and improved convergence rate in training feed-forward neural network. The
proposed technique is tested over some standard data set. It is found that
proposed method produces an improved convergence within very few iteration.
This performance is also analyzed and compared to genetic algorithm based
back-propagation. It is observed that proposed method consumes less time to
converge and providing improved convergence rate with minimum feed-forward
neural network design.
