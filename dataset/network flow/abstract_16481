We present preliminary results of our analysis of the {\it Fermi}-LAT data
from the direction of NGC 4151. We find a new gamma-ray source with a
statistical significance sigma > 5, shifted by 0.5degr from the position of NGC
4151. Apparently, the source was bright only during a 1.5-year period between
December 2011 and June 2013 and it strongly contaminated the signal from NGC
4151. Therefore, we neglect this period in our analysis. We find two
additional, persistent gamma-ray sources with high sigma, shifted from NGC 4151
by ~1.5degr and 5degr, whose presence has been recently confirmed in the Third
Fermi Catalog. After subtracting the above sources, we still see a weak
residual, with sigma ~< 3, at the position of NGC 4151. We derive an upper
limit (UL) for the gamma-ray flux from NGC 4151 and we compare it with
predictions of the ADAF model which can explain the X-ray observations of this
object. We find that the Fermi UL strongly constrains non-thermal acceleration
processes in hot flows as well as the values of some crucial parameters. Here
we present the comparison with the hot flow models in which heating of
electrons is dominated by Coulomb interactions with hot protons. In such a
version of the model, the gamma-ray UL, combined with the X-ray data,
constrains the energy content in the non-thermal component of proton
distribution to at most a few per cent, rules out a weak (sub-equipartition)
magnetic field and favors a rapid rotation of the supermassive black hole.
