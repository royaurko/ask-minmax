We review the use of mean field theory for describing the dynamics of dense,
randomly connected cortical circuits. For a simple network of excitatory and
inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, we can show how the firing
irregularity, as measured by the Fano factor, increases with the strength of
the synapses in the network and with the value to which the membrane potential
is reset after a spike. Generalizing the model to include conductance-based
synapses gives insight into the connection between the firing statistics and
the high-conductance state observed experimentally in visual cortex. Finally,
an extension of the model to describe an orientation hypercolumn provides
understanding of how cortical interactions sharpen orientation tuning, in a way
that is consistent with observed firing statistics.
