We consider a $C^1$ neighborhood of the time-one map of a hyperbolic flow and
prove that the topological entropy varies continuously for diffeomorphisms in
this neighborhood. This shows that the topological entropy varies continuously
for all known examples of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with
one-dimensional center bundle.
