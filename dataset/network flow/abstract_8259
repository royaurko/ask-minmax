In this chapter we want to provide a review of the main results obtained in
the modeling of epidemic spreading in scale-free networks. In particular, we
want to show the different epidemiological framework originated by the lack of
any epidemic threshold and how this feature is rooted in the extreme
heterogeneity of the scale-free networks' connectivity pattern.
