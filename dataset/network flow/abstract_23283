In accreting neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems, NS
accretes material from its low-mass companion via a Keplerian disk. In a
viscous accretion disk, inflows orbit the NS and spiral in due to dissipative
processes, such as the viscous process and collisions of elements. The dynamics
of accretion flows in the inner region of an accretion disk is significantly
affected by the rotation of NS. The rotation makes NS, thus the space-time
metric, deviate from the originally spherical symmetry, and leads to
gravitational quadrupole, on one hand. On the other hand, a rotating NS drags
the local inertial frame in its vicinity, which is known as the rotational
frame-dragging effect. In this paper, {\bf we investigate the orbital motion of
accretion flows of accreting NS/LMXBs and demonstrate that the rotational
effects of NS result in a band of quasi-quantized structure in the inner region
of the accretion disk, which is different, in nature, from the scenario in the
strong gravity of black hole arising from the resonance for frequencies related
to epicyclic and orbital motions. We also demonstrate that such a disk
structure may account for frequencies seen in X-ray variability, such as
quasi-periodic oscillations, and can be a potential promising tool of
investigation for photon polarization.
