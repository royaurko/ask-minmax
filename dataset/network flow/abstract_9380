The properties of earthquake networks have been studied so far mainly for the
seismic data sets taken from California, Japan and Iran, and features common in
these regions have been reported in the literature. Here, an earthquake network
is constructed and analyzed for the Chilean data to examine if the scale-free
and small-world properties of the earthquake networks constructed in the other
geographical regions can also be found in seismicity in Chile. It is shown that
the result is affirmative: in all the regions both the exponent "gamma" of the
power-law connectivity distribution and the clustering coefficient C take the
universal invariant values "gamma ~1" and "C~0.85", respectively, as the cell
size becomes larger than a certain value, which is the scale of coarse graining
needed for constructing earthquake network. An interpretation for this
remarkable result is presented based on physical considerations.
