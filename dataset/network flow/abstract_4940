Any smooth surface in R^3 may be flattened along the z-axis, and the
flattened surface becomes close to a billiard table in R^2 . We show that,
under some hypotheses, the geodesic flow of this surface converges locally
uniformly to the billiard flow. Moreover, if the billiard is dispersive and has
finite horizon, then the geodesic flow of the corresponding surface is Anosov.
We apply this result to the theory of mechanical linkages and their dynamics:
we provide a new example of a simple linkage whose physical behavior is Anosov.
For the first time, the edge lengths of the mechanism are given explicitly.
