We explore isothermal shock formation in non-equatorial, adiabatic accretion
flows onto a rotating black hole, with possible application to some active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). The isothermal shock jump conditions as well as the
regularity condition, previously developed for one-dimensional (1D) flows in
the equatorial plane, are extended to two-dimensional (2D), non-equatorial
flows, to explore possible geometrical effects. The basic hydrodynamic
equations with these conditions are self-consistently solved in the context of
general relativity to explore the formation of stable isothermal shocks. We
find that strong shocks are formed in various locations above the equatorial
plane, especially around a rapidly-rotating black hole with the prograde flows
(rather than a Schwarzschild black hole). The retrograde flows are generally
found to develop weaker shocks. The energy dissipation across the shock in the
hot non-equatorial flows above the cooler accretion disk may offer an
attractive illuminating source for the reprocessed features, such as the iron
fluorescence lines, which are often observed in some AGNs.
