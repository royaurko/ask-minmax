In this paper we will give a new proof of the monotonicity of Wasserstein
distances of two diffusions under super Ricci flow. Our proof is based on the
coupling method of B.Andrew and J.Clutterbuck. The same method can also be
applied to the contractivity of normalized L-Wasserstein distance under
backward Ricci flow.
