Bidirectional associative memory (BAM) is a kind of an artificial neural
network used to memorize and retrieve heterogeneous pattern pairs. Many efforts
have been made to improve BAM from the the viewpoint of computer application,
and few theoretical studies have been done. We investigated the theoretical
characteristics of BAM using a framework of statistical-mechanical analysis. To
investigate the equilibrium state of BAM, we applied self-consistent signal to
noise analysis (SCSNA) and obtained a macroscopic parameter equations and
relative capacity. Moreover, to investigate not only the equilibrium state but
also the retrieval process of reaching the equilibrium state, we applied
statistical neurodynamics to the update rule of BAM and obtained evolution
equations for the macroscopic parameters. These evolution equations are
consistent with the results of SCSNA in the equilibrium state.
