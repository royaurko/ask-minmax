The ad hoc network places a vital role in contemporary days communication
scenario. This network performance gets up while the clustering phenomenon has
been incorporated. The cluster formation using the vital parameters is
incredible on deciding the efficiency level of the clustered ad hoc networks.
The PSO-PAC mechanism forms clusters based on swarm intelligence by considering
energy as crucial parameter. This optimized cluster helps to suits the
applications where the energy parameter plays a key role. The clusters formed
by this mechanism may not ascertain the compactness of the clusters. Thus, this
paper proposes D-PAC as an index based validation mechanism to be handled on
clusters formed using PSO-PAC. The cluster formation and validation mechanism
have been implemented using OMNET++ simulator.
