The strong longitudinal expansion of the reaction zone formed in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions is found to significantly reduce the spatially averaged
pion phase-space density, compared to naive estimates based on thermal
distributions. This has important implications for data interpretation and
leads to larger values for the extracted pion chemical potential at kinetic
freeze-out.
