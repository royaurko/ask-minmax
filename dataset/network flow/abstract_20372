Dislocation systems exhibit well known scaling properties such as the Taylor
relationship between flow stress and dislocation density, and the "law of
similitude" linking the flow stress to the characteristic wavelength of
dislocation patterns. Here we discuss the origin of these properties, which can
be related to generic invariance properties of the equations of evolution of
discrete dislocation systems, and their implications for a wide class of models
of dislocation microstructure evolution. We demonstrate that under certain
conditions dislocation simulations carried out at different stress, dislocation
density, and strain rate can be considered as equivalent, and we study the
range of deformation conditions ("similitude regime") over which this
equivalence can be expected to hold. In addition, we discuss the restrictions
imposed by the formulated invariance properties for density-based, nonlocal or
stochastic models of dislocation microstructure evolution, and for dislocation
patterns and size effects.
