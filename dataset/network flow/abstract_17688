We consider a reactive Boussinesq system with no stress boundary conditions
in a periodic domain which is unbounded in one direction. Specifically, we
couple the reaction-advection-diffusion equation for the temperature, $T$, and
the linearized Navier-Stokes equation with the Boussinesq approximation for the
fluid flow, $u$. We show that this system admits smooth pulsating front
solutions that propagate with a positive, fixed speed.
