Motivated by the Son-Yamamoto (SY) relation which connects the three point
and two-point correlators we consider the holographic RG flows in the bottom-up
approach to holographic QCD via the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation with respect
to the radial coordinate . It is shown that the SY relation is diagonal with
respect to the RG flow in the 5d YM-CS model while the RG equation acquires the
inhomogeneous term in the model with the additional scalar field which encodes
the chiral condensate.
