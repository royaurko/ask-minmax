We have studied the nuclear emission detected in high-resolution radio and
optical data of carefully selected samples of low luminosity AGN (LLAGN) in the
local universe. When the Eddington ratio is plotted against the nuclear
``radio-loudness'' parameter, sources divide according to their physical
properties. It is thus possible to disentangle between nuclear jets and
accretion disks of different radiative efficiencies. If this simple
interpretation is correct, we now have a powerful tool to investigate the
nature of the nuclear radiation, and identify radiatively inefficient accretion
flows (RIAF) candidates. Our results show that the best chance of investigating
RIAF processes in the IR-to-UV spectral region is to observe (at the resolution
provided by HST) the nuclei of unobscured Seyferts of the lowest luminosity, as
well as a sub-class of LINERs. In all other objects other radiation processes
dominate. In a sample of 132 LLAGN we identify 8 objects in which we predict
the radiation from a RIAF can be directly detected.
