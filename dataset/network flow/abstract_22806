We suggest a simple model for the dynamics of granular particles in
suspension which is suitable for an event driven algorithm, allowing to
simulate $N=\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ particles or more. As a first application we
consider a dense granular packing which is fluidized by an upward stream of
liquid, i.e. a fluidized bed. In the stationary state, when all forces balance,
we always observe a well defined interface whose width is approximately
independent of packing fraction. We also study the dynamics of expansion and
sedimentation after a sudden change in flow rate giving rise to a change in
stationary packing fraction and determine the timescale to reach a stationary
state.
