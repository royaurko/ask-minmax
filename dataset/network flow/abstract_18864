While analyzing mobile systems we often approximate the actual coverage
surface and assume an ideal cell shape. In a multi-cellular network, because of
its tessellating nature, a hexagon is more preferred than a circular geometry.
Despite this reality, perhaps due to the inherent simplicity, only a model for
circular based random spreading is available. However, if used, this results an
unfair terminal distribution for non-circular contours. Therefore, in this
paper we specifically derived an unbiased node density model for a hexagon. We
then extended the principle and established stochastic ways to handle sectored
cells. Next, based on these mathematical findings, we created a generic
modeling tool that can support a complex network with varying position,
capacity, size, user density, and sectoring capability. Last, simulation was
used to verify the theoretical analysis.
