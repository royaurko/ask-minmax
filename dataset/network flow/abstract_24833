In recent years, online education has been considered as one of the most
widely used IT services. Researchers in this field face many challenges in the
realm of Electronic learning services. Nowadays, many researchers in the field
of learning and eLearning study curriculum planning, considering its complexity
and the various numbers of effective parameters. The success of a curriculum is
a multifaceted issue which needs analytical modelling for precise simulations
of the different learning scenarios. In this paper, parameters involved in the
learning process will be identified and a curriculum will be propounded.
Furthermore, a Curriculum model will be proposed using the behavior of the
user, based on the logs of the server. This model will estimate the success
rate of the users while taking courses. Authentic Bayesian networks have been
used for modelling. In order to evaluate the proposed model, the data of three
consecutive semesters of 117 MS IT Students of E-Learning Center of Amirkabir
University of Technology has been used. The assessment clarifies the effects of
various parameters on the success of curriculum planning.
