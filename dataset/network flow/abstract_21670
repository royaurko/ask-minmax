I present a systematic approach to calculating soft-gluon corrections through
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order for arbitrary hard-scattering cross
sections. Using a unified approach, master formulas are derived for processes
with both simple and complex color flows. Applications and numerical results
are given for some processes of interest, including charged Higgs production
and top quark production in the Standard Model and beyond.
