An asymptotic interface equation for directional solidification near the
absolute stabiliy limit is extended by a nonlocal term describing a shear flow
parallel to the interface. In the long-wave limit considered, the flow acts
destabilizing on a planar interface. Moreover, linear stability analysis
suggests that the morphology diagram is modified by the flow near the onset of
the Mullins-Sekerka instability. Via numerical analysis, the bifurcation
structure of the system is shown to change. Besides the known hexagonal cells,
structures consisting of stripes arise. Due to its symmetry-breaking
properties, the flow term induces a lateral drift of the whole pattern, once
the instability has become active. The drift velocity is measured numerically
and described analytically in the framework of a linear analysis. At large flow
strength, the linear description breaks down, which is accompanied by a
transition to flow-dominated morphologies, described in a companion paper.
Small and intermediate flows lead to increased order in the lattice structure
of the pattern, facilitating the elimination of defects. Locally oscillating
structures appear closer to the instability threshold with flow than without.
