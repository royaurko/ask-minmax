In this study, we investigate the adaptation and robustness of a packet
switching network (PSN), the fundamental architecture of the Internet. We claim
that the adaptation introduced by a transmission control protocol (TCP)
congestion control mechanism is interpretable as the self-organization of
multiple attractors and stability to switch from one attractor to another. To
discuss this argument quantitatively, we study the adaptation of the Internet
by simulating a PSN using ns-2. Our hypothesis is that the robustness and
fragility of the Internet can be attributed to the inherent dynamics of the PSN
feedback mechanism called the congestion window size, or \textit{cwnd}. By
varying the data input into the PSN system, we investigate the possible
self-organization of attractors in cwnd temporal dynamics and discuss the
adaptability and robustness of PSNs. The present study provides an example of
Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety in action.
