Handoff performance of NEMO BS protocol with existent improvement proposals
is still not sufficient for real time and QoS-sensitive applications and
further optimizations are needed. When dealing with single homed NEMO, handoff
latency and packet loss become irreducible all optimizations included, so that
it is impossible to meet requirements of the above applications. Then, How to
combine the different Fast handoff approaches remains an open research issue
and needs more investigation. In this paper, we propose a new Infrastructure
independent handoff approach combining multihoming and intelligent
Make-Before-Break Handoff. Based on required Handoff time estimation, L2 and L3
handoffs are initiated using effective and timely MIH triggers, reducing so the
anticipation time and increasing the probability of prediction. We extend MIH
services to provide tunnel establishment and switching before link break. Thus,
the handoff is performed in background with no latency and no packet loss while
pingpong scenario is almost avoided. In addition, our proposal saves cost and
power consumption by optimizing the time of simultaneous use of multiple
interfaces. We provide also NS2 simulation experiments identifying suitable
parameter values used for estimation and validating the proposed model
