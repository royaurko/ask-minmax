We use a hydrodynamical model to describe the evolution of the collision
system at collision energies sqrt{s}=130 and 200 GeV. At lower sqrt{s}=130 GeV
energy we compare the results obtained assuming fast or slow thermalization
(thermalization times tau_0=0.6 and 4.1 fm/c, respectively) and show that slow
thermalization fails to reproduce the observed anisotropy of particle
distribution. At sqrt{s}=200 GeV collision energy our results show anisotropies
similar to those observed at sqrt{s}=130 GeV.
