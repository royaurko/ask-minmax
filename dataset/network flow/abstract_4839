To better understand the hydrodynamic flow behavior in turbulence,
Particle-Fluid flow have been studied using our Direct Numerical(DNS) based
software DSM on MUSCL-QUICK and finite volume algorithm. The particle flow was
studied using Eulerian-Eulerian Quasi Brownian Motion(QBM) based approach. The
dynamics is shown for various particle sizes which are very relevant to spray
mechanism for Industrial applications and Bio medical applications.
