Based on a recent work (Thouless, Ao, and Niu, Transverse force on a
quantized vortex in a superfluid) I show that the spectral or momentum flow due
to a moving vortex is identical to the phase slippage process discussed by
Josephson and Anderson. I also show that the force due to the spectral flow is
the reaction force of the Magnus force, and that the two forces act on
different objects. Therefore one can conclude that the evaluation of the
spepctral flow confirms the results by the Berry's phase calculation of the
Magnus force, not the cancelation of the Magnus force as claimed by some
contributors. A by-product of the present proof is that localized core states do not
contribute to the spectral flow, as also noted in the work of Thouless, Ao, and
Niu on the Magnus force.
