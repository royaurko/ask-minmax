A microscopic theory of control of spatial-temporal congested traffic pattern
at freeway bottlenecks is presented. Based on empirical spatial-temporal
features of congested patterns at freeway bottlenecks which have recently been
found, different control strategies for prevention or reducing of the patterns
are simulated and compared. The studied control strategies include the on-ramp
metering with feedback and automatic cruise control (ACC) vehicles. A recent
microscopic traffic flow model within the contributor's three-phase traffic theory
is used for validation of spatial-temporal congested pattern control.
