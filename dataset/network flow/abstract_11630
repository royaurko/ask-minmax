We introduce a new algorithm for modularity-based community detection in
large networks. The algorithm, which we refer to as a smart local moving
algorithm, takes advantage of a well-known local moving heuristic that is also
used by other algorithms. Compared with these other algorithms, our proposed
algorithm uses the local moving heuristic in a more sophisticated way. Based on
an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our smart local moving
algorithm identifies community structures with higher modularity values than
other algorithms for large-scale modularity optimization, among which the
popular 'Louvain algorithm' introduced by Blondel et al. (2008). The
computational efficiency of our algorithm makes it possible to perform
community detection in networks with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of
millions of edges. Our smart local moving algorithm also performs well in small
and medium-sized networks. In short computing times, it identifies community
structures with modularity values equally high as, or almost as high as, the
highest values reported in the literature, and sometimes even higher than the
highest values found in the literature.
