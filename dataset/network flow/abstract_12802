In this paper we study a semilinear hyperbolic-parabolic system modeling
biological phenomena evolving on a network composed by oriented arcs. We prove
the existence of global (in time) smooth solutions to this problem. The result
is obtained by using energy estimates with suitable transmission conditions at
nodes.
