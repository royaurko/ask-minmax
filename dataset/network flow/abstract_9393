In recent years, the mobile devices are equipped with several wireless
interfaces in heterogeneous environments which integrate a multitude of radio
access technologies (RAT's). The evolution of these technologies will allow the
users to benefit simultaneously from these RAT's. However, the most important
issue is how to choose the most suitable access network for mobile's user which
can be used as long as possible for communication. To achieve this issue, this
paper proposes a new approach for network selection decision based on Saaty's
Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and the Technique for Order
Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The FAHP method is used
to determine a weight for each criterion, and the TOPSIS method is applied to
rank the alternatives. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the
effectiveness of our new approach for network selection.
