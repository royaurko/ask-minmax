A universal integrable hierarchy underlying topological Landau-Ginzburg
models of D-tye is presented. Like the dispersionless Toda hierarchy, the new
hierarchy has two distinct (``positive" and ``negative") set of flows. Special
solutions corresponding to topological Landau-Ginzburg models of D-type are
characterized by a Riemann-Hilbert problem, which can be converted into a
generalized hodograph transformation. This construction gives an embedding of
the finite dimensional small phase space of these models into the full space of
flows of this hierarchy. One of flat coordinates in the small phase space turns
out to be identical to the first ``negative" time variable of the hierarchy,
whereas the others belong to the ``positive" flows.
