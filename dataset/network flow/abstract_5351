A new method called diffusion factorial moment (DFM) is used to obtain
scaling features embedded in spectra of complex networks. For an Erdos-Renyi
network with connecting probability $p_{ER} < \frac{1}{N}$, the scaling
parameter is $\delta = 0.51$, while for $p_{ER} \ge \frac{1}{N}$ the scaling
parameter deviates from it significantly. For WS small-world networks, in the
special region $p_r \in [0.05,0.2]$, typical scale invariance is found. For GRN
networks, in the range of $\theta\in[0.33,049]$, we have $\delta=0.6\pm 0.1$.
And the value of $\delta$ oscillates around $\delta=0.6$ abruptly. In the range
of $\theta\in[0.54,1]$, we have basically $\delta>0.7$. Scale invariance is one
of the common features of the three kinds of networks, which can be employed as
a global measurement of complex networks in a unified way.
