In the present paper we prove that the pipe Poiseuille flow of parabolic
velocity profile attenuates exponentially in time with respect to three
dimensional infinitesimal disturbances at all finite wave numbers and Reynolds
numbers for given azimuthal periodicity if the equations of motion are
linearized. The spectra of the eigenvalue are shown to consist of infinitely
many discrete eigen-modes. Results of asymptotic analysis, expressed in simple
algebraic formulas and functional relations, are given. Good comparison has
been found in the approximations and numerical computations. The present
results are best interpreted as a description of the pipe flow regime, where
the linear diffusion due to viscosity dominates.
