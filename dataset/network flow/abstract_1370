We present multiepoch VLBA observations of the compact jet of GRS 1915+105
conducted at 15.0 and 8.4 GHz during a {\it plateau} state of the source in
2003 March-April. These observations show that the compact jet is clearly
asymmetric. Assuming an intrinsically symmetric continuous jet flow, using
Doppler boosting arguments and an angle to the line of sight of
$\theta=70\degr$, we obtain values for the velocity of the flow in the range
0.3--0.5$c$. These values are much higher than in previous observations of such
compact jet, although much lower than the highly relativistic values found
during individual ejection events. These preliminary results are compatible
with current ideas on the jet flow velocity for black holes in the low/hard
state.
