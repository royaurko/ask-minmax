OpenFlow is one of the most commonly used protocols for communication between
the controller and the forwarding element in a software defined network (SDN).
A model based on M/M/1 queues is proposed in [1] to capture the communication
between the forwarding element and the controller. Albeit the model provides
useful insight, it is accurate only for the case when the probability of
expecting a new flow is small. Secondly, it is not straight forward to extend
the model in [1] to more than one forwarding element in the data plane. In this
work we propose a model which addresses both these challenges. The model is
based on Jackson assumption but with corrections tailored to the OpenFlow based
SDN network. Performance analysis using the proposed model indicates that the
model is accurate even for the case when the probability of new flow is quite
large. Further we show by a toy example that the model can be extended to more
than one node in the data plane.
