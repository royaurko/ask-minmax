In this paper we derive estimates to the free boundary problem for the Euler
equation with surface tension, and without surface tension provided the
Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition holds. We prove that as the surface tension
tends to zero, when the Rayleigh-Taylor condition is satisfied, solutions
converge to the Euler flow with zero surface tension.
