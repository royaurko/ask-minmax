A framework to analyze inference performance in densely connected
single-layer feed-forward networks is developed for situations where a given
data set is composed of correlated patterns. The framework is based on the
assumption that the left and right singular value bases of the given pattern
matrix are generated independently and uniformly from Haar measures. This
assumption makes it possible to characterize the objective system by a single
function of two variables which is determined by the eigenvalue spectrum of the
cross-correlation matrix of the pattern matrix. Links to existing methods for
analysis of perceptron learning and Gaussian linear vector channels and an
application to a simple but nontrivial problem are also shown.
