Traditional metrics of node influence such as degree or betweenness identify
highly influential nodes, but are rarely usefully accurate in quantifying the
spreading power of nodes which are not. Such nodes are the vast majority of the
network, and the most likely entry points for novel influences, be they
pandemic disease or new ideas. Several recent works have suggested metrics
based on path counting. The current work proposes instead using the expected
number of infected-susceptible edges, and shows that this measure predicts
spreading power in discrete time, continuous time, and competitive spreading
processes simulated on large random networks and on real world networks.
Applied to the Ugandan road network, it predicts that Ebola is unlikely to pose
a pandemic threat.
