In this work, we consider a network of cosmic strings to explain possible
deviation from \Lambda CDM behaviour. We use different observational data to
constrain the model and show that a small but non zero contribution from the
string network is allowed by the observational data which can result in a
reasonable departure from \Lambda CDM evolution. But by calculating the
Bayesian Evidence, we show that the present data still strongly favour the
concordance \Lambda CDM model irrespective of the choice of the prior.
