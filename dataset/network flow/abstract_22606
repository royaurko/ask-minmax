In the planar three-body problem, we study solutions with zero initial
velocity (brake orbits). Following such a solution until the three masses
become collinear (syzygy), we obtain a continuous, flow-induced Poincar\'e map.
We study the image of the map in the set of collinear configurations and define
a continuous extension to the Lagrange triple collision orbit. In addition we
provide a variational characterization of some of the resulting brake-to-syzygy
orbits and find simple examples of periodic brake orbits.
