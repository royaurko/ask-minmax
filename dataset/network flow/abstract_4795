Motivated by Pan-Yang [PY] and Ma-Cheng [MC], we study a general linear
nonlocal curvature flow for convex closed plane curves and discuss the short
time existence and asymptotic convergence behavior of the flow. Due to the
linear structure of the flow, this partial differential equation problem can be
resolved using an ordinary differential equation method, together with the help
of representation formula for solutions to a linear heat equation.
