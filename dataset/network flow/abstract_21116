We discuss the metastate, a probability measure on thermodynamic states, and
its usefulness in addressing difficult questions pertaining to the statistical
mechanics of systems with quenched disorder, in particular short-range spin
glasses. The possible low-temperature structures of realistic (i.e.,
short-range) spin glass models are described, and a number of fundamental open
questions are presented.
