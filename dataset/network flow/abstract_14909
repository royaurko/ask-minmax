We derived a well-balanced scheme using a hydrostatic reconstruction of the
variables at the interface of each cell to numerically simulate blood flow in
arteries with a varying section and elasticity. The method has been then
validated on examples taken from the literature, where an artery with a varying
section at rest and a constant elasticity were considered. Asymptotic solutions
were computed to highlight the effect of the viscous and viscoelastic source
terms. Finally, a simulation of blood flow in a tapered artery was performed,
where the section at rest and the elasticity were varying. In each test case,
the well-balanced scheme showed good results when other simpler schemes behaved
poorly, generating spurious reflections and nonphysical velocities.
