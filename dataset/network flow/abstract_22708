The combination of the high-order accurate spectral difference discretization
on unstructured grids with subgrid-scale modelling is investigated for large
eddy simulation of a muffler at Re = 4.64 10^4 and low Mach number. The
subgrid-scale stress tensor is modelled by the wall-adapting local
eddy-viscosity model with a cut-off length which is a decreasing function of
the order of accuracy of the scheme. Numerical results indicate that although
the high-order solver without subgrid-scale modelling is already able to
capture well the features of the flow, the coupling with the wall-adapting
local eddy-viscosity model improves the quality of the solution.
