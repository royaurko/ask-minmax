We investigate the response of non-expanding deconfined hot matter to energy
and momentum deposition from a pair of partons moving with high energies.
Several situations are examined with partons moving so that the generated wakes
in the medium interact. The resulting energy and flow profiles are studied.
Such cases are relevant for nuclear collisions at the LHC where several hard
partons are produced in a single collision and their contribution to collective
expansion of the fireball may be important.
