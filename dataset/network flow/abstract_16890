Elucidating the fitness measures optimized during the evolution of complex
biological systems is a major challenge in evolutionary theory. We present
experimental evidence and an analytical framework demonstrating how biochemical
networks exploit optimal control strategies in their evolutionary dynamics.
Optimal control theory explains a striking pattern of extremization in the
redox potentials of electron transport proteins, assuming only that their
fitness measure is a control objective functional with bounded controls.
