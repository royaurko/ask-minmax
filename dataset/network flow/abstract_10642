Locating the sources that trigger a dynamical process is a fundamental but
challenging problem in complex networks, ranging from epidemic spreading in
society and on the Internet to cancer metastasis in the human body. An accurate
localization of the source is inherently limited by our ability to
simultaneously access the information of all nodes in a large-scale complex
network, such as the time at which each individual is infected in a large
population. This thus raises two critical questions: how do we locate the
source from incomplete information and can we achieve full localization of
sources at any possible location from a given set of observers. Here we develop
an efficient algorithm to locate the source of a diffusion-like process and
propose a general locatability condition. We test the algorithm by employing
epidemic spreading and consensus dynamics as typical dynamical processes and
apply it to the H1N1 pandemic in China. We find that the sources can be
precisely located in arbitrary networks insofar as the locatability condition
is assured. Our tools greatly improve our ability to locate the source of
diffusion in complex networks based on limited accessibility of nodal
information. Moreover they have implications for controlling a variety of
dynamical processes taking place on complex networks, such as inhibiting
epidemics, slowing the spread of rumors, and eliminating cancer seed cells in
the human body.
