We numerically analyse the rotation of a neutrally buoyant spheroid in a
shear flow at small shear Reynolds number. Using direct numerical stability
analysis of the coupled nonlinear particle-flow problem we compute the linear
stability of the log-rolling orbit at small shear Reynolds number, ${\rm
Re}_a$. As ${\rm Re}_a \to 0$ and as the box size of the system tends to
infinity we find good agreement between the numerical results and earlier
analytical predictions valid to linear order in ${\rm Re}_a$ for the case of an
unbounded shear. The numerical stability analysis indicates that there are
corrections to the analytical result of order ${\rm Re}_a^{3/2}$. We also
compare the analytical results to results of lattice-Boltzmann simulations to
analyse the stability of the tumbling orbit at shear Reynolds numbers of order
unity. Theory for an unbounded system at infinitesimal shear Reynolds number
predicts a bifurcation of the tumbling orbit at aspect ratio $\lambda_{\rm c}
\approx 0.137$ below which tumbling is stable (as well as log rolling). The
simulation results show a bifurcation line in the $\lambda$-${\rm Re}_a$ plane
that reaches $\lambda \approx0.1275$ at the smallest shear Reynolds number
(${\rm Re}_a=1$) at which we could simulate with the lattice-Boltzmann code, in
qualitative agreement with the analytical results.
