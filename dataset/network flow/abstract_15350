Spin transport in carbon-based materials has stimulated much interest due to
their ballistic conductance and a long phase coherence length. While much
research has been conducted on individual carbon nanotubes, current growth and
placement techniques are incompatible with large-scale fabrication. Here we
report nonlocal spin injection and detection in single wall carbon nanotube
networks. We observe spin transport over a distance of 1 um, and extract a spin
diffusion length of 1.6 - 2.4 um with an injected spin polarization from CoFe
into nanotube network of 18 - 41%. Our observations demonstrate that spin
transport is possible in carbon nanotube networks due to the formation of
natural tunnel barriers between nanotubes and metallic contacts.
