Complex dynamics of chaotic maps under an infinite-precision mathematical
framework have been well known. The case in a finite-precision computer remains
to be further explored. Previous work treated a digital chaotic map as a black
box and gave different explanations according to the test results of the
output. Using the Logistic map as a typical example, we disclose some dynamical
properties of chaotic maps in fixed-point arithmetic by studying its
corresponding state network, where every possible value is considered as a node
and every possible mapping relation between a pair of nodes works as a directed
edge. The scale-free properties of the state network are quantitatively proven.
The obtained results can be extended to the scenario of floating-point
arithmetic and to other chaotic maps. Understanding the real network structure
of the state space of a chaotic map in the digital domain will help evaluate
and improve the randomness of pseudo-random number sequences generated by
chaotic maps.
