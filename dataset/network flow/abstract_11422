Cooperative relaying improves the performance of wireless networks by forming
a network of multiple independent virtual sources transmitting the same
information as the source node. However, interference induced in the network
reduces the performance of cooperative communications. In this work the
statistical properties, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the
probability density function (PDF) for a basic dual hop cooperative relay
network with an arbitrary number of interferers over Rayleigh fading channels
are derived. Two system models are considered: in the first system model, the
interferers are only at the relay node; and in the second system model,
interferers are both at the relay and the destination. This work is further
extended to Nakagami-m faded interfering channels. Simulation results are
presented on outage probability performance to verify the theoretical analysis.
