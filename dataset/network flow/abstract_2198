We interpret the physical $B$-field renormalization group flow in the
language of Courant algebroids, clarifying the sense in which this flow is the
natural "Ricci flow" for generalized geometry. Next we show that the $B$-field
renormalization group flow preserves T-duality in a natural sense. As
corollaries we obtain new long time existence results for the $B$-field
renormalization group flow.
