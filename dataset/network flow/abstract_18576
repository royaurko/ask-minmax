In this work, we design and analyze novel distributed scheduling algorithms
for multi-user MIMO systems. In particular, we consider algorithms which do not
require sending channel state information to a central processing unit, nor do
they require communication between the users themselves, yet, we prove their
performance closely approximates that of a centrally-controlled system, which
is able to schedule the strongest user in each time-slot.
  Our analysis is based on a novel application of the Point-Process
approximation. This novel technique allows us to examine non-homogeneous cases,
such as non-identically distributed users, or handling various QoS
considerations, and give exact expressions for the capacity of the system under
these schemes, solving analytically problems which to date had been open.
Possible application include, but are not limited to, modern 4G networks such
as 3GPP LTE, or random access protocols.
