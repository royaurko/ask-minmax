Critical states are studied by a real space RG in the problem with strong
diagonal disorder and long range power law hopping. The RG flow of the
distribution of coupling parameters is characterized by a family of non-trivial
fix points. We consider the RG flow of the distribution of participation ratios
of eigenstates. Scaling of participation ratios is sensitive to the nature of
the RG fix point. For some fix points, scaling of participation ratios is
characterized by a distribution of exponents, rather than by a single exponent.
  The RG method can be generalized to treat certain fermionic Hamiltonians with
disorder and long range hopping. We derive the RG for a model of interacting
two-level systems. Besides couplings, in this problem the RG includes the
density of states. The density of states is renormalized so that it develops a
singularity near zero energy.
