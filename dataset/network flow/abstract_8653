Current IP-based networks are unable to fully exploit the capabilities of the
increasing number of multihomed mobile terminals. We argue that Content-Centric
Networking (CCN), a novel networking architecture based on named information
objects, can fill the gap. In this paper, we elicit requirements for CCN packet
forwarding on multihomed mobile terminals. We categorize CCN forwarding
strategies according to their ability to fulfill these requirements and provide
a real-world performance evaluation in the current CCNx prototype
implementation. Moreover, we describe the initial design of an advanced
multipath forwarding strategy.
