We extend the theory of Cellular Automata to arbitrary, time-varying graphs.
In other words we formalize, and prove theorems about, the intuitive idea of a
labelled graph which evolves in time - but under the natural constraint that
information can only ever be transmitted at a bounded speed, with respect to
the distance given by the graph. The notion of translation-invariance is also
generalized. The definition we provide for these "causal graph dynamics" is
simple and axiomatic. The theorems we provide also show that it is robust. For
instance, causal graph dynamics are stable under composition and under
restriction to radius one. In the finite case some fundamental facts of
Cellular Automata theory carry through: causal graph dynamics admit a
characterization as continuous functions, and they are stable under inversion.
The provided examples suggest a wide range of applications of this mathematical
object, from complex systems science to theoretical physics. KEYWORDS:
