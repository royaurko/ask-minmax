We monitored water-vapor masers around the semi-regular variable star R
Crateris with the Japanese VLBI Network (J-Net) at the 22 GHz band during four
epochs with intervals of one month. The relative proper motions and
Doppler-velocity drifts of twelve maser features were measured. Most of them
existed for longer than 80 days. The 3-D kinematics of the features indicates a
bipolar expanding flow. The major axis of the asymmetric flow was estimated to
be at P.A. = 136 degrees. The existence of a bipolar outflow suggests that a
Mira variable star had already formed a bipolar outflow. The water masers are
in a region of apparent minimum radii of 1.3 x 10^12 m and maximum radii of 2.6
x 10^12 m, between which the expansion velocity ranges from 4.3 to 7.4 km/s.
These values suggest that the water masers are radially accelerated, but still
gravitationally bound, in the water-maser region. The most positive and
negative velocity-drifting features were found relatively close to the systemic
velocity of the star. We found that the blue-shifted features are apparently
accelerated and the red-shifted apparently decelerated. The acceleration of
only the blue-shifted features seems to be consistent with that of the
expanding flow from the star.
