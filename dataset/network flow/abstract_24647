A "quantitative function" for community detection called modularity density
has been proposed by Li, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, and Chen in $[$Phys. Rev. E 77,
036109 (2008)$]$. We study the modularity density maximization problem and we
discuss some features of the optimal solution. More precisely, we show that in
the optimal solution there can be communities having negative modularity
density, and we propose a modification of the original formulation to overcome
this issue. Moreover, we show that a clique can be divided into two or more
parts when maximizing the modularity density. We also compare the solution
found by maximizing the modularity density with that obtained by maximizing the
modularity on the Zachary karate club network.
