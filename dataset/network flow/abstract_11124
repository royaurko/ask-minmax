A lot of work has been done on routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks,
but still standardization of them requires some more issues less addressed by
the existing routing protocols. In this paper a new paradigm of maintaining
multiple connections in adhoc routing protocols has been highlighted which may
be crucial for efficient routing in mobile ad hoc networks. The problem of
multiple connections has been hardly worked on in adhoc networks. In this paper
the solution of route maintenance if nodes are maintaining multiple connections
has been proposed. This idea not only helps to solve the multiple connections
problem, but also take care of proper bandwidth distribution to different
connections as per different traffic types. Study has been incorporated on
existing AODV with changes. Simulation studies have been performed over packet
delivery ratio, throughput and message overheads. Results show that the
proposed solution for multiple connections is efficient and worth implementing
in existing as well as new protocols.
