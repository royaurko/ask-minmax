Let $\phi$ be the flow generated by a smooth vector field $X$ on a smooth
closed manifold. We show that the Lipschitz shadowing property of $\phi$ is
equivalent to the structural stability of $X$ and that the Lipschitz periodic
shadowing property of $\phi$ is equivalent to the $\Omega$-stability of $X$.
