We study the effect of shear flow on the entropic Helfrich interaction in
lyotropic surfactant smectic fluids. Arguing that flow induces an effective
anisotropic surface tension in bilayers due to a combination of intermonolayer
friction, bilayer collisions and convection, we calculate the reduction in
fluctuations and hence the renormalised change in effective compression modulus
and steady-state layer spacing. We demonstrate that non-permeable or slowly
permeating membranes can be susceptible to a undulatory instability of the
Helfrich-Hurault type, and speculate that such an instability could be one
source of a transition to multilamellar vesicles.
