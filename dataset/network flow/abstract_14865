We study and measure the transmission coefficient of counter-propagating
shallow-water waves produced by a wave generator and scattered by an obstacle.
To precisely compare theoretical predictions and experimental data, we consider
$\sim 25$ frequencies for 5 subcritical background flows, where the maximum
value of the Froude number ranges from $0.5$ to $0.75$. For each flow, the
transmission coefficient displays a sharp transition separating total
transmission from wave-blocking. Both the width and the central frequency of
the transition are in good agreement with their theoretical values. The shape
of the obstacle is identical to that used by the Vancouver team in the recent
experiment aiming at detecting the analogue of stimulated Hawking radiation.
Our results are compatible with the observations that have been reported. They
complete them by establishing that the contribution of the transmission
coefficient cannot be neglected for the lower half of the probed frequency
range.
