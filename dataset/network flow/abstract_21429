We apply the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, developed
originally to calculate rarefied gas dynamical problems, to study the gas flow
in an accretion disc in a close binary system. The method involves viscosity
and thermal conduction automatically, and can thus simulate turbulent viscosity
(alpha viscosity).
