Around the world, several scientific projects share the interest of a global
network of small Cherenkov telescopes for monitoring observations of the
brightest blazars - the DWARF network. A small, ground based, imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescope of last generation is intended to be installed
and operated in Romania as a component of the DWARF network. To prepare the
construction of the observatory, two support projects have been initiated.
Within the framework of these projects, we have assessed a number of possible
sites where to settle the observatory. In this paper we submit a brief report
on the general characteristics of the best four sites selected after the local
infrastructure, the nearby facilities and the social impact criteria have been
applied.
