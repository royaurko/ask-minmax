Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) consist of wireless mobile nodes which
coordinate with each other to form temporary network without its pre-existing
infrastructure. AODV is popular Ad-hoc distance vector routing reactive
protocol which is used to find correct & shortest route to destination. Due to
openness, dynamic, infrastructure-less nature, MANET are vulnerable to various
attacks. One of these possible attacks is a Black Hole Attack in which a mobile
node falsely replies to the source node that it is having a shortest path to
the destination without checking its routing table. Therefore source node send
all of its data to the black hole node and it deprives all the traffic of the
source node. In this paper, We are proposing a technique to detect and prevent
the multiple black hole nodes from MANET so that source to destination
communication can be made easily. We also analysed the performance of the
network in terms of number of packets sent, received, throughput, energy of
network before attack and after detection & prevention of Attack. From these
analysis, we can conclude that performance decreased due to attack can be
improved after detection & prevention black hole attack in MANET.
