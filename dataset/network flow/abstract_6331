This paper considers the problem of algorithm selection for community
detection. The aim of community detection is to identify sets of nodes in a
network which are more interconnected relative to their connectivity to the
rest of the network. A large number of algorithms have been developed to tackle
this problem, but as with any machine learning task there is no
"one-size-fits-all" and each algorithm excels in a specific part of the problem
space. This paper examines the performance of algorithms developed for weighted
networks against those using unweighted networks for different parts of the
problem space (parameterised by the intra/inter community links). It is then
demonstrated how the choice of algorithm (weighted/unweighted) can be made
based only on the observed network.
