We study cosmological backgrounds from the point of view of the dS/CFT
correspondence and its renormalization group flow extension. We focus on the
case where gravity is coupled to a single scalar with a potential. Depending on
the latter, the scalar can drive both inflation and the accelerated expansion
(dS) phase in the far future. We also comment on quintessence scenarios, and
flows familiar from the AdS/CFT correspondence. We finally make a tentative
embedding of this discussion in string theory where the scalar is the dilaton
and the potential is generated at the perturbative level.
