A numerically effective procedure for determining weakly reversible chemical
reaction networks that are linearly conjugate to a known reaction network is
proposed in this paper. The method is based on translating the structural and
algebraic characteristics of weak reversibility to logical statements and
solving the obtained set of linear (in)equalities in the framework of mixed
integer linear programming. The unknowns in the problem are the reaction rate
coefficients and the parameters of the linear conjugacy transformation. The
efficacy of the approach is shown through numerical examples.
