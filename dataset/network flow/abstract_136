We proved uniqueness and instability of the symmetric subsonic--sonic flow
solution of the compressible potential flow equation in a surface with
convergent areas of cross--sections. Such a surface may be regarded as an
approximation of a two--dimensional convergent nozzle in aerodynamics.
Mathematically these are uniqueness and nonexistence results of a nonlinear
degenerate elliptic equation with Bernoulli type boundary conditions. The proof
depends on maximum principles and a generalized Hopf boundary point lemma which
was proved in the paper.
