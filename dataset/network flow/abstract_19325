The cluster Abell 2199 is one of the prototypical ``cooling flow'' clusters.
Its central cD galaxy is host to a steep-spectrum radio source, of the type
associated with cooling cores. In this paper we combine radio data with new
ROSAT HRI data to show that conditions in its inner core, less than 50 kpc, are
complex and interesting. Energy and momentum flux from the radio jet have been
significant in the dynamics of the gas in the core. In addition, the Faraday
data detects a dynamically important magnetic field there. The core of the
X-ray luminous gas is not a simple, spherically symmetric cooling inflow. In
addition, we believe the X-ray gas has had strong effects on the radio source.
It seems to have disrupted the jet flow, which has led to dynamical history
very different from the usual radio galaxy. This particular source is much
younger than the galaxy, which suggests the disruptive effects lead to an
on-off duty cycle for such sources.
