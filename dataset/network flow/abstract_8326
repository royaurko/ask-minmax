Using simulated collider data for $p+p\rightarrow 2{\rm Jets}\ $ interactions
in a 2-barrel pixel detector, a neural network is trained to construct the
coordinate of the primary vertex to a high degree of accuracy. Three other
estimates of this coordinate are also considered and compared to that of the
neural network. It is shown that the network can match the best of the
traditional estimates.
