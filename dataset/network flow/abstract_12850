We compute f-mode travel-time sensitivity kernels for flows. Using a
two-dimensional model, we show that it is important to account for several
systematic effects, such as the foreshortening and the projection of the
velocity vector onto the line of sight. Correcting for these effects is
necessary before any data inversion is attempted away from the center of the
solar disk.
