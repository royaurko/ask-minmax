In this paper we consider finite volume hyperbolic manifolds X with non-empty
totally geodesic boundary. We consider the distribution of the times for the
geodesic flow to hit the boundary and derive a formula for the moments of the
associated random variable in terms of the orthospectrum. We show that the the
first two moments correspond to two cases of known identities for the
orthospectrum. We further obtain an explicit formula in terms of the
trilogarithm functions for the average time for the geodesic flow to hit the
boundary in the surface case, using the third moment.
