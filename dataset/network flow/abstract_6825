Chemically patterned surfaces are of significant interest in the context of
microfluidic applications. Miniaturization of such devices will eventually lead
to structures on the nano-scale. Whereas on the micron scale purely macroscopic
descriptions of liquid flow are valid, on the nanometer scale long-ranged
inter-molecular interactions, thermal fluctuations such as capillary waves, and
finally the molecular structure of the liquid become important. We discuss the
most important conceptual differences between flow on chemically patterned
substrates on the micron scale and on the nanometer scale. These concern the
structure of the triple line, the type of interactions between neighboring
liquid flows, and the influence of the molecular structure of the liquid on the
flow. We formulate four design issues for nanofluidics related to channel
width, channel separation, and channel bending radius, and conclude with a
discussion of the relevance of the conceptual differences between the micron
scale and the nanometer scale for these issues.
