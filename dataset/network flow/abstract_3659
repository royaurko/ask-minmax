This thesis presents an overview of the flow equations recently introduced by
Wegner. The little known mathematical framework of the flow in the manifold of
unitarily equivalent matrices, as discovered in the mathematical literature
before Wegner's paper, is established in the initial chapter and used as a
background for the entire presentation. The application of flow equations to
the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation and to the elimination of the
electron-phonon coupling in a solid is reviewed. Recent flow equations
approaches to the Lipkin model are examined thoroughly, paying special
attention to their utility near the phase change boundary. We present more
robust schemes by requiring that expectation values be flow dependent; either
through a variational or self-consistent calculation. The similarity
renormalization group equations recently developed by Glazek and Wilson are
also reviewed. Their relationship to Wegner's flow equations is investigated
through the aid of an instructive model.
