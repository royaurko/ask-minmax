Routing the packets efficiently in mobile ad hoc network does not have end to
end paths. Multiple copies are forwarded from the source to the destination. To
deal with such networks, researches introduced flooding based routing schemes
which leads to high probability of delivery. But the flooding based routing
schemes suffered with contention and large delays. Here the proposed protocol
"Spray Select Focus", sprays a few message copies into the network, neighbors
receives a copy and by that relay nodes we are choosing the shortest route and
then route that copy towards the destination. Previous works assumption is that
there is no contention and dead ends. But we argue that contention and dead
ends must be considered for finding efficiency in routing. So we are including
a network which has contention and dead ends and we applied the proposed
protocol. We can say that this protocol works well for the contention based
network.
