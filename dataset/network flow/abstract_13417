Starting with Knutson and Tao's hive model (in J. Amer. Math. Soc., 1999) we
characterize the Littlewood-Richardson coefficient $c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu$ of
given partitions $\lambda,\mu,\nu\in N^n$ as the number of capacity achieving
hive flows on the honeycomb graph. Based on this, we design a polynomial time
algorithm for deciding $c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu >0$. This algorithm is easy to
state and takes $O(n^3 \log \nu_1)$ arithmetic operations and comparisons. We
further show that the capacity achieving hive flows can be seen as the vertices
of a connected graph, which leads to new structural insights into
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
