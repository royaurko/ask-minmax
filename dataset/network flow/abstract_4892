We present a numerical method for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of
compressible two-phase flows. The method is validated for the flow in a micro
channel with a step-like restriction. This setup is representative for typical
cavitating multi-phase flows in fuel injectors and follows an experimental
study of Iben et al., 2010. While a diesel-like test fuel was used in the
experiment, we solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a barotropic
equation of state for water and vapor and a simple phase-change model based on
equilibrium assumptions. Our LES resolve all wave dynamics in the compressible
fluid and the turbulence production in shear layers.
