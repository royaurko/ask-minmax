We introduce a measure of {\em greedy connectivity} for geographical networks
(graphs embedded in space) and where the search for connecting paths relies
only on local information, such as a node's location and that of its neighbors.
Constraints of this type are common in everyday life applications. Greedy
connectivity accounts also for imperfect transmission across established links
and is larger the higher the proportion of nodes that can be reached from other
nodes with a high probability. Greedy connectivity can be used as a criterion
for optimal network design.
