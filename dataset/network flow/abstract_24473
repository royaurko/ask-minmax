Excitons, quasi-particles consisting of electron-hole pairs bound by the
Coulomb interaction, are a potential medium for processing of photonic
information in the solid-state. Information processing via excitons requires
efficient techniques for the transport and manipulation of these uncharged
particles. We introduce here a novel concept for the interconnection of
multiple remote exciton systems based on the long-range transport of dipolar
excitons by a network of configurable interconnects driven by acoustic wave
beams. By combining this network with electrostatic gates, we demonstrate an
integrated exciton multiplexer capable of interconnecting, gating and routing
exciton systems separated by millimeter distances. The multiplexer provides a
scalable platform for the manipulation of exciton fluids with potential
applications in information processing.
