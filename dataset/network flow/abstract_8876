This paper describes a technique of real time head gesture recognition
system. The method includes Gaussian mixture model (GMM) accompanied by optical
flow algorithm which provided us the required information regarding head
movement. The proposed model can be implemented in various control system. We
are also presenting the result and implementation of both mentioned method.
