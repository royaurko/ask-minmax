We derive the first luminosity-metallicity relation for a large objectively
selected sample of local galaxy pairs and we compare the pairs LZ relation with
the relation for the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey (NFGS). Galaxy pair members
with small projected separations (s<20 kpc/h) have systematically lower
metallicities (~0.2 dex on average) than the field galaxies, or than more
widely separated pairs at the same luminosity. There is a strong correlation
between metallicity and central burst strength in the galaxy pairs. All five
galaxies in the pairs sample with strong central bursts have close companions
and metallicities lower than the comparable field galaxies. Our results provide
strong observational evidence for a merger scenario where galaxy interactions
cause gas flows towards the central regions, carrying less enriched gas from
the outskirts of the galaxy into the central regions. The less enriched gas
dilutes the pre-existing nuclear gas to produce a lower metallicity than would
be obtained prior to the interaction. These gas flows trigger central bursts of
star formation, causing strong central burst strengths, and possibly aiding the
formation of blue bulges. We show that the timescale and central gas dilution
required by this scenario are consistent with predictions from hydrodynamic
merger models.
