A mesoscopic model of a diblock copolymer is used to study the stability of a
uniform lamellar phase under a reciprocating shear flow. Approximate viscosity
contrast between the microphases is allowed through a linear dependence of the
(Newtonian) shear viscosity on monomer composition. We first show that
viscosity contrast does not affect the composition of the base lamellar phase
in an unbounded geometry, and that it only couples weakly to long wavelength
perturbations. A perturbative analysis is then presented to address the
stability of uniform lamellar structures under long wavelength perturbations by
self-consistently solving for the composition and velocity fields of the
perturbations. Stability boundaries are obtained as functions of the physical
parameters of the polymer, the parameters of the flow and the initial
orientation of the lamellae. We find that all orientations are linearly stable
within specific ranges of parameters, but that the perpendicular orientation is
generally stable within a larger range than the parallel orientation. Secondary
instabilities are both of the Eckhaus type (longitudinal) and zig-zag type
(transverse). The former is not expected to lead to re-orientation of the
lamella, whereas in the second case the critical wavenumber is typically found
to be along the perpendicular orientation.
