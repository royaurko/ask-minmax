Stents are medical devices designed to modify blood flow in aneurysm sacs, in
order to prevent their rupture. Some of them can be considered as a locally
periodic rough boundary. In order to approximate blood flow in arteries and
vessels of the cardio-vascular system containing stents, we use multi-scale
techniques to construct boundary layers and wall laws. Simplifying the flow we
turn to consider a 2-dimensional Poisson problem that conserves essential
features related to the rough boundary. Then, we investigate convergence of
boundary layer approximations and the corresponding wall laws in the case of
Neumann type boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet parts of the domain.
The difficulty comes from the fact that correctors, for the boundary layers
near the rough surface, may introduce error terms on the other portions of the
boundary. In order to correct these spurious oscillations, we introduce a
vertical boundary layer. Trough a careful study of its behavior, we prove
rigorously decay estimates. We then construct complete boundary layers that
respect the macroscopic boundary conditions. We also derive error estimates in
terms of the roughness size epsilon either for the full boundary layer
approximation and for the corresponding averaged wall law.
