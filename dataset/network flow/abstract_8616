Breast cancer has been reported to account for the maximum cases among all
female cancers till date. In order to gain a deeper insight into the
complexities of the disease, we analyze the breast cancer network and its
normal counterpart at the proteomic level. While the short range correlations
in the eigenvalues exhibiting universality provide an evidence towards the
importance of random connections in the underlying networks, the long range
correlations along with the localization properties reveal insightful
structural patterns involving functionally important proteins. The analysis
provides a benchmark for designing drugs which can target a subgraph instead of
individual proteins.
