Multi-channel multi-interface Wireless Mesh Networks permit to spread the
load across orthogonal channels to improve network capacity. Although broadcast
is vital for many layer-3 protocols, proposals for taking advantage of multiple
channels mostly focus on unicast transmissions. In this paper, we propose
broadcast algorithms that fit any channel and interface assignment strategy.
They guarantee that a broadcast packet is delivered with a minimum probability
to all neighbors. Our simulations show that the proposed algorithms efficiently
limit the overhead.
