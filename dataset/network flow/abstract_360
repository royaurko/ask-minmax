Packet and flow scheduling algorithms for WiMAX has been a topic of interest
for a long time since the very inception of WiMAX networks. WiMAX offers
advantages particularly in terms of Quality of service it offers over a longer
range at the MAC level. In our work, we propose two credit based scheduling
schemes one in which completed flows distributes the left over credits equally
to all higher priority uncompleted flows(ODRREDC) and another in which
completed flows give away all the excess credits to the highest priority
uncompleted flow(ODRRSDC). Both the schemes are compatible with 802.16 MAC
protocol and can efficiently serve real time bursty traffic with reduced
latency and hence improved QOS for real time flows. We compare the two proposed
schemes for their latency, bandwidth utilization and throughput for real time
burst flows with the opportunity based Deficit Round Robin scheduling scheme.
While the ODRR scheduler focuses on reducing the credits for the flows with
errors, our approach also distributes these remaining credits together with the
credits from completed flows equally among the higher priority uncompleted
flows or totally to the highest priority uncompleted flow.
