When a group of people unknown to each other meet and familiarize among
themselves, over time they form a community on a macroscopic scale. This
phenomenon can be understood in the context of percolation transition (PT) of
networks, which takes place continuously in the classical random graph model.
Recently, a modified model was introduced in which the formation of the
community was suppressed. Then the PT occurs explosively at a delayed
transition time. Whether the explosive PT is indeed discontinuous or continuous
becomes controversial. Here we show that type of PT depends on a detailed
dynamic rule. Thus, when the dynamic rule is designed to suppress the growth of
overall clusters, then the explosive PT could be discontinuous.
