We consider extensions of the lattice gas model to incorporate radial flow.
Experimental data are used to set the magnitude of radial flow. This flow is
then included in the Lattice Gas Model in a microcanonical formalism. For
magnitudes of flow seen in experiments, the main effect of the flow on
observables is a shift along the $E^*/A$ axis.
