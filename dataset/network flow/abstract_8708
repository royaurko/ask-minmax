Baraviera and Bonatti proved that it is possible to perturb, in the c^1
topology, a volume-preserving and partial hyperbolic diffeomorphism in order to
obtain a non-zero sum of all the Lyapunov exponents in the central direction.
In this article we obtain the analogous result for volume-preserving flows.
