In this paper, the relationship between the network synchronizability and the
edge distribution of its associated graph is investigated. First, it is shown
that adding one edge to a cycle definitely decreases the network
sychronizability. Then, since sometimes the synchronizability can be enhanced
by changing the network structure, the question of whether the networks with
more edges are easier to synchronize is addressed. It is shown by examples that
the answer is negative. This reveals that generally there are redundant edges
in a network, which not only make no contributions to synchronization but
actually may reduce the synchronizability. Moreover, an example shows that the
node betweenness centrality is not always a good indicator for the network
synchronizability. Finally, some more examples are presented to illustrate how
the network synchronizability varies following the addition of edges, where all
the examples show that the network synchronizability globally increases but
locally fluctuates as the number of added edges increases.
