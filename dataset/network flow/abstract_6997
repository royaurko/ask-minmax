Spectrum of kinematic fast dynamo operators in Ricci compressible flows in
Einstein 2-manifolds is investigated. A similar expression, to the one obtained
by Chicone, Latushkin and Montgomery-Smith (Comm Math Phys (1995)) is given,
for the fast dynamo operator. The operator eigenvalue is obtained in a highly
conducting media, in terms of linear and nonlinear orders of Ricci scalar.
Eigenvalue spectra shows that there is a relation between the Ricci scalar and
expansion of the flow. Spatial 3-Einstein manifold section of
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) is obtained in the limit of ideal plasma. If
the trace of the Ricci curvature tensor is negative, a contraction of the
inflationary phase of the universe takes place, and the dynamo action takes
place. When the universe expands a decaying magnetic field or non-dynamo is
obtained. As in Latushkin and Vishik (Comm Math Phys (2003)) the Lyapunov
exponents in kinematic dynamos is also investigated. Since positive curvature
scalar are preserved under Ricci flow, it is shown that fast dynamos are
preserved under this same flow.
