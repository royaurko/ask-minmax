Recent empirical research has shown that links between groups reinforce
individuals within groups to adopt cooperative behaviour. Moreover, links
between networks may induce cascading failures, competitive percolation, or
contribute to efficient transportation. Here we show that there in fact exists
an intermediate fraction of links between groups that is optimal for the
evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game. We consider individual
groups with regular, random, and scale-free topology, and study their different
combinations to reveal that an intermediate interdependence optimally
facilitates the spreading of cooperative behaviour between groups. Excessive
between-group links simply unify the two groups and make them act as one, while
too rare between-group links preclude a useful information flow between the two
groups. Interestingly, we find that between-group links are more likely to
connect two cooperators than in-group links, thus supporting the conclusion
that they are of paramount importance.
