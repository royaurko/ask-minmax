In a recent paper [arXiv:1403.4772], we gave a prescription how to construct
a correctly-normalized conserved energy--momentum tensor in lattice gauge
theory containing fermions, on the basis of the Yang--Mills gradient flow. In
the present note, we give an almost identical but somewhat superior
prescription with which one can simply set the fermion mass parameter in our
formulation zero for the massless fermion. This feature will be useful in
applying our formulation to theories in which the masslessness of the fermion
is crucial, such as multi-flavor gauge theories with an infrared fixed point.
