We review the quark coalescence model for hadronization in relativistic heavy
ion collisions and show how it can explain the observed large baryon to meson
ratio at intermediate transverse momentum and scaling of the elliptic flows of
identified hadrons. We also show its predictions on higher-order anisotropic
flows and discuss how quark coalescence applied to open- and hidden-charm
mesons can give insight to charm quark interactions in the quark-gluon plasma
and $J/\Psi$ production in heavy ion collisions.
