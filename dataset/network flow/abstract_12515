Congestion is a problem of paramount importance in resource constrained
Wireless Sensor Networks, especially for large networks, where the traffic
loads exceed the available capacity of the resources. Sensor nodes are prone to
failure and the misbehavior of these faulty nodes creates further congestion.
The resulting effect is a degradation in network performance, additional
computation and increased energy consumption, which in turn decreases network
lifetime. Hence, the data packet routing algorithm should consider congestion
as one of the parameters, in addition to the role of the faulty nodes and not
merely energy efficient protocols. Unfortunately most of the researchers have
tried to make the routing schemes energy efficient without considering
congestion factor and the effect of the faulty nodes. In this paper we have
proposed a congestion aware, energy efficient, routing approach that utilizes
Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, in which faulty nodes are isolated by means
of the concept of trust. The merits of the proposed scheme are verified through
simulations where they are compared with other protocols.
