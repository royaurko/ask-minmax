It is known that the presence of background magnetic field in cosmic plasma
distorts the acoustic peaks in CMBR. This primarily results from different
types of waves in the plasma with velocities depending on the angle between the
magnetic field and the wave vector. We consider the consequences of these
effects in relativistic heavy-ion collisions where very strong magnetic fields
arise during early stages of the plasma evolution. We show that flow
coefficients can be significantly affected by these effects when the magnetic
field remains strong during early stages due to strong induced fields in the
conducting plasma. In particular, the presence of magnetic field can lead to
enhancement in the elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$.
