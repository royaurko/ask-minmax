A class of exact solutions of Hele-Shaw flows without surface tension in a
rotating cell is reported. We show that the interplay between injection and
rotation modifies drastically the scenario of formation of finite-time cusp
singularities. For a subclass of solutions, we show that, for any given initial
condition, there exists a critical rotation rate above which cusp formation is
prevented. We also find an exact sufficient condition to avoid cusps
simultaneously for all initial conditions. This condition admits a simple
interpretation related to the linear stability problem.
