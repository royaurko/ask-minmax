The turbulent energy flow of the onedimensional Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak
equation is studied numerically. The system exhibits weak turbulence for weak
driving forces, while weak turbulence coexists with strongly nonlinear
intermittent collapses when the system is strongly driven. These two types of
dynamics can be distinguished by their energy and particle fluxes. The weakly
turbulent process can be characterized by fluxes in wavenumber space, while
additional fluxes in amplitude space emerge in the intermittent process. The
particle flux is directed from low amplitudes towards high amplitudes, and the
energy flows in the opposite direction.
