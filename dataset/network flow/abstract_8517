We consider multi-resolution streaming in fully-connected peer-to-peer
networks, where transmission rates are constrained by arbitrarily specified
upload capacities of the source and peers. We fully characterize the capacity
region of rate vectors achievable with arbitrary coding, where an achievable
rate vector describes a vector of throughputs of the different resolutions that
can be supported by the network. We then prove that all rate vectors in the
capacity region can be achieved using pure routing strategies. This shows that
coding has no capacity advantage over routing in this scenario.
