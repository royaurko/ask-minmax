We study the correlated-disorder driven zero-temperature phase transition of
the Random-Field Ising Magnet using exact numerical ground-state calculations
for cubic lattices. We consider correlations of the quenched disorder decaying
proportional to r^a, where r is the distance between two lattice sites and a<0.
To obtain exact ground states, we use a well established mapping to the
graph-theoretical maximum-flow problem, which allows us to study large system
sizes of more than two million spins. We use finite-size scaling analyses for
values a={-1,-2,-3,-7} to calculate the critical point and the critical
exponents characterizing the behavior of the specific heat, magnetization,
susceptibility and of the correlation length close to the critical point. We
find basically the same critical behavior as for the RFIM with delta-correlated
disorder, except for the finite-size exponent of the susceptibility and for the
case a=-1, where the results are also compatible with a phase transition at
infinitesimal disorder strength.
