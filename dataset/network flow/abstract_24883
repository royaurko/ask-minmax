G.fast is an upcoming next generation DSL standard envisioned to use
bandwidth up to 212 MHz. Far-end crosstalk (FEXT) at these frequencies greatly
overcomes direct links. Its cancellation based on non-linear
Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP) proved to show significant advantage over
standard linear precoding. This paper proposes a novel THP structure in which
ordering of successive interference pre-cancellation can be optimized for
downstream with non-cooperating receivers. The optimized scheme is compared to
existing THP structure denoted as equal-rate THP which is widely adopted in
wireless downlink. Structure and performance of both methods differ
significantly favoring the proposed scheme. The ordering that maximizes the
minimum rate (max-min fairness) for each tone of the discrete multi-tone
modulation is the familiar V-BLAST ordering. However, V-BLAST does not lead to
the global maximum when applied independently on each tone. The proposed novel
Dynamic Ordering (DO) strategy takes into account asymmetric channel statistics
to yield the highest minimum aggregated rate.
