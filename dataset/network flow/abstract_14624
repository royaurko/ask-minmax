In this numerical study on two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection we
consider $10^7 \leq Ra \leq 10^{12}$ in aspect ratio $0.23 \leq \Gamma \leq 13$
samples. We focus on several cases. First we consider small aspect ratio cells,
where at high Ra number we find a sharp transition from a low Ra number branch
towards a high Ra number branch, due to changes in the flow structure.
Subsequently, we show that the influence of the aspect ratio on the heat
transport decreases with increasing aspect ratio, although even at very large
aspect ratio of $\Gamma\approx10$ variations up to 2.5% in the heat transport
as a function of \Gamma are observed. Finally, we observe long-lived transients
up to at least $Ra=10^9$, as in certain aspect ratio cells we observe different
flow states that are stable for thousands of turnover times.
