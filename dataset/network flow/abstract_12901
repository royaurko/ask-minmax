The Josephson effect in cyclically coupled Bose-Einstein condensates is
studied theoretically. We analyze the simultaneous Gross-Pitaevskii equations
with coupling terms between adjacent condensates. Depending on the initial
relative phases between condensates, Josephson current flows cyclically to make
a quantized vortex. Reducing the coupling between condensates changes the
motion from periodic to chaotic, thus suppressing the cyclic current. The
relation to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism is discussed.
