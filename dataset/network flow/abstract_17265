Delay-based congestion control algorithms provide higher throughput and
stability than traditional loss-based AIMD algorithms, but they are inherently
unfair against older connections when the queuing and the propagation delay
cannot be measured accurately and independently. This paper presents a novel
measurement algorithm whereby fairness between old and new connections is
preserved. The algorithm does not modify the dynamics of congestion control,
and runs entirely in the server host using locally available information.
