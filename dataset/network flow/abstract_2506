In the paper we show that the bibliographic data can be transformed into a
collection of compatible networks. Using network multiplication different
interesting derived networks can be obtained. In defining them an appropriate
normalization should be considered. The proposed approach can be applied also
to other collections of compatible networks. We also discuss the question when
the multiplication of sparse networks preserves sparseness. The proposed
approaches are illustrated with analyses of collection of networks on the topic
"social network" obtained from the Web of Science.
