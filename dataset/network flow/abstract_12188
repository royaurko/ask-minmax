Since 2007 the Japanese video network provided significant amount of meteor
data observed by multi station video meteor network located in Japan. The
network detects meteors mostly up to +2 magnitude and is probably the most
accurate and largest freely accessible video meteor database up-to-date. In
this paper we present our analysis on the qualitative aspects of the meteor
orbits derived from the multi station video observation and the separation of
the shower meteors from the sporadic background.
