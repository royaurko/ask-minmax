Ad-hoc routing protocols use a number of algorithms for route discovery. Some
use flooding in which a route request packet (RREQ) is broadcasted from a
source node to other nodes in the network. This often leads to unnecessary
retransmissions, causing congestion and packet collisions in the network, a
phenomenon called a broadcast storm. This paper presents a RREQ message
forwarding scheme for AODV that reduces routing overheads. This has been called
AODV_EXT. Its performance is compared to that of AODV, DSDV, DSR and OLSR
protocols. Simulation results show that AODV_EXT achieves 3% energy efficiency,
19.5% improvement in data throughput and 69.5% reduction in the number of
dropped packets for a network of 50 nodes. Greater efficiency is achieved in
high density network and marginal improvement in networks with a small number
of nodes.
