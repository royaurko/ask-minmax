The ongoing debate over net neutrality covers a broad set of issues related
to the regulation of public networks. In two ways, we extend an idealized
usage-priced game-theoretic framework based on a common linear demand-response
model. First, we study the impact of "side payments" among a plurality of
Internet service (access) providers and content providers. In the
non-monopolistic case, our analysis reveals an interesting "paradox" of side
payments in that overall revenues are reduced for those that receive them.
Second, assuming different application types (e.g., HTTP web traffic,
peer-to-peer file sharing, media streaming, interactive VoIP), we extend this
model to accommodate differential pricing among them in order to study the
issue of application neutrality. Revenues for neutral and non-neutral pricing
are compared for the case of two application types.
