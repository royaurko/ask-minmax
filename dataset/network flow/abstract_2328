In this note we study conformal Ricci flow introduced by Arthur Fischer. We
use DeTurck's trick to rewrite conformal Ricci flow as a strong
parabolic-elliptic partial differential equations. Then we prove short time
existences for conformal Ricci flow on compact manifolds as well as on
asymptotically flat manifolds. We show that Yamabe constant is monotonically
increasing along conformal Ricci flow on compact manifolds. We also show that
conformal Ricci flow is the gradient flow for the ADM mass on asymptotically
flat manifolds.
