A nonlocal interface equation is derived for two-phase fluid flow, with
arbitrary wettability and viscosity contrast c=(mu_1-mu_2)/(mu_1+mu_2), in a
model porous medium defined as a Hele-Shaw cell with random gap b_0+delta b.
Fluctuations of both capillary and viscous pressure are explicitly related to
the microscopic quenched disorder, yielding conserved, non-conserved and
power-law correlated noise terms. Two length scales are identified that control
the possible scaling regimes and which scale with capillary number as ell_1 ~
b_0(c Ca)^{-1/2} and ell_2 ~ b_0 Ca^{-1}. Exponents for forced fluid invasion
are obtained from numerical simulation and compared with recent experiments.
