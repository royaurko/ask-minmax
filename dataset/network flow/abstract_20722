Uniform sampling from graphical realizations of a given degree sequence is a
fundamental component in simulation-based measurements of network observables,
with applications ranging from epidemics, through social networks to Internet
modeling. Existing graph sampling methods are either link-swap based
(Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithms) or stub-matching based (the Configuration
Model). Both types are ill-controlled, with typically unknown mixing times for
link-swap methods and uncontrolled rejections for the Configuration Model. Here
we propose an efficient, polynomial time algorithm that generates statistically
independent graph samples with a given, arbitrary, degree sequence. The
algorithm provides a weight associated with each sample, allowing the
observable to be measured either uniformly over the graph ensemble, or,
alternatively, with a desired distribution. Unlike other algorithms, this
method always produces a sample, without back-tracking or rejections. Using a
central limit theorem-based reasoning, we argue, that for large N, and for
degree sequences admitting many realizations, the sample weights are expected
to have a lognormal distribution. As examples, we apply our algorithm to
generate networks with degree sequences drawn from power-law distributions and
from binomial distributions.
