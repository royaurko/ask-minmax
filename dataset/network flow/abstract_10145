The 1998 outburst of XTE J1550-564 started with a hard X-ray spike, rising in
less than a day and declining after 3-4 days; at the same time, the soft X-ray
flux was rising with a longer timescale (~ 10 days). We suggest that the soft
and the initial hard X-ray emission are produced by two different components of
the accretion flow: a higher angular momentum flow, which forms the disk, and a
lower angular momentum flow feeding the hot inner region. Thus, we argue that
the onset of the outburst is determined by an increased mass transfer rate from
the companion star, but the outburst morphology is also determined by the
distribution of specific angular momentum in the accreting matter. In XTE
J1550-564, we attribute the initial, impulsive low angular momentum accretion
to the breaking down of magnetic confinement by the magnetically active
secondary star. We show that a hard X-ray spike is seen at the onset of an
outburst in other BHCs.
