We discuss a general definition of directional derivative of any tensor flow
field and its practical applications in physics. It is shown that both
Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions as complementary types of flow field
specifications adopted in modern theoretical hydrodynamics, imply two
complementary types of directional derivatives as corresponding mathematical
constructions. One of them is the Euler substantive derivative useful only in
the contexts of initial Cauchy problem and the other, called here as the local
directional derivative, arises only in the context of so-called final Cauchy
problem. The choice between Lagrangian and Eulerian specifications is
demonstrated to be equivalent to the choice between space-time with Euclidean
or Minkowski metric for any flow field domain, respectively. Mathematical
consideration is developed within the framework of diffeomorfic transformations
for general 4-dimensional differentiable manifold. The analytical expression
for local directional derivative is formulated in form of a theorem. Although
the consideration is developed for ideal one-component (scalar) flow field, it
can be easily generalized to any tensor field. Some implications of the local
directional derivative concept for the classical theory of fields are also
explored.
