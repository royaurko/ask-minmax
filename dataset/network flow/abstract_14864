The Tayler instability is a kink-type flow instability which occurs when the
electrical current through a conducting fluid exceeds a certain critical value.
Originally studied in the astrophysical context, the instability was recently
shown to be also a limiting factor for the upward scalability of liquid metal
batteries. In this paper, we continue our efforts to simulate this instability
for liquid metals within the framework of an integro-differential equation
approach. The original solver is enhanced by multi-domain support with
Dirichlet-Neumann partitioning for the static boundaries. Particular focus is
laid on the detailed influence of the axial electrical boundary conditions on
the characteristic features of the Tayler instability, and, secondly, on the
occurrence of electro-vortex flows and their relevance for liquid metal
batteries.
