There is a trend toward the use of predictive systems in communications
networks. At the systems and network management level predictive capabilities
are focused on anticipating network faults and performance degradation.
Simultaneously, mobile communication networks are being developed with
predictive location and tracking mechanisms. The interactions and synergies
between these systems present a new set of problems. A new predictive network
management framework is developed and examined. The interaction between a
predictive mobile network and the proposed network management system is
discussed. The Rapidly Deployable Radio Network is used as a specific example
to illustrate these interactions.
