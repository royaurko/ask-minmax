We consider an alternative approach for the computation of the stochastic
gravitational wave background generated by small loops produced throughout the
cosmological evolution of cosmic string networks and use it to derive an
analytical approximation to the corresponding power spectrum. We show that this
approximation produces an excellent ?t to more elaborate results obtained using
the Velocity-dependent One-Scale model to describe cosmic string network
dynamics, over a wide frequency range, in the small-loop regime.
