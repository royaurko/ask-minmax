In this paper we study the equations governing the unsteady motion of an
incompressible homogeneous generalized second grade fluid subject to periodic
boundary conditions. We establish the existence of global-in-time strong
solutions for shear thickening flows in the two and three dimensional case. We
also prove uniqueness of such solution without any smallness condition on the
initial data or restriction on the material moduli.
