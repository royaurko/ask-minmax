Epidemics occur in all shapes and forms: infections propagating in our sparse
sexual networks, rumours and diseases spreading through our much denser social
interactions, or viruses circulating on the Internet. With the advent of large
databases and efficient analysis algorithms, these processes can be better
predicted and controlled. In this study, we use different characteristics of
network organization to identify the influential spreaders in 17 empirical
networks of diverse nature using 2 epidemic models. We find that a judicious
choice of local measures, based either on the network's connectivity at a
microscopic scale or on its community structure at a mesoscopic scale, compares
favorably to global measures, such as betweenness centrality, in terms of
efficiency, practicality and robustness. We also develop an analytical
framework that highlights a transition in the characteristic scale of different
epidemic regimes. This allows to decide which local measure should govern
immunization in a given scenario.
