In this paper, we propose a fast fully convolutional neural network (FCNN)
for crowd segmentation. By replacing the fully connected layers in CNN with 1
by 1 convolution kernels, FCNN takes whole images as inputs and directly
outputs segmentation maps by one pass of forward propagation. It has the
property of translation invariance like patch-by-patch scanning but with much
lower computation cost. Once FCNN is learned, it can process input images of
any sizes without warping them to a standard size. These attractive properties
make it extendable to other general image segmentation problems. Based on FCNN,
a multi-stage deep learning is proposed to integrate appearance and motion cues
for crowd segmentation. Both appearance filters and motion filers are
pretrained stage-by-stage and then jointly optimized. Different combination
methods are investigated. The effectiveness of our approach and component-wise
analysis are evaluated on two crowd segmentation datasets created by us, which
include image frames from 235 and 11 scenes, respectively. They are currently
the largest crowd segmentation datasets and will be released to the public.
