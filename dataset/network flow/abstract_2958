We extend recent theoretical approximations describing the transition to
synchronization in large undirected networks of coupled phase oscillators to
the case of directed networks. We also consider extensions to networks with
mixed positive/negative coupling strengths. We compare our theory with
numerical simulations and find good agreement.
