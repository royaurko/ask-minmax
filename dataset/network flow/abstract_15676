We study cascades on a two-layer multiplex network, with asymmetric feedback
that depends on the coupling strength between the layers. Based on an
analytical branching process approximation, we calculate the systemic risk
measured by the final fraction of failed nodes on a reference layer. The
results are compared with the case of a single layer network that is an
aggregated representation of the two layers. We find that systemic risk in the
two-layer network is smaller than in the aggregated one only if the coupling
strength between the two layers is small. Above a critical coupling strength,
systemic risk is increased because of the mutual amplification of cascades in
the two layers. We even observe sharp phase transitions in the cascade size
that are less pronounced on the aggregated layer. Our insights can be applied
to a scenario where firms decide whether they want to split their business into
a less risky core business and a more risky subsidiary business. In most cases,
this may lead to a drastic increase of systemic risk, which is underestimated
in an aggregated approach.
