A dynamic procedure for the Lagrangian Averaged Navier-Stokes-$\alpha$
(LANS-$\alpha$) equations is developed where the variation in the parameter
$\alpha$ in the direction of anisotropy is determined in a self-consistent way
from data contained in the simulation itself. The dynamic model is initially
tested in forced and decaying isotropic turbulent flows where $\alpha$ is
constant in space but it is allowed to vary in time. It is observed that by
using the dynamic LANS-$\alpha$ procedure a more accurate simulation of the
isotropic homogeneous turbulence is achieved. The energy spectra and the total
kinetic energy decay are captured more accurately as compared with the
LANS-$\alpha$ simulations using a fixed $\alpha$. In order to evaluate the
applicability of the dynamic LANS-$\alpha$ model in anisotropic turbulence, a
priori test of a turbulent channel flow is performed. It is found that the
parameter $\alpha$ changes in the wall normal direction. Near a solid wall, the
length scale $\alpha$ is seen to depend on the distance from the wall with a
vanishing value at the wall. On the other hand, away from the wall, where the
turbulence is more isotropic, $\alpha$ approaches an almost constant value.
Furthermore, the behavior of the subgrid scale stresses in the near wall region
is captured accurately by the dynamic LANS-$\alpha$ model. The dynamic
LANS-$\alpha$ model has the potential to extend the applicability of the
LANS-$\alpha$ equations to more complicated anisotropic flows.
