There is a gap in the proof of Lemma VII.4 in [Ann. of Math. (2) 145 (1997),
81--137]. We present an alternative proof of Theorem B (C^1 Omega-stable
vector fields satisfy Axiom A). The novel and essential part in the proof of
the stability and Omega-stability conjectures for flows is the connecting
lemma introduced previously. A mistake in the proof of the last conjecture was
pointed out to me by Toyoshiba, who later also provided an independent proof
of it, again based on the connecting lemma and previous arguments by Ma\~n\'e
and Palis.
