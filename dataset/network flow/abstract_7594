Flow measurements are reviewed with particular emphasis on the hydrodynamic
character of elliptic flow at RHIC. Hydrodynamic scaling compatible with the
production of highly thermalized matter having a high degree of collective
interactions and extremely low viscosity, is observed for a broad selection of
the data. These properties suggest the production of a new state of strongly
interacting nuclear matter at extremely high density and temperature where the
relevant degrees of freedom are those of quarks and gluons, ie. the sQGP.
