Chemical-Vapor-Deposition (CVD) diamond films were prepared using a variation
of nitrogen addition into the gas source admixture by a direct current CVD
method. The influence of nitrogen addition on the crystallographic texture and
grain shape evolution in heteroepitaxial polycrystalline diamond films was
investigated using high-resolution electron backscattering diffraction
(HR-EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The analysis reveals that an addition of
1.5% N2 to the CH4 gas flow leads to a strong enhancement of a {110} fiber
texture. The phenomenon is discussed in terms of a competitive growth selection
mechanism.
