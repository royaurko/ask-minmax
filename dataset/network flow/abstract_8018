The spontaneous flapping of a flag in a steady flow can be used to power an
output circuit using piezoelectric elements positioned at its surface. Here, we
study numerically the effect of inductive circuits on the dynamics of this
fluid-solid-electric system and on its energy harvesting efficiency. In
particular, a destabilization of the system is identified leading to energy
harvesting at lower flow velocities. Also, a frequency lock-in between the flag
and the circuit is shown to significantly enhance the system's harvesting
efficiency. These results suggest promising efficiency enhancements of such
flow energy harvesters through the output circuit optimization.
