Web-fraud is one of the most unpleasant features of today's Internet. Two
well-known examples of fraudulent activities on the web are phishing and
typosquatting. Their effects range from relatively benign (such as unwanted
ads) to downright sinister (especially, when typosquatting is combined with
phishing). This paper presents a novel technique to detect web-fraud domains
that utilize HTTPS. To this end, we conduct the first comprehensive study of
SSL certificates. We analyze certificates of legitimate and popular domains and
those used by fraudulent ones. Drawing from extensive measurements, we build a
classifier that detects such malicious domains with high accuracy.
