Distributed processing across a networked environment suffers from
unpredictable behavior of speedup due to heterogeneous nature of the hardware
and software in the remote machines. It is challenging to get a better
performance from a distributed system by distributing task in an intelligent
manner such that the heterogeneous nature of the system do not have any effect
on the speedup ratio. This paper introduces homogenization, a technique that
distributes and balances the workload in such a manner that the user gets the
highest speedup possible from a distributed environment. Along with providing
better performance, homogenization is totally transparent to the user and
requires no interaction with the system.
