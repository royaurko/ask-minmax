A coarse-grained version of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is developed
with the intent of enhancing its geometrical flexibility so as to be able to
tackle a wider class of flows of engineering interest. To this purpose, the
original uniform LB technique is combined with standard finite-volume
techniques based upon a blend of piecewise constant and piecewise linear
interpolation schemes. A series of validation tests for the three dimensional
channel flow with one-dimensional (cross-channel) statistical behaviour are
presented. The main conclusion is that, although the method does indeed mark a
significant stride forward with respect to the original uniform LB scheme,
better interpolation schemes should be developed before the coarse-grain LB can
become fully competitive with modern CFD schemes.
