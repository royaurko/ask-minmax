Routing in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) benefits considerably if one can
take advantage of knowledge concerning node mobility. The main contribution of
this paper is the definition of a generic routing scheme for DTNs using a
high-dimensional Euclidean space constructed upon nodes' mobility patterns. For
example, nodes are represented as points having as coordinates their
probability of being found in each possible location. We present simulation
results indicating that such a scheme can be beneficial in a scenario inspired
by studies done on real mobility traces. This work should open the way to
further use of the virtual space formalism in DTN routing.
