We analyze weakly nonlinear stability of a flow of viscous conducting liquid
driven by pressure gradient in the channel between two parallel walls subject
to a transverse magnetic field. Using a non-standard numerical approach, we
compute the linear growth rate correction and the first Landau coefficient,
which in a sufficiently strong magnetic field vary with the Hartmann number as
$\mu_{1}\sim(0.814-\mathrm{i}19.8)\times10^{-3}\textit{Ha}$ and
$\mu_{2}\sim(2.73-\mathrm{i}1.50)\times10^{-5}\textit{Ha}^{-4}$. These
coefficients describe a subcritical transverse velocity perturbation with the
equilibrium amplitude
$|A|^{2}=\Re[\mu_{1}]/\Re[\mu_{2}](\textit{Re}_{c}-\textit{Re})\sim29.8\textit{Ha}^{5}(\textit{Re}_{c}-\textit{Re})$
which exists at Reynolds numbers below the linear stability threshold
$\textit{Re}_{c}\sim 4.83\times10^{4}\textit{Ha}.$ We find that the flow
remains subcritically unstable regardless of the magnetic field strength. Our
method for computing Landau coefficients differs from the standard one by the
application of the solvability condition to the discretized rather than
continuous problem. This allows us to bypass both the solution of the adjoint
problem and the subsequent evaluation of the integrals defining the inner
products, which results in a significant simplification of the method.
