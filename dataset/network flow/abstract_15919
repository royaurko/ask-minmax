This paper proposes a unique discovery signal as an enabler of peer-to-peer
(P2P) communication which overlays a cellular network and shares its resources.
Applying P2P communication to cellular network has two key issues: 1.
Conventional ad hoc P2P connections may be unstable since stringent resource
and interference coordination is usually difficult to achieve for ad hoc P2P
communications; 2. The large overhead required by P2P communication may offset
its gain. We solve these two issues by using a special discovery signal to aid
cellular network-supervised resource sharing and interference management
between cellular and P2P connections. The discovery signal, which facilitates
efficient neighbor discovery in a cellular system, consists of un-modulated
tones transmitted on a sequence of OFDM symbols. This discovery signal not only
possesses the properties of high power efficiency, high interference tolerance,
and freedom from near-far effects, but also has minimal overhead. A practical
discovery-signal-based P2P in an OFDMA cellular system is also proposed.
Numerical results are presented which show the potential of improving local
service and edge device performance in a cellular network.
