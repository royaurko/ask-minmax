The small-world networks recently introduced by Watts and Strogatz [Nature
393, 440 (1998)] has attracted much interests in studying the interesting
properties of the networks without time-delay. However, a signal or influence
travelling on the small-world networks often associated with time-delay
features which are very common in biological and physical networks. We develop
an analytical approach as well as numerical simulations to try to characterize
the effect of time-delay on the properties of small-world networks. An
analytical expression of the fractal dimension of the small-world networks is
given and thus compared with the results from numerical simulations. Analysis
shows that small-world networks with time-delay generally have the
multifractals property.
