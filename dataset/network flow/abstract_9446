New generation passive optical network aims at providing more than 100 Gb/s
capacity. Thanks to recent progress enabling a variety of optical transceivers
up to 40 Gb/s, many evolution possibilities to 200G PONs (passive optical
network) could be investigated. This work proposes two directly deployable
cases of evolution to 200G PON based on the combination of these improved
optical transceivers and WDM (wavelength division multiplexing). The physical
layer of the optical network has been simulated with OptiSystem software to
show the communication links performances behavior when considering key
components parameters in order to achieve good network design for a given area.
The complexity of the proposed architectures and financial cost comparisons are
also discussed.
