The "power of choice" has been shown to radically alter the behavior of a
number of randomized algorithms. Here we explore the effects of choice on
models of tree and network growth. In our models each new node has k randomly
chosen contacts, where k > 1 is a constant. It then attaches to whichever one
of these contacts is most desirable in some sense, such as its distance from
the root or its degree. Even when the new node has just two choices, i.e., when
k=2, the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree.
For instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to the
root of the tree, the distribution of depths changes from Poisson to a
traveling wave solution. If the new node attaches to the contact with the
smallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random
graph, so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network with
degree greater than O(log log N). Finally, if the new node attaches to the
contact with the largest degree, we find that the degree distribution is a
power law with exponent -1 up to degrees roughly equal to k, with an
exponential cutoff beyond that; thus, in this case, we need k >> 1 to see a
power law over a wide range of degrees.
