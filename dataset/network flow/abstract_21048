We show that the time development of the Coulomb gap in a Coulomb glass can
involve very long relaxation times due to electron rearrangement and hopping.
We find that an applied magnetic field reduces the rate of electron hopping
and, hence, Coulomb gap formation. These results are consistent with recent
conductance experiments on thin semiconducting and metallic films.
