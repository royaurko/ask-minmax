This paper analyzes the multiuser diversity gain in a cognitive radio (CR)
system where secondary transmitters opportunistically utilize the spectrum
licensed to primary users only when it is not occupied by the primary users. To
protect the primary users from the interference caused by the missed detection
of primary transmissions in the secondary network, minimum average throughput
of the primary network is guaranteed by transmit power control at the secondary
transmitters. The traffic dynamics of a primary network are also considered in
our analysis. We derive the average achievable capacity of the secondary
network and analyze its asymptotic behaviors to characterize the multiuser
diversity gains in the CR system.
