The generation of mean magnetic fields is studied for a simple non-helical
flow where a net cross helicity of either sign can emerge. This flow, which is
also known as the Archontis flow, is a generalization of the
Arnold--Beltrami--Childress flow, but with the cosine terms omitted. The
presence of cross helicity leads to a mean-field dynamo effect that is known as
the Yoshizawa effect. Direct numerical simulations of such flows demonstrate
the presence of magnetic fields on scales larger than the scale of the flow.
Contrary to earlier expectations, the Yoshizawa effect is found to be
proportional to the mean magnetic field and can therefore lead to its
exponential instead of just linear amplification for magnetic Reynolds numbers
that exceed a certain critical value. Unlike $\alpha$ effect dynamos, it is
found that the Yoshizawa effect is not noticeably constrained by the presence
of a conservation law. It is argued that this is due to the presence of a
forcing term in the momentum equation which leads to a nonzero correlation with
the magnetic field. Finally, the application to energy convergence in solar
wind turbulence is discussed.
