This paper presents a new discrete event-based network simulator named TARVOS
- Computer Networks Simulator, being designed as part of the first Author's
Masters research and will provide support to simulating MPLS architecture,
several RSVP-TE protocol functionalities and fast recovery in case of link
failure. The tool is used in a case study, where the impact of a link failure
on a VoIP application, within an MPLS domain network, is analyzed. The paper
displays a preliminary research of six already available simulators and reasons
why they were not adopted as tools for the Masters research. Then, it follows
to describe the basics of TARVOS implementation and exhibits the case study
simulated by this new tool.
