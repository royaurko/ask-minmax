We analyze spreading of a density front in the K\"untz-Lavall\'ee model of
porous media. In contrast to previous studies, where unusual properties of the
front were attributed to anomalous diffusion, we find that the front evolution
is controlled by normal diffusion and hydrodynamic flow, the latter being
responsible for apparent enhancement of the front propagation speed. Our
finding suggests that results of several recent experiments on porous media,
where anomalous diffusion was reported based on the density front propagation
analysis, should be reconsidered to verify the role of a fluid flow.
