Protocells are supposed to have played a key role in the self-organizing
processes leading to the emergence of life. Existing models either (i) describe
protocell architecture and dynamics, given the existence of sets of
collectively self-replicating molecules for granted, or (ii) describe the
emergence of the aforementioned sets from an ensemble of random molecules in a
simple experimental setting (e.g. a closed system or a steady-state flow
reactor) that does not properly describe a protocell. In this paper we present
a model that goes beyond these limitations by describing the dynamics of sets
of replicating molecules within a lipid vesicle. We adopt the simplest possible
protocell architecture, by considering a semi-permeable membrane that selects
the molecular types that are allowed to enter or exit the protocell and by
assuming that the reactions take place in the aqueous phase in the internal
compartment. As a first approximation, we ignore the protocell growth and
division dynamics. The behavior of catalytic reaction networks is then
simulated by means of a stochastic model that accounts for the creation and the
extinction of species and reactions. While this is not yet an exhaustive
protocell model, it already provides clues regarding some processes that are
relevant for understanding the conditions that can enable a population of
protocells to undergo evolution and selection.
