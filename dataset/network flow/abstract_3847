We study a statistical model describing the steady state distribution of the
fluxes in a metabolic network. The resulting model on continuous variables can
be solved by the cavity method. In particular analytical tractability is
possible solving the cavity equation over an ensemble of networks with the same
degree distribution of the real metabolic network. The flux distribution that
optimizes production of biomass has a fat tail with a power-law exponent
independent on the structural properties of the underling network. These
results are in complete agreement with the Flux-Balance-Analysis outcome of the
same system and in qualitative agreement with the experimental results.
