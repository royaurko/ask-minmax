A new class of automata networks is defined. Their evolution rules are
determined by a probability measure p on the set of all integers Z and an
indicator function I_A on the interval [0,1]. It is shown that any cellular
automaton rule can be represented by a (nonunique) rule formulated in terms of
a pair (p,I_A). This new class of automata networks contains discrete systems
which are not cellular automata. Some of their properties are discussed.
