A statistically stationary turbulence with a mean shear gradient is realized
in a flow driven by suitable body forces. The flow domain is periodic in
downstream and spanwise directions and bounded by stress free surfaces in the
normal direction. Except for small layers near the surfaces the flow is
homogeneous. The fluctuations in turbulent energy are less violent than in the
simulations using remeshing, but the anisotropy on small scales as measured by
the skewness of derivatives is similar and decays weakly with increasing
Reynolds number.
