To study mechanisms that cause the non-Gaussian nature of network traffic, we
analyzed IP flow statistics. For greedy flows in particular, we investigated
the hop counts between source and destination nodes, and classified
applications by the port number. We found that the main flows contributing to
the non-Gaussian nature of network traffic were HTTP flows with relatively
small hop counts compared with the average hop counts of all flows.
