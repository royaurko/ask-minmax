We study the dual 3d Euclidean RG flow of single-field slow-roll Inflation
using the postulates of the dS/CFT correspondence. For that purpose we solve
for the inflationary fluctuation at all times using a matching procedure
between two approximate solutions which are separately valid at different
regions of the space of parameters but together cover all of it. The two modes
of the full solution mix such that each of the modes at late times is a
superposition of the modes in the quasi-de Sitter region. We find that the dual
theory admits two phases of explicit and spontaneous breaking of conformal
symmetry.
  We also find that the mixing effect between the two modes in the bulk implies
that slow-roll inflation does not guarantee, but rather generically generates,
a nearly scale invariant power spectrum, except in fine-tuned situations. We
suggest that the mixing effect can have a unique signature on other
cosmological observables such as the bispectrum.
