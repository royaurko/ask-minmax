In recent years the modelling of traffic flow using methods from statistical
physics, especially cellular automata models have allowed simulations of large
traffic networks faster than real time. In this paper, we study a probabilistic
cellular automaton model for microsimulations of traffic flow of automated
vehicles in highways. This model describes single-lane traffic flow on a ring.
We study the equilibrium properties by including a parameter of safe distance
in the model and calculate the so-called fundamental diagrams (flow vs. density
graph) considering parallel dynamics. This is done numerically by computer
simulations of the model and by means of an analysis of speed variance.
