We investigate collective synchronous behaviors in random complex networks of
limit-cycle oscillators with the non-identical asymmetric coupling scheme, and
find a uniform coupling criticality of collective synchronization which is
independent of complexity of network topologies. Numerically simulations on
categories of random complex networks have verified this conclusion.
