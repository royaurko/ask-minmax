A new 3D transition turbulence model, more accurate and faster than an
empirical transition model, is proposed. The model is based on the calculation
of the pre-transitional u'v' due to mean flow shear. The present transition
model is fully described and verified against eight benchmark test cases.
Computations are performed for the ERCOFTAC flat-plate T3A, T3C and T3L test
cases. Further, the model is validated for bypass, cross-flow and separation
induced transition and compared with empirical transition models. The model
presents very good results for bypass transition under zero-pressure gradient
and with pressure gradient flow conditions. Also the model is able to correctly
predict separation induced transition. However, for very low speed and low
free-stream turbulence intensity the model delays separation induced transition
onset. The model also shows very good results for transition under complex
cross-flow conditions in three-dimensional geometries. The 3D tested case was
the 6:1 prolate-spheroid under three flow conditions.
