We show that discretization of internode distribution in complex networks
affects internode distances l_ij calculated as a function of degrees (k_i k_j)
and an average path length <l> as function of network size N. For dense
networks there are log-periodic oscillations of above quantities. We present
real-world examples of such a behavior as well as we derive analytical
expressions and compare them to numerical simulations. We consider a simple
case of network optimization problem, arguing that discrete effects can lead to
a nontrivial solution.
