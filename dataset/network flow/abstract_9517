A class of queueing networks which consist of single-server fork-join nodes
with infinite buffers is examined to derive a representation of the network
dynamics in terms of max-plus algebra. For the networks, we present a common
dynamic state equation which relates the departure epochs of customers from the
network nodes in an explicit vector form determined by a state transition
matrix. We show how the matrix may be calculated from the service time of
customers in the general case, and give examples of matrices inherent in
particular networks.
