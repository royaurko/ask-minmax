Long short-term memory (LSTM) based acoustic modeling methods have recently
been shown to give state-of-the-art performance on some speech recognition
tasks. To achieve a further performance improvement, in this research, deep
extensions on LSTM are investigated considering that deep hierarchical model
has turned out to be more efficient than a shallow one. Motivated by previous
research on constructing deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs), alternative
deep LSTM architectures are proposed and empirically evaluated on a large
vocabulary conversational telephone speech recognition task. Meanwhile,
regarding to multi-GPU devices, the training process for LSTM networks is
introduced and discussed. Experimental results demonstrate that the deep LSTM
networks benefit from the depth and yield the state-of-the-art performance on
this task.
