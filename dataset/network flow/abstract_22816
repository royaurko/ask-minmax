Instanton-dyons, also known as instanton-monopoles or instanton-quarks, are
topological constituents of the instantons at nonzero temperature and holonomy.
While the interaction between instanton-dyons have been calculated to one-loop
order by a number of contributors, that for dyon-antidyon pairs remains unknown even
at the classical level. In this work we are filling this gap, by performing
gradient flow calculations on a 3d lattice. We start with two separated and
unmodified objects, following through the so called "streamline" set of
configurations, till their collapse to perturbative fields.
