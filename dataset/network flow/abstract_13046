We introduce and study so-called self-indexed graphs. These are (oriented)
finite graphs endowed with a map from the set of edges to the set of vertices.
Such graphs naturally arise from classical knot and link diagrams. In fact, the
graphs resulting from link diagrams have an additional structure, an integral
flow. We call a self-indexed graph with integral flow a comte. The analogy with
links allows us to define transformations of comtes generalizing the
Reidemeister moves on link diagrams. We show that many invariants of links can
be generalized to comtes, most notably the linking number, the Alexander
polynomials, the link group, etc. We also discuss finite type invariants and
quandle cocycle invariants of comtes.
