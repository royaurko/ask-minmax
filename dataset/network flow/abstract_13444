We present a new mechanism for dissipationless persistent charge current. Two
dimensional topological insulators hold dissipationless spin currents in their
edges so that, for a given spin orientation, a net charge current flows which
is exactly compensated by the counter-flow of the opposite spin. Here we show
that ferromagnetic order in the edge upgrades the spin currents into persistent
charge currents, without applied fields. For that matter, we study an
interacting graphene zigzag ribbon with spin-orbit coupling. We find three
electronic phases with magnetic edges that carry currents reaching 0.4nA,
comparable to persistent currents in metallic rings, for the small spin orbit
coupling in graphene. One of the phases is a valley half-metal.
