The fermionic NSR string possesses a hidden N = 2 superconformal algebra on
the world-sheet. In this work, we show how to use an isomorphism of this
algebra, the so-called spectral flow, for construction of a subspace of
physical states of the string, on which space-time supersymmetry acts. This
construction is an alternative to the GSO-projection in string theory.
