We propose a geometric growth model which interpolates between
one-dimensional linear graphs and small-world networks. The model undergoes a
transition from large to small worlds. We study the topological characteristics
by both theoretical predictions and numerical simulations, which are in good
accordance with each other. Our geometrically growing model is a
complementarity for the static WS model.
