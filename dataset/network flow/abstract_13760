We report data for $I$ band Surface Brightness Fluctuation (SBF) magnitudes,
V-I colors, and distance moduli for 300 galaxies. The Survey contains E, S0 and
early-type spiral galaxies in the proportions of 49:42:9, and is essentially
complete for E galaxies to Hubble velocities of 2000 km/s, with a substantial
sampling of E galaxies out to 4000 km/s. The median error in distance modulus
is 0.22 mag.
  We also present two new results from the Survey. (1) We compare the mean
peculiar flow velocity (bulk flow) implied by our distances with predictions of
typical cold dark matter transfer functions as a function of scale, and find
very good agreement with cold, dark matter cosmologies if the transfer function
scale parameter $\Gamma$, and the power spectrum normalization $\sigma_8$ are
related by $\sigma_8 \Gamma^{-0.5} \approx 2\pm0.5$. Derived directly from
velocities, this result is independent of the distribution of galaxies or
models for biasing. The modest bulk flow contradicts reports of large-scale,
large-amplitude flows in the $\sim200$ Mpc diameter volume surrounding our
Survey volume. (2) We present a distance-independent measure of absolute galaxy
luminosity, \Nbar, and show how it correlates with galaxy properties such as
color and velocity dispersion, demonstrating its utility for measuring galaxy
distances through large and unknown extinction.
