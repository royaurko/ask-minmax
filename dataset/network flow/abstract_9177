In this paper, we study capacity scaling laws of the deterministic
dissemination (DD) in random wireless networks under the generalized physical
model (GphyM). This is truly not a new topic. Our motivation to readdress this
issue is two-fold: Firstly, we aim to propose a more general result to unify
the network capacity for general homogeneous random models by investigating the
impacts of different parameters of the system on the network capacity.
Secondly, we target to close the open gaps between the upper and the lower
bounds on the network capacity in the literature. The generality of this work
lies in three aspects: (1) We study the homogeneous random network of a general
node density $\lambda \in [1,n]$, rather than either random dense network (RDN,
$\lambda=n$) or random extended network (REN, $\lambda=1$) as in the
literature. (2) We address the general deterministic dissemination sessions,
\ie, the general multicast sessions, which unify the capacities for unicast and
broadcast sessions by setting the number of destinations for each session as a
general value $n_d\in[1,n]$. (3) We allow the number of sessions to change in
the range $n_s\in(1,n]$, instead of assuming that $n_s=\Theta(n)$ as in the
literature. We derive the general upper bounds on the capacity for the
arbitrary case of $(\lambda, n_d, n_s)$ by introducing the Poisson Boolean
model of continuum percolation, and prove that they are tight according to the
existing general lower bounds constructed in the literature.
