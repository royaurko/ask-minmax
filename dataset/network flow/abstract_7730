We establish a duality between L^p-Wasserstein control and L^q-gradient
estimate in a general framework. Our result extends a known result for a heat
flow on a Riemannian manifold. Especially, we can derive a Wasserstein control
of a heat flow directly from the corresponding gradient estimate of the heat
semigroup without using any other notion of lower curvature bound. By applying
our result to a subelliptic heat flow on a Lie group, we obtain a coupling of
heat distributions which carries a good control of their relative distance.
