Recent work on advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) is reviewed. The
article concentrates on an optically thin branch of ADAFs which is present at
mass accretion rates below a critical value $\sim(10^{-2}-10^{-1})$ the
Eddington rate. Models based on this branch have been quite successful at
explaining a number of low-luminosity X-ray binaries and galactic nuclei, and
some brighter systems. Some progress has also been made toward understanding
the various spectral states of accreting black holes. It is argued that ADAFs
may provide one of the best techniques for demonstrating the reality of event
horizons in black holes.
