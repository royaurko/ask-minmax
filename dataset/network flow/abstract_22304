In this study the numerical performances of wide and compact fourth order
formulation of the steady 2-D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations will be
investigated and compared with each other. The benchmark driven cavity flow
problem will be solved using both wide and compact fourth order formulations
and the numerical performances of both formulations will be presented and also
the advantages and disadvantages of both formulations will be discussed.
