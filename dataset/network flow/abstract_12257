The map of a city's streets constitutes a particular case of spatial complex
network. However a city is not limited to its topology: it is above all a
geometrical object whose particularity is to organize into short and long axes
called streets. In this article we present and discuss two algorithms aiming at
recovering the notion of street from a graph representation of a city. Then we
show that the length of the so-called streets scales logarithmically. This
phenomenon leads to assume that a city is shaped into a logic of extension and
division of space.
