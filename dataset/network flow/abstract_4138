We consider polygonal billiards on surfaces of constant curvature. We show
that the usual phase space of the billiard flow can be extended to a compact
three dimensional manifold without boundary that is a circle bundle. We extend
the dynamics $C^\infty$ to the manifold defined. We relate the expansiveness of
the billiard flow with the existence of periodic orbits and with the
injectivity of the itinerary map for billiard tables in the hyperbolic disc,
the Euclidean plane and the sphere.
