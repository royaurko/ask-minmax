A particle-swarm is a set of indivisible processing elements that traverse a
network in order to perform a distributed function. This paper will describe a
particular implementation of a particle-swarm that can simulate the behavior of
the popular PageRank algorithm in both its {\it global-rank} and {\it
relative-rank} incarnations. PageRank is compared against the particle-swarm
method on artificially generated scale-free networks of 1,000 nodes constructed
using a common gamma value, $\gamma = 2.5$. The running time of the
particle-swarm algorithm is $O(|P|+|P|t)$ where $|P|$ is the size of the
particle population and $t$ is the number of particle propagation iterations.
The particle-swarm method is shown to be useful due to its ease of extension
and running time.
