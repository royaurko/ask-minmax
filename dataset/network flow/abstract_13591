We apply the hydrodynamic model for the dynamics of matter created in p-Pb
collisions at 4.4TeV and d-Pb collisions at 3.11TeV. The fluctuating initial
conditions are calculated in the Glauber Monte-Carlo model for several
centrality classes. The expansion is performed event by event in
3+1-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics. Noticeable elliptic and triangular flows
appear in the distributions of produced particles.
