Taking advantage of vicinal (001) SrTiO3 substrates with different mean
terrace widths, the heteroepitaxial growth of SrRuO3 in the step flow mode has
been mapped as a function of mean step velocity. Transition between stable and
unstable step flow is shown to occur at a well-defined critical step velocity,
with a step bunching instability observed below this threshold. The ability to
pass from unstable to stable step flow during growth upon increasing the mean
step velocity is demonstrated. This result is discussed in terms of a
stress-based driving force for step bunching in competition with an effective
step-up adatom current.
