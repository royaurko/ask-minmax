The Legendre flow equation, a version of exact Wilsonian renormalization
group (WRG) equation, is employed to consider the power counting issues in
Nuclear Effective Field Theory. A WRG approach is an ideal framework because it
is nonperturbative and does not require any prescribed power counting rule. The
power counting is determined systematically from the scaling dimensions of the
operators at the nontrivial fixed point. The phase structure is emphasized and
the inverse of the scattering length, which is identified as a relevant
coupling, is shown to play a role of the order parameter. The relations to the
work done by Birse, McGovern, and Richardson and to the Kaplan-Savage-Wise
scheme are explained.
