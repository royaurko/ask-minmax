Existing Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) exhibit the nature of closed
delivery networks which do not cooperate with other CDNs and in practice,
islands of CDNs are formed. The logical separation between contents and
services in this context results in two content networking domains. In addition
to that, meeting the Quality of Service requirements of users according to
negotiated Service Level Agreement is crucial for a CDN. Present trends in
content networks and content networking capabilities give rise to the interest
in interconnecting content networks. Hence, in this paper, we present an open,
scalable, and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based system that assist the
creation of open Content and Service Delivery Networks (CSDNs), which scale and
supports sharing of resources through peering with other CSDNs. To encourage
resource sharing and peering arrangements between different CDN providers at
global level, we propose using market-based models by introducing an
economy-based strategy for content replication.
