In current scenario several commercial and social organizations are using
computer networks for their business and management purposes. In order to meet
the business requirements networks are also grow. The growth of network also
promotes the handling capability of large networks because it counter raises
the possibilities of various faults in the network. A fault in network degrades
its performance by affecting parameters like throughput, delay, latency,
reliability etc. In hierarchical network models any possibility of fault may
collapse entire network. If a fault occurrence disables a device in
hierarchical network then it may distresses all the devices underneath. Thus it
affects entire networks performance. In this paper we propose Fault Tolerable
hierarchical Network (FTN) approach as a solution to the problems of
hierarchical networks. The proposed approach firstly detects possibilities of
fault in the network and accordingly provides specific recovery mechanism. We
have evaluated the performance of FTN approach in terms of delay and throughput
of network.
