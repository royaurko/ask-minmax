We study the evolution of stable D-branes of C/Z_n and twisted circle
theories in the process of closed string tachyon condensation. We interpret the
fractional branes in these backgrounds as type II branes wrapping (`blown up')
cycles, and trace the evolution of the corresponding cycles under tachyon
condensation. We also study RG flows of the corresponding N=2 boundary
conformal field theories. We find flows along which fractional D-branes either
disappear or evolve into other fractional D-branes, and other flows along which
bulk branes either disappear or evolve into stable branes.
