Surface thermal emission has been detected by ROSAT from four nearby young
neutron stars. Assuming black body emission, the significant pulsations of the
observed light curves can be interpreted as due to large surface temperature
differences produced by the effect of the crustal magnetic field on the flow of
heat from the hot interior toward the cooler surface. However, the energy
dependence of the modulation observed in Geminga is incompatible with blackbody
emission: this effect will give us a strong constraint on models of the neutron
star surface.
