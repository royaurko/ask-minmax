We explore the phenomenon of spiral defect chaos in two types of generalized
Swift-Hohenberg model equations that include the effects of long-range drift
velocity or mean flow. We use spatially-extended domains and integrate the
equations for very long times to study the pattern dynamics as the magnitude of
the mean flow is varied. The magnitude of the mean flow is adjusted via a real
and continuous parameter that accounts for the fluid boundary conditions on the
horizontal surfaces in a convecting layer. For weak values of the mean flow we
find that the patterns exhibit a slow coarsening to a state dominated by large
and very slowly moving target defects. For strong enough mean flow we identify
the existence of spatiotemporal chaos which is indicated by a positive leading
order Lyapunov exponent. We compare the spatial features of the mean flow field
with that of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and quantify their differences in the
neighborhood of spiral defects.
