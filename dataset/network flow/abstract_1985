For every Gaussian network, there exists a corresponding deterministic
network called the discrete superposition network. We show that this discrete
superposition network provides a near-optimal digital interface for operating a
class consisting of many Gaussian networks in the sense that any code for the
discrete superposition network can be naturally lifted to a corresponding code
for the Gaussian network, while achieving a rate that is no more than a
constant number of bits lesser than the rate it achieves for the discrete
superposition network. This constant depends only on the number of nodes in the
network and not on the channel gains or SNR. Moreover the capacities of the two
networks are within a constant of each other, again independent of channel
gains and SNR. We show that the class of Gaussian networks for which this
interface property holds includes relay networks with a single
source-destination pair, interference networks, multicast networks, and the
counterparts of these networks with multiple transmit and receive antennas.
  The code for the Gaussian relay network can be obtained from any code for the
discrete superposition network simply by pruning it. This lifting scheme
establishes that the superposition model can indeed potentially serve as a
strong surrogate for designing codes for Gaussian relay networks.
  We present similar results for the K x K Gaussian interference network, MIMO
Gaussian interference networks, MIMO Gaussian relay networks, and multicast
networks, with the constant gap depending additionally on the number of
antennas in case of MIMO networks.
