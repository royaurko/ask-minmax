We introduce a method for computing interfacial motions governed by curvature
dependent acceleration. Our method is a thresholding algorithm of the BMO-type
which, instead of utilizing a diffusion process, thresholds evolution by the
wave equation to obtain the desired interfacial dynamics. We also develop the
numerical method and present results of its application, including an
investigation of the volume preserving and multiphase motions.
