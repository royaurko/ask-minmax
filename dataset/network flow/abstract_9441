Heterogeneous k-core percolation is an extension of a percolation model which
has interesting applications to the resilience of networks under random damage.
In this model, the notion of node robustness is local, instead of global as in
uniform k-core percolation. One of the advantages of k-core percolation models
is the validity of an analytical mathematical framework for a large class of
network topologies. We study ternary mixtures of node types in random networks
and show the presence of a new type of critical phenomenon. This scenario may
have useful applications in the stability of large scale infrastructures and
the description of glass-forming systems.
