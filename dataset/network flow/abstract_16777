Cells are known to utilize biochemical noise to probabilistically switch
between distinct gene expression states. We demonstrate that such noise-driven
switching is dominated by tails of probability distributions and is therefore
exponentially sensitive to changes in physiological parameters such as
transcription and translation rates. However, provided mRNA lifetimes are
short, switching can still be accurately simulated using protein-only models of
gene expression. Exponential sensitivity limits the robustness of noise-driven
switching, suggesting cells may use other mechanisms in order to switch
reliably.
