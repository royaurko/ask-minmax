Coevolution between strategy and network structure is established as a means
to arrive at optimal conditions for resolving social dilemmas. Yet recent
research highlights that the interdependence between networks may be just as
important as the structure of an individual network. We therefore introduce
coevolution of strategy and network interdependence to study whether it can
give rise to elevated levels of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game. We
show that the interdependence between networks self-organizes so as to yield
optimal conditions for the evolution of cooperation. Even under extremely
adverse conditions cooperators can prevail where on isolated networks they
would perish. This is due to the spontaneous emergence of a two-class society,
with only the upper class being allowed to control and take advantage of the
interdependence. Spatial patterns reveal that cooperators, once arriving to the
upper class, are much more competent than defectors in sustaining compact
clusters of followers. Indeed, the asymmetric exploitation of interdependence
confers to them a strong evolutionary advantage that may resolve even the
toughest of social dilemmas.
