The semantic web has led to the deployment of ontologies on the web connected
through various relations and, in particular, alignments of their vocabularies.
There exists several semantics for alignments which make difficult
interoperation between different interpretation of networks of ontologies. Here
we present an abstraction of these semantics which allows for defining the
notions of closure and consistency for networks of ontologies independently
from the precise semantics. We also show that networks of ontologies with
specific notions of morphisms define categories of networks of ontologies.
