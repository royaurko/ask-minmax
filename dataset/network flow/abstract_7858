We consider quark-gluon plasma with chemical potential and study
renormalization group flows of transport coefficients in the framework of
gauge/gravity duality. We first study them using the flow equations and compare
the results with hydrodynamic results by calculating the Green functions on the
arbitrary slice. Two results match exactly. Transport coefficients at arbitrary
scale is ontained by calculating hydrodynamics Green functions. When either
momentum or charge vanishes, transport coefficients decouple from each other.
