In this paper, we establish the existence of a unique "regular" weak solution
to the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models of turbulence with critical
regularization. We first consider the critical LES for the Navier-Stokes
equations and we show that its solution converges to a solution of the
Navier-Stokes equations as the averaging radii converge to zero. Then we extend
the study to the critical LES for Magnetohydrodynamics equations.
