The production and space-time evolution of heavy quarks and J/psi in the
quark gluon plasma is studied within the partonic transport model Boltzmann
Approach to MultiParton Scatterings (BAMPS). This framework allows interactions
among all partons: gluons, light quarks and heavy quarks. Heavy quarks, in
particular, interact with the rest of the medium via binary scatterings with a
running coupling and a more precise Debye screening which is derived from hard
thermal loop calculations. We compare our results of the elliptic flow and
nuclear modification factor not only to experimental data of heavy flavor
electrons at RHIC, but also to LHC data of heavy flavor electrons, muons, D
mesons, and non-prompt J/psi. Where no data is available yet, we make
predictions for those observables. Furthermore, results on prompt J/psi
elliptic flow are reported for RHIC energy within the same framework, taking
the dissociation as well as regeneration of J/psi in the quark-gluon plasma
into account.
