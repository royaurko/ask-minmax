Humans do not always make rational choices, a fact that experimental
economics is putting on solid grounds. The social context plays an important
role in determining our actions, and often we imitate friends or acquaintances
without any strategic consideration. We explore here the interplay between
strategic and social imitative behaviors in a coordination problem on a social
network. We observe that for interactions in 1D and 2D lattices any amount of
social imitation prevents the freezing of the network in domains with different
conventions, thus leading to global consensus. For interactions in complex
networks, the interplay of social and strategic imitation also drives the
system towards global consensus while neither dynamics alone does. We find an
optimum value for the combination of imitative behaviors to reach consensus in
a minimum time, and two different dynamical regimes to approach it: exponential
when social imitation predominates, and power-law when strategic considerations
dominate.
