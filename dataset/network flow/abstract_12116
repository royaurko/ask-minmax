We address the propagation of solitons in reconfigurable two-dimensional
networks induced optically by arrays of nondiffracting Bessel beams in
Kerr-type nonlinear media. We show that broad soliton beams can move across
networks having different topologies almost without radiation losses, opening
new prospects for all-optical soliton manipulation. We also discuss various
switching scenarios for solitons launched into multi-core directional couplers
optically-induced by suitable arrays of Bessel beams.
