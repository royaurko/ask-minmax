Azimuthal flow is driven in the edge of the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) [W.

through biasing a section of the vacuum vessel relative to the plasma source
cathode. As the applied bias exceeds a threshold, a transition in radial
particle confinement is observed, evidenced by a dramatic steepening in the
density profile, similar to the L- to H-mode transition in toroidal confinement
devices. The threshold behavior and dynamic behavior of radial transport is
related to flow penetration and the degree of spatial overlap between the flow
shear and density gradient profiles. An investigation of the changes in
turbulence and turbulent particle transport associated with the confinement
transition is presented. Two-dimensional cross-correlation measurements show
that the spatial coherence of edge turbulence in LAPD changes significantly
with biasing. The azimuthal correlation in the turbulence increases
dramatically, while the radial correlation length is little altered. Turbulent
amplitude is reduced at the transition, particularly in electric field
fluctuations, but the dominant change observed is in the cross-phase between
density and electric field fluctuations. The changes in cross-phase lead to a
suppression and then apparent reversal of turbulent particle flux as the
threshold is exceeded.
