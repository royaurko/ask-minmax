The response of degree-correlated scale-free attractor networks to stimuli is
studied. We show that degree-correlated scale-free networks are robust to
random stimuli as well as the uncorrelated scale-free networks, while
assortative (disassortative) scale-free networks are more (less) sensitive to
directed stimuli than uncorrelated networks. We find that the
degree-correlation of scale-free networks makes the dynamics of attractor
systems different from uncorrelated ones. The dynamics of correlated scale-free
attractor networks result in the effects of degree correlation on the response
to stimuli.
