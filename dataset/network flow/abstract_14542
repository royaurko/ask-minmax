We studied the induction of apoptosis in Jurkat cells by UVB radiation
(wavelength 290-320 nm) at a dose of 310 mJ/cm^2. We combined Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with flow cytometry to determine whether the
combination of both techniques could provide new and improved information about
cell modifications. To do this, we looked for correspondences and correlations
between spectroscopy and flow cytometry data and found three highly probable
spectroscopic markers of apoptosis. The behavior of the wave number shift of
both the Amide I beta-sheet component and the area of the 1083 cm^-1 band
reproduced, with a high correlation, the behavior of the early apoptotic cell
population, while the behavior of the Amide I area showed a high correlation
with the early plus late apoptotic cell population.
