We prove results about orbit closures and equidistribution for the SL(2,R)
action on the moduli space of compact Riemann surfaces, which are analogous to
the theory of unipotent flows. The proofs of the main theorems rely on the
measure classification theorem of [EMi2] and a certain isolation property of
closed SL(2,R) invariant manifolds developed in this paper.
