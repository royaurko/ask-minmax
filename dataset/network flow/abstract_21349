We transmitted 4x28 Gbit/s over 5-km standard GI-MMF using four different
mode groups in combination with direct detection and on-off-keying format
(OOK). Due to the square-law detection in the receiver MIMO processing is not
effective. Therefore proper mode group selective multiplexing and
de-multiplexing is essential.
