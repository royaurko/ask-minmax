We present synthetic Doppler maps of gaseous flows in binary IP Peg based on
the results of 3D gasdynamical simulations. Using of gasdynamical calculations
alongside with the Doppler tomography technique permits us to identify the main
features of the flow on the Doppler maps without solution of an ill-posed
inverse problem. Comparison of synthetic tomograms with observations shows that
in quiescence there are two zones of high emission: a shock wave on the edge of
the stream from L_1 caused by the interaction of the gas of circumbinary
envelope and the stream, and the dense region in a apoastron of
quasi-elliptical accretion disk. A single arm of the spiral shock and the
stream itself give a minor input to the total brightness. During outburst the
accretion disk dominates, and the most emitive regions are the two arms of the
spiral shock.
