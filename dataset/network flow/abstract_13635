This paper is concerned with diffuse-interface approximations of the Willmore
flow. We first present numerical results of standard diffuse-interface models
for colliding one dimensional interfaces. In such a scenario evolutions towards
interfaces with corners can occur that do not necessarily describe the adequate
sharp-interface dynamics.
  We therefore propose and investigate alternative diffuse-interface
approximations that lead to a different and more regular behavior if interfaces
collide. These dynamics are derived from approximate energies that converge to
the $L^1$-lower-semicontinuous envelope of the Willmore energy, which is in
general not true for the more standard Willmore approximation.
