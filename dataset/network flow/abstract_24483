In this paper, we study complete synchronization of the complex dynamical
networks described by linearly coupled ordinary differential equation systems
(LCODEs). The coupling considered here is time-varying in both the network
structure and the reaction dynamics. Inspired by our previous paper [6], the
extended Hajnal diameter is introduced and used to measure the synchronization
in a general differential system. Then we find that the Hajnal diameter of the
linear system induced by the time-varying coupling matrix and the largest
Lyapunov exponent of the synchronized system play the key roles in
synchronization analysis of LCODEs with the identity inner coupling matrix. As
an application, we obtain a general sufficient condition guaranteeing directed
time-varying graph to reach consensus. Example with numerical simulation is
provided to show the effectiveness the theoretical results.
