We find that the depth and shape of the broad absorption lines (BALs) in
BALQSO 1603+3002 are determined largely by the fraction of the emitting source
which is covered by the BAL flow. In addition, the observed depth of the BALs
is poorly correlated with their real optical depth. The implication of this
result is that abundance studies based on direct extraction of column densities
from the depth of the absorption troughs are unreliable. Our conclusion is
based on analysis of unblended absorption features of two lines from the same
ion (in this case the Si IV doublet), which allows unambiguous separation of
covering factor and optical depth effects. The complex morphology of the
covering factor as a function of velocity suggests that the BALs are produced
by several physically separated outflows. The covering factor is ion dependent
in both depth and velocity width. We also find evidence that in BALQSO
1603+3002 the flow does not cover the broad emission line region.
