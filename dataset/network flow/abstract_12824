With the availability of large-scale redshift survey data, it is now becoming
possible to explore correlations between large-scale structure and the
properties and morphologies of galaxy clusters. We investigate the spatial
distributions of a 98% complete, volume-limited sample of nearby (z<0.1) Abell
clusters with well-determined redshifts and find that cooling flow clusters
with high mass-accretion rates have nearest neighbors which are much closer
than those of other clusters in the sample (at the 99.8% confidence level), and
reside in more crowded environments out to 30/h Mpc. Several possible
explanations of this effect are discussed.
