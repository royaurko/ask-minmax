We present simultaneous optical polarimetry and X-ray data of the near
synchronous polar RX J2115-5840. We model the polarisation data using the
Stokes imaging technique of Potter et al. We find that the data are best
modelled using a relatively high binary inclination and a small angle between
the magnetic and spin axes. We find that for all spin-orbit beat phases, a
significant proportion of the accretion flow is directed onto the lower
hemisphere of the white dwarf, producing negative circular polarisation. Only
for a small fraction of the beat cycle is a proportion of the flow directed
onto the upper hemisphere. However, the accretion flow never occurs near the
upper magnetic pole, whatever the orientation of the magnetic poles. This
indicates the presence of a non-dipole field with the field strength at the
upper pole significantly higher. We find that the brightest parts of the hard
X-ray emitting region and the cyclotron region are closely coincident.
