A ROSAT HRI image of the hyperluminous infrared galaxy IRAS P09104+4109 shows
extended X-ray emission peaked around the central galaxy in a profile
characteristic of a cooling flow. The inferred soft X-ray luminosity is
comparable to that detected with ASCA. The ASCA spectrum is well fit by a
cooling flow spectrum, indicating a mass cooling rate of about 1000 Msunpyr.
The cooling flow dominates the total luminosity of the surrounding cluster. Any
contribution from a hidden AGN in the host galaxy to either the total ASCA
spectrum or the HRI image is small.
