A recently formulated framework of highly-anisotropic and
strongly-dissipative hydrodynamics (ADHYDRO) is used to describe the evolution
of matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. New developments
of the model contain: the inclusion of asymmetric transverse expansion
(combined with the longitudinal boost-invariant flow) and comparisons of the
model results with the RHIC data, which have become possible after coupling of
ADHYDRO with THERMINATOR. Various soft-hadronic observables (the
transverse-momentum spectra, the elliptic flow coefficient v_2, and the HBT
radii) are calculated for different initial conditions characterized by the
value of the initial pressure asymmetry. We find that as long as the initial
energy density profile is unchanged the calculated observables remain
practically the same. This result indicates the insensitivity of the analyzed
observables to the initial anisotropy of pressure and suggests that the
complete thermalization of the system may be delayed to easily acceptable times
of about 1 fm/c.
