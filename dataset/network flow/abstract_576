We give an algorithm for finding network encoding and decoding equations for
error-free multicasting networks with multiple sources and sinks. The algorithm
given is efficient (polynomial complexity) and works on any kind of network
(acyclic, link cyclic, flow cyclic, or even in the presence of knots). The key
idea will be the appropriate use of the delay (both natural and additional)
during the encoding. The resulting code will always work with finite delay with
binary encoding coefficients.
