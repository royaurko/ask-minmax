This paper studies the problem of identifying the contagion source when
partial timestamps of a contagion process are available. We formulate the
source localization problem as a ranking problem on graphs, where infected
nodes are ranked according to their likelihood of being the source. Two ranking
algorithms, cost-based ranking (CR) and tree-based ranking (TR), are proposed
in this paper. Experimental evaluations with synthetic and real-world data show
that our algorithms significantly improve the ranking accuracy compared with
four existing algorithms.
