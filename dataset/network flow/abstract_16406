A two-scale modelling approach is discussed to predict the performance and
energetics of a large number (more than a few hundred) of marine turbines
installed as a power farm in a general coastal environment. The kernel of this
approach is that the outer, or coastal-scale, model/simulation is to assess the
reduction of flow passing through a given farm area as a function of the
increase of head loss across the farm, whereas the inner, or device-scale,
model/simulation employs this function to account for the (otherwise unknown)
effect of coastal dynamics for that farm site, i.e. diminution of the power
removed from the farm area due to the reduction of flow through the farm.
Large-eddy simulations (LES) of periodic open channel flow (with a porous plate
model representing turbines) are then presented as a device-scale part of such
a two-scale model of large marine turbine arrays. Results demonstrate the
usefulness of this approach to study how the overall energetics of turbine
arrays (i.e. extraction, dissipation and diminution of energy within the entire
farm area) may change depending on the characteristics of the farm site, array
configuration and operating conditions of the turbines in the farm.
