This paper describes the design of a control and management network
(orderwire) for a mobile wireless Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network.
This mobile wireless ATM network is part of the Rapidly Deployable Radio
Network (RDRN). The orderwire system consists of a packet radio network which
overlays the mobile wireless ATM network, each network element in this network
uses Global Positioning System (GPS) information to control a beamforming
antenna subsystem which provides for spatial reuse. This paper also proposes a
novel Virtual Network Configuration (VNC) algorithm for predictive network
configuration. A mobile ATM Private Network-Network Interface (PNNI) based on
VNC is also discussed. Finally, as a prelude to the system implementation,
results of a Maisie simulation of the orderwire system are discussed.
