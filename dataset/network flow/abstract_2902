Spatial networks range from the brain networks, to transportation networks
and infrastructures. Recently interacting and multiplex networks are attracting
great attention because their dynamics and robustness cannot be understood
without treating at the same time several networks. Here we present maximal
entropy ensembles of spatial multiplex and spatial interacting networks that
can be used in order to model spatial multilayer network structures and to
build null models of real datasets. We show that spatial multiplex naturally
develop a significant overlap of the links, a noticeable property of many
multiplexes that can affect significantly the dynamics taking place on them.
Additionally, we characterize ensembles of spatial interacting networks and we
analyse the structure of interacting airport and railway networks in India,
showing the effect of space in determining the link probability.
