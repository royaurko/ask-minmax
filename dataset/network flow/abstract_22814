The relationship between the real part of the weak value of the momentum
operator at a post selected position is discussed and the meaning of the
experimentally determined stream-lines in the Toronto experiment of Kocsis {\em
et al} is re-examined. We argue against interpreting the energy flow lines as
photon trajectories. The possibility of performing an analogous experiment
using atoms is proposed in order that a direct comparison can be made with the
trajectories calculated by Philippidis, Dewdney and Hiley using the Bohm
approach.
