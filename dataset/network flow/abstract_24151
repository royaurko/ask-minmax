In this paper, we consider the periodic reference tracking problem in the
framework of batch-mode reinforcement learning, which studies methods for
solving optimal control problems from the sole knowledge of a set of
trajectories. In particular, we extend an existing batch-mode reinforcement
learning algorithm, known as Fitted Q Iteration, to the periodic reference
tracking problem. The presented periodic reference tracking algorithm
explicitly exploits a priori knowledge of the future values of the reference
trajectory and its periodicity. We discuss the properties of our approach and
illustrate it on the problem of reference tracking for a synthetic biology gene
regulatory network known as the generalised repressilator. This system can
produce decaying but long-lived oscillations, which makes it an interesting
system for the tracking problem. In our companion paper we also take a look at
the regulation problem of the toggle switch system, where the main goal is to
drive the system's states to a specific bounded region in the state space.
