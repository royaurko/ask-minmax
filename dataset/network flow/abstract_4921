We use coarse-grained molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the
structural and dynamical properties of micelles under non-equilibrium
Poiseuille flow in a nano-confined geometry. The effects of flow, confinement,
and the wetting properties of die-channel walls on spherical sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) micelles are explored when the micelle is forced through a
die-channel slightly smaller than its equilibrium size. Inside the channel, the
micelle may fragment into smaller micelles. In addition to the flow rate, the
wettability of the channel surfaces dictates whether the micelle fragments and
determines the size of the daughter micelles: The overall behavior is
determined by the subtle balance between hydrodynamic forces, micelle-wall
interactions and self-assembly forces.
