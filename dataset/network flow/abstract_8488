Although the technology of femtocells is highly promising, many challenging
problems should be addressed before fully harvesting its potential. In this
paper, we investigate the problem of cell association and handover management
in femtocell networks. Two extreme cases for cell association are first
discussed and analyzed. Then we propose our algorithm to maximize network
capacity while achieving fairness among users. Based on this algorithm, we
further develop a handover algorithm to reduce the number of unnecessary
handovers using Bayesian estimation. The proposed handover algorithm is
demonstrated to outperform a heuristic scheme with considerable gains in our
simulation study.
