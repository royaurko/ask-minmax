We follow the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism to study
time-dependent thermal transport in a linear chain system consisting of two
semi-infinite leads connected together by a coupling that is harmonically
modulated in time. The modulation is driven by an external agent that can
absorb and emit energy. We determine the energy current flowing out of the
leads exactly by solving numerically the Dyson equation for the contour-ordered
Green's function. The amplitude of the modulated coupling is of the same order
as the interparticle coupling within each lead. When the leads have the same
temperature, our numerical results show that modulating the coupling between
the leads may direct energy to either flow into the leads simultaneously or
flow out of the leads simultaneously, depending on the values of the driving
frequency and temperature. A special combination of values of the driving
frequency and temperature exists wherein no net energy flows into or out of the
leads, even for long times. When one of the leads is warmer than the other, net
energy flows out of the warmer lead. For the cooler lead, however, the
direction of the energy current flow depends on the values of the driving
frequency and temperature. In addition, we find transient effects to become
more pronounced for higher values of the driving frequency.
