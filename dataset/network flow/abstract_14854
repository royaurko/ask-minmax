The transverse momentum distributions of various hadrons produced in most
central Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energy Root(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV have been studied
using our earlier proposed unified statistical thermal freeze-out model. The
calculated results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data
measured by the ALICE experiment. The model calculation fits provide the
thermal freeze-out conditions in terms of the temperature and collective flow
effect parameters for different particle species. Interestingly the model
parameter fits reveal a strong collective flow in the system which appears to
be a consequence of the increasing particle density at LHC. The model used
incorporates a longitudinal as well as transverse hydrodynamic flow. The
chemical potential has been assumed to be nearly equal to zero for the bulk of
the matter owing to a high degree of nuclear transparency effect at such
energies. The contributions from heavier decay resonances are also taken into
account in our calculations.
