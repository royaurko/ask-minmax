Pore-scale modeling and simulation of reactive flow in porous media has a
range of diverse applications, and poses a number of research challenges. It is
known that the morphology of a porous medium has significant influence on the
local flow rate, which can have a substantial impact on the rate of chemical
reactions. While there are a large number of papers and software tools
dedicated to simulating either fluid flow in 3D computerized tomography (CT)
images or reactive flow using pore-network models, little attention to date has
been focused on the pore-scale simulation of sorptive transport in 3D CT
images, which is the specific focus of this paper. Here we first present an
algorithm for the simulation of such reactive flows directly on images, which
is implemented in a sophisticated software package. We then use this software
to present numerical results in two resolved geometries, illustrating the
importance of pore-scale simulation and the flexibility of our software
package.
