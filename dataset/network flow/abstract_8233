We study some simple models of disease transmission on small-world networks,
in which either the probability of infection by a disease or the probability of
its transmission is varied, or both. The resulting models display epidemic
behavior when the infection or transmission probability rises above the
threshold for site or bond percolation on the network, and we give exact
solutions for the position of this threshold in a variety of cases. We confirm
our analytic results by numerical simulation.
