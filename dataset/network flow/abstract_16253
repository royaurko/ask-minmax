We study the renormalization group flows of the two terminal conductance of a
superconducting junction of two Luttinger liquid wires. We compute the power
laws associated with the renormalization group flow around the various fixed
points of this system using the generators of the SU(4) group to generate the
appropriate parameterization of a S-matrix representing small deviations from a
given fixed point S-matrix (obtained earlier in Phys. Rev. B 77, 155418
(2008)), and we then perform a comprehensive stability analysis. In particular,
for the non-trivial fixed point which has intermediate values of transmission,
reflection, Andreev reflection and crossed Andreev reflection, we show that
there are eleven independent directions in which the system can be perturbed,
which are relevant or irrelevant, and five directions which are marginal. We
obtain power laws associated with these relevant and irrelevant perturbations.
Unlike the case of the two-wire charge-conserving junction, here we show that
there are power laws which are non-linear functions of V(0) and V(2k_{F})
(where V(k) represents the Fourier transform of the inter-electron interaction
potential at momentum k). We also obtain the power law dependence of linear
response conductance on voltage bias or temperature around this fixed point.
