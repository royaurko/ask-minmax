We propose a scheme for the realization of artificial neural networks based
on Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). In order to
demonstrate the operation of this scheme we designed and successfully tested a
small network that implements a XOR gate and is trained by means of examples.
The proposed scheme can be particularly convenient as support for
superconducting applications such as detectors for astrophysics, high energy
experiments, medicine imaging and so on.
