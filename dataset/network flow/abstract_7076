We exhibit a concentration-collapse decomposition of singularities of fourth
order curvature flows, including the $L^2$ curvature flow and Calabi flow, in
dimensions $n \leq 4$. The proof requires the development of several new a
priori estimates. First, we develop a smoothing result for initial metrics with
small energy and a volume growth lower bound, in the vein of Perelman's
pseudolocality result. Next, we generalize our technique from prior work to
exhibit local smoothing estimates for the $L^2$ flow in the presence of a
curvature-related bound. A final key ingredient is a new local
$\epsilon$-regularity result for $L^2$-critical metrics with possibly
nonconstant scalar curvature. Applications of these results include new
compactness and diffeomorphism-finiteness theorems for smooth compact
four-manifolds satisfying the necessary and effectively minimal hypotheses of
$L^2$ curvature pinching and a volume noncollapsing condition.
