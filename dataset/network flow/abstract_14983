Strain energy density is calculated for a network of flexible chains with
weak excluded-volume interactions (whose energy is small compared with thermal
energy). Constitutive equations are developed for an incompressible network of
chains with segment interactions at finite deformations. These relations are
applied to the study of uniaxial and equi-biaxial tension (compression), where
the stress--strain diagrams are analyzed numerically. It is demonstrated that
intra-chain interactions (i) cause an increase in the Young's modulus of the
network and (ii) induce the growth of stresses (compared to an appropriate
network of Gaussian chains), which becomes substantial at relatively large
elongation ratios. The effect of excluded-volume interactions on the elastic
response strongly depends on the deformation mode, in particular, it is more
pronounced at equi-biaxial tension than at uniaxial elongation.
