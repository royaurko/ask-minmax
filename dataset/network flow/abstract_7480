The non-uniform longitudinal flow model (NUFM) propsed recently is extended
to include also transverse flow. The resulting longitudinally non-uniform
collective expansion model (NUCEM) is applied to the calculation of rapidity
distribution of kaons, lambdas and protons in relativistic heavy ion collisions
at CERN-SPS energies. The model results are compared with the 200 A GeV/$c$ S-S
and 158 A GeV/$c$ Pb-Pb collision data. The central dips observed in
experiments are reproduced in a natural way.
