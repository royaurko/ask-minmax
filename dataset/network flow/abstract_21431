Well established correlations of low-mass flows show a continuity in the
high-mass regime, and mean accretion rates for L>1000 Lsun are dM/dt~10^(-4)
Msun/yr. We also present a tight correlation between outflow masses and core
masses, which implies that the accretion rate is to first order a linear
function of the core mass. All those results support the idea that similar
physical processes drive outflows of all masses.
