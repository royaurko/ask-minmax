Many real networks share three generic properties: they are scale-free,
display a small-world effect, and show a power-law strength-degree correlation.
In this paper, we propose a type of deterministically growing networks called
Sierpinski networks, which are induced by the famous Sierpinski fractals and
constructed in a simple iterative way. We derive analytical expressions for
degree distribution, strength distribution, clustering coefficient, and
strength-degree correlation, which agree well with the characterizations of
various real-life networks. Moreover, we show that the introduced Sierpinski
networks are maximal planar graphs.
