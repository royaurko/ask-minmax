This paper introduces the notion of objection-based causal networks which
resemble probabilistic causal networks except that they are quantified using
objections. An objection is a logical sentence and denotes a condition under
which a, causal dependency does not exist. Objection-based causal networks
enjoy almost all the properties that make probabilistic causal networks
popular, with the added advantage that objections are, arguably more intuitive
than probabilities.
