In the present paper, we try to propose a self-similar network theory for the
basic understanding. By extending the natural languages to a kind of so called
idealy sufficient language, we can proceed a few steps to the investigation of
the language searching and the language understanding of AI.
  Image understanding, and the familiarity of the brain to the surrounding
environment are also discussed. Group effects are discussed by addressing the
essense of the power of influences, and constructing the influence network of a
society. We also give a discussion of inspirations.
