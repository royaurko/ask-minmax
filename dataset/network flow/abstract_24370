The aim of this paper is to study the effect of cooperation on system delay,
quantified as the number of retransmissions required to deliver a broadcast
message to all intended receivers. Unlike existing works on broadcast
scenarios, where distance between nodes is not explicitly considered, we
examine the joint effect of small scale fading and propagation path loss. Also,
we study cooperation in application to finite networks, i.e. when the number of
cooperating nodes is small. Stochastic geometry and order statistics are used
to develop analytical models that tightly match the simulation results for
non-cooperative scenario and provide a lower bound for delay in a cooperative
setting. We demonstrate that even for a simple flooding scenario, cooperative
broadcast achieves significantly lower system delay.
