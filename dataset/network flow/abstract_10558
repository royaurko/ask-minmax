The capacity region of multi-pair bidirectional relay networks, in which a
relay node facilitates the communication between multiple pairs of users, is
studied. This problem is first examined in the context of the linear shift
deterministic channel model. The capacity region of this network when the relay
is operating at either full-duplex mode or half-duplex mode for arbitrary
number of pairs is characterized. It is shown that the cut-set upper-bound is
tight and the capacity region is achieved by a so called divide-and-conquer
relaying strategy. The insights gained from the deterministic network are then
used for the Gaussian bidirectional relay network. The strategy in the
deterministic channel translates to a specific superposition of lattice codes
and random Gaussian codes at the source nodes and successive interference
cancelation at the receiving nodes for the Gaussian network. The achievable
rate of this scheme with two pairs is analyzed and it is shown that for all
channel gains it achieves to within 3 bits/sec/Hz per user of the cut-set
upper-bound. Hence, the capacity region of the two-pair bidirectional Gaussian
relay network to within 3 bits/sec/Hz per user is characterized.
