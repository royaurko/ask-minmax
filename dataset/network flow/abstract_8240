The rate at which nodes in a network increase their connectivity depends on
their fitness to compete for links. For example, in social networks some
individuals acquire more social links than others, or on the www some webpages
attract considerably more links than others. We find that this competition for
links translates into multiscaling, i.e. a fitness dependent dynamic exponent,
allowing fitter nodes to overcome the more connected but less fit ones.
Uncovering this fitter-gets-richer phenomena can help us understand in
quantitative terms the evolution of many competitive systems in nature and
society.
