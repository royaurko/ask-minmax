Stochastic network calculus is an evolving theory which accounts for
statistical multiplexing and uses an envelope approach for probabilistic delay
and backlog analysis of networks. One of the key ideas of stochastic network
calculus is the possibility to describe service offered at network node as a
stochastic service envelope, which in turn can be used to describe the
stochastic service available in a network of nodes and determine end-to-end
probabilistic delay and backlog bounds. This paper introduces a new definition
of stochastic service envelopes which yield a simple network service envelope
and tighter end-to-end performance bounds. It is shown for ($\sigma(\theta),
\rho(\theta)$) - constrained traffic model that the end-to-end performance
measures computed using the new stochastic network service envelope are tight
in comparison to the ones obtained using the existing start-of-the-art
definition of statistical network service envelope and are bounded by ${\cal
O}(H \log{H})$, where $H$ is the number of nodes traversed by the arrival
traffic.
