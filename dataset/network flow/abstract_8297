Boolean Networks have been used to study numerous phenomena, including gene
regulation, neural networks, social interactions, and biological evolution.
Here, we propose a general method for determining the critical behavior of
Boolean systems built from arbitrary ensembles of Boolean functions. In
particular, we solve the critical condition for systems of units operating
according to canalizing functions and present strong numerical evidence that
our approach correctly predicts the phase transition from order to chaos in
such systems.
