We prove the existence of small steady periodic capillary-gravity water waves
for general stratified flows, where we allow for stagnation points in the flow.
We establish the existence of both laminar and non-laminar flow solutions for
the governing equations. This is achieved by using bifurcation theory and
estimates based on the ellipticity of the system, where we regard, in turn, the
mass-flux and surface tension as bifurcation parameters.
