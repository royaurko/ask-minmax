Temperature distributions and the corresponding vortex structures in an
evaporating sessile droplet are obtained by performing detailed numerical
calculations. A Marangoni convection induced by thermal conduction processes in
the drop and the substrate is demonstrated to be able to result not only in a
single vortex, but also in two or three vortices, depending on the ratio of
substrate to fluid thermal conductivities, on the substrate thickness and the
contact angle. The "phase diagrams" containing information on the number,
orientation and spatial location of the vortices for quasistationary fluid
flows are presented and analysed. The results obtained demonstrate that the
fluid flow structure in evaporating droplets can be influenced in a controlled
manner by selecting substrates with appropriate properties.
