We study counter expressed gene networks constructed from gene-expression
data obtained from many types of cancers. The networks are synthesized by
connecting vertices belonging to each others' list of K-farthest-neighbors,
with K being an a priori selected non-negative integer. In the range of K
corresponding to minimum homogeneity, the degree distribution of the networks
shows scaling. Clustering in these networks is smaller than that in equivalent
random graphs and remains zero till significantly large K. Their small
diameter, however, implies small-world behavior which is corroborated by their
eigenspectrum. We discuss implications of these findings in several contexts.
