We deal with a nonlocal interaction equation describing the evolution of a
particle density under the effect of a general symmetric pairwise interaction
potential, not necessarily in convolution form. We describe the case of a
convex (or \lambda-convex) potential, possibly not smooth at several points,
generalizing the results of [CDFLS]. We also identify the cases in which the
dynamic is still governed by the continuity equation with well-characterized
nonlocal velocity field.
