We investigate the optimization of synchronizability in multiplex networks
and demonstrate that the interlayer coupling strength is the deciding factor
for the efficiency of optimization. The optimized networks have homogeneity in
the degree as well as in the betweenness centrality. Additionally, the
interlayer coupling strength crucially affects various properties of individual
layers in the optimized multiplex networks. We provide an understanding to how
the emerged network properties are shaped or affected when the evolution
renders them better synchronizable.
