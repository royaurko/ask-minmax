Currently Public Safety and Security communication systems rely on reliable
and secure Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) Networks that are mainly devoted to
provide voice services. However, the evolution trend for PMR networks is
towards the provision of new value-added multimedia services such as video
streaming, in order to improve the situational awareness and enhance the
life-saving operations. The challenge here is to exploit the future commercial
broadband networks to deliver voice and multimedia services satisfying the PMR
service requirements. In particular, a viable solution till now seems that of
adapting the new Long Term Evolution technology to provide IP-based broadband
services with the security and reliability typical of PMR networks. This paper
outlines different alternatives to achieve this goal and, in particular,
proposes a proper solution for providing multimedia services with PMR standards
over commercial LTE networks.
