Though there is increasing evidence linking the moat flow and the Evershed
flow along the penumbral filaments, there is not a clear consensus regarding
the existence of a moat flow around umbral cores and pores, and the debate is
still open. Solar pores appear to be a suitable scenario to test the
moat-penumbra relation as evidencing the direct interaction between the umbra
and the convective plasma in the surrounding photosphere, without any
intermediate structure in between. The present work studies solar pores based
on high resolution ground-based and satellite observations. Local correlation
tracking techniques have been applied to different-duration time series to
analyze the horizontal flows around several solar pores. Our results establish
that the flows calculated from different solar pore observations are coherent
among each other and show the determinant and overall influence of exploding
events in the granulation around the pores. We do not find any sign of
moat-like flows surrounding solar pores but a clearly defined region of inflows
surrounding them. The connection between moat flows and flows associated to
penumbral filaments is hereby reinforced by this work.
