We report on dynamics of non-local Abrikosov vortex flow in mesoscopic
superconducting Nb channels. Magnetic field dependence of the non-local voltage
induced by the flux flow shows that vortices form ordered vortex chains.
Voltage asymmetry (rectification) with respect to the direction of vortex flow
is evidence that vortex jamming strongly moderates vortex dynamics in
mesoscopic geometries. The findings can be applied to superconducting devices
exploiting vortex dynamics and vortex manipulation, including superconducting
wires with engineered pinning centers.
