The large-scale bulk flow implied by the measurements of distances to
brightest cluster members within 15,000 km/s by Lauer and Postman has the
potential to put strong constraints on, or to even rule out, various models of
large-scale structure. Using PM simulations 400$h^{-1}$ Mpc on a side of five
cosmological models (Standard CDM, Tilted CDM, HDM, $\Omega = 0.3$ CDM, and
PBI), we present detailed Monte-Carlo simulations of the peculiar velocity
data, which we use to assess the probability that any given model can explain
the data. These models are ruled out at confidence levels ranging from 94\%
(HDM) to 97\% (PBI). However, these results may be affected by the finite size
of the simulation volume. If the observed bulk flow remains unchanged when
calculated using a refined distance indicator with smaller scatter, all these
models will be ruled out at high confidence levels.
