This study aims to identify the advantages and disadvantages of several
mechanisms for service differentiation in mobile terminals of a wireless LAN to
establish a more better and more optimal. At the end of the analysis of
available approaches for the quality of service of the IEEE 802.11 standard,
the objective of this paper is to suggest a new method named DF-DCF
Differentiated Frame DCF. The performance of the suggested method in a Network
Simulator (NS) environment allowed its validation through a set of testing and
simulation scenarios. Simulation results have shown that the DF-DCF method is
better suited for mobile nodes in a wireless communication network.
