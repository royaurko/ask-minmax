In order to clarify the statistical features of complex networks, the
spectral density of adjacency matrices has often been investigated. Adopting a
static model introduced by Goh, Kahng and Kim, we analyse the spectral density
of complex scale free networks. For that purpose, we utilize the replica method
and effective medium approximation (EMA) in statistical mechanics. As a result,
we identify a new integral equation which determines the asymptotic spectral
density of scale free networks with a finite mean degree $p$. In the limit $p
\to \infty$, known asymptotic formulae are rederived. Moreover, the $1/p$
corrections to known results are analytically calculated by a perturbative
method.
