We construct families of approximate solutions to the initial value problem
and provide complete mathematical proofs that they tend to satisfy the standard
system of isothermal one pressure two-fluid flows in 1-D when the data are
$L^1$ in densities and $L^\infty$ in velocities. To this end, we use a method
that reduces this system of PDEs to a family of systems of four ODEs in Banach
spaces whose smooth solutions are these approximate solutions. This method is
constructive: using standard numerical methods for ODEs one can easily and
accurately compute these approximate solutions which, therefore, from the
mathematical proof, can serve for comparison with numerical schemes. One
observes agreement with previously known solutions from scientific computing
[S. Evje, T. Flatten. Hybrid Flux-splitting Schemes for a common two fluid
model. J. Comput. Physics 192, 2003, p. 175-210]. We show that one recovers the
solutions of these contributors (exactly in one case, with a slight difference in
another case). Then we propose an efficient numerical scheme for the original
system of two-fluid flows and show it gives back exactly the same results as
the theoretical solutions obtained above.
