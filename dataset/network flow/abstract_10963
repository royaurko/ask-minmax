Many complex networks have an underlying modular structure, i.e., structural
subunits (communities or clusters) characterized by highly interconnected
nodes. The modularity $Q$ has been introduced as a measure to assess the
quality of clusterizations. $Q$ has a global view, while in many real-world
networks clusters are linked mainly \emph{locally} among each other
(\emph{local cluster-connectivity}). Here, we introduce a new measure,
localized modularity $LQ$, which reflects local cluster structure. Optimization
of $Q$ and $LQ$ on the clusterization of two biological networks shows that the
localized modularity identifies more cohesive clusters, yielding a
complementary view of higher granularity.
