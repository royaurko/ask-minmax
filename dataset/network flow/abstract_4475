We investigate joint network and channel coding schemes for networks when
relay nodes are not capable of performing channel coding operations. Rather,
channel encoding is performed at the source node while channel decoding is done
only at the destination nodes. We examine three different decoding strategies:
independent network-then-channel decoding, serial network and channel decoding,
and joint network and channel decoding. Furthermore, we describe how to
implement such joint network and channel decoding using iteratively decodable
error correction codes. Using simple networks as a model, we derive achievable
rate regions and use simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the three
decoders.
