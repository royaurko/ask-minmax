We have developed a heat shield based on a metamaterial engineering approach
to shield a region from transient diffusive heat flow. The shield is designed
with a multilayered structure to prescribe the appropriate spatial profile for
heat capacity, density, and thermal conductivity of the effective medium. The
heat shield was experimentally compared to other isotropic materials.
