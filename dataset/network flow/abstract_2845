This paper demonstrates existence for all time of mean curvature flow in
Minkowski space with a perpendicular Neumann boundary condition, where the
boundary manifold is a convex cone and the flowing manifold is initially
spacelike. Using a blowdown argument, we show that under renormalisation this
flow converges towards a homothetically expanding hyperbolic solution.
