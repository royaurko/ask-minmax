Several systems can be modeled as sets of interdependent networks where each
network contains distinct nodes. Diffusion processes like the spreading of a
disease or the propagation of information constitute fundamental phenomena
occurring over such coupled networks. In this paper we propose a new concept of
multidimensional epidemic threshold characterizing diffusion processes over
interdependent networks, allowing different diffusion rates on the different
networks and arbitrary degree distributions. We analytically derive and
numerically illustrate the conditions for multilayer epidemics, i.e., the
appearance of a giant connected component spanning all the networks.
Furthermore, we study the evolution of infection density and diffusion dynamics
with extensive simulation experiments on synthetic and real networks.
