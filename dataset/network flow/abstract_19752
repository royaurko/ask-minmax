We investigate the reflection and refraction behaviors of electromagnetic
waves at the interface between an isotropic material and the anisotropic medium
with a unique dispersion relation. We show that the refraction angle of whether
phase or energy flow for $E$-polarized waves is opposite to that for
$H$-polarized waves, though the dispersion relations for $E$- and $H$-polarized
waves are the same in such anisotropic media. For a certain polarized wave the
refraction behaviors of wave vector and energy flow are also significantly
different. It is found that waves exhibit different propagation behaviors in
anisotropic media with different sign combinations of the permittivity and
permeability tensors. Some interesting properties of propagation are also found
in the special anisotropic media, such as amphoteric refraction, oblique total
transmission for both $E$- and $H$-polarized waves, and the inversion of
critical angle. The special anisotropic media can be realized by metamaterials
and lead to potential applications, such as to fabricate polarization splitters
with higher efficiencies than conventional counterparts.
