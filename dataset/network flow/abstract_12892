In recent experiments on sodium chloride clusters structural transitions
between nanocrystals with different cuboidal shapes were detected. Here we
presents results for the thermodynamics and dynamics of one of these clusters,
(NaCl)35Cl-. As the time scales for the structural transitions can be much
longer than those accessible by conventional dynamics simulations, we use a
master equation to describe the probability flow within a large sample of
potential energy minima. We characterize the processes contributing to
probability flow between the different nanocrystals, and obtain rate constants
and activation energies for comparison with the experimental values.
