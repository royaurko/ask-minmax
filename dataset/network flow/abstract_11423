This article discusses the properties of extremes of degree sequences
calculated from network data. We introduce the notion of a normalized degree,
in order to permit a comparison of degree sequences between networks with
differing numbers of nodes. We model each normalized degree as a bounded
continuous random variable, and determine the properties of the ordered
k-maxima and minima of the normalized network degrees when they comprise a
random sample from a Beta distribution. In this setting, their means and
variances take a simplified form given by their ordering, and we discuss the
relation of these quantities to other prescribed decays such as power laws. We
verify the derived properties from simulated sets of normalized degrees, and
discuss possible extensions to more flexible classes of distributions.
