With the fast development of high-speed railway (HSR), the demand for mobile
communication on high-speed trains is increasingly growing. This leads to
significant attention on the study of resource management in HSR wireless
communications with limited bandwidth. Resource management is a challenging
problem due to heterogenous quality of service (QoS) requirements and dynamic
characteristics of HSR wireless communications. In this article, we first
provide a state-of-the-art overview on HSR wireless communications and the
existing resource management schemes. Then a location-aware cross-layer
optimization framework is developed for the dynamic resource management with
realistic system model, where the train location information is exploited to
facilitate dynamic design. Next we demonstrate the applications of stochastic
network optimization theory in solving the dynamic resource management problem
in HSR wireless communications. Finally, we highlight some future research
directions for location-aware dynamic resource management in the conclusion.
