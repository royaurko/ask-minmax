We investigate the collision of two oblique dark solitons in the two
dimensional supersonic nonlinear Schr\"odinger flow past two impenetrable
obstacles. We numerically show that this collision is very similar to the dark
soliton collisions in the one dimensional case. We observe that it is
practically elastic and we measure the shifts of the solitons positions after
their interaction.
