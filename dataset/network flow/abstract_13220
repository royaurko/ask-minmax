Two-dimensional potential flows of an ideal fluid with a free surface are
considered in situations when shape of the bottom depends on time due to
external reasons. Exact nonlinear equations describing surface waves in terms
of the so called conformal variables are derived for an arbitrary time-evolving
bottom parameterized by an analytical function. An efficient numerical method
for the obtained equations is suggested.
