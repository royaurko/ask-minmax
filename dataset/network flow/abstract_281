In this short paper, we propose a new multi-fractal flow model, aiming to
provide a possible explanation for the crossover phenomena that appear in the
estimation of Hurst exponent for network traffic. It is shown that crossover
occurs if the network flow consists of several components with different Hurst
components. Our results indicate that this model might be useful in network
traffic modeling and simulation.
