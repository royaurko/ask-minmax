In this paper, we study retrievability of admissible cycles and the dynamics
of the networks constructed from admissible cycles with the pseudoinverse
learning rule. Retrievability of admissible cycles in networks with $C_0>0$ and
$\lambda$ sufficiently large are discussed. Based on the linear stability
analysis we derive a complete description of all possible local bifurcations of
the trivial solution for the networks constructed from admissible cycles. We
illustrate numerically that, depending on the structural features, the
admissible cycles are respectively stored and retrieved as attracting limit
cycles, unstable periodic solutions and delay-induced long-lasting transient
oscillations, and the transition from fixed points to the attracting limit
cycle bifurcating from the trivial solution takes place through multiple
saddle-nodes on limit cycle bifurcations.
