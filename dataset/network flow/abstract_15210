Today, many network applications require shorter react time. Robotic field is
an excellent example of these needs: robot react time has a direct effect on
its task's complexity. Here, we propose a full deterministic medium access
method for a wireless robotic application. This contribution is based on some
low-power wireless personal area networks, like ZigBee standard. Indeed, ZigBee
has identified limits with Quality of Service due to non-determinist medium
access and probable collisions during medium reservation requests. In this
paper, two major improvements are proposed: an efficient polling of the star
nodes and a temporal deterministic distribution of peer-to-peer messages. This
new MAC protocol with no collision offers some QoS faculties.
