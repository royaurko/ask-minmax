In this paper we model the tomography of scale free networks by studying the
structure of layers around an arbitrary network node. We find, both
analytically and empirically, that the distance distribution of all nodes from
a specific network node consists of two regimes. The first is characterized by
rapid growth, and the second decays exponentially. We also show that the nodes
degree distribution at each layer is a power law with an exponential cut-off.
We obtain similar results for the layers surrounding the root of multicast
trees cut from such networks, as well as the Internet. All of our results were
obtained both analytically and on empirical Interenet data.
