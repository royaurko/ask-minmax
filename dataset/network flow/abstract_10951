We show that the chemical reactions of the model systems of A+A->0 and A+B->0
when performed on scale-free networks exhibit drastically different behavior as
compared to the same reactions in normal spaces. The exponents characterizing
the density evolution as a function of time are considerably higher than 1,
implying that both reactions occur at a much faster rate. This is due to the
fact that the discerning effects of the generation of a depletion zone (A+A)
and the segregation of the reactants (A+B) do not occur at all as in normal
spaces. Instead we observe the formation of clusters of A (A+A reaction) and of
mixed A and B (A+B reaction) around the hubs of the network. Only at the limit
of very sparse networks is the usual behavior recovered.
