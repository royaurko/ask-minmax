We define two conformal structures on $S^1$ which give rise to a different
view of the affine curvature flow and a new curvature flow, the ``$Q$-curvature
flow". The steady state of these flows are studied. More specifically, we prove
four sharp inequalities, which state the existences of the corresponding
extremal metrics.
