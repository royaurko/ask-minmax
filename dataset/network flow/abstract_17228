In the case of graph partitioning, the emergence of localized eigenvectors
can cause the standard spectral method to fail. To overcome this problem, the
spectral method using a non-backtracking matrix was proposed. Based on
numerical experiments on several examples of real networks, it is clear that
the non-backtracking matrix does not exhibit localization of eigenvectors.
However, we show that localized eigenvectors of the non-backtracking matrix can
exist outside the spectral band, which may lead to deterioration in the
performance of graph partitioning.
