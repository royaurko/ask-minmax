The general scheme for the construction of the general-relativistic model of
the magnetically driven jet is suggested. The method is based on the usage of
the 3+1 MHD formalism. It is shown that the critical points of the flow and the
explicit radial behavior of the physical variables may be derived through the
jet ``profile function."
