Femtocell is emerging as a key technology to secure the coverage and capacity
in indoor environments. However the deployment of a new femtocell layer may
originate undesired interference to the whole system. This paper investigates
spectrum resource coordination and interference management for the femtocell
networks. A resource coordination scheme based on broadcasting resource
coordination request messages by the femto mobile is proposed to reduce the
system interference.
