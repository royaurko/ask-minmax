An overlooked conservation law for near-inertial waves propagating in a
steady background flow provides a new perspective on the concentration of these
waves in regions of anticyclonic vorticity. The conservation law implies that
this concentration is a direct consequence of the decrease in spatial scales
experienced by an initially homogeneous wave field. Scaling arguments and
numerical simulations of a reduced-gravity model of mixed-layer near-inertial
waves confirm this interpretation and elucidate the influence of the strength
of the background flow relative to the dispersion.
