We present a model of traffic flow, with rules that describe the behaviour of
automated vehicles in an open system. We show first of all that the fundamental
diagram of this system collapses to a point, where states of free and jammed
traffic can coexist in phase space. This leads us to consider separately the
roles of average velocities and densities as better descriptors of the actual
state of the traffic. Next, we observe that the transition between free and
jammed traffic as a function of the braking parameter R is different for high
and low initial densities, in the steady state; it turns out to be 'smeared
out' for low densities, a behaviour which is already portended by the transient
behaviour of the system. Our results indicate strongly that, at least for such
models, two effective temperatures (one related to R, and the other to the
density) are needed to describe the global behaviour of this system in
statistical mechanical terms. Analogies with granular flow are discussed in
this context.
