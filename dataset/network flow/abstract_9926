The ability to monitore bottomhole flowing pressure in pumping oil wells
provides important information regarding both reservoir and artificial lift
performance. Converting surface pressure measurements to bottomhole is
currently accomplished by locating the fluid level in the annulus using a sonic
device and then applying a correlation to estimate the density of the gas-cut
liquid column above the perforations. This work proposes a flowing bottomhole
pressure calculation procedure from fluid level measurements. The model is
developed from experimental work and from theoretical arguments. The
calculation procedure developed allows to calculate BHP without shutting the
well, which is common for fluid level casinghead pressure measurements. Also
this method allows to take into account real geometry of the The comparison of
the calculated and measured pump intake pressure shows good accuracy of a
technique. It allows to draw a conclusion for an opportunity to use this method
in practice.
