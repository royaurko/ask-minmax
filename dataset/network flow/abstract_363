Recently, motivated by the pioneer works in revealing the small-world effect
and scale-free property of various real-life networks, many scientists devote
themselves to studying complex networks. In this paper, we give a brief review
on the studies of traffic flow and efficient routing on scale-free networks,
including the traffic dynamics based on global routing protocol, Traffic
dynamics based on local routing protocol, and the critical phenomena and
scaling behaviors of real and artificial traffic. Finally, perspectives and
some interesting problems are proposed.
