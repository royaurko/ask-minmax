Circular flush Jets In Cross-Flow were experimentally studied in a water
tunnel using Volumetric Particle Tracking Velocimetry, for a range of jet to
cross-flow velocity ratios, r, from 0.5 to 3, jet exit diameters $d$ from 0.8
cm to 1 cm and cross-flow boundary layer thickness delta from 1 to 2.5 cm. The
analysis of the 3D mean velocity fields allows for the definition, computation
and study of Counter-rotating Vortex Pair trajectories. The influences of r, d
and delta were investigated. A new scaling based on momentum ratio r_m taking
into account jet and cross-flow momentum distributions is introduced based on
the analysis of jet trajectories published in the literature. Using a rigorous
scaling quality factor Q to quantify how well a given scaling successfully
collapses trajectories, we show that the proposed scaling also improves the
collapse of CVP trajectories, leading to a final scaling law for these
trajectories.
