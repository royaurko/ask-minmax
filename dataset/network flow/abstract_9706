In this paper, we propose solutions for the energy-efficient broadcasting
over cross networks, where N nodes are located on two perpendicular lines. Our
solutions consist of an algorithm which finds the optimal range assignment in
polynomial time (O(N^12)), a near-optimal algorithm with linear complexity
(O(N)), and a distributed algorithm with complexity O(1). To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study presenting an optimal solution for the
minimum-energy broadcasting problem for a 2-D network (with cross
configuration). We compare our algorithms with the broadcast incremental power
(BIP) algorithm, one of the most commonly used methods for solving this problem
with complexity O(N^2). We demonstrate that our near-optimal algorithm
outperforms BIP, and that the distributed algorithm performs close to it.
Moreover, the proposed distributed algorithm can be used for more general
two-dimensional networks, where the nodes are located on a grid consisting of
perpendicular line-segments. The performance of the proposed near-optimal and
distributed algorithms tend to be closer to the optimal solution for larger
networks.
