Let M be a non-orientable compact 2-manifold of genus 4. Then there exists a
family of quasi-minimal, Kupka-Smale smooth vector fields X_r in M, depending
smoothly on 0<=r<e, such that, for some flow box V in M of X_0, and for all
0<=r,v<e, (1) X_r restricted to V is a flow box; (2) If r is not equal to v,
X_r is a C^\infty--twist perturbation of X_v localized in V; (3) X_r and X_v
are topologically equivalent.
