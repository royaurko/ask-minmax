It has been suggested that the laws of thermodynamics are violated by what we
have called a convection-dominated accretion flow (or a 1/2-law accretion flow)
-- an accretion flow characterized by a constant outflow of energy. We show
that both the 1/2-law flow and the Bondi flow (also known as ADAF, advection
dominated accretion flow) are thermodynamically admissible.
