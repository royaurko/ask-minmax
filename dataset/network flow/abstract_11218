Gaussian graphical models are often used to infer gene networks based on
microarray expression data. Many scientists, however, have begun using
high-throughput sequencing technologies to measure gene expression. As the
resulting high-dimensional count data consists of counts of sequencing reads
for each gene, Gaussian graphical models are not optimal for modeling gene
networks based on this discrete data. We develop a novel method for estimating
high-dimensional Poisson graphical models, the Log-Linear Graphical Model,
allowing us to infer networks based on high-throughput sequencing data. Our
model assumes a pair-wise Markov property: conditional on all other variables,
each variable is Poisson. We estimate our model locally via neighborhood
selection by fitting 1-norm penalized log-linear models. Additionally, we
develop a fast parallel algorithm, an approach we call the Poisson Graphical
Lasso, permitting us to fit our graphical model to high-dimensional genomic
data sets. In simulations, we illustrate the effectiveness of our methods for
recovering network structure from count data. A case study on breast cancer
microRNAs, a novel application of graphical models, finds known regulators of
breast cancer genes and discovers novel microRNA clusters and hubs that are
targets for future research.
