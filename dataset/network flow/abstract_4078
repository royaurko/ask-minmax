We study the convergence of the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on a Fano manifold under
some stability conditions. More precisely we assume that the first eingenvalue
of the $\bar\partial$-operator acting on vector fields is uniformly bounded
along the flow, and in addition the Mabuchi energy decays at most
logarithmically. We then give different situations in which the condition on
the Mabuchi energy holds.
