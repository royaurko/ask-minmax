We review some recent work on the synchronization of coupled dynamical
systems on a variety of networks. When nodes show synchronized behaviour, two
interesting phenomena can be observed. First, there are some nodes of the
floating type that show intermittent behaviour between getting attached to some
clusters and evolving independently. Secondly, two different ways of cluster
formation can be identified, namely self-organized clusters which have mostly
intra-cluster couplings and driven clusters which have mostly inter-cluster
couplings.
