In this work we study the Boolean Networks of different geometric shape and
lattice organization. It was revealed that no only a spatial shape but also
type of lattice are very important for definition of the structure-dynamics
relation. The regular structures do not give a critical regime in the
investigated cases. Hierarchy together with the irregular structure reveals
characteristic features of criticality.
