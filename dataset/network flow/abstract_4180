This article is concerned with developing an analytic theory for second order
nonlinear parabolic equations on singular manifolds. Existence and uniqueness
of solutions in an Lp-framework is established by maximal regularity tools.
These techniques are applied to the Yamabe flow. It is proven that the Yamabe
flow admits a unique local solution within a class of incomplete initial
metrics.
