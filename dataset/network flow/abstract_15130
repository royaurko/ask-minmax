In this paper we present the state of advancement of the French ANR WebStand
project. The objective of this project is to construct a customizable XML based
warehouse platform to acquire, transform, analyze, store, query and export data
from the web, in particular mailing lists, with the final intension of using
this data to perform sociological studies focused on social groups of World
Wide Web, with a specific emphasis on the temporal aspects of this data. We are
currently using this system to analyze the standardization process of the W3C,
