We study the locally-defined social capital metric of Palasek (2013) for
determining individuals' prestige within an online social network. From it we
derive an equivalent global measure by considering random walks over the
network itself. This result inspires a novel expression quantifying the
strategic desirability of a potential social connection. We show in silico that
ideal social neighbors tend to satisfy a "big fish in a small pond" criterion
and that the distribution of neighbor-desirability throughout a network is
governed by anti-homophily.
