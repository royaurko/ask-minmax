Random walk on discrete lattice models is important to understand various
types of transport processes. The extreme events, defined as exceedences of the
flux of walkers above a prescribed threshold, have been studied recently in the
context of complex networks. This was motivated by the occurrence of rare
events such as traffic jams, floods, and power black-outs which take place on
networks. In this work, we study extreme events in a generalized random walk
model in which the walk is preferentially biased by the network topology. The
walkers preferentially choose to hop toward the hubs or small degree nodes. In
this setting, we show that extremely large fluctuations in event-sizes are
possible on small degree nodes when the walkers are biased toward the hubs. In
particular, we obtain the distribution of event-sizes on the network. Further,
the probability for the occurrence of extreme events on any node in the network
depends on its 'generalized strength', a measure of the ability of a node to
attract walkers. The 'generalized strength' is a function of the degree of the
node and that of its nearest neighbors. We obtain analytical and simulation
results for the probability of occurrence of extreme events on the nodes of a
network using a generalized random walk model. The result reveals that the
nodes with a larger value of 'generalized strength', on average, display lower
probability for the occurrence of extreme events compared to the nodes with
lower values of 'generalized strength'.
