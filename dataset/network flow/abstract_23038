Nucleon-nucleon (NN) cross sections are evaluated in neutron-rich matter
using a scaling model according to nucleon effective masses. It is found that
the in-medium NN cross sections are not only reduced but also have a different
isospin dependence compared with the free-space ones. Because of the
neutron-proton effective mass splitting the difference between nn and pp
scattering cross sections increases with the increasing isospin asymmetry of
the medium. Within the transport model IBUU04, the in-medium NN cross sections
are found to influence significantly the isospin transport in heavy-ion
reactions. With the in-medium NN cross sections, a symmetry energy of
$E_{sym}(\rho)\approx 31.6(\rho /\rho_{0})^{0.69}$ was found most acceptable
compared with both the MSU isospin diffusion data and the presently acceptable
neutron-skin thickness in $^{208}$Pb. The isospin dependent part $K_{asy}(\rho
_{0})$ of isobaric nuclear incompressibility was further narrowed down to
$-500\pm 50$ MeV. The possibility of determining simultaneously the in-medium
NN cross sections and the symmetry energy was also studied. The proton
transverse flow, or even better the combined transverse flow of neutrons and
protons, can be used as a probe of the in-medium NN cross sections without much
hindrance from the uncertainties of the symmetry energy.
