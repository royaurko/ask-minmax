{\it Critical slowing down} associated with the iterative solvers close to
the critical point often hinders large-scale numerical simulation of fracture
using discrete lattice networks. This paper presents a block circlant
preconditioner for iterative solvers for the simulation of progressive fracture
in disordered, quasi-brittle materials using large discrete lattice networks.
The average computational cost of the present alorithm per iteration is $O(rs
log s) + delops$, where the stiffness matrix ${\bf A}$ is partioned into
$r$-by-$r$ blocks such that each block is an $s$-by-$s$ matrix, and $delops$
represents the operational count associated with solving a block-diagonal
matrix with $r$-by-$r$ dense matrix blocks. This algorithm using the block
circulant preconditioner is faster than the Fourier accelerated preconditioned
conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm, and alleviates the {\it critical slowing
down} that is especially severe close to the critical point. Numerical results
using random resistor networks substantiate the efficiency of the present
algorithm.
