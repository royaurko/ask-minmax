We have generalised the exact solution of the Riemann problem in special
relativistic hydrodynamics for arbitrary tangential flow velocities. The
solution is obtained by solving the jump conditions across shocks plus an
ordinary differential equation arising from the self-similarity condition along
rarefaction waves, in a similar way as in purely normal flow. The dependence of
the solution on the tangential velocities is analysed, and the impact of this
result on the development of multidimensional relativistic hydrodynamic codes
(of Godunov type) is discussed.
