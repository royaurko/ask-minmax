Human diseases spread over networks of contacts between individuals and a
substantial body of recent research has focused on the dynamics of the
spreading process. Here we examine a model of two competing diseases spreading
over the same network at the same time, where infection with either disease
gives an individual subsequent immunity to both. Using a combination of
analytic and numerical methods, we derive the phase diagram of the system and
estimates of the expected final numbers of individuals infected with each
disease. The system shows an unusual dynamical transition between dominance of
one disease and dominance of the other as a function of their relative rates of
growth. Close to this transition the final outcomes show strong dependence on
stochastic fluctuations in the early stages of growth, dependence that
decreases with increasing network size, but does so sufficiently slowly as
still to be easily visible in systems with millions or billions of individuals.
In most regions of the phase diagram we find that one disease eventually
dominates while the other reaches only a vanishing fraction of the network, but
the system also displays a significant coexistence regime in which both
diseases reach epidemic proportions and infect an extensive fraction of the
network.
