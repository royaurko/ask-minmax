In this second part of a series of papers on the long-time behavior of Ricci
flows with surgery, we establish a bound on the evolution of the infimal area
of simplicial complexes inside a 3-manifold under the Ricci flow. This estimate
generalizes an area estimate of Hamilton, which we will recall in the first
part of the paper.
  We remark that in this paper we will mostly be dealing with non-singular
Ricci flows. The existence of surgeries will not play an important role.
