This paper concerns the numerical approximation of the Euler equations for
multicomponent flows. A numerical method is proposed to reduce spurious
oscillations that classically occur around material interfaces. It is based on
the "Explicit Simplified Interface Method" (ESIM), previously developed in the
linear case of acoustics with stationary interfaces (2001, J. Comput. Phys.
168, pp.~227-248). This technique amounts to a higher order extension of the
"Ghost Fluid Method" introduced in Euler multicomponent flows (1999, J. Comput.
Phys. 152, pp. 457-492). The ESIM is coupled to sophisticated shock-capturing
schemes for time-marching, and to level-sets for tracking material interfaces.
Jump conditions satisfied by the exact solution and by its spatial derivative
are incorporated in numerical schemes, ensuring a subcell resolution of
material interfaces inside the meshing. Numerical experiments show the
efficiency of the method for rich-structured flows.
