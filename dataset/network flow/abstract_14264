In most electronic devices, electric current of both types (electrons and
holes) flows through a junction. Usually the boundary conditions have been
formulated exclusively for open circuit. The boundary conditions proposed here
bypass this limitation by the first time, as far as we are aware. Besides,
these new boundary conditions correctly describe current flow in a circuit,
i.e., closed circuit conditions, which are the usual operation conditions for
electronic devices and for the measurement of many transport properties. We
also have generalized the case (as much as it is possible in a classical
treatment), so self-consistent boundary conditions to describe current-flow
through a contact between two arbitrary conducting media are developed in the
present work. These boundary conditions take into account a recently developed
theory: influence of temperature space inhomogeneity due to the interfaces and
quasi-particles temperature-mismatch on thermo-generation and recombination.
They also take into account surface resistance, surface recombination rates and
possible temperature discontinuities at the interface due to finite surface
thermo-conductivity. The temperature difference between current-carriers and
phonon subsystems is also included in this approach.
