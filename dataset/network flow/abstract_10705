I present results from numerical simulations of gas dynamics outside luminous
accretion disks in active galactic nuclei. The gas, gravitationally captured by
a super massive black hole, can be driven away by the energy and momentum of
the radiation emitted during black hole accretion. Assuming axisymmetry, I
study how the mass accretion and outflow rates, and the flow dynamics respond
to changes in radiation heating relative to radiation pressure. I find that for
a 10^8 MSUN black hole with the accretion luminosity of 0.6 of the Eddington
luminosity the flow settles into a steady state and has two components: (1) an
equatorial inflow and (2) a bipolar inflow/outflow with the outflow leaving the
system along the disk rotational axis. The inflow is a realization of a
Bondi-like accretion flow. The second component is an example of a non-radial
accretion flow which becomes an outflow once it is pushed close to the
rotational axis where thermal expansion and radiation pressure accelerate it
outward. The main result of this preliminary work is that although the above
two-component solution is robust, its properties are sensitive to the geometry
and spectral energy distribution of the radiation field.
