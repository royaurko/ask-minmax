This is a natural generalization of the previous work by Dan, "Modeling and
Simulation of Diffusion Phenomena on Social Networks," to appear in The
proceedings of 2011 Third International Conference on Computer Modeling and
Simulation. In this paper, we consider the diffusion phenomena of personal or
secret information on the variety of networks, such as complete, random,
stochastic and scale-free networks.
