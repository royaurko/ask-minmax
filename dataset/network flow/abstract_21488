The replicated field theory of the random field Ising model involves the
couplings of replicas of different indices. The resulting correlation functions
involve a superposition of different types of long distance behaviours. However
the $n=0$ limit allows one to discuss the renormalization group properties in
spite of this phenomenon. The attraction of pairs of replicas is enhanced under
renormalization flow and no stable fixed point is found. Consequently an
instability occurs in the paramagnetic region, before one reaches the Curie
line, signalling the onset of replica symmetry breaking.
