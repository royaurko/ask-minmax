Large-scale network experiments is a challenging problem. Simulations,
emulations, and real-world testbeds all have their advantages and
disadvantages. In this paper we present LiteLab, a light-weight platform
specialized for large-scale networking experiments. We cover in detail its
design, key features, and architecture. We also perform an extensive evaluation
of LiteLab's performance and accuracy and show that it is able to both simulate
network parameters with high accuracy, and also able to scale up to very large
networks. LiteLab is flexible, easy to deploy, and allows researchers to
perform large-scale network experiments with a short development cycle. We have
used LiteLab for many different kinds of network experiments and are planning
to make it available for others to use as well.
