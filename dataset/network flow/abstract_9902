We study the collective flow of open charm mesons and charmonia in Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV within the hadron-string-dynamics (HSD)
transport approach. The detailed studies show that the coupling of $D,\bar{D}$
mesons to the light hadrons leads to comparable directed and elliptic flow as
for the light mesons. This also holds approximately for $J/\Psi$ mesons since
more than 50% of the final charmonia for central and mid-central collisions
stem from $D+\bar{D}$ induced reactions in the transport calculations. The
transverse momentum spectra of $D,\bar{D}$ mesons and $J/\Psi$'s are only very
moderately changed by the (pre-)hadronic interactions in HSD which can be
traced back to the collective flow generated by elastic interactions with the
light hadrons.
