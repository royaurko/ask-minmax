Oscillating solid bodies have frequently been used for studying the
properties of normal and superfluid helium. In particular, the transition from
laminar flow to turbulence has attracted much interest recently. The purpose of
this note is to review several central features of this transition in
oscillatory flow, which have been inaccurately formulated in some recent work.
