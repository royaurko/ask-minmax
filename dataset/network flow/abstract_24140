We present a strategic analysis of a trust model that has recently been
proposed for promoting cooperative behaviour in user-centric networks. The
mechanism for cooperation is based on a combination of reputation and virtual
currency schemes in which service providers reward paying customers and punish
non-paying ones by adjusting their reputation, and hence the price they pay for
services. We model and analyse this system using PRISM-games, a tool that
performs automated verification and strategy synthesis for stochastic
multi-player games using the probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with
rewards (rPATL). We construct optimal strategies for both service users and
providers, which expose potential risks of the cooperation mechanism and which
we use to devise improvements that counteract these risks.
