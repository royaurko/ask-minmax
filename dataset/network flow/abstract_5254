The M-theory lift of N=1 G_2-invariant RG flow via a combinatoric use of the
4-dimensional RG flow and 11-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell equations was found
some time ago. The 11-dimensional metric, a warped product of an asymptotically
AdS_4 space with a squashed and stretched 7-sphere, for SU(3)-invariance was
found before. In this paper, by choosing the 4-dimensional internal space as
CP^2 space, we discover an exact solution of N=1 G_2-invariant flow to the
11-dimensional field equations. By an appropriate coordinate transformation on
the three internal coordinates, we also find an 11-dimensional solution of N=1
G_2-invariant flow interpolating from N=8 SO(8)-invariant UV fixed point to N=1
G_2-invariant IR fixed point. In particular, the 11-dimensional metric and
4-forms at the N=1 G_2 fixed point for the second solution will provide some
hints for the 11-dimensional lift of whole N=1 SU(3) RG flow connecting this
N=1 G_2 fixed point to N=2 SU(3) x U(1)_R fixed point in 4-dimensions.
