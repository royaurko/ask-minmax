We propose a two fluid theory to model a dilute polymer solution assuming
that it consists of two phases, polymer and solvent, with two distinct
macroscopic velocities. The solvent phase velocity is governed by the
macroscopic Navier-Stokes equations with the addition of a force term
describing the interaction between the two phases. The polymer phase is
described on the mesoscopic level using a dumbbell model and its macroscopic
velocity is obtained through averaging. We start by writing down the full
phase-space distribution function for the dumbbells and then obtain the
inertialess limits for the Fokker-Planck equation and for the averaged friction
force acting between the phases from a rigorous asymptotic analysis. The
resulting equations are relevant to the modelling of strongly non-homogeneous
flows, while the standard kinetic model is recovered in the locally homogeneous
case.
