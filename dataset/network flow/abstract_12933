We study a one-dimensional discrete analog of the von Karman flow, widely
investigated in turbulence. A lattice of anharmonic oscillators is excited by
both ends in order to create a large scale structure in a highly nonlinear
medium, in the presence of a dissipative term similar to the viscous term in a
fluid. This system shows a striking similarity with a turbulent flow both at
local and global scales. The properties of the nonlinear excitations of the
lattice provide a partial understanding of this behavior.
