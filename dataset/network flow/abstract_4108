In this paper, we derive some local a priori estimates for Ricci flow. This
gives rise to some strong uniqueness theorems. As a corollary, let $g(t)$ be a
smooth complete solution to the Ricci flow on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, with the
canonical Euclidean metric $E$ as initial data, then $g(t)$ is trivial, i.e.
$g(t)\equiv E$.
