This paper deals with the use of self-organizing protocols to improve the
reliability of dynamic Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay networks. We present two
approaches, that employ local knowledge of the 2nd neighborhood of nodes. The
first scheme is a simple protocol requiring interactions among nodes and their
direct neighbors. The second scheme extends this approach by resorting to the
Edge Clustering Coefficient (ECC), a local measure that allows to identify
those edges that connect different clusters in an overlay. A simulation
assessment is presented, which evaluates these protocols over uniform networks,
clustered networks and scale-free networks. Different failure modes are
considered. Results demonstrate the viability of the proposal.
