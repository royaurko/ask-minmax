How to pass from local to global scales in anonymous networks? How to
organize a selfstabilizing propagation of information with feedback. From the
Angluin impossibility results, we cannot elect a leader in a general anonymous
network. Thus, it is impossible to build a rooted spanning tree. Many problems
can only be solved by probabilistic methods. In this paper we show how to use
Unison to design a self-stabilizing barrier synchronization in an anonymous
network. We show that the commuication structure of this barrier
synchronization designs a self-stabilizing wave-stream, or pipelining wave, in
anonymous networks. We introduce two variants of Wave: the strong waves and the
wavelets. A strong wave can be used to solve the idempotent r-operator
parametrized computation problem. A wavelet deals with k-distance computation.
We show how to use Unison to design a self-stabilizing wave stream, a
self-stabilizing strong wave stream and a self-stabilizing wavelet stream.
