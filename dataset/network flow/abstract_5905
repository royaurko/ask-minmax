We examine two properties of complex networks, the robustness against
targeted node removal (attack) and the transport efficiency in terms of degree
correlation in node connection by numerical evaluation of exact analytic
expressions. We find that, while the assortative correlation enhances the
structural robustness against attack, the disassortative correlation
significantly improves the transport efficiency of the network under
consideration. This finding might shed light on the reason why some networks in
the real world prefer assortative correlation and others prefer disassortative
one.
