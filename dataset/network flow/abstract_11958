Daum et al. [PODC'13] presented an algorithm that computes a maximal
independent set (MIS) within $O(\log^2 n/F+\log n \mathrm{polyloglog} n)$
rounds in an $n$-node multichannel radio network with $F$ communication
channels. The paper uses a multichannel variant of the standard graph-based
radio network model without collision detection and it assumes that the network
graph is a polynomially bounded independence graph (BIG), a natural
combinatorial generalization of well-known geographic families. The upper bound
of that paper is known to be optimal up to a polyloglog factor.
  In this paper, we adapt algorithm and analysis to improve the result in two
ways. Mainly, we get rid of the polyloglog factor in the runtime and we thus
obtain an asymptotically optimal multichannel radio network MIS algorithm. In
addition, our new analysis allows to generalize the class of graphs from those
with polynomially bounded local independence to graphs where the local
independence is bounded by an arbitrary function of the neighborhood radius.
