In this paper correspondence between experimental data for packet delay and
two theoretical types of distribution is investigated. Statistical tests have
shown that only exponential distribution can be used for the description of
packet delays in global network. Precision experimental data to within
microseconds are gathered by means of the RIPE Test Box. Statistical
verification of hypothesis has shown that distribution parameters remain
constants during 500 second intervals at least. In paper cumulative
distribution function and generating function for packet delay in network are
in an explicit form written down, the algorithm of search of parameters of
distribution is resulted.
