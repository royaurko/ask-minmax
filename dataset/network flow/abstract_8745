We present direct numerical simulations of reversals of the magnetic field
generated by swirling flows in a spherical domain. In agreement with a recent
model, we observe that coupling dipolar and quadrupolar magnetic modes by an
asymmetric forcing of the flow generates field reversals. In addition, we show
that this mechanism strongly depends on the value of the magnetic Prandtl
number.
