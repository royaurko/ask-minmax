We consider holographic RG flow solutions with eight supersymmetries and
study the geometry transverse to the brane. For both M2-branes and for
D3-branes in F-theory this leads to an eight-manifold with only a four-form
flux. In both settings there is a natural four-dimensional hyper-Kahler slice
that appears on the Coulomb branch. In the IIB theory this hyper-Kahler
manifold encodes the Seiberg-Witten coupling over the Coulomb branch of a U(1)
probe theory. We focus primarily upon a new flow solution in M-theory. This
solution is first obtained using gauged supergravity and then lifted to eleven
dimensions. In this new solution, the brane probes have an Eguchi-Hanson moduli
space with the M2-branes spread over the non-trivial 2-sphere. It is also shown
that the new solution is valid for a class of orbifold theories. We discuss how
the hyper-Kahler structure on the slice extends to some form of G-structure in
the eight-manifold, and describe how this can be computed.
