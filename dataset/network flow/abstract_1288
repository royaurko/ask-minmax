In this paper, we study the interdependency between the power grid and the
communication network used to control the grid. A communication node depends on
the power grid in order to receive power for operation, and a power node
depends on the communication network in order to receive control signals for
safe operation. We demonstrate that these dependencies can lead to cascading
failures, and it is essential to consider the power flow equations for studying
the behavior of such interdependent networks. We propose a two-phase control
policy to mitigate the cascade of failures. In the first phase, our control
policy finds the non-avoidable failures that occur due to physical
disconnection. In the second phase, our algorithm redistributes the power so
that all the connected communication nodes have enough power for operation and
no power lines overload. We perform a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the
performance of our control policy, and show that our control policy achieves
close to optimal yield for many scenarios. This analysis can help design robust
interdependent grids and associated control policies.
