The evolution to the steady state of a granular gas subject to simple shear
flow is analyzed by means of computer simulations. It is found that, regardless
of its initial preparation, the system reaches (after a transient period
lasting a few collisions per particle) a non-Newtonian (unsteady) hydrodynamic
regime, even at strong dissipation and for states where the time scale
associated with inelastic cooling is shorter than the one associated with the
irreversible fluxes. Comparison with a simplified rheological model shows a
good agreement.
