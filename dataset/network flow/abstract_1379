We present a numerical simulation study of a simple monatomic Lennard-Jones
liquid under shear flow, as a function of both temperature and shear rate. By
investigating different observables we find that i) It exists a line in the
(temperature-shear) plane that sharply marks the boarder between an
``equilibrium'' and a ``shear-controlled'' region for both the dynamic and the
thermodynamic quantities; and ii) Along this line the structural relaxation
time, is proportional to the inverse shear rate, i.e. to the typical time-scale
introduced by the shear flow. Above the line the liquid dynamics is unaffected
by the shear flow, while below it both temperature and shear rate control the
particle motion.
