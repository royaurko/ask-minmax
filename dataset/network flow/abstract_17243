In order to investigate the breast cancer prediction problem on the aging
population with the grades of DCIS, we conduct a tree augmented naive Bayesian
network experiment trained and tested on a large clinical dataset including
consecutive diagnostic mammography examinations, consequent biopsy outcomes and
related cancer registry records in the population of women across all ages. The
aggregated results of our ten-fold cross validation method recommend a biopsy
threshold higher than 2% for the aging population.
