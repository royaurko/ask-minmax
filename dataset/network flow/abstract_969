We use confocal microscopy to directly visualize the spatial fluctuations in
fluid flow through a three-dimensional porous medium. We find that the velocity
magnitudes and the velocity components both along and transverse to the imposed
flow direction are exponentially distributed, even with residual trapping of a
second immiscible fluid. Moreover, we find pore-scale correlations in the flow
that are determined by the geometry of the medium. Our results suggest that,
despite the considerable complexity of the pore space, fluid flow through it is
not completely random.
