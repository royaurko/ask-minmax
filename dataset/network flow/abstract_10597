The first decade of the 21st century has seen tremendous improvements in
mobile internet and its technologies. The high traffic volume of services such
as video conference and other real-time traffic applications are imposing a
great challenge on networks. In the meantime, demand for the use of mobile
devices in computation and communication such as smart phones, personal digital
assistants, and mobile-enabled laptops has grown rapidly. These services have
driven the demand for increasing and guaranteing bandwidth requirements in the
network. A direction of this paper is in the case of resource reservation
protocol (RSVP) over mobile IPv6 networks. There are numbers of proposed
solutions for RSVP and quality of service provision over mobile IPv6 networks,
but most of them using advanced resource reservation. In this paper, we propose
a mathematical model to determine maximum end-to-end delay bound through
intermediate routers along the network. These bounds are sent back to the home
agent for further processing. Once the home agent receives maximum end-to-end
delay bounds, it calculates cumulative bound and compares this bound with the
desired application end-to-end delay bound to make final decision on resource
reservation. This approach improves network resource utilization.
