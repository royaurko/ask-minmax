We report on magnetotransport measurements performed on a large metallic
two-dimensional $\mathcal{T}_{3}$ network. Superimposed on the conventional
Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak (AAS) oscillations of period $h/2e$, we observe clear
$h/e$ oscillations in magnetic fields up to $8 T$. Different interpretations of
this phenomenon are proposed.
