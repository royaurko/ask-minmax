We simulate the dynamics of Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) with a hybrid model that treats the quark-gluon plasma
macroscopically as an ideal fluid, but models the hadron resonance gas
microscopically using a hadronic cascade. We find that much of the
mass-ordering pattern for v_2(p_T) observed at RHIC is generated during the
hadronic stage due to build-up of additional radial flow. We also find that the
mass-ordering pattern is violated for phi meson due to small interaction cross
section in the hadron resonance gas.
