We present an analytical theory of susceptibility induced nuclear spin
dephasing in the capillary network of myocardium. Using a strong collision
approach, equations are obtained for the relaxation rate of the free induction
and the spin echo decay. Simulation and experimental data are well predicted by
the theory. Since paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin as the origin of nuclear spin
dephasing has a higher tissue concentration in myocardium supplied by a
stenotic, i. e. significantly narrowed, coronary artery, spin dephasing might
serve as a diagnostic tool. Our approach can be modified for capillary networks
in other tissues than myocardium and may be applied in material science.
