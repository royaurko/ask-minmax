This arXiv article describes the fluid dynamics video on `Gravity-driven
thin-film flow with negatively buoyant particles', presented at the 64th Annual
Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics in Baltimore, MD in November
2011. The video shows three different experiments where a thin film of silicone
oil laden with particles, is allowed to flow down an incline under the action
of gravity. The videos were recorded at the UCLA Applied Math Laboratory.
