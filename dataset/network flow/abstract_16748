We study how a fraction of a population should be vaccinated to most
efficiently top epidemics. We argue that only local information (about the
neighborhood of specific vertices) is usable in practice, and hence we consider
only local vaccination strategies. The efficiency of the vaccination strategies
is investigated with both static and dynamical measures. Among other things we
find that the most efficient strategy for many real-world situations is to
iteratively vaccinate the neighbor of the previous vaccinee that has most links
out of the neighborhood.
