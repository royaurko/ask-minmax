We describe an efficient method for drawing any n-vertex simple graph G in
the hyperbolic plane. Our algorithm produces greedy drawings, which support
greedy geometric routing, so that a message M between any pair of vertices may
be routed geometrically, simply by having each vertex that receives M pass it
along to any neighbor that is closer in the hyperbolic metric to the message's
eventual destination. More importantly, for networking applications, our
algorithm produces succinct drawings, in that each of the vertex positions in
one of our embeddings can be represented using O(log n) bits and the
calculation of which neighbor to send a message to may be performed efficiently
using these representations. These properties are useful, for example, for
routing in sensor networks, where storage and bandwidth are limited.
