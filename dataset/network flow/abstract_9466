It is known that the capacity of parallel (e.g., multi-carrier) Gaussian
point-to-point, multiple access and broadcast channels can be achieved by
separate encoding for each subchannel (carrier) subject to a power allocation
across carriers. Recent results have shown that parallel interference channels
are not separable, i.e., joint coding is needed to achieve capacity in general.
This work studies the separability, from a sum-capacity perspective, of single
hop Gaussian interference networks with independent messages and arbitrary
number of transmitters and receivers. The main result is that the only network
that is always (for all values of channel coefficients) separable from a
sum-capacity perspective is the MAC-Z-BC network, i.e., a network where a MAC
component and a BC component are linked by a Z component. The sum capacity of
this network is explicitly characterized.
