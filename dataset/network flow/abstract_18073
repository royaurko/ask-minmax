Three elastic phases of covalent networks, (I) floppy, (II) isostatically
rigid and (III) stressed-rigid have now been identified in glasses at specific
degrees of cross-linking (or chemical composition) both in theory and
experiments. Here we use size-increasing cluster combinatorics and constraint
counting algorithms to study analytically possible consequences of
self-organization. In the presence of small rings that can be locally I, II or
III, we obtain two transitions instead of the previously reported single
percolative transition at the mean coordination number $\bar r=2.4$, one from a
floppy to an isostatic rigid phase, and a second one from an isostatic to a
stressed rigid phase. The width of the intermediate phase $~ \bar r$ and the
order of the phase transitions depend on the nature of medium range order
(relative ring fractions). We compare the results to the Group IV
chalcogenides, such as Ge-Se and Si-Se, for which evidence of an intermediate
phase has been obtained, and for which estimates of ring fractions can be made
from structures of high T crystalline phases.
