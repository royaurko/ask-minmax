Our project analyzes the United States domestic airport network. We attempt
to determine which airports are most vital in maintaining the underlying
infrastructure for all domestic flights within the United States. To perform
our analysis, we use data from the first quarter of 2010 and use several
methods and algorithms that are frequently used in network science. Using these
statistics, we identified the most important airports in the United States and
investigate the role and significance that these airports play in maintaining
the structure of the entire domestic airport network. Some of these airports
include Denver International and Ted Stevens Anchorage International. We also
identified any structural holes and suggested improvements that can be made to
the network. Finally, through our analysis, we developed a disaster response
algorithm that calculates flight path reroutes in emergency situations.
