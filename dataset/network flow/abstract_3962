This chapter introduces statistical methods used in the analysis of social
networks and in the rapidly evolving parallel-field of network science.
Although several instances of social network analysis in health services
research have appeared recently, the majority involve only the most basic
methods and thus scratch the surface of what might be accomplished.
Cutting-edge methods using relevant examples and illustrations in health
services research are provided.
