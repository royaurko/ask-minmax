We have developed the formalism necessary to employ the
discontinuous-Galerkin approach in general-relativistic hydrodynamics. The
formalism is firstly presented in a general 4-dimensional setting and then
specialized to the case of spherical symmetry within a 3+1 splitting of
spacetime. As a direct application, we have constructed a one-dimensional code,
EDGES, which has been used to asses the viability of these methods via a series
of tests involving highly relativistic flows in strong gravity. Our results
show that discontinuous Galerkin methods are able not only to handle strong
relativistic shock waves but, at the same time, to attain very high orders of
accuracy and exponential convergence rates in smooth regions of the flow. Given
these promising prospects and their affinity with a pseudospectral solution of
the Einstein equations, discontinuous Galerkin methods could represent a new
paradigm for the accurate numerical modelling in relativistic astrophysics.
