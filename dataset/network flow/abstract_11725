We investigate the effect of unidirectional regular and random couplings of
units in a network on stochastic resonance. For simplicity we choose the units
as Bellows map with bistability. In a regular network we apply a weak periodic
signal and noise to first unit only. Above certain coupling strength undamped
and enhanced signal propagation takes place. Resonance occurs at the same value
of noise intensity in all units. The response amplitude displays sigmoidal
function type variation with unit number. When all the units are driven by the
weak periodic force and noise oscillatory variation of response amplitude with
unit number occurs. In the network with random coupling all the units are
subjected to periodic force and noise. In this case the value of noise
intensity at which resonance occurs and the corresponding value of average
response amplitude increases nonlinearly with the number of units wired.
Numerical simulation with multiple couplings shows that in both type of
networks single coupling is sufficient to realize a great improvement in
stochastic resonance and signal propagation.
