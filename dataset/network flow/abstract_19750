In a two-dimensional model of the planetary atmosphere the compressible
convective flow of vorticity represents a strong nonlinearity able to drive the
fluid toward a quasi-coherent vortical pattern. This is similar to the highly
organised motion generated at relaxation in ideal Euler fluids. The problem of
the atmosphere is however fundamentally different since now there is an
intrinsic length, the Rossby radius. Within the Charney Hasegawa Mima model it
has been derived a differential equation governing the stationary,
two-dimensional, highly organised vortical flows in the planetary atmosphere.
We present results of a numerical study of this differential equation. The most
characteristic solution shows a strong similarity with the morphology of a
tropical cyclone. Quantitative comparisons are also favorable and several
relationships can be derived connecting the characteristic physical parameters
of the tropical cyclone: the radius of the eye-wall, the maximum azimuthal
velocity and the radial extension of the vortex.
