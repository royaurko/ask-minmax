Community detection using both graphs and social networks is the focus of
many algorithms. Recent methods aimed at optimizing the so-called modularity
function proceed by maximizing relations within communities while minimizing
inter-community relations.
  However, given the NP-completeness of the problem, these algorithms are
heuristics that do not guarantee an optimum. In this paper, we introduce a new
algorithm along with a function that takes an approximate solution and modifies
it in order to reach an optimum. This reassignment function is considered a
'potential function' and becomes a necessary condition to asserting that the
computed optimum is indeed a Nash Equilibrium. We also use this function to
simultaneously show partitioning and overlapping communities, two detection and
visualization modes of great value in revealing interesting features of a
social network. Our approach is successfully illustrated through several
experiments on either real unipartite, multipartite or directed graphs of
medium and large-sized datasets.
