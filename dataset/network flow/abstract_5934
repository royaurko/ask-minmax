We propose in this paper a new generative model for graphs that uses a latent
space approach to explain timestamped interactions. The model is designed to
provide global estimates of activity dates in historical networks where only
the interaction dates between agents are known with reasonable precision.
Experimental results show that the model provides better results than local
averages in dense enough networks
