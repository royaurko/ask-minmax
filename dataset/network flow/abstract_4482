The lack of interoperability between cellular access networks has long been a
challenging burden, which telecommunication engineers and researchers are
trying to overcome. In second generation networks for example, this problem
lies in the lack of standardization. 3rd G networks is limited to a few
operating modes using different radio transmission technologies that are not
interoperable. 4G technology even being successful in its various trials cannot
guarantee interoperability. The undertaken approach to overcome this issue
within heterogeneous networks begins by establishing a holistic understanding
of cellular communication, and proposing an Ontological approach that expresses
the domain's concepts, classes, and properties in a formal and unambiguous way.
It begins by analyzing the structure of three different cellular technologies,
and producing feature models. Lte-Advanced cellular network is the target of
this ongoing analysis. The final objective sought is to build Ontology capable
of providing a common view of cellular network technologies' domain.
