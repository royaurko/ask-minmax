We consider a network design problem called the generalized terminal backup
problem. Whereas earlier work investigated the edge-connectivity constraints
only, we consider both edge- and node-connectivity constraints for this
problem. A major contribution of this paper is the development of a strongly
polynomial-time 4/3-approximation algorithm for the problem. Specifically, we
show that a linear programming relaxation of the problem is half-integral, and
that the half-integral optimal solution can be rounded to a 4/3-approximate
solution. We also prove that the linear programming relaxation of the problem
with the edge-connectivity constraints is equivalent to minimizing the cost of
half-integral multiflows that satisfy flow demands given from terminals. This
observation presents a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for computing a
minimum cost half-integral multiflow under flow demand constraints.
