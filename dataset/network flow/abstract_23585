Compressed video is well known to be self-similar in nature. We model VBR
carrying Long-Range Dependent (LRD), multiplexed MPEG-2 video sources. The
actual traffic for the model is generated using fast-fourier transform of
generate the fractional gaussian noise (FGN) sequence. Our model of compressed
video sources bears similarity to an MPEG-2 Transport Stream carrying video,
i.e., it is long-range dependent and generates traffic in a piecewise-CBR
fashion. We study the effect of such VBR traffic on ABR carrying TCP traffic.
The effect of such VBR traffic is that the ABR capacity is highly variant. We
find that a switch algorithm like ERICA+ can tolerate this variance in ABR
capacity while maintaining high throughput and low delay. We present simulation
results for terrestrial and satellite configurations.
