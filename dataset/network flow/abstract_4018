Nonequilibrium Langmuir monolayers including a fraction of chiral molecules
and subject to transmembrane flow are considered. The flow induces coherent
collective precession of chiral molecules. Our theoretical study shows that
splay interactions in this system lead to spatial redistribution of chiral
molecules and formation of spiral waves and target patterns observed in
experiments.
