We study $N=2$ gauged supergravity with $U(1)$ gauge group coupled to $n_v$
vector multiplets and find quite general analytic solutions for quarter-BPS
black holes with mass, NUT and dyonic Maxwell charges. The solutions we find
have running scalar fields and flow in the IR region to a horizon geometry of
the form AdS$_2\times \Sigma_g$.
