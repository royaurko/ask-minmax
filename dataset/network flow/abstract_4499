Over the past several years Bayesian networks have been applied to a wide
variety of problems. A central problem in applying Bayesian networks is that of
finding one or more of the most probable instantiations of a network. In this
paper we develop an efficient algorithm that incrementally enumerates the
instantiations of a Bayesian network in decreasing order of probability. Such
enumeration algorithms are applicable in a variety of applications ranging from
medical expert systems to model-based diagnosis. Fundamentally, our algorithm
is simply performing a lazy enumeration of the sorted list of all
instantiations of the network. This insight leads to a very concise algorithm
statement which is both easily understood and implemented. We show that for
singly connected networks, our algorithm generates the next instantiation in
time polynomial in the size of the network. The algorithm extends to arbitrary
Bayesian networks using standard conditioning techniques. We empirically
evaluate the enumeration algorithm and demonstrate its practicality.
