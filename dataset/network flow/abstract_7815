Collective flow, its anisotropies and its event-to-event fluctuations in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and the extraction of the specific shear
viscosity of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) from collective flow data collected in
heavy-ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC are reviewed. Specific emphasis
is placed on the similarities between the Big Bang of our universe and the
Little Bangs created in heavy-ion collisions.
