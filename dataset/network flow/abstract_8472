In this work we focus on how noise propagates in biochemical reaction
networks and affects sensitivities of the system. We discover that the
stochastic fluctuations can enhance sensitivities in one region of the value of
control parameters by reducing sensitivities in another region. Based on this
compensation principle, we designed a concentration detector in which enhanced
amplification is achieved by an incoherent feedforward reaction network.
