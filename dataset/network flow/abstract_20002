Modern techniques of the renormalization group (RG) combined with effective
field theory (EFT) methods are revolutionizing nuclear many-body physics. In
these lectures we will explore the motivation for RG in low-energy nuclear
systems and its implementation in systems ranging from the deuteron to neutron
stars, both formally and in practice. Flow equation approaches applied to
Hamiltonians both in free space and in the medium will be emphasized. This is a
conceptually simple technique to transform interactions to more perturbative
and universal forms. An unavoidable complication for nuclear systems from both
the EFT and flow equation perspective is the need to treat many-body forces and
operators, so we will consider these aspects in some detail. We'll finish with
a survey of current developments and open problems in nuclear RG.
