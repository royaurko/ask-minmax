We introduce four new cocycle conjugacy invariants for E_0-semigroups on II_1
factors: a coupling index, a dimension for the gauge group, a super product
system and a C*-semiflow. Using noncommutative It\^o integrals we show that the
dimension of the gauge group can be computed from the structure of the additive
cocycles. We do this for the Clifford flows and even Clifford flows on the
hyperfinite II_1 factor, and for the free flows on the free group factor
$L(F_\infty)$. In all cases the index is 0, which implies they have trivial
gauge groups. We compute the super product systems for these families and,
using this, we show they have trivial coupling index. Finally, using the
C*-semiflow and the boundary representation of Powers and Alevras, we show that
the families of Clifford flows and even Clifford flows contain infinitely many
mutually non-cocycle-conjugate E_0-semigroups.
