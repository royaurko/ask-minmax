In this paper we propose a new scheduling algorithm called Real Time
Scheduling (RTS) which uses virtual nodes for self stabilization. This
algorithm deals with all the contributing components of the end-to-end
travelling delay of data packets in sensor network and with virtual nodes
algorithm achieves QoS in terms of packet delivery, multiple connections,
better power management and stable routes in case of failure. RTS delays
packets at intermediate hops (not just prioritizes them) for a duration that is
a function of their deadline. Delaying packets allows the network to avoid hot
spotting while maintaining deadline-faithfulness. We compare RTS with another
prioritizing and scheduling algorithm for real-time data dissemination in
sensor networks, velocity monotonic scheduling. This paper simulates RTS based
on two typical routing protocols, shortest path routing and greedy forwarding
with J-Sim.
