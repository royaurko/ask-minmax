In this paper we construct two mechanisms that fully implement social welfare
maximising allocation in Nash equilibria for the case of single infinitely
divisible good being demanded by a separate groups of agents, whilst being
subject to multiple inequality constraints. The nature of the good demanded is
such that it can be duplicated locally at no cost. The first mechanism achieves
weak budget balance, while the second is an extension of the first, and
achieves strong budget balance at equilibrium. One important application of
these mechanisms is the multi-rate multicast service on the Internet where a
network operator wishes to allocate rates among strategic agents, who are
segregated in groups based on the content they demand (while their demanded
rates could be different), in such a way that maximises overall user
satisfaction while respecting capacity constraints on every link in the
network. The emphasis of this work is on full implementation, which means that
all Nash equilibria of the induced game result in the optimal allocations of
the centralized allocation problem.
