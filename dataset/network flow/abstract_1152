Given a wireless network where some pairs of communication links interfere
with each other, we study sufficient conditions for determining whether a given
set of minimum bandwidth quality-of-service (QoS) requirements can be
satisfied. We are especially interested in algorithms which have low
communication overhead and low processing complexity. The interference in the
network is modeled using a conflict graph whose vertices correspond to the
communication links in the network. Two links are adjacent in this graph if and
only if they interfere with each other due to being in the same vicinity and
hence cannot be simultaneously active. The problem of scheduling the
transmission of the various links is then essentially a fractional, weighted
vertex coloring problem, for which upper bounds on the fractional chromatic
number are sought using only localized information. We recall some distributed
algorithms for this problem, and then assess their worst-case performance. Our
results on this fundamental problem imply that for some well known classes of
networks and interference models, the performance of these distributed
algorithms is within a bounded factor away from that of an optimal, centralized
algorithm. The performance bounds are simple expressions in terms of graph
invariants. It is seen that the induced star number of a network plays an
important role in the design and performance of such networks.
