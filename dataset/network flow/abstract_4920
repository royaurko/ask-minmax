Let $T=(T_t^f)_{t\in \mathbb{R}}$ be a special flow built over an IET $T : T
\to T$ of bounded type, under a roof function f with symmetric logarithmic
singularities at a subset of discontinuities of T. We show that $T$ satisfies
so-called switchable Ratner's property. A consequence of this fact is that such
flows are mildly mixing. Thus, on each compact, connected, orientable surface
of genus greater than one there exist flows which are mildly mixing and not
mixing.
