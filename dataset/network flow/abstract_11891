The recent economic crisis has raised a wide awareness that the financial
system should be considered as a complex network with financial institutions
and financial dependencies respectively as nodes and links between these nodes.
Systemic risk is defined as the risk of default of a large portion of financial
exposures among institution in the network. Indeed, the structure of this
network is an important element to measure systemic risk and there is no widely
accepted methodology to determine the systemically important nodes in a large
financial network. In this research, we introduce a metric for systemic risk
measurement with taking into account both common idiosyncratic shocks as well
as contagion through counterparty exposures. Our focus is on application of
eigenvalue problems, as a robust approach to the ranking techniques, to measure
systemic risk. Recently, the efficient algorithm has been developed for robust
eigenvector problem to reduce to a nonsmooth convex optimization problem. We
applied this technique and studied the performance and convergence behavior of
the algorithm with different structure of the financial network.
