We present a comparison of Abell and APM clusters of galaxies as tracers of
the large scale structure of the Universe. We investigate selection functions
of both cluster catalogs. We show that the supercluster-void network can be
traced with both cluster samples; the network has a well-defined period of ~120
h^{-1} Mpc. We calculate the correlation function and the power spectrum for
Abell and APM cluster samples. The APM cluster sample with measured redshifts
covers a small volume which contains only a few very rich superclusters that
surround one void and have exceptionally large mutual separations. Due to this
property the maximum of the power spectrum of APM clusters with measured
velocities is shifted to larger scales than the corresponding feature in the
power spectrum of Abell clusters. We conclude that the APM sample is not
representative for the large-scale structure as a whole due to the small space
coverage. We present a catalog of superclusters of galaxies, based on APM
clusters up to a redshift z_{lim}=0.13.
