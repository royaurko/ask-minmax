Sink Mobility is becoming popular due to excellent load balancing between
nodes and ultimately resulting in prolonged network lifetime and throughput. A
major challenge is to provide reliable and energy-efficient operations are to
be taken into consideration for differentmobility patterns of sink. Aim of this
paper is lifetime maximization of Delay TolerantWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
through the manipulation of Mobile Sink (MS) on different trajectories. We
propose Square Routing Protocol with MS (SRP-MS) based on existing SEP (Stable
Election Protocol) by making it Cluster Less (CL) and introducing sink
mobility.
