We study the problem of routing in sensor networks where the goal is to
maximize the network's lifetime. Previous work has considered this problem for
fixed-topology networks. Here, we add mobility to the source node, which
requires a new definition of the network lifetime. In particular, we redefine
lifetime to be the time until the source node depletes its energy. When the
mobile node's trajectory is unknown in advance, we formulate three versions of
an optimal control problem aiming at this lifetime maximization. We show that
in all cases, the solution can be reduced to a sequence of Non- Linear
Programming (NLP) problems solved on line as the source node trajectory
evolves.
