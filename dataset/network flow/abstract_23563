We study the diffusion of gas molecules through a two-dimensional network of
polymers with the help of Monte Carlo simulations. The polymers are modeled as
non-interacting random walks on the bonds of a two-dimensional square lattice,
while the gas particles occupy the lattice cells. When a particle attempts to
jump to a nearest-neighbor empty cell, it has to overcome an energy barrier
which is determined by the number of polymer segments on the bond separating
the two cells. We investigate the gas current $J$ as a function of the mean
segment density $\rho$, the polymer length $\ell$ and the probability $q^{m}$
for hopping across $m$ segments. Whereas $J$ decreases monotonically with
$\rho$ for fixed $\ell$, its behavior for fixed $\rho$ and increasing $\ell$
depends strongly on $q$. For small, non-zero $q$, $J$ appears to increase
slowly with $\ell$. In contrast, for $q=0$, it is dominated by the underlying
percolation problem and can be non-monotonic. We provide heuristic arguments to
put these interesting phenomena into context.
