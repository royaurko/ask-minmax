We introduce a mesoscale technique for simulating the structure and rheology
of block copolymer melts and blends in hydrodynamic flows. The technique
couples dynamic self consistent field theory (DSCFT) with continuum
hydrodynamics and flow penalization to simulate polymeric fluid flows in
channels of arbitrary geometry. We demonstrate the method by studying phase
separation of an ABC triblock copolymer melt in a sub-micron channel with
neutral wall wetting conditions. We find that surface wetting effects and shear
effects compete, producing wall-perpendicular lamellae in the absence of flow,
and wall-parallel lamellae in cases where the shear rate exceeds some critical
Weissenberg number.
