In network theory, Pearson's correlation coefficients are most commonly used
to measure the degree assortativity of a network. We investigate the behavior
of these coefficients in the setting of directed networks with heavy-tailed
degree sequences. We prove that for graphs where the in- and out-degree
sequences satisfy a power law with realistic parameters, Pearson's correlation
coefficients converge to a non-negative number in the infinite network size
limit. We propose alternative measures for degree-degree dependencies in
directed networks based on Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. Using examples and
calculations on the Wikipedia graphs for nine different languages, we show why
these rank correlation measures are more suited for measuring degree
assortativity in directed graphs with heavy-tailed degrees.
