Today by growing network systems, security is a key feature of each network
infrastructure. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) provide defense model
for all security threats which are harmful to any network. The IDS could detect
and block attack-related network traffic. The network control is a complex
model. Implementation of an IDS could make delay in the network. Several
software-based network intrusion detection systems are developed. However, the
model has a problem with high speed traffic. This paper reviews of many type of
software architecture in intrusion detection systems and describes the design
and implementation of a high-performance network intrusion detection system
that combines the use of software-based network intrusion detection sensors and
a network processor board. The network processor which is a hardware-based
model could acts as a customized load balancing splitter. This model cooperates
with a set of modified content-based network intrusion detection sensors rather
than IDS in processing network traffic and controls the high-speed.
