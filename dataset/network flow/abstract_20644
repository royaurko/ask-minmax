We study the dynamics of visitation flux in a multi-random-walker model by
comparison to surface growth dynamics in which one random walker drops a
particle to a node at each time the walker visits the node. In each independent
experiment (trial or day) for the multi-random-walker model, the number of
walkers are randomly chosen from the uniform distribution $[< N_{RW} >
-\triangle N_{RW}, < N_{RW} > +\triangle N_{RW} ]$. The averaged fluctuation
$\bar {\sigma} ({T_{RW}})$ of the visitations over all nodes $i$ and
independent experiments is shown to satisfy the power-law dependence on the
walk step $T_{RW}$ as $\bar {\sigma} ({T_{RW}})\simeq {T_{RW}}^\beta$.
Furthermore two distinct values of the exponent $\beta$ are found on a
scale-free network, a random network and regular lattices. One is $\beta_i$,
which is equal to the growth exponent $\beta$ for the surface fluctuation $W$
in one-random-walker model, and the other is $\beta=1$. $\beta_i$ is found for
small $\triangle N_{RW}$ or for the system governed by the internal intrinsic
dynamics. In contrast $\beta=1$ is found for large $\triangle N_{RW}$ or for
the system governed by the external flux variations. The implications of our
results to the recent studies on fluctuation dynamics of the nodes on networks
are discussed.
