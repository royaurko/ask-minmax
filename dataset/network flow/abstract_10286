The velocity of a two-dimensional aqueous foam has been measured as it flows
through two parallel channels, at a constant overall volumetric flow rate. The
flux distribution between the two channels is studied as a function of the
ratio of their widths. A peculiar dependence of the velocity ratio on the width
ratio is observed when the foam structure in the narrower channel is either
single staircase or bamboo. In particular, discontinuities in the velocity
ratios are observed at the transitions between double and single staircase and
between single staircase and bamboo. A theoretical model accounting for the
viscous dissipation at the solid wall and the capillary pressure across a film
pinned at the channel outlet predicts the observed non-monotonic evolution of
the velocity ratio as a function of the width ratio. It also predicts
quantitatively the intermittent temporal evolution of the velocity in the
narrower channel when it is so narrow that film pinning at its outlet
repeatedly brings the flow to a near stop.
