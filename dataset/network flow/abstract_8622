A few years ago, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) used by only military. Now,
we have seen many of organizations use WSNs for some purposes such as weather,
pollution, traffic control, and healthcare. Security is becoming on these days
a major concern for wireless sensor network. In this paper I focus on the
security types of attacks and their detection. This paper anatomizes the
security requirements and security attacks in wireless sensor networks. Also,
indicate to the benchmarks for the security in WSNs.
