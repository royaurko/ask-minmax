Detecting and visualizing what are the most relevant changes in an evolving
network is an open challenge in several domains. We present a fast algorithm
that filters subsets of the strongest nodes and edges representing an evolving
weighted graph and visualize it by either creating a movie, or by streaming it
to an interactive network visualization tool. The algorithm is an approximation
of exponential sliding time-window that scales linearly with the number of
interactions. We compare the algorithm against rectangular and exponential
sliding time-window methods. Our network filtering algorithm: i) captures
persistent trends in the structure of dynamic weighted networks, ii) smoothens
transitions between the snapshots of dynamic network, and iii) uses limited
memory and processor time. The algorithm is publicly available as open-source
software.
