In our recent paper, we have obtained a model solution to the problem of
radiation-inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) in a global magnetic field (so
called, resistive RIAF model), which is asymptotically exact in outer regions
of such flows forming accretion disks. When extrapolated inwardly, the model
predicts a local enhancement of the vertical Poynting flux within a small
radius that may be regarded as the disk inner-edge. This fact has been
interpreted as the origin of power source for the astrophysical jets
observationally well-known to be ejected from this type of accretion disks.
Since the accuracy of the solution may become rather poor in such inner
regions, however, the ground of this assertion may not seem to be so firm. In
the present paper, we develop a sophisticated discussion for the appearance of
jet-driving circumstances, based on a much more firm ground by deriving a
global solution in the same situation. Although the new solution still has an
approximate nature, it becomes exact in the limits not only of large radius but
also of small radius. The analytic results clarify that the electrodynamic
power is gathered by the Poynting flux, from outer main-disk region to feed the
innermost part of an accretion disk. The injected power largely exceeds the
local supply of work by the fluid motion.
