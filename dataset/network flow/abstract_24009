Based on the transformation optics, a novel transmission-line (TL) approach
to realize invisibility cloaking using planar anisotropic metamaterials (MTMs)
is proposed. The two-dimensional cylindrical cloaks are modeled based on
inductor-capacitor (L-C) MTMs networks. The three elements of the constitutive
parameters are all allowed to be spatially inhomogeneous which lead to the full
parameter realization of a cylindrical cloak. As an example, a cloak working at
VHF band is modeled and its invisibility behavior is demonstrated based on the
solution of the node voltage distribution. Due to the non-resonant properties
of the L-C elements, the broadband characteristic of the proposed cloaks is
also evident.
