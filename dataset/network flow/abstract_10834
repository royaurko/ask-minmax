Planets appear to form in environments shaped by the gas flowing through
protostellar disks to the central young stars. The flows in turn are governed
by orbital angular momentum transfer. In this chapter we summarize current
understanding of the transfer processes best able to account for the flows,
including magneto-rotational turbulence, magnetically-launched winds,
self-gravitational instability and vortices driven by hydrodynamical
instabilities. For each in turn we outline the major achievements of the past
few years and the outstanding questions. We underscore the requirements for
operation, especially ionization for the magnetic processes and heating and
cooling for the others. We describe the distribution and strength of the
resulting flows and compare with the long-used phenomenological
$\alpha$-picture, highlighting issues where the fuller physical picture yields
substantially different answers. We also discuss the links between magnetized
turbulence and magnetically-launched outflows, and between magnetized
turbulence and hydrodynamical vortices. We end with a summary of the status of
efforts to detect specific signatures of the flows.
