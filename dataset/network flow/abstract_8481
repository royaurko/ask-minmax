With the help of the Internet, social networks have grown rapidly. This has
increased security requirements. We present a formalization of social networks
as composite behavioral objects, defined using the Observational Transition
System (OTS) approach. Our definition is then translated to the OTS/CafeOBJ
algebraic specification methodology. This translation allows the formal
verification of safety properties for social networks via the Proof Score
method. Finally, using this methodology we formally verify some security
properties.
