We derive a new shell model of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in which
the energy transfers are not necessary local. Like the original MHD equations,
the model conserves the total energy, magnetic helicity, cross-helicity and
volume in phase space (Liouville's theorem) apart from the effects of external
forcing, viscous dissipation and magnetic diffusion. In the absence of magnetic
field the model exhibits a statistically stationary kinetic energy solution
with a Kolmogorov spectrum. The dynamo action from a seed magnetic field by the
turbulent flow and the non linear interactions are studied for a wide range of
magnetic Prandtl numbers in both kinematic and dynamic cases. The non locality
of the energy transfers are clearly identified.
