The architecture of the BlueGene/L massively parallel supercomputer is
described. Each computing node consists of a single compute ASIC plus 256 MB of
external memory. The compute ASIC integrates two 700 MHz PowerPC 440 integer
CPU cores, two 2.8 Gflops floating point units, 4 MB of embedded DRAM as cache,
a memory controller for external memory, six 1.4 Gbit/s bi-directional ports
for a 3-dimensional torus network connection, three 2.8 Gbit/s bi-directional
ports for connecting to a global tree network and a Gigabit Ethernet for I/O.
65,536 of such nodes are connected into a 3-d torus with a geometry of
32x32x64. The total peak performance of the system is 360 Teraflops and the
total amount of memory is 16 TeraBytes.
