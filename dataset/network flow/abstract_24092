We study the synchronisation and phase-lag of fluctuations in the number of
infected individuals in a network of cities between which individuals commute.
The frequency and amplitude of these oscillations is known to be very well
captured by the van Kampen system-size expansion, and we use this approximation
to compute the complex coherence function that describes their correlation. We
find that, if the infection rate differs from city to city and the coupling
between them is not too strong, these oscillations are synchronised with a well
defined phase lag between cities. The analytic description of the effect is
shown to be in good agreement with the results of stochastic simulations for
realistic population sizes.
