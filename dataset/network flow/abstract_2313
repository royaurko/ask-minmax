A possible evolution of a compact hypersurface in R^n by mean curvature past
singularities is defined via the level set flow. In the case that the initial
hypersurface has positive mean curvature, we show that the Brakke flow
associated to the level set flow is actually a Brakke flow with equality. We
obtain as a consequence that no mass drop can occur along such a flow. As a
further application of the techniques used above we give a new variational
formulation for mean curvature flow of mean convex hypersurfaces.
