We analyze the structure of networks minimizing the global resistance to flow
(or dissipated energy) with respect to two different constraints: fixed total
channel volume and fixed total channel surface area. First, we determine the
shape of channels in such optimal networks and show that they must be straight
with uniform cross-sectional areas. Then, we establish a relation between the
cross-sectional areas of adjoining channels at each junction. Indeed, this
relation is a generalization of Murray's law, originally established in the
context of local optimization. Moreover, we establish a relation between angles
and cross-sectional areas of adjoining channels at each junction, which can be
represented as a vectorial force balance equation, where the force weight
depends on the channel cross-sectional area. A scaling law between the minimal
resistance value and the total volume or surface area value is also derived
from the analysis. Furthermore, we show that no more than three or four
channels meet in one junction of optimal bi-dimensional networks, depending on
the flow profile (e.g.: Poiseuille-like or plug-like) and the considered
constraint (fixed volume or surface area). In particular, we show that sources
are directly connected to wells, without intermediate junctions, for minimal
resistance networks preserving the total channel volume in case of plug flow
regime. Finally, all these results are illustrated with a simple example, and
compared with the structure of natural networks.
