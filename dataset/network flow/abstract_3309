In this paper we introduce a property of ergodic flows, called Property B. We
prove that any ergodic hyper?nite equiva- lence relation of type III_o whose
associated flow satis?es this property is not of product type. A consequence of
this result is that any properly ergodic ow with Property B is not
approximately transitive. We use Property B to construct a non-AT flow which -
up to conjugacy - is a flow built under a function with the dyadic odometer as
base automorphism.
