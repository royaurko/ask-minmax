It is shown that the universally unstable kinetic drift wave in an
electron-ion plasma can very effectively be suppressed by adding an extra
flowing ion (or plasma) population. The effect of the flow of the added ions is
essential, their response is of the type (vph-vf0) exp[-(vph-vf0)^2], where vf0
is the flow speed and vph phase speed parallel to the magnetic field vector.
The damping is strong and it is mainly due to this ion exponential term, and
this remains so for vf0 < vph.
