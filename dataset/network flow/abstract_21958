The classical theory of water waves is based on the theory of inviscid flows.
However it is important to include viscous effects in some applications. Two
models are proposed to add dissipative effects in the context of the Boussinesq
equations, which include the effects of weak dispersion and nonlinearity in a
shallow water framework. The dissipative Boussinesq equations are then
integrated numerically.
