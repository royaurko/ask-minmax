We introduce a class of integrable $l$-field first-order lattices together
with corresponding Lax equations. These lattices may be represented as
consistency condition for auxiliary linear systems defined on sequences of
formal dressing operators. This construction provides simple way to build
lattice Miura transformations between one-field lattice and $l$-field ($l\ge
2$) ones. We show that the lattices pertained to above class is in some sense
compatible with KP flows and define the chains of constrained KP Lax operators.
