This paper explores the decay of the scale-free property for a kind of
birth-and-death evolving networks, in which at each time step, a node is added
with probability p and connected with old nodes by preferential attachment; or
a node is randomly deleted from the network with probability q=1-p. Employing
the SPR-based Markov chain method, we calculate the degree distribution of the
proposed network and discuss its tail features. Our results show that the node
deletion probability q has a strong impact on the power-law tail. As q tends to
0, the power-law property is distinct, while with the increasing of q to 1/2,
the scale-free character is gradually disappeared. This may imply for the real
birth-and-death network, during the emergent and growing stages, since the
probability of node deletion is very small, the power-law tail of the degree
distribution is apparent. However, when the network is in the matured stage,
the deletion probability q will be incrementally increasing, making the
scale-free feature decay gradually.
