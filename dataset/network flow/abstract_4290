We propose a renormalization group treatment of stochastically growing
networks. As an example, we study percolation on growing scale-free networks in
the framework of a real-space renormalization group approach. As a result, we
find that the critical behavior of percolation on the growing networks differs
from that in uncorrelated nets.
