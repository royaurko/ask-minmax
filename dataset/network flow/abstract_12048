Through the distinction between ``real'' and ``virtual'' links between the
nodes of a graph, we develop a set of simple rules leading to scale-free
networks with a tunable degree distribution exponent. Albeit sharing some
similarities with preferential attachment, our procedure is both faster than a
na\"ive implementation of the Barab\'asi and Albert model and exhibits
different clustering properties. The model is thoroughly studied numerically
and suggests that reducing the set of partners a node can connect to is
important in seizing the diversity of scale-free structures.
