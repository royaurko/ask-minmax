In transportation planning and development, transport network design problem
seeks to optimize specific objectives (e.g. total travel time) through choosing
among a given set of projects while keeping consumption of resources (e.g.
budget) within their limits. Due to the numerous cases of choosing projects,
solving such a problem is very difficult and time-consuming. Based on particle
swarm optimization (PSO) technique, a heuristic solution algorithm for the
bi-level problem is designed. This paper evaluates the algorithm performance in
the response of changing certain basic PSO parameters.
