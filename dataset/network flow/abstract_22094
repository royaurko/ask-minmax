Through an extension of the ultradiscretization for the optimal velocity (OV)
model, we introduce an ultradiscretizable traffic flow model, which is a hybrid
of the OV and the slow-to-start (s2s) models. Its ultradiscrete limit gives a
generalization of a special case of the ultradiscrete OV (uOV) model recently
proposed by Takahashi and Matsukidaira. A phase transition from free to jam
phases as well as the existence of multiple metastable states are observed in
numerically obtained fundamental diagrams for cellular automata (CA), which are
special cases of the ultradiscrete limit of the hybrid model.
