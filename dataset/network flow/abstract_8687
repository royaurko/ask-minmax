The spectral flow of the overlap operator is computed numerically along a
path connecting two gauge fields which differ by a topologically non-trivial
gauge transformation. The calculation is performed for SU(2) in the 3/2 and 5/2
representation. An even-odd pattern for the spectral flow as predicted by
Witten is verified. The results are, however, more complicated than naively
expected.
