We study an exact rotating and expanding solution of the fluid dynamical
model of heavy ion reactions, that take into account the rate of slowing down
of the rotation due to the longitudinal and transverse expansion of the system.
The parameters of the model are set on the basis of realistic 3+1D fluid
dynamical calculation at TeV energies, where the rotation is enhanced by the
build up of the Kelvin Helmholtz Instability in the flow.
