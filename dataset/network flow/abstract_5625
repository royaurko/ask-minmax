A new era is dawning for wireless mobile ad hoc networks where communication
will be done using a group of mobile devices called cluster, hence clustered
network. In a clustered network, protocols used by these mobile devices are
different from those used in a wired network; which helps to save computation
time and resources efficiently. This paper focuses on Cluster-Based Routing
Protocol and Dynamic Source Routing. The results presented in this paper
illustrates the implementation of Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector routing
protocol for enhancing mobile nodes performance and lifetime in a clustered
network and to demonstrate how this routing protocol results in time efficient
and resource saving in wireless mobile ad hoc networks.
