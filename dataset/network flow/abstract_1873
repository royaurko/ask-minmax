This paper considers max-min fair rate allocation and routing in energy
harvesting networks where fairness is required among both the nodes and the
time slots. Unlike most previous work on fairness, we focus on multihop
topologies and consider different routing methods. We assume a predictable
energy profile and focus on the design of efficient and optimal algorithms that
can serve as benchmarks for distributed and approximate algorithms. We first
develop an algorithm that obtains a max-min fair rate assignment for any given
(time-variable or time-invariable) unsplittable routing or a routing tree. For
time-invariable unsplittable routing, we also develop an algorithm that finds
routes that maximize the minimum rate assigned to any node in any slot. For
fractional routing, we study the joint routing and rate assignment problem. We
develop an algorithm for the time-invariable case with constant rates. We show
that the time-variable case is at least as hard as the 2-commodity feasible
flow problem and design an FPTAS to combat the high running time. Finally, we
show that finding an unsplittable routing or a routing tree that provides
lexicographically maximum rate assignment (i.e., that is the best in the
max-min fairness terms) is NP-hard, even for a time horizon of a single slot.
Our analysis provides insights into the problem structure and can be applied to
other related fairness problems.
