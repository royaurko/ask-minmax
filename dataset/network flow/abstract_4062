We describe the Hamiltonian structures, including the Poisson brackets and
Hamiltonians, for free boundary problems for incompressible fluid flows with
vorticity. The Hamiltonian structure is used to obtain variational principles
for stationary gravity waves both for irrotational flows as well as flows with
vorticity.
