Helioseismic observations have detected small temporal variations of the
rotation rate below the solar surface corresponding to the so-called `torsional
oscillations' known from Doppler measurements of the surface. These appear as
bands of slower and faster than average rotation moving equatorward. Here we
establish, using complementary helioseismic observations over four years from
the GONG network and from the MDI instrument on board SOHO, that the banded
flows are not merely a near-surface phenomenon: rather they extend downward at
least 60 Mm (some 8% of the total solar radius) and thus are evident over a
significant fraction of the nearly 200 Mm depth of the solar convection zone.
