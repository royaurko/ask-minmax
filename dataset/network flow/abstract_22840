In two classical works of 1995, R.S. Hamilton investigated some deep problems
of differential geometry, in which it was involved the Ricci flow and a
specific functional defined on hypersurfaces (called, isoperimetric ratio),
whose analytic expression has interesting properties. We show some conditions
of minimization for this functional, by using the approach of the geometric
measure theory and a recent method developed in [M. Ritor\'e and C. Rosales,
Existence and characterization of regions minimizing perimeter under a volume
constraint inside euclidean cones, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 356 (2004),
4601--4622].
