The objective of this paper is to study the plane symmetric kinematic
self-similar heat conducting fluid and charge dust solutions of the Einstein
field equations. These solutions are classified according to self-similarity of
the first, second, zeroth and infinite kinds with different equations of state.
We take the self-similar vector to be tilted, orthogonal and parallel to the
fluid flow. For heat conducting fluid, it is found that there exist only
\emph{one} solution in parallel case. In all other possibilities, these
solutions reduce to the perfect fluid kinematic self-similar solutions. For
charge dust case, we also obtain only \emph{one} kinematic self-similar
solution.
