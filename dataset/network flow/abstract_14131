In this Letter we investigate the properties of advection-dominated accretion
flows (ADAFs) fed by the evaporation of a Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk (SSD).
In our picture the ADAF fills the central cavity evacuated by the SSD and
extends beyond the transition radius into a coronal region. We find that,
because of global angular momentum conservation, a significant fraction of the
hot gas flows away from the black hole forming a transsonic wind, unless the
injection rate depends only weakly on radius (if $r^2\dot\sigma\propto
r^{-\xi}$, $\xi< 1/2$). The Bernoulli number of the inflowing gas is negative
if the transition radius is $\lesssim 100$ Schwarzschild radii, so matter
falling into the hole is gravitationally bound. The ratio of inflowing to
outflowing mass is $\approx 1/2$, so in these solutions the accretion rate is
of the same order as in standard ADAFs and much larger than in
advection-dominated inflow/outflow models (ADIOS). The possible relevance of
evaporation-fed solutions to accretion flows in black hole X-ray binaries is
briefly discussed.
