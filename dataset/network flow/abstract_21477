We present a systematic stability analysis for the two-dimensional Hubbard
model, which is based on a new renormalization group method for interacting
Fermi systems. The flow of effective interactions and susceptibilities confirms
the expected existence of a d-wave pairing instability driven by
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. More unexpectedly, we find that strong
forward scattering interactions develop which may lead to a Pomeranchuk
instability breaking the tetragonal symmetry of the Fermi surface.
