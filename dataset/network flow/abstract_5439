As the vast majority of network measures are defined for one-mode networks,
two-mode networks often have to be projected onto one-mode networks to be
analyzed. A number of issues arise in this transformation process, especially
when analyzing ties among nodes' contacts. For example, the values attained by
the global and local clustering coefficients on projected random two-mode
networks deviate from the expected values in corresponding classical one-mode
networks. Moreover, both the local clustering coefficient and constraint
(structural holes) are inversely associated to nodes' two-mode degree. To
overcome these issues, this paper proposes redefinitions of the clustering
coefficients for two-mode networks.
