It is known that the critical probability for the percolation transition is
not a sharp threshold, actually it is a region of non-zero width $\Delta p_c$
for systems of finite size. Here we present evidence that for complex networks
$\Delta p_c \sim \frac{p_c}{l}$, where $l \sim N^{\nu_{opt}}$ is the average
length of the percolation cluster, and $N$ is the number of nodes in the
network. For Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graphs $\nu_{opt} = 1/3$, while for
scale-free (SF) networks with a degree distribution $P(k) \sim k^{-\lambda}$
and $3<\lambda<4$, $\nu_{opt} = (\lambda-3)/(\lambda-1)$. We show analytically
and numerically that the \textit{survivability} $S(p,l)$, which is the
probability of a cluster to survive $l$ chemical shells at probability $p$,
behaves near criticality as $S(p,l) = S(p_c,l) \cdot exp[(p-p_c)l/p_c]$. Thus
for probabilities inside the region $|p-p_c| < p_c/l$ the behavior of the
system is indistinguishable from that of the critical point.
