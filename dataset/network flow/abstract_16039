One of the most challenging fields in vehicular communications has been the
experimental assessment of protocols and novel technologies. Researchers
usually tend to simulate vehicular scenarios and/or partially validate new
contributions in the area by using constrained testbeds and carrying out minor
tests. In this line, the present work reviews the issues that pioneers in the
area of vehicular communications and, in general, in telematics, have to deal
with if they want to perform a good evaluation campaign by real testing. The
key needs for a good experimental evaluation is the use of proper software
tools for gathering testing data, post-processing and generating relevant
figures of merit and, finally, properly showing the most important results. For
this reason, a key contribution of this paper is the presentation of an
evaluation environment called AnaVANET, which covers the previous needs. By
using this tool and presenting a reference case of study, a generic testing
methodology is described and applied. This way, the usage of the IPv6 protocol
over a vehicle-to-vehicle routing protocol, and supporting IETF-based network
mobility, is tested at the same time the main features of the AnaVANET system
are presented. This work contributes in laying the foundations for a proper
experimental evaluation of vehicular networks and will be useful for many
researchers in the area.
