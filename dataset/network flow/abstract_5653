A soft control of the network activity through varying reward in a
proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency is reported. Rewards are the necessity to
incent the contributors activities (i.e., mining) in order to maintain the PoW
network. Contrary to constant rewarding in a certain period implemented in most
of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, we propose a network-dependent rewarding
model system, primarily including two phases: 1) activities encouraging phase
in which higher rewards are issued at higher network activities; and 2)
discouraging further increase of activities by reducing rewards. The advantages
of this system include 1) fair distribution of rewards among a variety of
contributors, and 2) enforcing a limit to the network activity and hence the
cost of maintaining the PoW network. This mechanism requires network
contributors to show their participation in order to earn maximum rewards,
i.e., proof-of-mining.
