We present the results of 3--D nonlinear simulations of magnetic dynamo
action by core convection within A-type stars of 2 solar masses, at a range of
rotation rates. We consider the inner 30% by radius of such stars, with the
spherical domain thereby encompassing the convective core and a portion of the
surrounding radiative envelope. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations,
subject to the anelastic approximation, are solved to examine highly nonlinear
flows that span multiple scale heights, exhibit intricate time dependence, and
admit magnetic dynamo action. Small initial seed magnetic fields are found to
be amplified greatly by the convective and zonal flows. The central columns of
strikingly slow rotation found in some of our progenitor hydrodynamic
simulations continue to be realized in some simulations to a lesser degree,
with such differential rotation arising from the redistribution of angular
momentum by the nonlinear convection and magnetic fields. We assess the
properties of the magnetic fields thus generated, the extent of convective
penetration, the magnitude of the differential rotation, and the excitation of
gravity waves within the radiative envelope.
