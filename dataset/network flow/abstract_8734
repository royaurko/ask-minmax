We review several competing chaining methods to estimate the supremum, the
diameter of the range or the modulus of continuity of a stochastic process in
terms of tail bounds of their two-dimensional distributions. Then we show how
they can be applied to obtain upper bounds for the growth of bounded sets under
the action of a stochastic flow.
