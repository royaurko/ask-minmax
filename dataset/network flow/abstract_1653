For a long time biologists have used visual representations of biochemical
networks to gain a quick overview of important structural properties. Recently
SBGN, the Systems Biology Graphical Notation, has been developed to standardise
the way in which such graphical maps are drawn in order to facilitate the
exchange of information. Its qualitative Process Diagrams (SBGN-PD) are based
on an implicit Process Flow Abstraction (PFA) that can also be used to
construct quantitative representations, which can be used for automated
analyses of the system. Here we explicitly describe the PFA that underpins
SBGN-PD and define attributes for SBGN-PD glyphs that make it possible to
capture the quantitative details of a biochemical reaction network. We
implemented SBGNtext2BioPEPA, a tool that demonstrates how such quantitative
details can be used to automatically generate working Bio-PEPA code from a
textual representation of SBGN-PD that we developed. Bio-PEPA is a process
algebra that was designed for implementing quantitative models of concurrent
biochemical reaction systems. We use this approach to compute the expected
delay between input and output using deterministic and stochastic simulations
of the MAPK signal transduction cascade. The scheme developed here is general
and can be easily adapted to other output formalisms.
