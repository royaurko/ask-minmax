We report STAR preliminary results on multi-strange baryon production in
Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV at RHIC. Its implication for the
formation of a new state of matter is discussed. The system size dependence on
the production of strange baryons is investigated to study the onset of strange
quark equilibration in the medium. The nuclear modification factor of Lambda,
Xi and Omega is also presented. Its suppression at p_T>3 GeV/c supports the
formation of a dense interacting medium at RHIC. The spectra of multi-strange
baryons reveal that within a hydro-inspired model, they may decouple prior than
lighter particles and that their flow may be mostly developed at a partonic
level. This idea is emphasized by the measurement of the v_2 of Xi+AntiXi and
Omega+AntiOmega whose behaviour is close to the Lambda+AntiLambda baryon
elliptic flow in the intermediate p_T region where a constituent quark scaling
of v_2 is observed.
