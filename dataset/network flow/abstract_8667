In this paper we compare the social network structure of people talking about
Crohn's disease, Cystic Fibrosis, and Type 1 diabetes on Facebook and Twitter.
We find that the Crohn's community's contributors are most emotional on
Facebook and Twitter and most negative on Twitter, while the T1D community's
communication network structure is most cohesive.
