In this paper, we propose a scheme by which banks can collect and verify
biometric data eg, fingerprints, directly from their customers and use it to
authenticate their transactions made through PoS/ ATM/ online console. We
propose building a network of computers called BioNet to allow such
transactions to be made online across the world. A BioNet server will be able
to do 4 million transactions per second using GPU.
