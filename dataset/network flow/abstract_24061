Competition is one of the most fundamental phenomena in physics, biology and
economics. Recent studies of the competition between innovations have
highlighted the influence of switching costs and interaction networks, but the
problem is still puzzling. We introduce a model that reveals a novel
multi-percolation process, which governs the struggle of innovations trying to
penetrate a market. We find that innovations thrive as long as they percolate
in a population, and one becomes dominant when it is the only one that
percolates. Besides offering a theoretical framework to understand the
diffusion of competing innovations in social networks, our results are also
relevant to model other problems such as opinion formation, political
polarization, survival of languages and the spread of health behavior.
