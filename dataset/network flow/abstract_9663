Cognitive radio has been widely considered as one of the prominent solutions
to tackle the spectrum scarcity. While the majority of existing research has
focused on single-band cognitive radio, multiband cognitive radio represents
great promises towards implementing efficient cognitive networks compared to
single-based networks. Multiband cognitive radio networks (MB-CRNs) are
expected to significantly enhance the network's throughput and provide better
channel maintenance by reducing handoff frequency. Nevertheless, the wideband
front-end and the multiband spectrum access impose a number of challenges yet
to overcome. This paper provides an in-depth analysis on the recent
advancements in multiband spectrum sensing techniques, their limitations, and
possible future directions to improve them. We study cooperative communications
for MB-CRNs to tackle a fundamental limit on diversity and sampling. We also
investigate several limits and tradeoffs of various design parameters for
MB-CRNs. In addition, we explore the key MB-CRNs performance metrics that
differ from the conventional metrics used for single-band based networks.
