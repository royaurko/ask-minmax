We describe the structure of connected graphs with the minimum and maximum
average distance, radius, diameter, betweenness centrality, efficiency and
resistance distance, given their order and size. We find tight bounds on these
graph qualities for any arbitrary number of nodes and edges and analytically
derive the form and properties of such networks.
