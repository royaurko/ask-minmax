We study the influence of complex graphs on the metastability and fixation
properties of a set of evolutionary processes. In the framework of evolutionary
game theory, where the fitness and selection are frequency-dependent and vary
with the population composition, we analyze the dynamics of snowdrift games
(characterized by a metastable coexistence state) on scale-free networks. Using
an effective diffusion theory in the weak selection limit, we demonstrate how
the scale-free structure affects the system's metastable state and leads to
anomalous fixation. In particular, we analytically and numerically show that
the probability and mean time of fixation are characterized by stretched
exponential behaviors with exponents depending on the network's degree
distribution.
