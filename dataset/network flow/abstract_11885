The structural cohesion model is a powerful theoretical conception of
cohesion in social groups, but its diffusion in empirical literature has been
hampered by operationalization and computational problems. In this paper we
start from the classic definition of structural cohesion as the minimum number
of actors who need to be removed in a network in order to disconnect it, and
extend it by using average node connectivity as a finer grained measure of
cohesion. We present useful heuristics for computing structural cohesion that
allow a speed-up of one order of magnitude over the algorithms currently
available. We analyze three large collaboration networks (co-maintenance of
Debian packages, co-contributorship in Nuclear Theory and High-Energy Theory) and
show how our approach can help researchers measure structural cohesion in
relatively large networks. We also introduce a novel graphical representation
of the structural cohesion analysis to quickly spot differences across
networks.
