The discontinuous shear thickening (DST) of dense suspensions is a remarkable
phenomenon in which the viscosity can increase by several orders of magnitude
at a critical shear rate. It has the appearance of a first order phase
transition between two hypothetical "states" that we have recently identified
as Stokes flows with lubricated or frictional contacts, respectively. Here we
extend the analogy further by means of novel stress-controlled simulations and
show the existence of a non-monotonic steady-state flow curve analogous to a
non-monotonic equation of state. While we associate DST with an S-shaped flow
curve, at volume fractions above the shear jamming transition the frictional
state loses flowability and the flow curve reduces to an arch, permitting the
system to flow only at small stresses. Whereas a thermodynamic transition leads
to phase separation in the coexistence region, we observe a uniform shear flow
all along the thickening transition. A stability analysis suggests that uniform
shear may be mechanically stable for the small Reynolds numbers and system
sizes in a rheometer.
