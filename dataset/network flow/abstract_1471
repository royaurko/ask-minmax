In this paper, the problem of allocating users to radio resources (i.e.,
subcarriers) in the downlink of an OFDMA cellular network is addressed. We
consider a multi-cellular environment with a realistic interference model and a
margin adaptive approach, i.e., we aim at minimizing total transmission power
while maintaining a certain given rate for each user.
  The computational complexity issues of the resulting model is discussed and
proving that the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense. Heuristic approaches,
based on network flow models, that finds optima under suitable conditions, or
"reasonably good" solutions in the general case are presented. Computational
experiences show that, in a comparison with a commercial state-of-the-art
optimization solver, the proposed algorithms are effective in terms of solution
quality and CPU times.
