Cell motility and tissue morphogenesis depend crucially on the dynamic
remodelling of actomyosin networks. An actomyosin network consists of an actin
polymer network connected by crosslinker proteins and motor protein myosins
that generate internal stresses on the network. A recent discovery shows that
for a range of experimental parameters, actomyosin networks contract to
clusters with a power-law size distribution [Alvarado J. et al. (2013) Nature
Physics 9 591]. Here, we argue that actomyosin networks can exhibit robust
critical signature without fine-tuning because the dynamics of the system can
be mapped onto a modified version of percolation with trapping (PT), which is
known to show critical behaviour belonging to the static percolation
universality class without the need of fine-tuning of a control parameter. We
further employ our PT model to generate experimentally testable predictions.
