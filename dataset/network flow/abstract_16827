We consider the following problem: Given a finite set of straight line
segments in the plane, determine the positions of a minimal number of points on
the segments, from which guards can see all segments. This problem can be
interpreted as looking for a minimal number of locations of policemen, guards,
cameras or other sensors, that can observe a network of streets, corridors,
tunnels, tubes, etc. We show that the problem is strongly NP-complete even for
a set of segments with a cubic graph structure, but in P for tree structures.
