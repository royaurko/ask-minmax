Recent results establish the optimality of interference alignment to approach
the Shannon capacity of interference networks at high SNR. However, the extent
to which interference can be aligned over a finite number of signalling
dimensions remains unknown. Another important concern for interference
alignment schemes is the requirement of global channel knowledge. In this work
we provide examples of iterative algorithms that utilize the reciprocity of
wireless networks to achieve interference alignment with only local channel
knowledge at each node. These algorithms also provide numerical insights into
the feasibility of interference alignment that are not yet available in theory.
