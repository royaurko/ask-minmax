This paper analyzes the pricing of transit traffic in wireless peer-to-peer
networks using the concepts of direct and indirect network externalities. We
first establish that without any pricing mechanism, congestion externalities
overwhelm other network effects in a wireless data network. We show that
peering technology will mitigate the congestion and allow users to take
advantage of more the positive network externalities. However, without pricing,
the peering equilibrium breaks down just like a bucket brigade made up of
free-riding agents. With pricing and perfect competition, a peering equilibrium
is possible and allows many more users on the network at the same time.
However, the congestion externality is still a problem, so peering organized
through a club may be the best solution.
