Shotgun proteomics is a high-throughput technology used to identify unknown
proteins in a complex mixture. At the heart of this process is a prediction
task, the spectrum identification problem, in which each fragmentation spectrum
produced by a shotgun proteomics experiment must be mapped to the peptide
(protein subsequence) which generated the spectrum. We propose a new algorithm
for spectrum identification, based on dynamic Bayesian networks, which
significantly outperforms the de-facto standard tools for this task: SEQUEST
and Mascot.
