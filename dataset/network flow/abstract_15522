Recently, Grid Computing Systems have provided wide integrated use of
resources. Grid computing systems provide the ability to share, select and
aggregate distributed resources as computers, storage systems or other devices
in an integrated way. Grid computing systems have solved many problems in
science, engineering and commerce fields. In this paper we introduce a
self-recognition algorithm for grid network and introduced this algorithm to
have exclusive management control on the autonomic grid networks. This
algorithm is base on binomial heap to allocate and recognition any node in the
grid. We try to using this algorithm in advisor labor law software application
as case study and shown in this application how to use this method for any
advisor application on the network. By this implementation model shown this
method can get better answer to any question as a best labor law advisor.
