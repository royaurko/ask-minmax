Forced turbulence combined with the effect of rotation and shear flow is
studied. In a previous paper [Leprovost and Kim, PRE in press (2008)], we
considered the case where the shear and the rotation are perpendicular. Here,
we consider the complementary case of parallel rotation and shear, elucidating
how rotation and flow shear influence the generation of shear flow (e.g. the
direction of energy cascade), turbulence level, transport of particles and
momentum. In contrast with the case where rotation and shear are perpendicular,
we found that rotation affects turbulence amplitude only for very rapid
rotation ($\Omega \gg \A$) where it reduces slightly the anisotropy due to
shear flow. Also, concerning the transport properties of turbulence, we find
that rotation affects only the transport of particle and only for rapid
rotation, leading to an almost isotropic transport (whereas, in the case of
perpendicular rotation and shear, rotation favors isotropic transport even for
slow rotation).
