We desingularise the union of $3$ Grim paraboloids along Costa-Hoffman-Meeks
surfaces in order to obtain what we believe to be the first examples in
$\Bbb{R}^3$ of complete embedded translating solitons of the mean curvature
flow of arbitrary non-trivial genus. This solves a problem posed by Mart\'in,
Savas-Halilaj and Smoczyk.
