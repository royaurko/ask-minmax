A new framework for two-fluids flow using a Finite Element/Level Set method
is presented and verified through the simulation of the rising of a bubble in a
viscous fluid. This model is then enriched to deal with vesicles (which mimic
red blood cells mechanical behavior) by introducing a Lagrange multiplier to
constrain the inextensibility of the membrane. Moreover, high order polynomial
approximation is used to increase the accuracy of the simulations. A validation
of this model is finally presented on known behaviors of vesicles under flow
such as "tank treading" and tumbling motions.
