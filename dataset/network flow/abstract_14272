t has been shown that the flow of a simple liquid over a solid surface can
violate the so-called no-slip boundary condition. We investigate the flow of
polar liquids, water and glycerol, on a hydrophilic Pyrex surface and a
hydrophobic surface made of a Self-Assembled Monolayer of OTS
(octadecyltrichlorosilane) on Pyrex. We use a Dynamic Surface Force Apparatus
(DSFA) which allows one to study the flow of a liquid film confined between two
surfaces with a nanometer resolution. No-slip boundary conditions are found for
both fluids on hydrophilic surfaces only. Significant slip is found on the
hydrophobic surfaces, with a typical length of one hundred nanometers.
