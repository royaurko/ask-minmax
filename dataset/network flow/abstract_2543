Any network studied in the literature is inevitably just a sampled
representative of its real-world analogue. Additionally, network sampling is
lately often applied to large networks to allow for their faster and more
efficient analysis. Nevertheless, the changes in network structure introduced
by sampling are still far from understood. In this paper, we study the presence
of characteristic groups of nodes in sampled social and information networks.
We consider different network sampling techniques including random node and
link selection, network exploration and expansion. We first observe that the
structure of social networks reveals densely linked groups like communities,
while the structure of information networks is better described by modules of
structurally equivalent nodes. However, despite these notable differences, the
structure of sampled networks exhibits stronger characterization by
community-like groups than the original networks, irrespective of their type
and consistently across various sampling techniques. Hence, rich community
structure commonly observed in social and information networks is to some
extent merely an artifact of sampling.
