We consider a one-dimensional kinetic model of granular media in the case
where the interaction potential is quadratic. Taking advan- tage of a simple
first integral, we can use a reformulation (equivalent to the initial kinetic
model for classical solutions) which allows mea- sure solutions. This
reformulation has a Wasserstein gradient flow structure (on a possibly infinite
product of spaces of measures) for a convex energy which enables us to prove
global in time well-posedness.
