We prove quantitative estimates on flows of ordinary differential equations
with vector field with gradient given by a singular integral of an $L^1$
function. Such estimates allow to prove existence, uniqueness, quantitative
stability and compactness for the flow, going beyond the $BV$ theory. We
illustrate the related well-posedness theory of Lagrangian solutions to the
continuity and transport equations.
