High frequency velocity oscillations were observed in the spectral lines Fe I
543.45nm and 543.29nm, using 2D spectroscopy with a Fabry- Perot and speckle
reconstruction, at the VTT in Tenerife. We investigate the radial component of
waves with frequencies in the range 8 - 22mHz in the internetwork, network and
a pore. We find that the occurrence of waves do not show any preference on
location and are equally distributed over down-flows and up-flows, regardless
of the activity of the observed area in the line of Fe I 543.45nm. The waves
observed in the lower formed line of Fe I 543.29nm seem to appear
preferentially over down-flows.
