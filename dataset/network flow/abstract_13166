We report on STAR analyses of p-lambda, p_bar-lambda_bar, p-lambda_bar,
p_bar-lambda, p-p_bar and pi-Xi correlations in Au+Au collisions at
sqrt(S_NN)=62 and 200 GeV. Measured source sizes in p(p_bar)-lambda(lambda_bar)
and p-p_bar are shown to be in qualitative agreement with flow expectations.
Interaction potential between p-lambda_bar, p_bar-lambda was investigated by
measuring scattering length, thus showing that correlation analyses in
heavy-ion collisions can be used to study strong interaction potential between
hadrons. We present also analyses of pi-Xi correlations addressing
independently on previous measurements the issue of Xi flow in heavy-ion
collisions.
