This work weakens well-known consistency models using graphs that capture
applications' characteristics. The weakened models not only respect application
semantic, but also yield a performance benefit. We introduce a notion of
dependency graphs, which specify relations between events that are important
with respect to application semantic, and then weaken traditional consistency
models (e.g., causal consistency) using these graphs. Particularly, we consider
two types of graphs: intra-process and inter-process dependency graphs, where
intra-process dependency graphs specify how events in a single process are
related, and inter-process dependency graphs specify how events across multiple
processes are related. Then, based on these two types of graphs, we define new
consistency model, namely {\em application-aware} consistency. We also discuss
why such application-aware consistency can be useful in social network
applications.
  This is a work in progress, and we present early ideas regarding
application-aware consistency here.
