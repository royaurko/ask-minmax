Recently, self-similarity of complex networks have attracted much attention.
Fractal dimension of complex network is an open issue. Hub repulsion plays an
important role in fractal topologies. This paper models the repulsion among the
nodes in the complex networks in calculation of the fractal dimension of the
networks. The Coulomb's law is adopted to represent the repulse between two
nodes of the network quantitatively. A new method to calculate the fractal
dimension of complex networks is proposed. The Sierpinski triangle network and
some real complex networks are investigated. The results are illustrated to
show that the new model of self-similarity of complex networks is reasonable
and efficient.
