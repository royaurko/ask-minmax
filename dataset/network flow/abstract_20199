Halo mergers and shock waves play a crucial role in the process of
hierarchical clustering. Hydrodynamical simulations are the principal
investigation tool in this field for theoreticians, and predict that a
by-product of cluster formation and virialisation is the injection of
turbulence in the cosmic flow. Here I will summarise results from a series of
recent works focused on the main stirring mechanisms acting on baryons: minor
and major cluster mergers, and curved shocks. Unresolved turbulence has been
treated with the implementation of a subgrid scale model. Recent simulations
show that the production of turbulence differs significantly for the warm-hot
intergalactic medium (WHIM) and the intra-cluster medium (ICM), because of
different stirring mechanisms acting in the two gas phases.
