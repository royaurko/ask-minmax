In this paper, we study the long-time behavior of a fluid particle immersed
in a turbulent fluid driven by a diffusion with jumps, that is, a Feller
process associated with a non-local operator. We derive the law of large
numbers and central limit theorem for the evolution process of the tracked
fluid particle in the cases when the driving process: (i) has periodic
coefficients, (ii) is ergodic or (iii) is a class of L\'evy processes. The
presented results generalize the classical and well-known results for fluid
flows driven by elliptic diffusion processes.
