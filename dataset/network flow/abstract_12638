Restoration of macroscopic isotropy has been investigated in (d+1)-simplex
fractal conductor networks via exact real space renormalization group
transformations. Using some theorems of fixed point theory, it has been shown
very rigoroursly that the macroscopic conductivity becomes isotropic for large
scales and anisotropy vanishes with a scaling exponent which is computed
exactly for arbitrary values of d and decimation numbers b=2,3,4 and
 5.
