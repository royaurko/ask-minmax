Wealthy individuals may be less tempted to defect than those with
comparatively low payoffs. To take this into consideration, we introduce
coevolutionary success-driven multigames in structured populations. While the
core game is always the weak prisoner's dilemma, players whose payoffs from the
previous round exceed a threshold adopt only a minimally low temptation to
defect in the next round. Along with the strategies, the perceived strength of
the social dilemma thus coevolves with the success of each individual player.
We show that the lower the threshold for using the small temptation to defect,
the more the evolution of cooperation is promoted. Importantly, the promotion
of cooperation is not simply due to a lower average temptation to defect, but
rather due to a dynamically reversed direction of invasion along the interfaces
that separate cooperators and defectors on regular networks. Conversely, on
irregular networks, in the absence of clear invasion fronts, the promotion of
cooperation is due to intermediate-degree players. At sufficiently low
threshold values, these players accelerate the erosion of defectors and
significantly shorten the fixation time towards more cooperative stationary
states. Coevolutionary multigames could thus be the new frontier for the swift
resolution of social dilemmas.
