Recent advances in wideband impulse technology, low power communication along
with unlicensed band have enabled ultra wide band (UWB) as a leading technology
for future wireless applications. This paper outlines the applications of
emerging UWB technology in a private and commercial sector. We further talk
about UWB technology for a wireless body area network (WBAN).
