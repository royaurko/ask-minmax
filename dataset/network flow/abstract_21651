It is pointed out that Higgs bootstrap is inherent in the top-condensate
models of Nambu and Bardeen et al in that the ladder sum of Higgs pole diagrams
in one channel reproduces a Higgs pole in the crossed-channel. This result is
exact whenever color flows simultaneously in both channel directions e.g. for
N(sub c)=1. Bootstrap solutions for the Higgs boson mass are obtained that are
compatible with the condensate models such as the top-color models which imply
large top-Yukawa couplings at the top mass.
