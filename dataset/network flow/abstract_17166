The paper presents academic content, delivery and assessment mechanisms used,
available resources including initial lessons from teaching Networked Storage
Technology as a special topics course to students enrolled in two specific
programs - IT and CS. The course is based on the EMC s vendor-neutral Storage
Technology Fundamentals course. Furthermore, this manuscript provides a
detailed review of how the course fits into our curriculum, particularly, how
it helps achieving the 2008 ABET assessment requirements.
