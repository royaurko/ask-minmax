It was noticed in the past that, to avoid physical inconsistencies, in
Marcatili's lossless tapers through-flowing waves must be drastically different
from standing waves. First, we reconfirm this by means of numerical results
based on an extended BPM algorithm. Next, we show that this apparently
surprising behavior is a straightforward fallout of Maxwell's equations. Very
similar remarks apply to Gaussian beams in a homogeneous medium. As a
consequence, Gaussian beams are shown to carry reactive powers, and their
active power distributions depart slightly from their standard pictures.
Similar conclusions hold for free-space modes expressed in terms of Bessel
functions.
