Test modes on turbulent magnetized plasmas are studied taking into account
the ion trapping that characterizes the E x B drift in the background
turbulence. We show that trappyng provides the physical mechanism for the
formation of large scale potential structures (inverse cascade) observed in
drift turbulence. Trapping combined with the motion of the potential with the
diamagnetic velocity determines ion flows in opposite directions, which reduce
the growth rate and eventually damps the drift modes. It also determine
transitory zonal flow modes in connection with compressibility effect due to
the polarization drift in the background turbulence.
