Many network applications rely on the synchronization of coupled oscillators.
For example, such synchronization can provide networked devices with a common
temporal reference necessary for coordinating actions or decoding transmitted
messages. In this paper, we study the problem of using distributed control to
achieve both phase and frequency synchronization of a network of coupled
heterogeneous nonlinear oscillators. Not only do our controllers guarantee zero
phase error in steady state under arbitrary frequency heterogeneity, but they
also require little knowledge of the oscillator nonlinearities and network
topology. Furthermore, we provide a global convergence analysis, in the absence
of noise and propagation delay, for the resulting nonlinear system whose phase
vector evolves on the n-torus.
