The linear and renormalized nonlinear analysis of the temporal evolution of
drift-type modes in plasma flows with strong time-varying velocity shear is
developed. Analysis is performed in the time domain without spectral
decomposition in time and admits time variation of the flow velocity with time
scales which may be comparable with turbulent time scales. 52.35.Ra
