Recent data from the NA49 experiment on directed and elliptic flow for Pb+Pb
reactions at CERN-SPS are compared to calculations with a hadron-string
transport model, the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD)
model.
  The rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the directed and elliptic
flow, i.e. $v_1$ and $v_2$, are investigated. The flow results are compared to
data at three different centrality bins. Generally, a reasonable agreement
between the data and the calculations is found. Furthermore, the energy
excitation functions of $v_1$ and $v_2$ from $E_{\rm beam}=90A$ MeV to $E_{\rm
cm}=200A$ GeV are explored within the UrQMD framework and discussed in the
context of the available data. It is found that, in the energy regime below
$E_{\rm beam}\leq 10A$ GeV, the inclusion of nuclear potentials is necessary to
describe the data. Above $40A$ GeV beam energy, the UrQMD model starts to
underestimate the elliptic flow. Around the same energy the slope of the
rapidity spectra of the proton directed flow develops negative values. This
effect is known as the third flow component ("antiflow") and cannot be
reproduced by the transport model. These differences can possibly be explained
by assuming a phase transition from hadron gas to quark gluon plasma at about
$40A$ GeV.
