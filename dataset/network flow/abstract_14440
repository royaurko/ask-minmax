Employing daily wind data from the ECMWF, we perform passive particle
advection to estimate the Lagrangian velocity correlation functions (LVCF)
associated with the midlatitude tropospheric flow. In particular we decompose
the velocity field into time mean and transient (or eddy) components to better
understand the nature of the LVCF's. A closely related quantity, the absolute
dispersion (AD) is also examined.
  Given the anisotropy of the flow, meridional and zonal characteristics are
considered separately. The zonal LVCF is seen to be non-exponential. In fact,
for intermediate timescales it can either be interpreted as a power law of the
form $\tau^{-\alpha}$ with $ 0<\alpha<1$ or as the sum of exponentials with
differing timescales - both interpretations being equivalent. More importantly
the long time correlations in the zonal flow result in a superdiffusive zonal
AD regime. On the other hand, the meridional LVCF decays rapidly to zero.
Before approaching zero the meridional LVCF shows a region of negative
correlation - a consequence of the presence of planetary scale Rossby waves. As
a result the meridional AD, apart from showing the classical asymptotic
ballistic and diffusive regimes, displays transient subdiffusive behaviour.
