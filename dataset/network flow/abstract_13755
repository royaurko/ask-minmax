The boundary layers of weakly-magnetized white dwarfs (WDs) accreting at
rates <=10^16 g/s are radially extended, hot, optically-thin, and they advect
some of their internally-dissipated energy (Narayan & Popham 1993). Motivated
by this, I construct here idealized spectral models of an Advection-Dominated
Accretion Flow (ADAF) around a WD, for application to quiescent Dwarf Novae
(DN). The Bremsstrahlung cooling of the gas in the ADAF, with temperatures
ranging from a few keV to a few tens of keV, can account for the X-ray emission
properties of quiescent DN. If the energy advected by the flow is thermalized
in the WD atmosphere, the resulting emission from the entire stellar surface
(blackbody of temperature T_eff ~ 5 eV) outshines the X-ray luminosity
substantially. This extreme-UV component provides a flux in the 0.055-0.28 keV
band which is sufficient to power the strong HeII lambda4686 emission lines of
quiescent DN by photoionization of the disk material. Reprocessing of the ADAF
X-ray emission by a cold outer thin disk could also lead to an observable iron
Kalpha fluorescence emission line, which can be used to probe the geometry of
the accretion flow. Existing observational data indicate that the presence of
ADAFs in quiescent DN is not ubiquitous, while future observations, in
particular with the X-ray satellites Chandra and XMM-Newton, have the potential
to detect signatures of the hot flow in promising candidates.
