Taylor-Couette (TC) flow is used to probe the hydrodynamical stability of
astrophysical accretion disks. Experimental data on the subcritical stability
of TC are in conflict about the existence of turbulence (cf. Ji et al. Nature,
444, 343-346 (2006) and Paoletti et al., A$\&$A, 547, A64 (2012)), with
discrepancies attributed to end-plate effects. In this paper we numerically
simulate TC flow with axially periodic boundary conditions to explore the
existence of sub-critical transitions to turbulence when no end-plates are
present. We start the simulations with a fully turbulent state in the unstable
regime and enter the linearly stable regime by suddenly starting a
(stabilizing) outer cylinder rotation. The shear Reynolds number of the
turbulent initial state is up to $Re_s \sim10^5$ and the radius ratio is
$\eta=0.714$. The stabilization causes the system to behave as a damped
oscillator and correspondingly the turbulence decays. The evolution of the
torque and turbulent kinetic energy is analysed and the periodicity and damping
of the oscillations are quantified and explained as a function of shear
Reynolds number. Though the initially turbulent flow state decays,
surprisingly, the system is found to absorb energy during this decay.
