Structural, vibrational and thermal properties of densified sodium silicate
(NS2) are investigated with classical molecular dynamics simulations of the
glass and the liquid state. A systematic investigation of the glass structure
with respect to density was performed. We observe a repolymerization of the
network manifested by a transition from a tetrahedral to an octahedral silicon
environment, the decrease of the amount of non-bridging oxygen atoms and the
appearance of three-fold coordinated oxygen atoms (triclusters). Anomalous
changes in the medium range order are observed, the first sharp diffraction
peak showing a minimum of its full-width at half maximum according to density.
The previously reported vibrational trends in densified glasses are observed,
such as the shift of the Boson peak intensity to higher frequencies and the
decrease of its intensity. Finally, we show that the thermal behavior of the
liquid can be reproduced by the Birch-Murnaghan equation of states, thus
allowing us to compute the isothermal compressibility.
