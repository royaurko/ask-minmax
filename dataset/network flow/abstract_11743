Online Social Networks are becoming the most important "places" where people
share information about their lives. With the increasing concern that users
have about privacy, most social networks offer ways to control the privacy of
the user. Unfortunately, we believe that current privacy settings are not as
effective as users might think.
  In this paper, we highlight this problem focusing on one of the most popular
social networks, Facebook. In particular, we show how easy it is to retrieve
information that a user might have set as (and hence thought as) "private". As
a case study, we focus on retrieving the list of friends for users that did set
this information as "hidden" (to non-friends). We propose four different
strategies to achieve this goal, and we evaluate them. The results of our
thorough experiments show the feasibility of our strategies as well as their
effectiveness: our approach is able to retrieve a significant percentage of the
names of the "hidden" friends: i.e., some 25% on average, and more than 70% for
some users.
