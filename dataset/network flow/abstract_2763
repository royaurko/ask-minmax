We report the electrical responses of thin and thick single-walled carbon
nanotube (SWNT) networks to N2 and O2 adsorption. In the surface desorbed state
exposure to N2 and O2 provide an increase in conductance of thin and thick SWNT
networks. The increase in conductance of both thin and thick networks is of a
greater magnitude during O2 exposure rather than N2 exposure. Thin networks
exhibit a greater response to both O2 and N2 rather than thick networks. This
is likely a result of the increased semiconducting nature of thin SWNT
networks.
