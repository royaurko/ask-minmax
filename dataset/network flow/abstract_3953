This study seeks to better understand the network characteristics of client
support teams by analyzing the teams' e-mail communication networks and
comparing it to client organization's satisfaction. In collaboration with a
large service provider we studied the impact of network properties on the
satisfaction of client organizations. In particular, we found that social
network metrics correlate with client satisfaction as measured by Net Promoter
Score (NPS). A Communication Score Card is suggested as a dashboard to
continuously measure client satisfaction, illustrating that data-driven
analysis might help improving service providers' service quality management.
