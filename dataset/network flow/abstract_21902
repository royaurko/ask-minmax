Results of numerical simulations of a recently derived most general
dissipative-dispersive PDE describing evolution of a film flowing down an
inclined plane are presented. They indicate that a novel complex type of
spatiotemporal patterns can exist for strange attractors of nonequilibrium
systems. It is suggested that real-life experiments satisfying the validity
conditions of the theory are possible: the required sufficiently viscous
liquids are readily available.
