Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) networks were
expected to be the main Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) technology that
provided several services such as data, voice, and video services including
different classes of Quality of Services (QoS), which in turn were defined by
IEEE 802.16 standard. Scheduling in WiMAX became one of the most challenging
issues, since it was responsible for distributing available resources of the
network among all users; this leaded to the demand of constructing and
designing high efficient scheduling algorithms in order to improve the network
utilization, to increase the network throughput, and to minimize the end-to-end
delay. In this study, we presenedt a simulation study to measure the
performance of several scheduling algorithms in WiMAX, which were Strict
Priority algorithm, Round-Robin (RR), Weighted Round Robin (WRR), Weighted Fair
Queuing (WFQ), Self-Clocked Fair (SCF), and Diff-Serv Algorithm.
