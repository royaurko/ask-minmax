Despite the large quantity of information available, thorough researches in
various biological databases are still needed in order to reconstruct and
understand the steps that lead to known or new phenomena. By using
protein-protein interaction networks and algorithms to extract relevant
interconnections among proteins of interest, it is possible to assemble
subnetworks from global interactomes. Using these extracted networks it is
possible to use algorithms to predict signal directions while activation and
inhibition effects can be predicted using RNA interference screenings. The
result of this approach is the automatic generation of boolean networks. This
way of modelling dynamical systems allows the discovery of steady states and
the prediction of stimuli response.
