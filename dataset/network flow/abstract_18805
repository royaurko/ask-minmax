Thanks to improvements in wireless communication technologies and increasing
computing power in hand-held devices, mobile ad hoc networks are becoming an
ever-more present reality. Coordination languages are expected to become
important means in supporting this type of interaction. To this extent we argue
the interest of the Bach coordination language as a middleware that can handle
and react to context changes as well as cope with unpredictable physical
interruptions that occur in opportunistic network connections. More concretely,
our proposal is based on blackboard rules that model declaratively the actions
to be taken once the blackboard content reaches a predefined state, but also
that manage the engagement and disengagement of hosts and transient sharing of
blackboards. The idea of reactiveness has already been introduced in previous
work, but as will be appreciated by the reader, this article presents a new
perspective, more focused on a declarative setting.
