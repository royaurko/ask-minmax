In the note two errors in Low and Lapsley's article "Optimization Flow
Control, I: Basic Algorithm and Convergence", "IEEE/ACM Transactions on
Networking", 7(6), pp. 861-874, 1999, are shown. Because of these errors the
proofs of both theorems presented in the article are incomplete and some
assessments are wrong.
