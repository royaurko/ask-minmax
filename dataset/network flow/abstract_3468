We consider a multi-class single server queueing network as a model of a
packet switching network. The rates packets are sent into this network are
controlled by queues which act as congestion windows. By considering a sequence
of congestion controls, we analyse a sequence of stationary queueing networks.
In this asymptotic regime, the service capacity of the network remains constant
and the sequence of congestion controllers act to exploit the network's capcity
by increasing the number of packets within the network. We show the stationary
throughput of routes on this sequence of networks converges to an allocation
that maximizes aggregate utility subject to the network's capacity constraints.
To perform this analysis, we require that our utility functions satisfy an
exponential concavity condition. This family of utilities includes weighted
$\alpha$-fair utilities for $\alpha >1$.
