In this note we give a simple proof of the fact that the determinant of
Laplace operator in smooth metric over compact Riemann surfaces of arbitrary
genus $g$ monotonously grows under the normalized Ricci flow. Together with
results of Hamilton that under the action of the normalized Ricci flow the
smooth metric tends asymptotically to metric of constant curvature for $g\geq
1$, this leads to a simple proof of Osgood-Phillips-Sarnak theorem stating that
that within the class of smooth metrics with fixed conformal class and fixed
volume the determinant of Laplace operator is maximal on metric of constant
curvatute.
