In this paper, we investigate the statistical features of the weighted
international-trade network. By finding the maximum weight spanning trees for
this network we make the extraction of the truly relevant connections forming
the network's backbone. We discuss the role of large-sized countries (strongest
economies) in the tree. Finally, we compare the topological properties of this
backbone to the maximum weight spanning trees obtained from the gravity model
of trade. We show that the model correctly reproduces the backbone of the
real-world economy.
