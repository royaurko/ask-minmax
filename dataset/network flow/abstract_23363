Dynamical systems with translational or rotational symmetry arise frequently
in studies of spatially extended physical systems, such as Navier-Stokes flows
on periodic domains. In these cases, it is natural to express the state of the
fluid in terms of a Fourier series truncated to a finite number of modes. Here,
we study a 4-dimensional model with chaotic dynamics and SO(2) symmetry similar
to those that appear in fluid dynamics problems. A crucial step in the analysis
of such a system is symmetry reduction. We use the model to illustrate
different symmetry-reduction techniques. Its relative equilibria are
conveniently determined by rewriting the dynamics in terms of a
symmetry-invariant polynomial basis. However, for the analysis of its chaotic
dynamics, the `method of slices', which is applicable to very high-dimensional
problems, is preferable. We show that a Poincar\'e section taken on the `slice'
can be used to further reduce this flow to what is for all practical purposes a
unimodal map. This enables us to systematically determine all relative periodic
orbits and their symbolic dynamics up to any desired period. We then present
cycle averaging formulas adequate for systems with continuous symmetry and use
them to compute dynamical averages using relative periodic orbits. The
convergence of such computations is discussed.
