To meet the demands of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) where data are usually
aggregated at a single source prior to transmitting to any distant user, there
is a need to establish a tree structure inside to aggregate data. In this
paper, an adaptive energy aware data aggregation tree (AEDT) is proposed. The
proposed tree uses the maximum energy available node as the data aggregator
node. The tree incorporates sleep and awake technology where the communicating
node and the parent node are only in awake state rest all the nodes go to sleep
state saving the network energy and enhancing the network lifetime. When the
traffic load crosses the threshold value, then the packets are accepted
adaptively according to the communication capacity of the parent node. The
proposed tree maintains a memory table which stores the value of each selected
path. Path selection is based on shortest path algorithm where the node with
highest available energy is always selected as forwarding node. By simulation
results, we show that our proposed tree enhances network lifetime minimizes
energy consumption and achieves good delivery ratio with reduced delay.
