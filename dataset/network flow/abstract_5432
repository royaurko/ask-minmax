The collective dynamics of coupled two-dimensional chaotic maps on complex
networks is known to exhibit a rich variety of emergent properties which
crucially depend on the underlying network topology. We investigate the
collective motion of Chirikov standard maps interacting with time delay through
directed links of Gene Regulatory Network of bacterium Escherichia Coli.
Departures from strongly chaotic behavior of the isolated maps are studied in
relation to different coupling forms and strengths. At smaller coupling
intensities the network induces stable and coherent emergent dynamics. The
unstable behavior appearing with increase of coupling strength remains confined
within a connected sub-network. For the appropriate coupling, network exhibits
statistically robust self-organized dynamics in a weakly chaotic regime.
