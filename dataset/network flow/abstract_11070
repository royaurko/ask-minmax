We propose a novel network growth model coupled with the competition
interaction to simulate macroevolution. Our work shows that the competition
plays an important role in macroevolution and it is more rational to describe
the interaction between species by network structures. Our model presents a
complete picture of the development of phyla and the splitting process. It is
found that periodic mass extinction occurred in our networks without any
extraterrestrial factors and the lifetime distribution of species is very close
to fossil record. We also perturb networks with two scenarios of mass
extinctions on different hierarchic levels in order to study their recovery.
