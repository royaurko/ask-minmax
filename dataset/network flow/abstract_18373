In densely populated urban areas WiFi routers form a tightly interconnected
proximity network that can be exploited as a substrate for the spreading of
malware able to launch massive fraudulent attack and affect entire urban areas
WiFi networks. In this paper we consider several scenarios for the deployment
of malware that spreads solely over the wireless channel of major urban areas
in the US. We develop an epidemiological model that takes into consideration
prevalent security flaws on these routers. The spread of such a contagion is
simulated on real-world data for geo-referenced wireless routers. We uncover a
major weakness of WiFi networks in that most of the simulated scenarios show
tens of thousands of routers infected in as little time as two weeks, with the
majority of the infections occurring in the first 24 to 48 hours. We indicate
possible containment and prevention measure to limit the eventual harm of such
an attack.
