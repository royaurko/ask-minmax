Online Social Networks (OSNs) have exploded in terms of scale and scope over
the last few years. The unprecedented growth of these networks present
challenges in terms of system design and maintenance. One way to cope with this
is by partitioning such large networks and assigning these partitions to
different machines. However, social networks possess unique properties that
make the partitioning problem non-trivial. The main contribution of this paper
is to understand different properties of social networks and how these
properties can guide the choice of a partitioning algorithm. Using large scale
measurements representing real OSNs, we first characterize different properties
of social networks, and then we evaluate qualitatively different partitioning
methods that cover the design space. We expose different trade-offs involved
and understand them in light of properties of social networks. We show that a
judicious choice of a partitioning scheme can help improve performance.
