In the present paper, we reduce and enhance the scaled Gaussian width(SGW) by
30% from the normal SGW of the systems and see its effect on balance energy.
The scaled Gaussian width can be defined as the ratio of Gaussian width used
for any nuclei to the Gaussian width used for Au nuclei(i.e. 8.66 $fm^2$).
