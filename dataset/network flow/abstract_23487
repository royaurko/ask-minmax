We study nonlinear random resistor diode networks at the transition from the
non percolating to the directed percolating phase. The resistor-like bonds and
the diode-like bonds under forward bias voltage obey a generalized Ohm's law,
$V \sim I^r$. Based on general grounds as symmetries and relevance we develop a
field theoretic model. We focus on the average two-port resistance, which is
governed at the transition by the resistance exponent $\phi_r$. By employing
renormalization group methods we calculate $\phi_r$ for arbitrary $r$ to
one-loop order. Then we address the fractal dimensions characterizing directed
percolation clusters. Via considering distinct values of the nonlinearity $r$,
we determine the dimension of the red bonds, the chemical path and the backbone
to two-loop order.
