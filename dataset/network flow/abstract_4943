Dynamics of flexible non-Brownian fibers in shear flow at low-Reynolds-number
are analyzed numerically for a wide range of the ratios A of the fiber bending
force to the viscous drag force. Initially, the fibers are aligned with the
flow, and later they move in the plane perpendicular to the flow vorticity. A
surprisingly rich spectrum of different modes is observed when the value of A
is systematically changed, with sharp transitions between coiled and
straightening out modes, period-doubling bifurcations from periodic to
migrating solutions, irregular dynamics and chaos.
