The similarities between string percolation and Glasma results are
emphasized, special attention being paid to rapidity long range correlations,
ridge structure and elliptic flow. As the string density of high multiplicity
pp collisions at LHC energies has similar value as the corresponding to Au-Au
semi-central collisions at RHIC we also expect in pp collisions long rapidity
correlations and ridge structure, extended more than 8 units in rapidity.
