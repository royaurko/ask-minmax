These proceedings consist of a brief overview of the current understanding of
collective behavior in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In particular, recent
progress in understanding the implications of event-by-event fluctuations have
solved important puzzles in existing data -- the "ridge" and "shoulder"
phenomena of long-range two-particle correlations -- and have created an
exciting opportunity to tightly constrain theoretical models with many new
observables.
