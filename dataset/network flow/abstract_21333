Techniques for the evaluation of complex polynomials with one and two
variables are introduced. Polynomials arise in may areas such as control
systems, image and signal processing, coding theory, electrical networks, etc.,
and their evaluations are time consuming. This paper introduces new evaluation
algorithms that are straightforward with fewer arithmetic operations.
