In this article, we propose a growing network model based on an optimal
policy involving both topological and geographical measures. In this model, at
each time step, a new node, having randomly assigned coordinates in a $1 \times
1$ square, is added and connected to a previously existing node $i$, which
minimizes the quantity $r_i^2/k_i^\alpha$, where $r_i$ is the geographical
distance, $k_i$ the degree, and $\alpha$ a free parameter. The degree
distribution obeys a power-law form when $\alpha=1$, and an exponential form
when $\alpha=0$. When $\alpha$ is in the interval $(0,1)$, the network exhibits
a stretched exponential distribution. We prove that the average topological
distance increases in a logarithmic scale of the network size, indicating the
existence of the small-world property. Furthermore, we obtain the geographical
edge-length distribution, the total geographical length of all edges, and the
average geographical distance of the whole network. Interestingly, we found
that the total edge-length will sharply increase when $\alpha$ exceeds the
critical value $\alpha_c=1$, and the average geographical distance has an upper
bound independent of the network size. All the results are obtained
analytically with some reasonable approximations, which are well verified by
simulations.
