It has been recently shown (Fouxon et al. 2007) that, in the framework of
ideal granular hydrodynamics (IGHD), an initially smooth hydrodynamic flow of a
granular gas can produce an infinite gas density in a finite time. Exact
solutions that exhibit this property have been derived. Close to the
singularity, the granular gas pressure is finite and almost constant. This work
reports molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a freely cooling gas of nearly
elastically colliding hard disks, aimed at identifying the "attempted" density
blowup regime. The initial conditions of the simulated flow mimic those of one
particular solution of the IGHD equations that exhibits the density blowup. We
measure the hydrodynamic fields in the MD simulations and compare them with
predictions from the ideal theory. We find a remarkable quantitative agreement
between the two over an extended time interval, proving the existence of the
attempted blowup regime. As the attempted singularity is approached, the
hydrodynamic fields, as observed in the MD simulations, deviate from the
predictions of the ideal solution. To investigate the mechanism of breakdown of
the ideal theory near the singularity, we extend the hydrodynamic theory by
accounting separately for the gradient-dependent transport and for finite
density corrections.
