This paper provides the first study of a new dynamical instability in
superfluids. This instability is similar to the two-stream instability known to
operate in plasmas. It is analogous to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, but
has the distinguishing feature that the two fluids are interpenetrating. The
instability sets in once the relative flow between the two components of the
system reaches a critical level. Our analysis is based on the two-fluid
equations that have been used to model the dynamics of the outer core of a
neutron star, where superfluid neutrons are expected to coexist with
superconducting protons and relativistic electrons. These equations are
analogous to the standard Landau model for superfluid Helium. We study this
instability for two different model problems. First we analyze a local
dispersion relation for waves in a system where one fluid is at rest while the
other flows at a constant rate. This provides a proof of principle of the
existence of the two-stream instability for superfluids. Our second model
problem concerns two rotating fluids confined within an infinitesimally thin
spherical shell. The aim of this model is to assess whether the two-stream
instability may be relevant (perhaps as a trigger mechanism) for pulsar
glitches. Our results for this problem show that the entrainment effect could
provide a sufficiently strong coupling for the instability to set in at a
relative flow small enough to be astrophysically plausible.
