In this talk, I review how four dimensional stationary supergravity solutions
that are more general than spherically symmetric black holes emerge naturally
in the low energy description of BPS states in type II Calabi-Yau
compactifications. An explicit construction of multicenter solutions using
single center attractor flows as building blocks is presented, and some
interesting properties of these solutions are examined. We end with a brief
remark on non-BPS configurations.
