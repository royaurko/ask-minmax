We include spontaneous symmetry breaking into the functional renormalization
group (RG) equations for the irreducible vertices of Ginzburg-Landau theories
by augmenting these equations by a flow equation for the order parameter, which
is determined from the requirement that at each RG step the vertex with one
external leg vanishes identically. Using this strategy, we propose a simple
truncation of the coupled RG flow equations for the vertices in the broken
symmetry phase of the Ising universality class in D dimensions. Our truncation
yields the full momentum dependence of the self-energy Sigma (k) and
interpolates between lowest order perturbation theory at large momenta k and
the critical scaling regime for small k. Close to the critical point, our
method yields the self-energy in the scaling form Sigma (k) = k_c^2 sigma^{-}
(k | xi, k / k_c), where xi is the order parameter correlation length, k_c is
the Ginzburg scale, and sigma^{-} (x, y) is a dimensionless two-parameter
scaling function for the broken symmetry phase which we explicitly calculate
within our truncation.
