Routing, as a basic phenomena, by itself, has got umpteen scopes to analyse,
discuss and arrive at an optimal solution for the technocrats over years.
Routing is analysed based on many factors; few key constraints that decide the
factors are communication medium, time dependency, information source nature.
Parametric routing has become the requirement of the day, with some kind of
adaptation to the underlying network environment. Satellite constellations,
particularly LEO satellite constellations have become a reality in operational
to have a non-breaking voice/data communication around the world.Routing in
these constellations has to be treated in a non conventional way, taking their
network geometry into consideration. One of the efficient methods of
optimization is putting Neural Networks to use. Few Artificial Neural Network
models are very much suitable for the adaptive control mechanism, by their
nature of network arrangement. One such efficient model is Hopfield Network
model.
  This paper is an attempt to design a framework for the Hopfield Network based
adaptive routing phenomena in satellite constellations.
