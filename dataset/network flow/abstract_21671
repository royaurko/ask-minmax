In this paper we calculate dipole amplitude and dipole amplitude correlations
using first and second equation from Balitsky-Kovchegov hierarchy. Our analysis
shows that even in presence of weak dipole correlation in initial condition
mean field approximation breaks down through evolution. This difference
asymptotically grows not only by absolute value but also by relative difference
of dipole correlation from mean field value. This could affect physical values
related to dipole correlation such as elliptic flow $v_2$ and 'back-forward'
asymmetry in saturation model.
