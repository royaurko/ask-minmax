Data obtained by the GONG and MDI instruments over the last seven years are
used to study how solar dynamics -- both rotation and other large scale flows
-- have changed with time. In addition to the well known phenomenon of bands of
faster and slower rotation moving towards the equator and pole, we find that
the zonal flow pattern rises upwards with time. Like the zonal flows, the
meridional flows also show distinct solar activity related changes. In
particular, the anti-symmetric component of the meridional flow shows a
decrease in speed with activity. We do not see any significant temporal
variations in the dynamics of the tachocline region where the solar dynamo is
believed to be operating.
