This paper provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a random network
with nodes Poissonly distributed on a unit square and a pair of nodes directly
connected following a generic random connection model to be asymptotically
almost surely connected. The results established in this paper expand recent
results obtained for connectivity of random geometric graphs from the unit disk
model and the fewer results from the log-normal model to the more generic and
more practical random connection model.
