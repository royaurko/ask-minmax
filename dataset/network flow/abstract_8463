For networked systems, the control law is typically subject to network flaws
such as delays and packet dropouts. Hence, the time in between updates of the
control law varies unexpectedly. Here, we present a stability theorem for
nonlinear model predictive control with varying control horizon in a continuous
time setting without stabilizing terminal constraints or costs. It turns out
that stability can be concluded under the same conditions as for a (short)
fixed control horizon.
