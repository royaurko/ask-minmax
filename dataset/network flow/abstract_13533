In this work, a geometric discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations is
sought by treating momentum as a covector-valued volume-form. The novelty of
this approach is that we treat conservation of momentum as a tensor equation
and describe a higher order approximation to this tensor equation. The
resulting scheme satisfies mass and momentum conservation laws exactly, and
resembles a staggered-mesh finite-volume method. Numerical test-cases to which
the discretization scheme is applied are the Kovasznay flow, and lid-driven
cavity flow.
