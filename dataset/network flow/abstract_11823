The paper is aimed at analyzing the potential of new information networks to
solve the problems of energy management network with the use of renewable
energy sources. One of the basic problems of renewable energy sources is their
temporal and spatial variability. It is mainly about resources based on direct
solar radiation and wind speed. New computer systems that use only classical
connection-based solid structure of computer network connections but also on
the basis of short-range connections allow accurate prediction of the active
intensity changes observed energy. Using the system thus created can control
precisely the basic energy equipment / generator and operable appliances /
gradient to reduce the power needed resources or from work. This approach is
one of the directions of further development of smart appliances and smart
elements in the energy sector.
