In this work, we consider a method of searching of the direction of a
wireless network development (the places of new access points or base stations
etc.) optimized with criteria of coverage of important territories and minimum
cost of equipment and additional needed infrastructure which does not need the
execution of special field testings and determination of the exact geometry of
elements of RF-propagation medium and their RF absorbing properties but takes
into account the minimum accessible information obtained from built-in
measuring instruments of wireless hardware and approximate data of the medium
elements shape. The problem of search of a disposition and types of the
infrastructure elements of the growing network is formulated as a multicriteria
discrete constrained optimization problem solvable with variant probability
method [1]. The problem of a medium RF-propagation properties modeling is also
formulated and solved as a discrete optimization task.
