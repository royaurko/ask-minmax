Recently an alternative of DDoS attacks called shrew attacks or Reduction of
Quality (RoQ) has been identified which is very much difficult to detect. The
RoQ attacks can use source and destination IP address spoofing, and they do not
have distinct periodicity, and may not filter the attack packets precisely. In
this paper, we propose to design the MAC layer based defense architecture for
RoQ attacks in Wireless LAN which includes the detection and response stages.
The attackers are detected by checking the RTS CTS packets from the MAC layer
and the corresponding attack flows are blocked or rejected. By our simulation
results, we show that our proposed technique achieves reduces the attack
throughput there by increasing the received bandwidth and reducing the packet
loss of legitimate users.
