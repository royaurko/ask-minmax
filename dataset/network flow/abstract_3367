We present new Chandra X-ray observations of the brightest cluster galaxy
(BCG) in the cool core cluster Abell 2597. The data reveal an extensive
kpc-scale X-ray cavity network as well as a 15 kpc filament of soft-excess gas
exhibiting strong spatial correlation with archival VLA radio data. In addition
to several possible scenarios, multiwavelength evidence may suggest that the
filament is associated with multiphase (10^3 - 10^7 K) gas that has been
entrained and dredged-up by the propagating radio source. Stemming from a full
spectral analysis, we also present profiles and 2D spectral maps of modeled
X-ray temperature, entropy, pressure, and metal abundance. The maps reveal an
arc of hot gas which in projection borders the inner edge of a large X-ray
cavity. Although limited by strong caveats, we suggest that the hot arc may be
(a) due to a compressed rim of cold gas pushed outward by the radio bubble or
(b) morphologically and energetically consistent with cavity-driven active
galactic nucleus (AGN) heating models invoked to quench cooling flows, in which
the enthalpy of a buoyant X-ray cavity is locally thermalized as ambient gas
rushes to refill its wake. If confirmed, this would be the first observational
evidence for this model.
