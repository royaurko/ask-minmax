We study numerically and analytically the dynamics of charged particles on
the Galton board, a regular lattice of disc scatters, in the presence of
constant external force, magnetic field and friction. It is shown that under
certain conditions friction leads to the appearance of a strange chaotic
attractor. In this regime the average velocity and direction of particle flow
can be effectively affected by electric and magnetic fields. We discuss the
applications of these results to the charge transport in antidot superlattices
and stream of suspended particles in a viscous flow through scatters.
