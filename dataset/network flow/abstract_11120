The large scale content distribution systems were improved broadly using the
replication techniques. The demanded contents can be brought closer to the
clients by multiplying the source of information geographically, which in turn
reduce both the access latency and the network traffic. The system scalability
can be improved by distributing the load across multiple servers which is
proposed by replication. If a copy of the requested object (e.g., a web page or
an image) is located in its closer proximity then the clients would feel low
access latency. Depending on the position of the replicas, the effectiveness of
replication tends to a large extent. A QoS based overlay network architecture
involving an intelligent replica placement algorithm is proposed in this paper.
Its main goal is to improve the network utilization and fault tolerance of the
P2P system. In addition to the replica placement, it also has a caching
technique, to reduce the search latency. We are able to show that our proposed
architecture attains less latency and better throughput with reduced bandwidth
usage, through the simulation results.
