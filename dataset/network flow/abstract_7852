We study the generalizations of Jonathan King's rank-one theorems
(Weak-Closure Theorem and rigidity of factors) to the case of rank-one
R-actions (flows) and rank-one Z^n-actions. We prove that these results remain
valid in the case of rank-one flows. In the case of rank-one Z^n actions, where
counterexamples have already been given, we prove partial Weak-Closure Theorem
and partial rigidity of factors.
