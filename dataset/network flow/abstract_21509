We study the d - dimensional Bose gas at finite temperature using the
renormalization group method. The flow - equations and the free energy have
been obtained for dimension d, and the cases d<2 and d=2 have been analysed in
the limit of low and high temperatures. The critical temperature, the coherence
length and the specific heat of a two dimensional Bose gas have been obtained
using a solution for the coupling constant which does not present a singular
behavior.
