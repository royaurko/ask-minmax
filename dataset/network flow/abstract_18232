Much recent work in bioinformatics has focused on the inference of various
types of biological networks, representing gene regulation, metabolic
processes, protein-protein interactions, etc. A common setting involves
inferring network edges in a supervised fashion from a set of high-confidence
edges, possibly characterized by multiple, heterogeneous data sets (protein
sequence, gene expression, etc.). Here, we distinguish between two modes of
inference in this setting: direct inference based upon similarities between
nodes joined by an edge, and indirect inference based upon similarities between
one pair of nodes and another pair of nodes. We propose a supervised approach
for the direct case by translating it into a distance metric learning problem.
A relaxation of the resulting convex optimization problem leads to the support
vector machine (SVM) algorithm with a particular kernel for pairs, which we
call the metric learning pairwise kernel (MLPK). We demonstrate, using several
real biological networks, that this direct approach often improves upon the
state-of-the-art SVM for indirect inference with the tensor product pairwise
kernel.
