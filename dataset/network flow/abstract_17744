For any set $M$ of natural numbers there are mixing Gaussian automorphisms
and non-mixing Gaussian automorphisms with singular spectrum (as well as some
automorphisms which are disjoint from all Gaussian actions) such that $
M\cup\{\infty\}$ is the set of their spectral multiplicities. We show also that
for a Gaussian flow $\{G_t\}$ the sets of spectral multiplicities for some
automorphisms $G_t$, $t>0$, could be different.
