We analytically investigate the kinetic Gaussian model and the
one-dimensional kinetic Ising model on two typical small-world networks (SWN),
the adding-type and the rewiring-type. The general approaches and some basic
equations are systematically formulated. The rigorous investigation of the
Glauber-type kinetic Gaussian model shows the mean-field-like global influence
on the dynamic evolution of the individual spins. Accordingly a simplified
method is presented and tested, and believed to be a good choice for the
mean-field transition widely (in fact, without exception so far) observed on
SWN. It yields the evolving equation of the Kawasaki-type Gaussian model. In
the one-dimensional Ising model, the p-dependence of the critical point is
analytically obtained and the inexistence of such a threshold p_c, for a finite
temperature transition, is confirmed. The static critical exponents, gamma and
beta are in accordance with the results of the recent Monte Carlo simulations,
and also with the mean-field critical behavior of the system. We also prove
that the SWN effect does not change the dynamic critical exponent, z=2, for
this model. The observed influence of the long-range randomness on the critical
point indicates two obviously different hidden mechanisms.
