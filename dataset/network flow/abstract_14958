We demonstrate that our recently introduced stochastic Hebb-like learning
rule is capable of learning the problem of timing in general network topologies
generated by an algorithm of Watts and Strogatz. We compare our results with a
learning rule proposed by Bak and Chialvo and obtain not only a significantly
better convergence behavior but also a dependence of the presentation order of
the patterns to be learned by introduction of an additional degree of freedom
which allows the neural network to select the next pattern itself whereas the
learning rule of Bak and Chialvo stays uneffected. This dependence offers a
bidirectional communication between a neuronal and a behavioural level and
hence completes the action-perception-cycle which is a characteristics of any
living being with a brain.
