We investigate the magnetization reversal processes on classes of complex
spin networks with antiferromagnetic interaction along the network links. With
slow field ramping the hysteresis loop and avalanches of spin flips occur due
to topological inhomogeneity of the network, even without any disorder of the
magnetic interaction [B. Tadic, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 (2005) 137204].
Here we study in detail properties of the magnetization avalanches, hysteresis
curves and density of domain walls and show how they can be related to the
structural inhomogeneity of the network. The probability distribution of the
avalanche size, N_s(s), displays the power-law behaviour for small s, i.e.
N_s(s)\propto s^{-\alpha}. For the scale-free networks, grown with preferential
attachment, \alpha increases with the connectivity parameter M from 1.38 for
M=1 (trees) to 1.52 for M=25. For the exponential networks, \alpha is close to
1.0 in the whole range of M.
