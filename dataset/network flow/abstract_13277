We study analytically and numerically the ratchet transport of interacting
particles induced by a monochromatic driving in asymmetric two-dimensional
structures. The ratchet flow is preserved in the limit of strong interactions
and can become even stronger compared to the non-interacting case. The
developed kinetic theory gives a good description of these two limiting
regimes. The numerical data show emergence of turbulence in the ratchet flow
under certain conditions.
