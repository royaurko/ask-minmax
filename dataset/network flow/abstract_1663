Decentralized methods for computing optimal real and reactive power setpoints
for residential photovoltaic (PV) inverters are developed in this paper. It is
known that conventional PV inverter controllers, which are designed to extract
maximum power at unity power factor, cannot address secondary performance
objectives such as voltage regulation and network loss minimization. Optimal
power flow techniques can be utilized to select which inverters will provide
ancillary services, and to compute their optimal real and reactive power
setpoints. Leveraging advances in semidefinite relaxation techniques and
sparsity-promoting regularizations, such problems can be solved with reduced
computational burden and with optimality guarantees. To enable large-scale
implementation, a novel algorithmic framework is introduced - based on the
so-called alternating direction method of multipliers - by which the optimal
power flow problem in this setting can be systematically decomposed into
sub-problems that can be solved in a decentralized fashion by the utility and
customer-owned PV systems with limited exchanges of information. Since the
computational burden is shared among multiple devices and the requirement of
all-to-all communication can be circumvented, the proposed optimization
approach scales to large distribution networks.
