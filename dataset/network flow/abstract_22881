We study renormalization group flows in strongly interacting field theories
with fermions that correspond to transitions between a theory without Lorentz
invariance at high energies down to a theory with approximate Lorentz symmetry
in the infrared. Holographic description of the strong coupling is used. The
emphasis is made on emergence of chiral fermions in the low-energy theory.
