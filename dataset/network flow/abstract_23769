We consider interconnections of n nonlinear subsystems in the input-to-state
stability (ISS) framework. For each subsystem an ISS Lyapunov function is given
that treats the other subsystems as independent inputs. A gain matrix is used
to encode the mutual dependencies of the systems in the network. Under a small
gain assumption on the monotone operator induced by the gain matrix, a locally
Lipschitz continuous ISS Lyapunov function is obtained constructively for the
entire network by appropriately scaling the individual Lyapunov functions for
the subsystems. The results are obtained in a general formulation of ISS, the
cases of summation, maximization and separation with respect to external gains
are obtained as corollaries.
