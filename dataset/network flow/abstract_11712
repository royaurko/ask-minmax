Symbolic models have recently spurred the interest of the research community
because they offer a correct-by-design approach to the control of embedded and
cyber-physical systems. In this paper we address construction of symbolic
models for networks of discrete-time nonlinear control systems. The main result
of the paper shows that under some small gain theorem-type conditions, a
network of symbolic models can be constructed which approximates a network of
incrementally stable control systems in the sense of approximate bisimulation
with any desired accuracy. Compositional design of quantization parameters of
the symbolic models is also derived and based on the topological properties of
the network.
