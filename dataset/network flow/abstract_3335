Extensive research has been done on studying the capacity of wireless
multi-hop networks. These efforts have led to many sophisticated and customized
analytical studies on the capacity of particular networks. While most of the
analyses are intellectually challenging, they lack universal properties that
can be extended to study the capacity of a different network. In this paper, we
sift through various capacity-impacting parameters and present a simple
relationship that can be used to estimate the capacity of both static and
mobile networks. Specifically, we show that the network capacity is determined
by the average number of simultaneous transmissions, the link capacity and the
average number of transmissions required to deliver a packet to its
destination. Our result is valid for both finite networks and asymptotically
infinite networks. We then use this result to explain and better understand the
insights of some existing results on the capacity of static networks, mobile
networks and hybrid networks and the multicast capacity. The capacity analysis
using the aforementioned relationship often becomes simpler. The relationship
can be used as a powerful tool to estimate the capacity of different networks.
Our work makes important contributions towards developing a generic methodology
for network capacity analysis that is applicable to a variety of different
scenarios.
