Cliques are defined as complete graphs or subgraphs; they are the strongest
form of cohesive subgroup, and are of interest in both social science and
engineering contexts. In this paper we show how to efficiently estimate the
distribution of clique sizes from a probability sample of nodes obtained from a
graph (e.g., by independence or link-trace sampling). We introduce two types of
unbiased estimators, one of which exploits labeling of sampled nodes neighbors
and one of which does not require this information. We compare the estimators
on a variety of real-world graphs and provide suggestions for their use. We
generalize our estimators to cases in which cliques are distinguished not only
by size but also by node attributes, allowing us to estimate clique composition
by size. Finally, we apply our methodology to a sample of Facebook users to
estimate the clique size distribution by gender over the social graph.
