Relay selection enhances the performance of the cooperative networks by
selecting the links with higher capacity. Meanwhile link adaptation improves
the spectral efficiency of wireless data-centric networks through adapting the
modulation and coding schemes (MCS) to the current link condition. In this
paper, relay selection is combined with link adaptation for distributed
beamforming in a two-hop regenerative cooperative system. A novel signaling
mechanism and related optimal algorithms are proposed for joint relay selection
and link adaptation. In the proposed scheme, there is no need to feedback the
relay selection results to each relay. Instead, by broadcasting the link
adaptation results from the destination, each relay will automatically
understand whether it is selected or not. The lower and upper bounds of the
throughput of the proposed scheme are derived. The analysis and simulation
results indicate that the proposed scheme provides synergistic gains compared
to the pure relay selection and link adaptation schemes.
