Cluster coordinates for a large class of Argyres-Douglas and asymptotical
free theories are constructed using network on bordered Riemann surface. Such N
= 2 theories are engineered using six dimensional (2, 0) theory on Riemann
surface with irregular and regular singularities. The Stokes phenomenon plays
an important role in our construction. Our results are expected to be very
useful in studying BPS spectrum, wall crossing, and line operators of these
theories, etc. In particular, we conjecture that the quiver from the network is
the BPS quiver. Moreover, our construction provides a simple way to build the
minimal network for cells of positive Grassmannia .
