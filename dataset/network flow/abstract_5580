Bayesian belief networks are bing increasingly used as a knowledge
representation for diagnostic reasoning. One simple method for conducting
diagnostic reasoning is to represent system faults and observations only. In
this paper, we investigate how having intermediate nodes-nodes other than fault
and observation nodes affects the diagnostic performance of a Bayesian belief
network. We conducted a series of experiments on a set of real belief networks
for medical diagnosis in liver and bile disease. We compared the effects on
diagnostic performance of a two-level network consisting just of disease and
finding nodes with that of a network which models intermediate
pathophysiological disease states as well. We provide some theoretical evidence
for differences observed between the abstracted two-level network and the full
network.
