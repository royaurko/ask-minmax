In this paper, the design of the optimal decentralized state-feedback
controllers is considered for a wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN)
with stochastic network-induced delays and packet losses. In particular, taking
advantage of multiple controllers, we model the WSAN as a wireless networked
control system (NCS) with decentralized controllers, and then formulate the
stochastic optimal state-feedback control problem as a non-cooperative linear
quadratic (LQ) game. The optimal control law of each controller is obtained
that is a function of the current plant state and all past control signals. The
performance of the proposed stochastic optimal control algorithm is
investigated using both a genetic control system and a load frequency control
(LFC) system in power grid.
