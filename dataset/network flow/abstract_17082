This paper explores semi-qualitative probabilistic networks (SQPNs) that
combine numeric and qualitative information. We first show that exact
inferences with SQPNs are NPPP-Complete. We then show that existing qualitative
relations in SQPNs (plus probabilistic logic and imprecise assessments) can be
dealt effectively through multilinear programming. We then discuss learning: we
consider a maximum likelihood method that generates point estimates given a
SQPN and empirical data, and we describe a Bayesian-minded method that employs
the Imprecise Dirichlet Model to generate set-valued estimates.
