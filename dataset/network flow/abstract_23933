We study the role of delay in phase synchronization and phenomena responsible
for cluster formation in delayed coupled maps on various networks. Using
numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of delay may change the
mechanism of unit to unit interaction. At weak coupling values, same parity
delays are associated with the same phenomenon of cluster formation and exhibit
similar dynamical evolution. Intermediate coupling values yield rich
delay-induced driven cluster patterns. A Lyapunov function analysis sheds light
on the robustness of the driven clusters observed for delayed bipartite
networks. Our results reveal that delay may lead to a completely different
relation, between dynamical and structural clusters, than observed for the
undelayed case.
