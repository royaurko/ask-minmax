We investigate the growth of connectivity in a network. In our model,
starting with a set of disjoint nodes, links are added sequentially. Each link
connects two nodes, and the connection rate governing this random process is
proportional to the degrees of the two nodes. Interestingly, this network
exhibits two abrupt transitions, both occurring at finite times. The first is a
percolation transition in which a giant component, containing a finite fraction
of all nodes, is born. The second is a condensation transition in which the
entire system condenses into a single, fully connected, component. We derive
the size distribution of connected components as well as the degree
distribution, which is purely exponential throughout the evolution.
Furthermore, we present a criterion for the emergence of sudden condensation
for general homogeneous connection rates.
