Motivation: Measurements of gene expression over time enable the
reconstruction of transcriptional networks. However, Bayesian networks and many
other current reconstruction methods rely on assumptions that conflict with the
differential equations that describe transcriptional kinetics. Practical
approximations of kinetic models would enable inferring causal relationships
between genes from expression data of microarray, tag-based and conventional
platforms, but conclusions are sensitive to the assumptions made.
  Results: The representation of a sufficiently large portion of genome enables
computation of an upper bound on how much confidence one may place in
influences between genes on the basis of expression data. Information about
which genes encode transcription factors is not necessary but may be
incorporated if available. The methodology is generalized to cover cases in
which expression measurements are missing for many of the genes that might
control the transcription of the genes of interest. The assumption that the
gene expression level is roughly proportional to the rate of translation led to
better empirical performance than did either the assumption that the gene
expression level is roughly proportional to the protein level or the Bayesian
model average of both assumptions.
