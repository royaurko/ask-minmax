Traditional network disruption approaches focus on disconnecting or
lengthening paths in the network. We present a new framework for network
disruption that attempts to reroute flow through critical vertices via vertex
deletion, under the assumption that this will render those vertices vulnerable
to future attacks. We define the load on a critical vertex to be the number of
paths in the network that must flow through the vertex. We present
graph-theoretic and computational techniques to maximize this load, firstly by
removing either a single vertex from the network, secondly by removing a subset
of vertices.
