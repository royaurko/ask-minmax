The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which is an
inter connection of networks through an insecure public channel i.e. Internet
demands for authenticating the remote user trying to access the secure network
resources. In 2013, Ankita et al. proposed an improved three factor remote user
authentication scheme. In this poster we will show that Ankita et al scheme is
vulnerable to known session specific temporary information attack, on
successfully performing the attack, the adversary can perform all other major
cryptographic attacks. As a part of our contribution, we will propose an
improved scheme which is resistance to all major cryptographic attacks and
overcomes the defects in Ankita et al. scheme.
