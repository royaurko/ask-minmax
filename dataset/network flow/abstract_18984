In this paper, we address the caching problem in small cell networks from a
game theoretic point of view. In particular, we formulate the caching problem
as a many-to-many matching game between small base stations and service
providers' servers. The servers store a set of videos and aim to cache these
videos at the small base stations in order to reduce the experienced delay by
the end-users. On the other hand, small base stations cache the videos
according to their local popularity, so as to reduce the load on the backhaul
links. We propose a new matching algorithm for the many-to-many problem and
prove that it reaches a pairwise stable outcome. Simulation results show that
the number of satisfied requests by the small base stations in the proposed
caching algorithm can reach up to three times the satisfaction of a random
caching policy. Moreover, the expected download time of all the videos can be
reduced significantly.
