The limits on the mass of the black hole in 23 BL Lac objects are obtained
from their luminosities of the broad emission line H\beta on the assumption
that broad emission lines are emitted from clouds ionized by the radiation of
the accretion disk surrounding a black hole. The distribution of line
luminosity L_{H\beta} of all these BL Lac objects suggests a bimodal nature,
although this cannot be statistically proven on the basis of the present,
rather small sample. We found that standard thin disks are probably in the
sources with L_{H\beta}>10^{41} erg s^{-1}. The central black holes in these
sources have masses of 10^{8-10} M_\odot, if the matter is accreting at the
rate of 0.025 {\dot M}_{\rm Edd}. For the sources with L_{H\beta}<10^{41} erg
s^{-1}, the accretion flows have transited from standard thin disk type to the
ADAF type. The lower limits on the mass of the black hole in these sources are
in the range of 1.66-24.5\times 10^{8} M_\odot. The results support the
evolutionary sequence of blazars: FSRQ\to LBL\to HBL.
