In this paper we study the regularity properties of two maximal operators of
convolution type: the heat flow maximal operator (associated to the Gauss
kernel) and the Poisson maximal operator (associated to the Poisson kernel). In
dimension $d=1$ we prove that these maximal operators do not increase the
$L^p$-variation of a function for any $p \geq 1$, while in dimensions $d>1$ we
obtain the corresponding results for the $L^2$-variation. Similar results are
proved for the discrete versions of these operators.
