Many real-world networks depend on other networks, often in non-trivial ways,
to maintain their functionality. These interdependent "networks of networks"
are often extremely fragile. When a fraction $1-p$ of nodes in one network
randomly fails, the damage propagates to nodes in networks that are
interdependent and a dynamic failure cascade occurs that affects the entire
system. We present dynamic equations for two interdependent networks that allow
us to reproduce the failure cascade for an arbitrary pattern of
interdependency. We study the "rich club" effect found in many real
interdependent network systems in which the high-degree nodes are extremely
interdependent, correlating a fraction $\alpha$ of the higher degree nodes on
each network. We find a rich phase diagram in the plane $p-\alpha$, with a
triple point reminiscent of the triple point of liquids that separates a
non-functional phase from two functional phases.
