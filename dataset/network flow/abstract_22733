The role of the domain geometry for the statistical mechanics of 2D Euler
flows is investigated. It is shown that for a spherical domain, there exists
invariant subspaces in phase space which yield additional angular momentum,
energy and enstrophy invariants. The microcanonical measure taking into account
these invariants is built and a mean-field, Robert-Sommeria-Miller theory is
developed in the simple case of the energy-enstrophy measure. The variational
problem is solved analytically and a partial energy condensation is obtained.
The thermodynamic properties of the system are also discussed.
