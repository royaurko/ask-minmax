Community structure is one of the key properties of real-world complex
networks. It plays a crucial role in their behaviors and topology. While an
important work has been done on the issue of community detection, very little
attention has been devoted to the analysis of the community structure. In this
paper, we present an extensive investigation of the overlapping community
network deduced from a large-scale co-contributorship network. The nodes of the
overlapping community network represent the functional communities of the
co-contributorship network, and the links account for the fact that communities
share some nodes in the co-contributorship network. The comparative evaluation of
the topological properties of these two networks shows that they share similar
topological properties. These results are very interesting. Indeed, the network
of communities seems to be a good representative of the original co-contributorship
network. With its smaller size, it may be more practical in order to realize
various analyses that cannot be performed easily in large-scale real-world
networks.
