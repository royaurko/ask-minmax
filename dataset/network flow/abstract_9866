A bi-Hamiltonian hierarchy of complex vector soliton equations is derived
from geometric flows of non-stretching curves in the Lie groups
$G=SO(N+1),SU(N)\subset U(N)$, generalizing previous work on integrable curve
flows in Riemannian symmetric spaces $G/SO(N)$. The derivation uses a parallel
frame and connection along the curves, involving the Klein geometry of the
group $G$. This is shown to yield the two known $U(N-1)$-invariant vector
generalizations of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation and the complex
modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, as well as $U(N-1)$-invariant
vector generalizations of the sine-Gordon (SG) equation found in recent
symmetry-integrability classifications of hyperbolic vector equations. The
curve flows themselves are described in explicit form by chiral wave maps,
chiral variants of Schrodinger maps, and mKdV analogs.
