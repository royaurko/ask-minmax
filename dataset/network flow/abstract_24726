How do shared conventions emerge in complex decentralized social systems?
This question engages fields as diverse as linguistics, sociology and cognitive
science. Previous empirical attempts to solve this puzzle all presuppose that
formal or informal institutions, such as incentives for global agreement,
coordinated leadership, or aggregated information about the population, are
needed to facilitate a solution. Evolutionary theories of social conventions,
by contrast, hypothesize that such institutions are not necessary in order for
social conventions to form. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis have
been hindered by the difficulties of evaluating the real-time creation of new
collective behaviors in large decentralized populations. Here, we present
experimental results - replicated at several scales - that demonstrate the
spontaneous creation of universally adopted social conventions, and show how
simple changes in a population's network structure can direct the dynamics of
norm formation, driving human populations with no ambition for large scale
coordination to rapidly evolve shared social conventions.
