For many complex networks present in nature only a single instance, usually
of large size, is available. Any measurement made on this single instance
cannot be repeated on different realizations. In order to detect significant
patterns in a real--world network it is therefore crucial to compare the
measured results with a null model counterpart. Here we focus on dense and
weighted networks, proposing a suitable null model and studying the behaviour
of the degree correlations as measured by the rich-club coefficient. Our method
solves an existing problem with the randomization of dense unweighted graphs,
and at the same time represents a generalization of the rich--club coefficient
to weighted networks which is complementary to other recently proposed ones.
