We investigate corrections to scaling induced by irrelevant operators in
randomly diluted systems near the percolation threshold. The specific systems
that we consider are the random resistor network and a class of continuous spin
systems, such as the x-y-model. We focus on a family of least irrelevant
operators and determine the corrections to scaling that originate from this
family. Our field theoretic analysis carefully takes into account, that
irrelevant operators mix under renormalization. It turns out that long standing
results on corrections to scaling are respectively incorrect (random resistor
networks) or incomplete (continuous spin systems).
