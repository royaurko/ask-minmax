Possible mechanisms for over-limiting current (OLC) through aqueous
ion-exchange membranes (exceeding diffusion limitation) have been debated for
half a century. Flows consistent with electro-osmotic instability (EOI) have
recently been observed in microfluidic experiments, but the existing theory
neglects chemical effects and remains to be quantitatively tested. Here, we
show that charge regulation and water self-ionization can lead to OLC by
"current-induced membrane discharge" (CIMD), even in the absence of fluid flow.
Salt depletion leads to a large electric field which expels water co-ions,
causing the membrane to discharge and lose its selectivity. Since salt co-ions
and water ions contribute to OLC, CIMD interferes with electrodialysis (salt
counter-ion removal) but could be exploited for current-assisted ion exchange
and pH control. CIMD also suppresses the extended space charge that leads to
EOI, so it should be reconsidered in both models and experiments on OLC.
