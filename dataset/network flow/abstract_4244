Protein function prediction is the important problem in modern biology. In
this paper, the un-normalized, symmetric normalized, and random walk graph
Laplacian based semi-supervised learning methods will be applied to the
integrated network combined from multiple networks to predict the functions of
all yeast proteins in these multiple networks. These multiple networks are
network created from Pfam domain structure, co-participation in a protein
complex, protein-protein interaction network, genetic interaction network, and
network created from cell cycle gene expression measurements. Multiple networks
are combined with fixed weights instead of using convex optimization to
determine the combination weights due to high time complexity of convex
optimization method. This simple combination method will not affect the
accuracy performance measures of the three semi-supervised learning methods.
Experiment results show that the un-normalized and symmetric normalized graph
Laplacian based methods perform slightly better than random walk graph
Laplacian based method for integrated network. Moreover, the accuracy
performance measures of these three semi-supervised learning methods for
integrated network are much better than the best accuracy performance measures
of these three methods for the individual network.
