Computing economics are changing. Today there is rough price parity between
(1) one database access, (2) ten bytes of network traffic, (3) 100,000
instructions, (4) 10 bytes of disk storage, and (5) a megabyte of disk
bandwidth. This has implications for how one structures Internet-scale
distributed computing: one puts computing as close to the data as possible in
order to avoid expensive network traffic.
