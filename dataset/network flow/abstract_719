This paper discusses the implementation of a tactical network simulation
tool. The tool is called Tactical Network Modeller (TNM). TNM uses some novel
techniques to simplify the building of the network model using graph theory
constrained by a hierarchical tree which reflects the organisation structure.
TNM allows models to be constructed using an Application Programming Interface
(API) or a node based User Interface (UI). When the model is constructed,
different simulation back-ends can be applied to it. A discrete event
simulation and a network emulation back-end are implemented building on top of
open source tools. TNM is simple to create models for non technical users. The
model can be used to analyse information flows. The same model can be used for
a full network emulation. This allows real software and protocols to be tested
in a realistic simulated environment. The flexibility of the software allows
its use from engineering up to campaign planning.
