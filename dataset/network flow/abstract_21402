Qualitative arguments are presented to demonstrate that the energy density of
magnetic fields in matter accreting onto a black hole inside the marginally
stable orbit is automatically comparable to the rest-mass energy density of the
accretion flow. Several consequences follow: magnetic effects must be
dynamically significant, but cannot be so strong as to dominate; outward energy
transport in Alfven waves may alter the effective efficiency of energy
liberation; and vertical magnetic stresses in this region may contribute to
"coronal" activity.
