We introduce a new real space super cell approximation method for treating
the electronic states of disordered systems. This method is general and allows
both randomness in the on-site energies and in the hopping integrals. In the
special case of randomness in the on-site energies only, this method is
equivalent to the Non Local Coherent Potential Approximation (NLCPA) derived
previously.
