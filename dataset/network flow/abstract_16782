The lack of extensive research in the application of inexpensive wireless
sensor nodes for the early detection of wildfires motivated us to investigate
the cost of such a network. As a first step, in this paper we present several
results which relate the time to detection and the burned area to the number of
sensor nodes in the region which is protected. We prove that the probability
distribution of the burned area at the moment of detection is approximately
exponential, given that some hypotheses hold: the positions of the sensor nodes
are independent random variables uniformly distributed and the number of sensor
nodes is large. This conclusion depends neither on the number of ignition
points nor on the propagation model of the fire.
