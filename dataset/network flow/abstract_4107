A foliation is R-covered if the leaf space in the universal cover is
homeomorphic to the real numbers. We show that, up to topological conjugacy,
there are at most two pseudo-Anosov flows transverse to such a foliation. If
there are two, then the foliation is weakly conjugate to the the stable
foliation of an R-covered Anosov flow. The proof uses the universal circle to
R-covered foliations.
