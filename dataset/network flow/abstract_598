Experimental measurements of the onset of granular flow are directly compared
to predictions of the "shear transformation zone" (STZ) theory of amorphous
plasticity. The STZ equations make it possible, on a coarse grained level, to
incorporate the anisotropy of the particle contact network and its dynamic
evolution including changes in the contact network direction under shear
reversal. The STZ theory and experiment show qualitative agreement in the
transient and steady state shear forces and velocity profiles during the start
of shear and shear reversal.
