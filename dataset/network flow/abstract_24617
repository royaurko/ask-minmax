Phenomenological screening of small molecule libraries for anticancer
activity yields potentially interesting candidate molecules, with a bottleneck
in the determination of drug targets and the mechanism of anticancer action. A
novel approach to drug target deconvolution compares the abundance profiles of
proteins expressed in a panel of cells treated with different drugs, and
identifies proteins with cell-type independent and drug-specific regulation
that is exceptionally strong in relation to the other proteins. Mapping top
candidates on known protein networks reveals the mechanism of drug action,
while abundant proteins provide a signature of cellular death/survival
pathways. The above approach can significantly shorten drug target
identification, and thus facilitate the emergence of novel anticancer
treatments.
