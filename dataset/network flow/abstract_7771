In this work, we present the results obtained by the hydrodynamic code
NeXSPheRIO on anisotropic flows. In our calculation, we made use of
event-by-event fluctuating initial conditions, and chemical freeze-out was
explicitly implemented. We studied directed flow, elliptic flow and forth
harmonic coefficient for various hadrons at different centrality windows for
Au+Au collisions at 200 AGeV. The results are discussed and compared with
experimental data from RHIC.
