Finding the dominant direction of flow of information in densely
interconnected regulatory or signaling networks is required in many
applications in computational biology and neuroscience. This is achieved by
first identifying and removing links which close up feedback loops in the
original network and hierarchically arranging nodes in the remaining network.
In mathematical language this corresponds to a problem of making a graph
acyclic by removing as few links as possible and thus altering the original
graph in the least possible way. Practically in all applications the exact
solution of this problem requires an enumeration of all combinations of removed
links, which is computationally intractable. We introduce and compare two
algorithms: the deterministic, 'greedy' algorithm that preferentially cuts the
links that participate in the largest number of feedback cycles, and the
probabilistic one based on a simulated annealing of a hierarchical layout of
the network which minimizes the number of ``backward'' links going from lower
to higher hierarchical levels. We find that the annealing algorithm outperforms
the deterministic one in terms of speed, memory requirement, and the actual
number of removed links. Implications for system biology and directions for
further research are discussed.
