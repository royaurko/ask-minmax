The kinematic dynamo problem is investigated for the flow of a conducting
fluid in a cylindrical, periodic tube with conducting walls. The methods used
are an eigenvalue analysis of the steady regime, and the three-dimensional
solution of the time-dependent induction equation. The configuration and
parameters considered here are close to those of a dynamo experiment planned in
Perm, which will use a torus-shaped channel. We find growth of an initial
magnetic field by more than 3 orders of magnitude. Marked field growth can be
obtained if the braking time is less than 0.2 s and only one diverter is used
in the channel. The structure of the seed field has a strong impact on the
field amplification factor. The generation properties can be improved by adding
ferromagnetic particles to the fluid in order to increase its relative
permeability,but this will not be necessary for the success of the dynamo
experiment. For higher magnetic Reynolds numbers, the nontrivial evolution of
different magnetic modes limits the value of simple `optimistic' and
`pessimistic' estimates.
