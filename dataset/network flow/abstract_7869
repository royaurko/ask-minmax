We study the dynamics of a prolate spheroidal microswimmer in Poiseuille flow
for different flow geometries. When moving between two parallel plates or in a
cylindrical microchannel, the swimmer performs either periodic swinging or
periodic tumbling motion. Although the trajectories of spherical and elongated
swimmers are qualitatively similar, the swinging and tumbling frequency
strongly depends on the aspect ratio of the swimmer. In channels with reduced
symmetry the swimmers perform quasiperiodic motion which we demonstrate
explicitely for swimming in a channel with elliptical cross section.
