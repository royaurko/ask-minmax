This paper reports the initial steps in the development of WaterLab, an
ambitious experimental facility for the testing of new cyber-physical
technologies in drinking water distribution networks (DWDN). WaterLab's initial
focus is on wireless control networks and on data-based, distributed anomaly
detection over wireless sensor networks. The former can be used to control the
hydraulic properties of a DWDN, while the latter can be used for in-situ
detection and isolation of contamination and hydraulic faults.
