Using Evans function techniques, we develop a stability index for weak and
strong detonation waves analogous to that developed for shock waves in
[GZ,BSZ], yielding useful necessary conditions for stability. Here, we carry
out the analysis in the context of the Majda model, a simplified model for
reacting flow; the method is extended to the full Navier-Stokes equations of
reacting flow in [Ly,LyZ]. The resulting stability condition is satisfied for
all nondegenerate, i.e., spatially exponentially decaying, weak and strong
detonations of the Majda model in agreement with numerical experiments of [CMR]
and analytical results of [Sz,LY] for a related model of Majda and Rosales. We
discuss also the role in the ZND limit of degenerate, subalgebraically decaying
weak detonation and (for a modified, ``bump-type'' ignition function)
deflagration profiles, as discussed in [GS.1-2] for the full equations.
