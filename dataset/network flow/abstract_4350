The network of 5823 cities of Mexico with a population more than 5000
inhabitants is studied. Our analysis is focused to the spectral properties of
the adjacency matrix, the small-world properties of the network, the
distribution of the clustering coefficients and the degree distribution of the
vertices. The connection of these features with the spread of epidemics on this
network is also discussed.
