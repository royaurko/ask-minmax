In this paper, it is shown that for any given single-hop communication
network with two receivers, splitting messages into more than two sub-messages
in a random coding scheme is redundant. To this end, the Broadcast Channel with
Cognitive Relays (BCCR) is considered. A novel achievability scheme is designed
for this network. Our achievability design is derived by a systematic
combination of the best known achievability schemes for the basic building
blocks included in the network: the Han-Kobayashi scheme for the two-user
interference channel and the Marton coding scheme for the broadcast channel.
Meanwhile, in our scheme each private message is split into only two
sub-messages which is identically exploited also in the Han-Kobayashi scheme.
It is shown that the resultant achievable rate region includes previous results
as well. More importantly, the procedure of the achievability design is
described by graphical illustrations based on directed graphs. Then, it is
argued that by extending the proposed scheme on the MACCM plan of messages, one
can derive similar achievability schemes for any other single-hop communication
network.
