We suggest to simulate evolution of complex organisms constrained by the sole
requirement of robustness in their expression patterns. This scenario is
illustrated by evolving discrete logical networks with epigenetic properties.
Evidence for dynamical features in the evolved networks is found that can be
related to biological observables.
