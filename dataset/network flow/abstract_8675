We propose a scheme for computing Maximum Likelihood Estimators for
Log-Linear models using reaction networks, and prove its correctness. Our
scheme exploits the toric structure of equilibrium points of reaction networks.
This allows an efficient encoding of the problem, and reveals how reaction
networks are naturally suited to statistical inference tasks. Our scheme is
relevant to molecular programming, an emerging discipline that views molecular
interactions as computational primitives for the synthesis of sophisticated
behaviors. In addition, such a scheme may provide a template to understand how
biochemical signaling pathways integrate extensive information about their
environment and history.
