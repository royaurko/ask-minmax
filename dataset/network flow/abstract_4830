We construct a category of examples of partially hyperbolic geodesic flows
which are not Anosov, deforming the metric of a compact locally symmetric space
of nonconstant negative curvature. Candidates for such example as the product
metric and locally symmetric spaces of nonpositive curvature with rank bigger
than one are not partially hyperbolic. We prove that if a metric of nonpositive
curvature has a partially hyperbolic geodesic flow, then its rank is one. Other
obstructions to partial hyperbolicity of a geodesic flow are also analyzed.
