We consider point to point link scheduling in Spatial Time Division Multiple
Access (STDMA) wireless networks under the physical interference model. We
propose a novel link scheduling algorithm based on a line graph representation
of the network, by embedding the interferences between pairs of nodes into the
edge weights of the line graph. Our algorithm achieves lower schedule length
and lower run time complexity than existing algorithms.
