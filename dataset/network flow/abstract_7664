We show that for two dimensional manifolds M with negative Euler
characteristic there exists subsets of the space of smooth Riemannian metrics
which are invariant and either parabolic or backwards-parabolic for the 2nd
order RG flow. We also show that solutions exists globally on these sets.
Finally, we establish the existence of an eternal solution that has both a UV
and IR limit, and passes through regions where the flow is parabolic and
backwards-parabolic.
