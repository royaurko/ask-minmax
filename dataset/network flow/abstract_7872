Event-by-event hydrodynamics is applied to Cu-Au collisions at 200GeV.
Predictions for charged particle distributions in pseudorapidity, transverse
momentum spectra, femtoscopy radii are given. The triangular and elliptic flow
coefficients are calculated. The directed flow at central rapidity in the
reaction plane in asymmetric collisions is nonzero, fluctuations of the initial
profile lead to a further increase of the directed flow when measured in the
event plane.
