New infinite number of one- and two-point B\"{a}cklund transformations (BTs)
with explicit expressions are constructed for the high-order constrained flows
of the AKNS hierarchy. It is shown that these BTs are canonical transformations
including B\"{a}cklund parameter $\eta$ and a spectrality property holds with
respect to $\eta$ and the 'conjugated' variable $\mu$ for which the point
$(\eta, \mu)$ belongs to the spectral curve. Also the formulas of m-times
repeated Darboux transformations for the high-order constrained flows of the
AKNS hierarchy are presented.
