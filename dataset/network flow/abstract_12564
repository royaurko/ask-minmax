This paper deals with the analysis of critical observability and design of
observers for networks of Finite State Machines (FSMs). Critical observability
is a property of FSMs that corresponds to the possibility of detecting
immediately if the current state of an FSM reaches a set of critical states
modeling unsafe operations. This property is relevant in safety--critical
applications where the timely recovery of human errors and device failures is
of primary importance in ensuring safety. A critical observer is an observer
that detects on--line the occurrence of critical states. When a large--scale
network of FSMs is considered, the construction of such an observer is
prohibitive because of the large computational effort needed. In this paper we
propose a decentralized architecture for critical observers of networks of
FSMs, where on--line detection of critical states is performed by local
critical observers, each associated with an FSM of the network. For the design
of local observers, efficient algorithms were provided which are based on
on--the-fly techniques. Further, we present results on model reduction of
networks of FSMs, based on bisimulation equivalence preserving critical
observability. The advantages of the proposed approach in terms of
computational complexity are discussed and examples offered.
