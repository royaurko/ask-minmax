We present a reduced model for the transition to turbulence in shear flow
that is simple enough to admit a thorough numerical investigation while
allowing spatio-temporal dynamics that are substantially more complex than
those allowed in previous modal truncations. Our model allows a comparison of
the dynamics resulting from initial perturbations that are localised in the
spanwise direction with those resulting from sinusoidal perturbations. For
spanwise-localised initial conditions the subcritical transition to a
`turbulent' state (i) takes place more abruptly, with a boundary between
laminar and `turbulent' flow that is appears to be much less `structured' and
(ii) results in a spatiotemporally chaotic regime within which the lifetimes of
spatiotemporally complicated transients are longer, and are even more sensitive
to initial conditions. The minimum initial energy $E_0$ required for a
spanwise-localised initial perturbation to excite a chaotic transient has a
power-law scaling with Reynolds number $E_0 \sim Re^p$ with $p \approx -4.3$.
The exponent $p$ depends only weakly on the width of the localised perturbation
and is lower than that commonly observed in previous low-dimensional models
where typically $p \approx -2$. The distributions of lifetimes of chaotic
transients at fixed Reynolds number are found to be consistent with exponential
distributions.
