Dissensus is a modeling framework for networks of dynamic agents in
competition for scarce resources. Originally inspired by biological cells
behaviors, it fits also marketing, finance and many other application areas.
Competition is often unstable in the sense that strong agents, those having
access to large resources, gain more and more resources at the expense of weak
agents. Thus, strong agents duplicate when reaching a critical amount of
resources, whereas weak agents die when loosing all their resources. To capture
all these phenomena we introduce systems with a discrete time gossip and
unstable state dynamics interrupted by discrete events affecting the network
topology. Invariancy of states and topologies and network connectivity are
explored.
