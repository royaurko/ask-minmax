Wireless Mesh network (WMN) is dynamically self-organizing and
self-configured, with the nodes in the network automatically establishing an
ad-hoc network and maintaining the mesh connectivity. The ability to use
multiple-radios and multiple channels can be cashed to increase aggregate
throughput of wireless mesh network. Thus the efficient use of available
interfaces and channels without interference becomes the key factor. In this
paper we propose, interference aware clustered based channel assignment schemes
which minimizes the interference and increases throughput. In our proposed
scheme we have given priority to minimize interference from nearby mesh nodes
in interference range than maximizing channel diversity. We simulated our
proposed work using NS-3 and results show that our scheme improves network
performance than BFSCA and Distributed Greedy CA.
