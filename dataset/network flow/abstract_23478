We study the universality class for localization which arises from models of
non-interacting quasiparticles in disordered superconductors that have neither
time-reversal nor spin-rotation symmetries. Two-dimensional systems in this
category, which is known as class D, can display phases with three different
types of quasiparticle dynamics: metallic, localized, or with a quantized
(thermal) Hall conductance. Correspondingly, they can show a variety of
delocalization transitions. We illustrate this behavior by investigating
numerically the phase diagrams of network models with the appropriate symmetry,
and for the first time show the appearance of the metallic phase.
