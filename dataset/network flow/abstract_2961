We study the statistical properties of large random networks with specified
degree distributions. New techniques are presented for analyzing the structure
of social networks. Specifically, we address the question of how many nodes
exist at a distance from a given node. We also explore the degree distribution
of for nodes at some distance from a given node. Implications for network
sampling and diffusion on social networks are described.
