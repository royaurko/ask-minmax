Two particle azimuthal correlation functions are presented for charged
hadrons produced in Au+Au collisions at RHIC ($\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=130$ GeV). The
measurements allow for the determination of elliptic flow without
event-by-event estimation of the reaction plane. The measured correlation
functions indicate elliptic flow values ($v_2$) which show significant
sensitivity to both the collision centrality and the transverse momenta of
emitted hadrons.
