The advent of multipoint (multicast-based) applications and the growth and
complexity of the Internet has complicated network protocol design and
evaluation.
  In this paper, we present a method for automatic synthesis of worst and best
case scenarios for multipoint protocol performance evaluation.
  Our method uses a fault-oriented test generation (FOTG) algorithm for
searching the protocol and system state space to synthesize these scenarios.
The algorithm is based on a global finite state machine (FSM) model. We extend
the algorithm with timing semantics to handle end-to-end delays and address
performance criteria. We introduce the notion of a virtual LAN to represent
delays of the underlying multicast distribution tree.
  As a case study, we use our method to evaluate variants of the timer
suppression mechanism, used in various multipoint protocols, with respect to
two performance criteria: overhead of response messages and response time.
Simulation results for reliable multicast protocols show that our method
provides a scalable way for synthesizing worst-case scenarios automatically. We
expect our method to serve as a model for applying systematic scenario
generation to other multipoint protocols.
