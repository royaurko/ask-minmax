To explore the strength, isospin dependence, and density dependence of the
in-medium spin-orbit coupling that is poorly known but relevant for
understanding the structure of rare isotopes, the nucleon spin up-down
differential transverse flow is studied systematically by varying the beam
energy and impact parameter of Au+Au collisions within a spin-isospin dependent
transport model recently developed for investigating spin-related phenomena in
intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions. The optimal reaction conditions for
delineating and disentangling effects of different terms in the spin-orbit
coupling are discussed.
