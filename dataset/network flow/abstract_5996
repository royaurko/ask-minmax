In order to assess the short-term memory performance of non-linear random
neural networks, we introduce a measure to quantify the dependence of a neural
representation upon the past context. We study this measure both numerically
and theoretically using the mean-field theory for random neural networks,
showing the existence of an optimal level of synaptic weights heterogeneity. We
further investigate the influence of the network topology, in particular the
symmetry of reciprocal synaptic connections, on this measure of context
dependence, revealing the importance of considering the interplay between
non-linearities and connectivity structure.
