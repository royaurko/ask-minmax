In many fields observations are performed irregularly along time, due to
either measurement limitations or lack of a constant immanent rate. While
discrete-time Markov models (as Dynamic Bayesian Networks) introduce either
inefficient computation or an information loss to reasoning about such
processes, continuous-time Markov models assume either a discrete state space
(as Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks), or a flat continuous state space (as
stochastic differential equations). To address these problems, we present a new
modeling class called Irregular-Time Bayesian Networks (ITBNs), generalizing
Dynamic Bayesian Networks, allowing substantially more compact representations,
and increasing the expressivity of the temporal dynamics. In addition, a
globally optimal solution is guaranteed when learning temporal systems,
provided that they are fully observed at the same irregularly spaced
time-points, and a semiparametric subclass of ITBNs is introduced to allow
further adaptation to the irregular nature of the available data.
