Based on A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model, we have studied the elliptic
flow $v_{2}$ of $\phi$ mesons from reconstructed $K^{+}K^{-}$ decay channel at
the top Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider energy at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. The dependences of $v_{2}$ on transverse momentum $p_T$ and
collision centrality are presented and the rescattering effect of $\phi$ mesons
in the hadronic phase is also investigated. The results show that experimental
measurement of $v_{2}$ for $\phi$ mesons can retain the early collision
information before $\phi$ decays and that the $\phi$ $v_2$ value obeys the
constituent quark number scaling which has been observed for other mesons and
baryons. Our study indicates that the $\phi$ $v_2$ mostly reflects partonic
level collectivity developed during the early stage of the nucleus-nucleus
collision and the strange and light up/down quarks have developed similar
angular anistropy properties at the hadronization.
