We have performed a systematic, large-scale simulation study of granular
media in two- and three-dimensions, investigating the rheology of cohesionless
granular particles in inclined plane geometries, i.e., chute flows. We find
that over a wide range of parameter space of interaction coefficients and
inclination angles, a steady state flow regime exists in which the energy input
from gravity balances that dissipated from friction and inelastic collisions.
In this regime, the bulk packing fraction (away from the top free surface and
the bottom plate boundary) remains constant as a function of depth z, of the
pile. The velocity profile in the direction of flow v(z) scales with height of
the pile H, according to v(z) proportional to H^a, with a=1.52. However, the
behavior of the normal stresses indicates that existing simple theories of
granular flow do not capture all of the features evidenced in the simulations.
