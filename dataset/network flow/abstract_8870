We study a simple stochastic differential equation driven by one Brownian
motion on a general oriented metric graph whose solutions are stochastic flows
of kernels. Under some condition, we describe the laws of all solutions. This
work is a natural continuation of some previous papers by Hajri, Hajri-Raimond
and Le Jan-Raimond where some particular graphs have been considered.
