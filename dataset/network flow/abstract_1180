We simulate quasistatic flows of an ideal two-dimensional monodisperse foam
around different obstacles, both symmetric and asymmetric, in a channel. We
record both pressure and network contributions to the drag and lift forces, and
study them as a function of obstacle geometry. We show that the drag force
increases linearly with the cross section of an obstacles. The lift on an
asymmetric aerofoil-like shape is negative and increases with its arc length,
mainly due to the pressure contribution.
