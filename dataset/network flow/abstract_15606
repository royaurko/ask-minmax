We present a stylized model of the allocation of resources on a network. By
considering as a concrete example the network of sectors of the airspace, where
each node is a sector characterized by a maximal number of simultaneously
present aircraft, we consider the problem of air companies competing for the
allocation of the airspace. Each company is characterized by a cost function,
weighting differently punctuality and length of the flight. We consider the
model in the presence of pure and mixed populations of types of airline
companies and we study how the equilibria depends on the characteristics of the
network.
