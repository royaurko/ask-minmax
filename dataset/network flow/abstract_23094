We address a problem which is mathematically reminiscent of the one of
Anderson localization, although it is related to a strongly dissipative
dynamics. Specifically, we study thermal convection in a horizontal porous
layer heated from below in the presence of a parametric disorder; physical
parameters of the layer are time-independent and randomly inhomogeneous in one
of the horizontal directions. Under such a frozen parametric disorder,
spatially localized flow patterns appear. We focus our study on their
localization properties and the effect of an imposed advection along the layer
on these properties. Our interpretation of the results of the linear theory is
underpinned by numerical simulation for the nonlinear problem. Weak advection
is found to lead to an upstream delocalization of localized current patterns.
Due to this delocalization, the transition from a set of localized patterns to
an almost everywhere intense "global" flow can be observed under conditions
where the disorder-free system would be not far below the instability
threshold. The results presented are derived for a physical system which is
mathematically described by a modified Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and
therefore they are expected to be relevant for a broad variety of dissipative
media where pattern selection occurs.
