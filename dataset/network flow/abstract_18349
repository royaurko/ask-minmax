We demonstrate a simple network-analyzer technique to make quantitative
measurements of the bias dependence of spin torque in a magnetic tunnel
junction. We apply a microwave current to exert an oscillating spin torque near
the ferromagnetic resonance frequency of the tunnel junction's free layer. This
produces an oscillating resistance that, together with an applied direct
current, generates a microwave signal that we measure with the network
analyzer. An analysis of the resonant response yields the strength and
direction of the spin torque at non-zero bias. We compare to measurements of
the spin torque vector by time-domain spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance.
