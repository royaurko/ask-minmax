Threshold networks are used as models for neural or gene regulatory networks.
They show a rich dynamical behaviour with a transition between a frozen and a
chaotic phase. We investigate the phase diagram of randomly connected threshold
networks with real-valued thresholds h and a fixed number of inputs per node.
The nodes are updated according to the same rules as in a model of the
cell-cycle network of Saccharomyces cereviseae [PNAS 101, 4781 (2004)]. Using
the annealed approximation, we derive expressions for the time evolution of the
proportion of nodes in the "on" and "off" state, and for the sensitivity
$\lambda$. The results are compared with simulations of quenched networks. We
find that for integer values of h the simulations show marked deviations from
the annealed approximation even for large networks. This can be attributed to
the particular choice of the updating rule.
