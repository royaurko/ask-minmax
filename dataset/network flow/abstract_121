A model to explain the statistics of the velocity gradients in the
dissipation range of a turbulent flow is presented. The experimentally observed
non-gaussian statistics is theoretically predicted by means of a
thermodynamical analogy using the maximum entropy principle of ordinary
statistical mechanics.
