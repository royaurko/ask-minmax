We give an analogy between non-reversible Markov chains and electric networks
much in the flavour of the classical reversible results originating from
Kakutani, and later Kem\'eny-Snell-Knapp and Kelly. Non-reversibility is made
possible by a voltage multiplier -- a new electronic component. We prove that
absorption probabilities, escape probabilities, expected number of jumps over
edges and commute times can be computed from electrical properties of the
network as in the classical case. The central quantity is still the effective
resistance, which we do have in our networks despite the fact that individual
parts cannot be replaced by a simple resistor. We rewrite a recent
non-reversible result of Gaudilli\`ere-Landim about the Dirichlet and Thomson
principles into the electrical language. We also give a few tools that can help
in reducing and solving the network. The subtlety of our network is, however,
that the classical Rayleigh monotonicity is lost.
