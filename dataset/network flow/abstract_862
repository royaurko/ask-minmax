We examine the characteristic properties of photospheric p-modes and
sub-photospheric flows of active regions (ARs) observed during the period of
26-31 October 2003. Using ring diagram analysis of Doppler velocity data
obtained from the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG), we have found that
p-mode parameters evolve with ARs and show a strong association with flare
activity. Sub-photospheric flows, derived using inversions of p-modes, show
strong twist at the locations of ARs, and large variation with flare activity.
