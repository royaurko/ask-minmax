Turbulent shear flows, such as those occurring in the wall region of
turbulent boundary layers, manifest a substantial increase of intermittency
with respect to isotropic conditions. This suggests a close link between
anisotropy and intermittency. However, a rigorous statistical description of
anisotropic flows is, in most cases, hampered by the inhomogeneity of the
field. This difficulty is absent for the homogeneous shear flow. For this flow
the scale by scale budget is discussed here by using the appropriate form of
the Karman-Howarth equation, to determine the range of scales where the shear
is dominant. The issuing generalization of the four-fifths law is then used as
the guideline to extend to shear dominated flows the Kolmogorov-Obhukhov theory
of intermittency. The procedure leads naturally to the formulation of
generalized structure functions and the description of intermittency thus
obtained reduces to the K62 theory for vanishing shear. Also here the
intermittency corrections to the scaling exponents are carried by the moments
of the coarse grained energy dissipation field. Numerical experiments give
indications that the dissipation field is statistically unaffected by the
shear, thereby supporting the conjecture that the intermittency corrections are
universal. This observation together with the present reformulation of the
theory gives reason for the increased intermittency observed in the classical
longitudinal velocity increments.
