We analyze the peculiar velocity field for 2400 flat spiral galaxies selected
from an infrared sky survey (2MFGC). The distances to the galaxies have been
determined from the Tully-Fisher relation in the photometric J band with a
dispersion of 0.45 mag. The bulk motion of this sample relative to the cosmic
microwave background (3K) frame has an amplitude of 199+/-37 km/s in the
direction l = 290 +/- 11, b = +1 +/- 9 degree. The amplitude of the dipole
motion tends to decrease with distance in accordance with the expected
convergence of bulk flows in the 3K frame. We believe that external massive
attractors similar to the Shapley cluster concentration are responsible for
\~60% of the local flow velocity in the z = 0.03 volume.
