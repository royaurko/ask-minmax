Wireless networks are fundamentally limited by the intensity of the received
signals and by their inherent interference. It is shown here that in finite ad
hoc networks where node placement is modelled according to a Poisson point
process and no carrier sensing is employed for medium access, the SINR received
by nodes located at the border of the network deployment/operation region is on
average greater than the rest. This is primarily due to the uneven interference
landscape of such networks which is particularly kind to border nodes giving
rise to all sorts of performance inhomogeneities and access unfairness. Using
tools from stochastic geometry we quantify these spatial variations and provide
closed form communication-theoretic results showing why the receiver's location
is so important.
