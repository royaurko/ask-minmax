In this article, we analyze different factors that affect the diffusion
behavior of small tracer particles (as they are used e.g.in fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy (FCS)) in the polymer network of a hydrogel and
perform simulations of various simplified models. We observe, that under
certain circumstances the attraction of a tracer particle to the polymer
network strands might cause subdiffusive behavior on intermediate time scales.
In theory, this behavior could be employed to examine the network structure and
swelling behavior of weakly crosslinked hydrogels with the help of FCS.
