We derive analytical expressions for the mass flow rates in and from
accretion discs, taking into account the Eddington limit. This allows us to
connect the basic properties of outflows with those of the accretion flow. As
an example, we derive the radial surface density distribution in the accretion
disc of Mrk 231.
