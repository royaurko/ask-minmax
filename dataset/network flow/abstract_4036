In 1946, M. Morse proposed a conjecture that an analytic topologically
transitive systems is metrically transitive. We prove this Morse conjecture for
flows on a closed orientable surface of negative Euler characteristic. As a
consequence, the Morse conjecture is true for highly transitive flows on
non-orientable surfaces.
