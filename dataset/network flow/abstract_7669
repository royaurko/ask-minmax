We show if the flow polynomial of a bridgeless graph G has only integral
roots, then G is the dual graph to a planar chordal graph. We also show that
for 3-connected cubic graphs, the same conclusion holds under the weaker
hypothesis that it has only real flow roots. Expressed in the language of
matroid theory, this result says that the cographic matroids with only integral
characteristic roots are the cycle matroids of planar chordal graphs.
