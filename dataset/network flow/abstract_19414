Observations of AGNs and microquasars by ASCA, RXTE, Chandra and XMM-Newton
indicate the existence of broad X-ray emission lines of ionized heavy elements
in their spectra. Such spectral lines were discovered also in X-ray spectra of
neutron stars and X-ray afterglows of GRBs. Recently, Zakharov et al. (MNRAS,
2003, 342, 1325) described a procedure to estimate an upper limit of the
magnetic fields in regions from which X-ray photons are emitted. The contributors
simulated typical profiles of the iron $K_\alpha$ line in the presence of
magnetic field and compared them with observational data in the framework of
the widely accepted accretion disk model. Here we further consider typical
Zeeman splitting in the framework of a model of non-flat accretion flows, which
is a generalization of previous consideration into non-equatorial plane motion
of particles emitting X-ray photons.
 Using perspective facilities of space borne instruments (e.g. Constellation-X
mission) a better resolution of the blue peak structure of iron $K_\alpha$ line
will allow to evaluate the magnetic fields with higher accuracy.
