In this work we present an analysis of a spatially non homogeneous ultimatum
game. By considering different underlying topologies as substrates on top of
which the game takes place we obtain nontrivial behaviors for the evolution of
the strategies of the players. We analyze separately the effect of the size of
the neighborhood and the spatial structure. Whereas this last effect is the
most significant one, we show that even for disordered networks and provided
the neighborhood of each site is small, the results can be significantly
different from those obtained in the case of fully connected networks.
