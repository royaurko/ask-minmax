Many recent large-scale studies of interaction networks have focused on
networks of accumulated contacts. In this paper we explore social networks of
ongoing relationships with an emphasis on dynamical aspects. We find a
distribution of response times (times between consecutive contacts of different
direction between two actors) that has a power-law shape over a large range. We
also argue that the distribution of relationship duration (the time between the
first and last contacts between actors) is exponentially decaying. Methods to
reanalyze the data to compensate for the finite sampling time are proposed. We
find that the degree distribution for networks of ongoing contacts fits better
to a power-law than the degree distribution of the network of accumulated
contacts do. We see that the clustering and assortative mixing coefficients are
of the same order for networks of ongoing and accumulated contacts, and that
the structural fluctuations of the former are rather large.
