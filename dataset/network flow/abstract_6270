This paper looks at five U.S. cities (Austin, Cleveland, Nashville, Portland,
and Washington, DC) and explores strategies being employed by community
activists and local governments to create and sustain community networking
projects. In some cities, community networking initiatives are relatively
mature, while in others they are in early or intermediate stages. The paper
looks at several factors that help explain the evolution of community networks
in cities:
  1) Local government support; 2) Federal support 3) Degree of community
activism, often reflected by public-private partnerships that help support
community networks.
  In addition to these (more or less) measurable elements of local support, the
case studies enable description of the different objectives of community
networks in different cities. Several community networking projects aim to
improve the delivery of government services (e.g., Portland and Cleveland),
some have a job-training focus (e.g., Austin, Washington, DC), others are
oriented very explicitly toward community building (Nashville, DC), and others
toward neighborhood entrepreneurship (Portland and Cleveland).
  The paper ties the case studies together by asking whether community
technology initiatives contribute to social capital in the cities studied.
