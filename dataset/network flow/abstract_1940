The Trinity (Brodsky et al., 2007) spam classification system is based on a
distributed hash table that is implemented using a structured peer-to-peer
overlay. Such an overlay must be capable of processing hundreds of messages per
second, and must be able to route messages to their destination even in the
presence of failures and malicious peers that misroute packets or inject
fraudulent routing information into the system. Typically there is tension
between the requirements to route messages securely and efficiently in the
overlay.
  We describe a secure and efficient routing extension that we developed within
the I3 (Stoica et al. 2004) implementation of the Chord (Stoica et al. 2001)
overlay. Secure routing is accomplished through several complementary
approaches: First, peers in close proximity form overlapping groups that police
themselves to identify and mitigate fraudulent routing information. Second, a
form of random routing solves the problem of entire packet flows passing
through a malicious peer. Third, a message authentication mechanism links each
message to it sender, preventing spoofing. Fourth, each peer's identifier links
the peer to its network address, and at the same time uniformly distributes the
peers in the key-space.
  Lastly, we present our initial evaluation of the system, comprising a 255
peer overlay running on a local cluster. We describe our methodology and show
that the overhead of our secure implementation is quite reasonable.
