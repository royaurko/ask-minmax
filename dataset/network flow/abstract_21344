Anderson localization is studied for two-dimensional Dirac fermions in the
presence of strong random scattering. Averaging with respect to the latter
leads to a graphical representation of the correlation function with entangled
random walks and three-vertices which connect three different types of
propagators. This approach indicates Anderson localization along a
semi-infinite line, where the localization length is inversely proportional to
the scattering rate.
