A new model about cascading occurrences caused by perturbation is established
to search after the mechanism because of which catastrophes in networks occur.
We investigate the avalanche dynamics of our model on 2-dimension Euclidean
lattices and scale-free networks and find out the avalanche dynamic behaviors
is very sensitive to the topological structure of networks. The experiments
show that the catastrophes occur much more frequently in scale-free networks
than in Euclidean lattices and the greatest catastrophe in scale-free networks
is much more serious than that in Euclidean lattices. Further more, we have
studied how to reduce the catastrophes' degree, and have schemed out an
effective strategy, called targeted safeguard-strategy for scale-free networks.
