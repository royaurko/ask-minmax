We consider the model of spatially distributed population consisting of two
species with "\textsl{predator\,--\,prey}" interaction; each of the species
occupies two stations. Transfer of individuals between the stations (migration)
is not random and yields the maximization of a net reproduction of each
species. Besides, each species implements reflexive behavior strategy to
determine the optimal migration flow.
