We consider branes embedded in spacetimes of codimension one and two, with a
warped metric tensor for the subspace parallel to the brane. We study a variety
of brane-world solutions arising by introducing a Schwarzschild-like black hole
metric on the brane and we investigate the properties of the corresponding
higher-dimensional spacetime. We demonstrate that normalizable bulk modes lead
to a vanishing flow of energy through the naked singularities. From this point
of view, these singularities are harmless.
