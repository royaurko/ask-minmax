Research into human dynamical systems has long sought to identify robust
signals for human behavior. We have discovered a series of social network-based
indicators that are reliable predictors of team creativity and collaborative
innovation. We extract these signals from electronic records of interpersonal
interactions, including e-mail, and face-to-face interaction measured via
sociometric badges. The first of these signals is Rotating Leadership,
measuring the degree to which, over time, actors in a team vary in how central
they are to team's communication network's structure. The second is Rotating
Contribution, which measures the degree to which, over time, actors in a team
vary in the ratio of communications they distribute versus receive. The third
is Prompt Response Time, which measures, over time, the responsiveness of
actors to one another's communications. Finally, we demonstrate the predictive
utility of these signals in a variety of contexts, showing them to be robust to
various methods of evaluating innovation.
