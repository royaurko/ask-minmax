We present a simple yet effective routing strategy inspired by coverage
control, which delays the onset of congestion on traffic networks, by
introducing a control parameter. The routing algorithm allows a trade-off
between the congestion level and the distance to the destination. Numerical
verification of the strategy is provided on a number of representative examples
in SUMO, a well known micro agent simulator used for the analysis of traffic
networks. We find that it is crucial in many cases to tune the given control
parameters to some optimal value in order to reduce congestion in the most
effective way. The effects of different network structural properties are
connected to the level of congestion and the optimal range for setting the
control parameters.
