We build a toy model of the Wilson-Kogut renormalization group in one
dimensional Quantum Mechanics. With it, we show how the RG flow in the space of
1-D S matrices of finite range defines, as renormalized interactions, the known
four parametric set of contact interactions, thus providing a suitable
framework for its study.
