We study the $p$-harmonic flow from the unit disk $D^2$ to the unit sphere
$S^2$ under rotational symmetry. We show that the Dirichlet problem with
constant boundary conditions is locally well-posed in the class of classical
solutions and we also give a sufficient criterion, in terms of the boundary
condition, for the derivative of the solutions to blow-up in finite time.
