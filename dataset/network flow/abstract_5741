Networks grow and evolve by local events, such as the addition of new nodes
and links, or rewiring of links from one node to another. We show that
depending on the frequency of these processes two topologically different
networks can emerge, the connectivity distribution following either a
generalized power-law or an exponential. We propose a continuum theory that
predicts these two regimes as well as the scaling function and the exponents,
in good agreement with the numerical results. Finally, we use the obtained
predictions to fit the connectivity distribution of the network describing the
professional links between movie actors.
