Boolean networks are an important class of computational models for molecular
interaction networks. Boolean canalization, a type of hierarchical clustering
of the inputs of a Boolean function, has been extensively studied in the
context of network modeling where each layer of canalization adds a degree of
stability in the dynamics of the network. Recently, dynamic network control
approaches have been used for the design of new therapeutic interventions and
for other applications such as stem cell reprogramming. This work studies the
role of canalization in the control of Boolean molecular networks. It provides
a method for identifying the potential edges to control in the wiring diagram
of a network for avoiding undesirable state transitions. The method is based on
identifying appropriate input-output combinations on undesirable transitions
that can be modified using the edges in the wiring diagram of the network.
Moreover, a method for estimating the number of changed transitions in the
state space of the system as a result of an edge deletion in the wiring diagram
is presented. The control methods of this paper were applied to a mutated
cell-cycle model and to a \textit{p53-mdm2} model to identify potential control
targets.
