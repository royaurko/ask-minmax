The problem of noncooperative resource allocation in a
multipoint-to-multipoint cellular network is considered in this paper. The
considered scenario is general enough to represent several key instances of
modern wireless networks such as a multicellular network, a peer-to-peer
network (interference channel), and a wireless network equipped with
femtocells. In particular, the problem of joint transmit waveforms adaptation,
linear receiver design, and transmit power control is examined. Several utility
functions to be maximized are considered, and, among them, we cite the received
SINR, and the transmitter energy efficiency, which is measured in bit/Joule,
and represents the number of successfully delivered bits for each energy unit
used for transmission. Resorting to the theory of potential games,
noncooperative games admitting Nash equilibria in multipoint-to-multipoint
cellular networks regardless of the channel coefficient realizations are
designed. Computer simulations confirm that the considered games are
convergent, and show the huge benefits that resource allocation schemes can
bring to the performance of wireless data networks.
