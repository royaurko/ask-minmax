The purpose of this article is to provide a general overview of curvature
functional in Finsler geometry and use its information to introduce the
gradient flow on Finsler manifolds. For this purpose, we first prove that the
space of Finslerian metrics is a Riemannian manifold. Then it is given a
decomposition for the tangent space of this Riemannian manifold by means of
Riemannian metric and the Berger-Ebin theorem. Next, Finslerian functional is
introduced and show that Akbar-Zadeh curvature functional is the example of
Finslerian functional. After that, the critical points of Akbar-Zadeh
functional are found in two situations. Based on the constant Indicatrix volume
and restricting its variations to the point-wise conformal transformations, we
prove that the critical points of functional are metrics of constant
Ricci-directional curvature. Finally, the gradient flow of Akbar-Zadeh
curvature functional in this special direction is introduced as a good
candidate for evolving to the metric with constant second type scalar curvature
and we compare this new ow with introducing Ricci flow in Finsler geometry.
