Boolean networks are used to model biological networks such as gene
regulatory networks. Often Boolean networks show very chaotic behavior which is
sensitive to any small perturbations.In order to reduce the chaotic behavior
and to attain stability in the gene regulatory network,nested canalizing
functions(NCF)are best suited NCF and its variants have a wide range of
applications in system biology. Previously many work were done on the
application of canalizing functions but there were fewer methods to check if
any arbitrary Boolean function is canalizing or not. In this paper, by using
Karnaugh Map this problem gas been solved and also it has been shown that when
the canalizing functions of n variable is given, all the canalizing functions
of n+1 variable could be generated by the method of concatenation. In this
paper we have uniquely identified the number of NCFs having a particular
hamming distance (H.D) generated by each variable x as starting canalizing
input. Partially nested canalizing functions of 4 variables have also been
studied in this paper. Keywords: Karnaugh Map, Canalizing function, Nested
