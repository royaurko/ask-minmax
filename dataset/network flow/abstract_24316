One of the fundamental concepts in the statistical mechanics field is that of
ensemble. Ensembles of graphs are collections of graphs, defined according to
certain rules. The two most used ensembles in network theory are the
microcanonical and the grandcanonical (whose definitions mimick the classical
ones, originally proposed by Boltzmann and Gibbs), even if the latter is far
more used than the former to carry on the analytical calculations. For binary
(undirected or directed) networks, the grandcanonical ensemble is defined by
considering all the graphs with the same number of vertices and a variable
number of links, ranging from 0 to the maximum: N(N-1)/2 for binary, undirected
graphs and N(N-1) for binary, directed graphs. Even if it is commonly used
almost exclusively as a tool to calculate the average of some topological
quantity of interest, its structure is so rich to deserve an analysis on its
own. In this paper a logic-algebraic characterization of the grandcanonical
ensemble of binary graphs is provided.
