In this paper, we introduce a novel, general purpose, technique for faster
sampling of nodes over an online social network. Specifically, unlike
traditional random walk which wait for the convergence of sampling distribution
to a predetermined target distribution - a waiting process that incurs a high
query cost - we develop WALK-ESTIMATE, which starts with a much shorter random
walk, and then proactively estimate the sampling probability for the node taken
before using acceptance-rejection sampling to adjust the sampling probability
to the predetermined target distribution. We present a novel backward random
walk technique which provides provably unbiased estimations for the sampling
probability, and demonstrate the superiority of WALK-ESTIMATE over traditional
random walks through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments over real
world online social networks.
