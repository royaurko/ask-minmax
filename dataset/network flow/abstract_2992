The various flow phenomena observed at energies between 50 AMeV and 160 AGeV
are reviewed. I first define three types of flow: directed flow and elliptic
flow, which are the two first Fourier components of the azimuthal distribution
in non-central collisions; radial flow, which is deduced from an analysis of
transverse momentum spectra in central collisions. Then, I review the
observations of directed flow and elliptic flow, with emphasis on recent
results. I discuss their dependence on various parameters: global geometry
(impact parameter, mass numbers of colliding nuclei and bombarding energy) and
individual observables (rapidity, transverse momentum and particle type).
Finally, I explain how azimuthal distributions can be measured experimentally.
