We examine the thermodynamic properties of recently constructed black hole
solutions in SL(3,R) x SL(3,R) Chern-Simons theory in the presence of a
chemical potential for spin-3 charge, which acts as an irrelevant deformation
of the dual CFT with W_3 x W_3 symmetry. The smoothness or holonomy conditions
admit four branches of solutions describing a flow between two AdS_3
backgrounds corresponding to two different CFTs. The dominant branch at low
temperatures, connected to the BTZ black hole, merges smoothly with a
thermodynamically unstable branch and disappears at higher temperatures. We
confirm that the UV region of the flow satisfies the Ward identities of a CFT
with W_3^(2) x W_3^(2) symmetry deformed by a spin-3/2 current. This allows to
identify the precise map between UV and IR thermodynamic variables. We find
that the high temperature regime is dominated by a black hole branch whose
thermodynamics can only be consistently inferred with reference to this W_3^(2)
x W_3^(2) CFT.
