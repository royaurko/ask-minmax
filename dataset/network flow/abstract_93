We apply to radio mini-halo candidates a model for electron re-acceleration
in cooling flows (Gitti, Brunetti & Setti 2002). In agreement with the basic
idea of the model, we find that the power required for the re-acceleration of
the electron population is only a small fraction of the maximum power that can
be extracted from the cooling flow (as estimated on the basis of the standard
model). Observationally, we notice that the strongest radio mini-halos are
found in association with the most powerful cooling flows, and that cooling
flow powers are orders of magnitude larger than the integrated radio power.
Possible effects of new Chandra and XMM-Newton estimates of $\dot{M}$ on this
trend are considered: we conclude that even if earlier derived cooling rates
were overestimated, cooling flow powers are still well above the radio powers
emitted by mini-halos.
