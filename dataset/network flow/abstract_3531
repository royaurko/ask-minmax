Content dissemination networks are pervasive in todays Internet. Examples of
content dissemination networks include peer-to-peer networks (P2P), content
distribution networks (CDN) and information centric networks (ICN). In this
paper, we propose a new system design for information centric networks which
leverages opportunistic searching, routing and caching. Our system design is
based on an hierarchical tiered structure. Random walks are used to find
content inside each tier, and gateways across tiers are used to direct requests
towards servers placed in the top tier, which are accessed in case content
replicas are not found in lower tiers. Then, we propose a model to analyze the
system in consideration. The model yields metrics such as mean time to find a
content and the load experienced by custodians as a function of the network
topology. Using the model, we identify trade-offs between these two metrics,
and numerically show how to find the optimal time to live of the random walks.
