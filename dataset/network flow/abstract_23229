For the recent four years we have been studying feedback heating in cooling
flow (CF) clusters by AGN activity that inflate bubbles by jets; this short
contribution to a meeting summarizes our main results. To achieve our results
we had to self-consistently inflate the bubbles with jets, rather than inject
them artificially. Our main results are as follows
  (1) Feedback mechanisms that are based on Bondi accretion fail. Instead, the
accretion to the central super-massive black hole (SMBH) is in the form of cold
dense blobs that fall-in from an extended region. (2) Slow massive wide (SMW)
jets, or rapidly precessing jets, can inflate bubbles similar to those observed
in CF clusters. (3) Contrary to some claims in the literature, the inflated
bubbles are stable for a relatively long time, becoming unstable only at later
times. (4) A single bubble inflation episode excites multiple sound waves and
shocks. These can then heat the intracluster medium (ICM). (5) Mixing of the
bubble material to the ICM is efficient, and can serve as a main heating
channel. (6) The heating processes work in all directions, and can explain the
heating of the ICM in CF in clusters and in galaxies.
