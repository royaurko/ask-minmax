In this paper we introduce the notion of optimization under control and
communication constraint in a robotic network. Starting from a general setup,
we focus our attention on the problem of achieving rendezvous in minimum time
for a network of first order agents with bounded inputs and limited range
communication. We propose two dynamic control and communication laws. These
laws are based on consensus algorithms for distributed computation of the
minimal enclosing ball and orthotope of a set of points. We prove that these
control laws converge to the optimal solution of the centralized problem (i.e.,
when no communication constrains are enforced) as the bound on the control
input goes to zero. Moreover, we give a bound for the time complexity of one of
the two laws.
