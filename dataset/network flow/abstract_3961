In this paper, our recently proposed mobile-conductance based analytical
framework is extended to the sparse settings, thus offering a unified tool for
analyzing information spreading in mobile networks. A penalty factor is
identified for information spreading in sparse networks as compared to the
connected scenario, which is then intuitively interpreted and verified by
simulations. With the analytical results obtained, the mobility-connectivity
tradeoff is quantitatively analyzed to determine how much mobility may be
exploited to make up for network connectivity deficiency.
