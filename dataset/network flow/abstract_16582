A choice of wireless technologies is available today. Not all of them are
suitable to be used in a instrument control network at a neutron scattering
facility. This paper will start with an overview of the wireless communication
protocols IrDA, IEEE 802.11 WLAN, Bluetooth and protocols used by cellular
phones. Afterwards some thoughts on network layout and the results of tests
performed with 802.11b and Bluetooth equipment are presented.
