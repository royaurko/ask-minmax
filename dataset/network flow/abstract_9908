Anisotropic flows ($v_1$, $v_2$ and $v_4$) of light nuclear clusters are
studied by a nucleonic transport model in intermediate energy heavy ion
collisions. The number-of-nucleon scalings of the directed flow ($v_1$) and
elliptic flow ($v_2$) are demonstrated for light nuclear clusters. Moreover,
the ratios of $v_4/v_2^2$ of nuclear clusters show a constant value of 1/2
regardless of the transverse momentum. The above phenomena can be understood by
the coalescence mechanism in nucleonic level and are worthy to be explored in
experiments.
