We review the Symmetric Unitary One Matrix Models. In particular we discuss
the string equation in the operator formalism, the mKdV flows and the Virasoro
Constraints. We focus on the $\t$-function formalism for the flows and we
describe its connection to the (big cell of the) Sato Grassmannian $\Gr$ via
the Plucker embedding of $\Gr$ into a fermionic Fock space. Then the space of
solutions to the string equation is an explicitly computable subspace of
$\Gr\times\Gr$ which is invariant under the flows.
