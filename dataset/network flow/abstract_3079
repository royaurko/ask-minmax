Torus networks of moderate degree have been widely used in the supercomputer
industry. Tori are superb when used for executing applications that require
near-neighbor communications. Nevertheless, they are not so good when dealing
with global communications. Hence, typical 3D implementations have evolved to
5D networks, among other reasons, to reduce network distances. Most of these
big systems are mixed-radix tori which are not the best option for minimizing
distances and efficiently using network resources. This paper is focused on
improving the topological properties of these networks.
  By using integral matrices to deal with Cayley graphs over Abelian groups, we
have been able to propose and analyze a family of high-dimensional grid-based
interconnection networks. As they are built over $n$-dimensional grids that
induce a regular tiling of the space, these topologies have been denoted
\textsl{lattice graphs}. We will focus on cubic crystal lattices for modeling
symmetric 3D networks. Other higher dimensional networks can be composed over
these graphs, as illustrated in this research. Easy network partitioning can
also take advantage of this network composition operation. Minimal routing
algorithms are also provided for these new topologies. Finally, some practical
issues such as implementability and preliminary performance evaluations have
been addressed.
