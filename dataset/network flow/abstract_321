Network flow interdiction analysis studies by how much the value of a maximum
flow in a network can be diminished by removing components of the network
constrained to some budget. Although this problem is strongly NP-complete on
general networks, pseudo-polynomial algorithms were found for planar networks
with a single source and a single sink and without the possibility to remove
vertices. In this work we introduce pseudo-polynomial algorithms which overcome
some of the restrictions of previous methods. We propose a planarity-preserving
transformation that allows to incorporate vertex removals and vertex capacities
in pseudo-polynomial interdiction algorithms for planar graphs. Additionally, a
pseudo-polynomial algorithm is introduced for the problem of determining the
minimal interdiction budget which is at least needed to make it impossible to
satisfy the demand of all sink nodes, on planar networks with multiple sources
and sinks satisfying that the sum of the supplies at the source nodes equals
the sum of the demands at the sink nodes. Furthermore we show that the
k-densest subgraph problem on planar graphs can be reduced to a network flow
interdiction problem on a planar graph with multiple sources and sinks and
polynomially bounded input numbers. However it is still not known if either of
these problems can be solved in polynomial time.
