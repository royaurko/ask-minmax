In this paper we study mobile ad hoc wireless networks using the notion of
evolving connectivity graphs. In such systems, the connectivity changes over
time due to the intermittent contacts of mobile terminals. In particular, we
are interested in studying the expected flooding time when full connectivity
cannot be ensured at each point in time. Even in this case, due to finite
contact times durations, connected components may appear in the connectivity
graph. Hence, this represents the intermediate case between extreme cases of
fully mobile ad hoc networks and fully static ad hoc networks. By using a
generalization of edge-Markovian graphs, we extend the existing models based on
sparse scenarios to this intermediate case and calculate the expected flooding
time. We also propose bounds that have reduced computational complexity.
Finally, numerical results validate our models.
