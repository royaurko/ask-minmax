Exact analytic solutions are derived for radiation in time-dependent
relativistic flows. The flows are spherically-symmetric homologous explosions
or implosions of matter with a grey extinction coefficient. The solutions are
suitable for testing numerical transfer codes, and this is illustrated for a
fully relativistic Monte Carlo code.
