The problem of designing new physical-layer network coding (PNC) schemes via
lattice partitions is considered. Building on a recent work by Nazer and
Gastpar, who demonstrated its asymptotic gain using information-theoretic
tools, we take an algebraic approach to show its potential in non-asymptotic
settings. We first relate Nazer-Gastpar's approach to the fundamental theorem
of finitely generated modules over a principle ideal domain. Based on this
connection, we generalize their code construction and simplify their encoding
and decoding methods. This not only provides a transparent understanding of
their approach, but more importantly, it opens up the opportunity to design
efficient and practical PNC schemes. Finally, we apply our framework for PNC to
a Gaussian relay network and demonstrate its advantage over conventional PNC
schemes.
