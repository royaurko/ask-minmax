Granular simulations are used to probe the particle scale dynamics at short,
intermediate, and long time scales for gravity driven, dense granular flows
down an inclined plane. On approach to the angle of repose, where motion
ceases, the dynamics become intermittent over intermediate times, with strong
temporal correlations between particle motions -- temporally heterogeneous
dynamics. This intermittency is characterised through large scale structural
events whereby the contact network periodically spans the system. A
characteristic time scale associated with these processes increases as the
stopped state is approached. These features are discussed in the context of the
dynamics of supercooled liquids near the glass transition.
