The purpose of this article is to study the statics and dynamics of nanotubes
by using the methods of continuum mechanics. The nanotube can be filled with
only a liquid or a vapour phase according to the physicochemical
characteristics of the wall and to the disjoining pressure associated with the
liquid and vapour mother bulks of the fluid, regardless of the nature of the
external mother bulk. In dynamics, flows through nanotubes can be much more
important than classical Poiseuille flows. When the external mother bulk is of
vapour, the flow can be a million times larger than the classical flows when
slippage on wall does not exist.
