We present a first-principles theory for plug-free dense granular flow. This
is done by coarse-graining directly the microscopic dynamics and deriving an
explicit relation between the macroscopic stress and strain rate tensors. The
newly derived relation not only differs significantly from that of the existing
empirical models for such flows but it also provides a novel understanding of
the effect of rigid-like rotational regions in the flow.
