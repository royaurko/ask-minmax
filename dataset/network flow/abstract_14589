Measurement of the free flux flow resistance in monocrystalline highly
anisotropic BSCCO reveals a low field magneto-resistive effect nearly 100 times
that expected from a naive application of the Bardeen-Stephen rule R/Rn =
B/Bc2. Furthermore in the vortex solid phase it saturates to a constant value
at about Hc2/100 as if the vortices were moving 100 times faster than expected.
An attempt to account for this behavior by a combination of sheared planar
vortex flow obeying the BS rule and the quasi-particle c axis conductivity
between the Josephson coupled superconducting planes is only partially
successful. In particular it is unable to account for the saturation feature
which occurs in both optimally and underdoped samples in the low temperature
vortex solid phase.
