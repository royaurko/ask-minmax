We propose and study a model of information or disease spreading on multiplex
social networks, in which agents interact or communicate through multiple
channels (layers), say online vs. offline, and there exists a layer-switching
overhead for transmission across the interaction layers. The model is
characterized by the path-dependent transmissibility over a contact, that is
dynamically determined dependent on both incoming and outgoing transmission
layers due to the switching overhead. We formulate a generalized theory with a
mapping to deal with such a path-dependent transmissibility, and demonstrate
that network multiplexity can bring about non-additive and non-monotonic
effects in spreading dynamics. Our results suggest that explicit consideration
of multiplexity can be crucial in realistic modeling of spreading processes on
social networks in an era of ever-diversifying social interaction layers.
