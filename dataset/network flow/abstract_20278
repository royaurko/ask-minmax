We perform three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the ram pressure
stripping of the hot extended gaseous halo of a massive galaxy using the
k-epsilon sub-grid turbulence model at Mach numbers 0.9, 1.1 and 1.9. The
k-epsilon model is used to simulate high Reynolds number flows by increasing
the transport coefficients in regions of high turbulence. We find that the
initial, instantaneous stripping is the same whether or not the k-epsilon model
is implemented and is in agreement with the results of other studies. However
the use of the k-epsilon model leads to five times less gas remaining after
stripping by a supersonic flow has proceeded for 10 Gyr, which is more
consistent with what simple analytic calculations indicate. Hence the continual
Kelvin-Helmholtz stripping plays a significant role in the ram pressure
stripping of the haloes of massive galaxies. To properly account for this,
simulations of galaxy clusters will require the use of sub-grid turbulence
models
