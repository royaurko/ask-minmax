Recent X-ray observations have revealed a universal temperature profile of
the intracluster gas of non-cooling flow clusters which is flat for r \le 0.2
r_{180}. Numerical simulations, however, obtain a steeper temperature profile
in the inner region. We study the effect of thermal conduction on the
intracluster gas in non-cooling flow clusters in light of these observations,
using the steep temperature profiles obtained by contributors of numerical
simulations. We find that given 10^{10} yr for the intracluster gas to evolve,
thermal conduction should be suppressed from the classical value by a factor
\sim 10^{-3} in order to explain the observations.
