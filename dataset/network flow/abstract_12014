The atomic structure of amorphous materials is believed to be well described
by the continuous random network model. We present an algorithm for the
generation of large, high-quality continuous random networks. The algorithm is
a variation of the "sillium" approach introduced by Wooten, Winer, and Weaire.
By employing local relaxation techniques, local atomic rearrangements can be
tried that scale almost independently of system size. This scaling property of
the algorithm paves the way for the generation of realistic device-size atomic
networks.
