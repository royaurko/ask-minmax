We summarize measurements of elliptic flow and higher order flow harmonics
performed by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Results on event-averaged flow
measurements and event-plane correlations in Pb+Pb collisions are discussed
along with the event-by-event flow measurements. Further, we summarize results
on flow in p+Pb collisions.
