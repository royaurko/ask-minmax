RHIC data have shown robust collective flows, including recent spectacular
``conical flow'' from quenched jets: that confirms that QGP above the critical
line is in a strongly coupled regime. One way to study Non-Abelian classical
strongly coupled plasmas is via molecular dynamics, which was recently extended
to plasmas with electric and magntic charges. First results on its transport
(diffusion and viscosity) are reported.
  AdS/CFT correspondence is another actively pursuit approach to strong
coupling regime: we review new results for heavy quark motion and even complete
picture of conical flow, obtained from linearized gravity dual. Recent
developments in (non-linearized) gravity aims at reproduction of the whole
time-dependent picture of the explosion. We finally compare transport
properties obtained from RHIC data to those obtained in MD and AdS/CFT.
