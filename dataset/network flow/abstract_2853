A high-speed jet flowing inside of a partially-open hydraulic valve is
accompanied by a reaction force, also referred to as flow force. The nature of
this force has remained a mystery despite an extensive research effort spanning
many decades. The momentum theory on the flow force by Lee and Blackburn (1952)
explains the origin of the flow force and offers a design solution to shape the
valve spool as a turbine bucket. It provides a model to calculate the
compensated flow force as well. This paper shows that the model applies to a
different flow case due to incorrect assumptions made. A corrected equation is
presented based on a detailed analysis of the static-pressure distribution in
the valve cavity as well as on a literature review of pressure loss in
diffusers and nozzles. The new equation is based on the compensation taking
place upstream of the valve orifice, not downstream as assumed by the momentum
theory. The new model can be applied to chamfers or notches on the valve spool
without the need to machine a complete turbine-bucket profile. Keywords: flow
