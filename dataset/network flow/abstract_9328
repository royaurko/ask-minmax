With larger memory capacities and the ability to link into wireless networks,
more and more students uses palmtop and handheld computers for learning
activities. However, existing software for Web-based learning is not
well-suited for such mobile devices, both due to constrained user interfaces as
well as communication effort required. A new generation of applications for the
learning domain that is explicitly designed to work on these kinds of small
mobile devices has to be developed. For this purpose, we introduce CARLA, a
cooperative learning system that is designed to act in hybrid wireless
networks. As a cooperative environment, CARLA aims at disseminating teaching
material, notes, and even components of itself through both fixed and mobile
networks to interested nodes. Due to the mobility of nodes, CARLA deals with
upcoming problems such as network partitions and synchronization of teaching
material, resource dependencies, and time constraints.
