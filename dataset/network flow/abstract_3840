We propose a simple growing model for the evolution of small-world networks.
It is introduced as a modified BA model in which all the edges connected to the
new nodes are made locally to the creator and its nearest neighbors. It is
found that this model can produce small-world networks with power-law degree
distributions. Properties of our model, including the degree distribution,
clustering, and the average path length are compared with that of the BA model.
Since most real networks are both scale-free and small-world networks, our
model may provide a satisfactory description for empirical characteristics of
real networks.
