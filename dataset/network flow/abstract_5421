We compare the elastic response of spring networks whose contact geometry is
derived from real packings of frictionless discs, to networks obtained by
randomly cutting bonds in a highly connected network derived from a
well-compressed packing. We find that the shear response of packing-derived
networks, and both the shear and compression response of randomly cut networks,
are all similar: the elastic moduli vanish linearly near jamming, and
distributions characterizing the local geometry of the response scale with
distance to jamming. Compression of packing-derived networks is exceptional:
the elastic modulus remains constant and the geometrical distributions do not
exhibit simple scaling. We conclude that the compression response of jammed
packings is anomalous, rather than the shear response.
