Gynandromorphs are creatures where at least two different body sections are a
different sex. Bilateral gynandromorphs are half male and half female. Here we
develop a theory of gynandromorph ontogeny based on developmental control
networks. The theory explains the embryogenesis of all known variations of
gynandromorphs found in multicellular organisms. The theory also predicts a
large variety of more subtle gynandromorphic morphologies yet to be discovered.
The network theory of gynandromorph development has direct relevance to
understanding sexual dimorphism (differences in morphology between male and
female organisms of the same species) and medical pathologies such as
hemihyperplasia (asymmetric development of normally symmetric body parts in a
unisexual individual). The network theory of gynandromorphs brings up
fundamental open questions about developmental control in ontogeny. This in
turn suggests a new theory of the origin and evolution of species that is based
on cooperative interactions and conflicts between developmental control
networks in the haploid genomes and epigenomes of potential sexual partners for
reproduction. This network-based theory of the origin of species is a
paradigmatic shift in our understanding of evolutionary processes that goes
beyond gene-centered theories.
