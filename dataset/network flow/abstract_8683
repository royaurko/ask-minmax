I present empirical evidence that turbulent flows are closely analogous to
critical phenomena, from a reanalysis of friction factor measurements in rough
pipes. The data collapse found here corresponds to Widom scaling near critical
points, and implies that a full understanding of turbulence requires explicit
accounting for boundary roughness.
