In IPTV networks, channel change latency is considered as a major obstacle in
achieving broadcast-level quality video delivery. Because of the bandwidth
limitations observed at the client side, users typically have access to a
limited number of channels. As a result, channel change requests oftentimes
need to go through the network, thereby leading to significant delays. In this
paper, we address this problem by proposing a resource-efficient time-shifted
channel reordering mechanism to minimize the channel change latency. The
proposed framework exploits the differing key-frame delivery times for the
adjacent sessions to dynamically arrange the switching order during the surfing
periods. The simulation results show that, with the proposed framework, more
than 50% improvement can be achieved in channel change latency without
introducing any overhead in the network.
