This review paper presents analytical information regarding the transfer of
TCP data flows on paths towards interconnected wireless systems, with emphasis
on 3G cellular networks. The focus is on protocol modifications in face of
problems arising from terminal mobility and wireless transmission. The
objective of this paper is not to present an exhaustive review of the
literature, but to filter out the causes of poor TCP performance in such
systems and give a rationalized view of measures that can be taken against
them.
