In this paper, I perform mental experiment to analyze hypothetical process of
mind uploading. That process suggested as a way to achieve resurrection of
human consciousness. Mind uploading can be seen as a migration process of the
core mental functions, which migrate from a human brain to an artificial
environment. To simulate the process, I suggest a topological approach which is
based on a formalism of information geometry. Geometrical formalism lets us
simulate the toy mind as geometrical structures as well as gives us powerful
geometrical and topological methods for analysis of the information system.
This approach leads to the insight about using holographic model as an analogy
for the mind migration to an artificial environment. This model represents the
toy mind functionality in terms of information geometry (as a geometrical
shape) on information manifold. Such shape can have distributed holographic
representation. This representation gives us delocalized representation of the
system. At the same time, the process of creating the holographic
representation gives us a strategy to migrate from original to an artificial
environment and back. The interface between brain and an environment is modeled
as an entropy flow which is defined as a geometrical flow on information
manifold. Such flow is an analogy of holography recording for the toy mind. The
opposite process of holography reconstruction is modeled by none-local
Hamiltonians defined on the information manifold.
