We explore the Hawk-Dove game on networks with topologies ranging from
regular lattices to random graphs with small-world networks in between. This is
done by means of computer simulations using several update rules for the
population evolutionary dynamics. We find the overall result that cooperation
is sometimes inhibited and sometimes enhanced in those network structures, with
respect to the mixing population case. The differences are due to different
update rules and depend on the gain-to-cost ratio. We analyse and qualitatively
explain this behavior by using local topological arguments.
