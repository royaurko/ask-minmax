In this paper it is shown that for substantial increase of video quality in
wireless network it is necessary to execute two obligatory points on
modernization of the communication scheme. The player on the received part
should throw back automatically duplicated RTP packets, server of streaming
video should duplicate the packets containing the information of key frames.
Coefficients of the mathematical model describing video quality in wireless
network have been found for WiFi and 3G standards and codecs MPEG-2 and MPEG-4
(DivX). The special experimental technique which has allowed collecting and
processing the data has been developed for calculation of values of factors.
