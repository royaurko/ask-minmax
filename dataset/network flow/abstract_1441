Centrality is one of the most studied concepts in social network analysis.
There is a huge literature regarding centrality measures, as ways to identify
the most relevant users in a social network. The challenge is to find measures
that can be computed efficiently, and that can be able to classify the users
according to relevance criteria as close as possible to reality.
  We address this problem in the context of the Twitter network, an online
social networking service with millions of users and an impressive flow of
messages that are published and spread daily by interactions between users. In
Twitter there are different types of users, but most utility lies in finding
the most influential ones.
  The purpose of this article is to collect and classify the different measures
of influence of Twitter that exist so far in literature. The diversity of these
measures is very high. Some are based on simple metrics, and others are based
on complex mathematical models. Several measures are based on the PageRank
algorithm, traditionally used to rank the websites on the Internet. Some
measures consider the timeline of publication, others the content of the
messages, some are focused on specific topics, and others try to make
predictions. We consider all these aspects, and some additional others.
  Furthermore, we mention measures of activity and popularity, the traditional
mechanisms to correlate measures, and some simple but important aspects of
computational complexity for this particular context.
