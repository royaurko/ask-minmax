The expansion of the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma (sQGP) created
in Au+Au collisions at RHIC can be described by hydrodynamical models. Hadrons
are created after a freeze-out, thus their distribution describes the final
state of the evolution. The earlier stages can be analyzed via penetrating
probes like photon observables. These were measured in 2010 and 2011 by the
PHENIX experiment. Here we analyze an analytic, 1+3 dimensional perfect
relativistic hydrodynamic solution and calculate hadron and photon observables,
such as transverse momentum spectra, elliptic flow and correlation (HBT) radii.
We find that our model is not incompatible with the data, not even with the
direct photon elliptic flow. From fitting the data, we find that early
temperatures of the sQGP were well above the quark-hadron transition
temperature, in the hottest point, the center of the fireball the temperature
may have reached 507+-12 MeV. The equation of state of this quark matter can be
described by an average sound speed of 0.36+-0.02. We also predict a photon
source that is significantly larger in the out direction than in the side
direction.
