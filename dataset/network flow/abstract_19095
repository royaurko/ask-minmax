In this paper, how to optimally deploy base station density in a small cell
network with energy-efficient power control was investigated. Base stations
(BSs) and users form two independent Poisson point processes (PPPs) in the
network. Since user-centric cell association may lead to void cells that do not
have any users, the power of each BS is controlled in either all-on or on-off
mode depending on whether its cell is void or not. The average cell rates for
each power control mode are first found and their corresponding energy
efficiency is also characterized. The optimal BS density that maximizes the
energy efficiency under a given user density is theoretically proved to exist
and its value can be found numerically. Both analytical and simulated results
indicate that on-off power control is significantly superior to all-on power
control in terms of energy efficiency if BSs are deployed based on their
optimal energy-efficient density.
