Uplink power control plays a key role on the performance of uplink cellular
network. In this work, the power control factor ($\in[0,1]$) is evaluated based
on three parameters namely: average transmit power, coverage probability and
average rate. In other words, we evaluate power control factor such that
average transmit power should be low, coverage probability of cell-edge users
should be high and also average rate over all the uplink users should be high.
We show through numerical studies that the power control factor should be close
to $0.5$ in order to achieve an acceptable trade-off between these three
parameters.
