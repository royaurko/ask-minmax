A new formulation of the Navier-Stokes equation, in terms of the gradient of
the total mechanical energy, is derived for the time-averaged flows, and the
singular point possibly existing in the Navier-Stokes equation is exactly
found. Transition of a laminar flow to turbulence must be implemented via this
singular point. For pressure driven flows, this singular point corresponds to
the inflection point on the velocity profile. It is found that the stability of
a flow depends on the direction of the gradient of the total mechanical energy
for incompressible pressure-driven flow. When this direction is nearer the
normal direction of the streamline, the flow is more unstable. It is further
demonstrated that the existence of the singularity in the time-averaged
Navier-Stokes equation is the necessary and sufficient condition for the
turbulent transition. In turbulent transition, it is observed that the role of
disturbance is to promote the flow approaching to produce this singular point.
These results are the most important part of the energy gradient theory.
