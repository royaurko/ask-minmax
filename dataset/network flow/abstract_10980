The axiomatic theory of ideally glassy networks, which has proved effective
in describing phase diagrams and properties of chalcogenide and oxide glasses
and their foreign interfaces, is broadened here to include intermolecular
interactions in hydrogen-bonded polyalcohols such as glycerol, monosaccharides
(glucose), and the optimal bioprotective hydrogen-bonded disaccharide networks
formed from trehalose. The methods of Lagrangian mechanics and Maxwellian
scaffolds are useful at the molecular level when bonding hierarchies are
characterized by constraint counting similar to the chemical methods used by
Huckel and Pauling. Whereas Newtonian molecular dynamical methods are useful
for simulating large-scale interactions for times of order 10 ps, constraint
counting describes network properties on glassy (almost equilibrated) time
scales, which may be of cosmological order for oxide glasses, or years for
trehalose. The ideally glassy network of trehalose may consist of extensible
tandem sandwich arrays.
