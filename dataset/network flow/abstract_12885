Uniform Shear Flow is a prototype nonequilibrium state admitting detailed
study at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels via theory and computer
simulation. It is shown that the hydrodynamic equations for this state have a
long wavelength instability. This result is obtained first from the
Navier-Stokes equations and shown to apply at both low and high densities.
Next, higher order rheological effects are included using a model kinetic
theory. The results are compared favorably to those from Monte Carlo
simulation.
