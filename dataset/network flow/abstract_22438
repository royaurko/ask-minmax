We show that the balance between localized gain and nonlinear cubic
dissipation in the twodimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation allows for
existence of stable two-dimensional localized modes which we identify as
solitons. Such modes exist only when the gain is strong enough and the energy
flow exceeds certain threshold value. The observed solitons neither undergo
diffractive spreading nor collapse. Above the critical value of the gain the
symmetry breaking occurs and asymmetric dissipative solitons emerge.
