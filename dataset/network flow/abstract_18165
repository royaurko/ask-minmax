In hierarchical reliable multicast environment, makespan is the time that is
required to fully and successfully transmit a packet from the sender to all
receivers. Low makespan is vital for achieving high throughput with a TCP-like
window based sending scheme. In hierarchical reliable multicast methods, the
number of repair servers and their locations influence the makespan. In this
paper we propose a new method to decide the locations of repair servers that
can reduce the makespan in hierarchical reliable multicast networks. Our method
has a formulation based on mixed integer programming to analyze the makespan
minimization problem. A notable aspect of the formulation is that heterogeneous
links and packet losses are taken into account in the formulation. Three
different heuristics are presented to find the locations of repair servers in
reasonable time in the formulation. Through simulations, three heuristics are
carefully analyzed and compared on networks with different sizes. We also
evaluate our proposals on PGM (Pragmatic General Multicast) reliable multicast
protocol using ns-2 simulation. The results show that the our best heuristic is
close to the lower bound by a factor of 2.3 in terms of makespan and by a
factor of 5.5 in terms of the number of repair servers.
