The behavior of complex systems is determined not only by the topological
organization of their interconnections but also by the dynamical processes
taking place among their constituents. A faithful modeling of the dynamics is
essential because different dynamical processes may be affected very
differently by network topology. A full characterization of such systems thus
requires a formalization that encompasses both aspects simultaneously, rather
than relying only on the topological adjacency matrix. To achieve this, we
introduce the concept of flow graphs, namely weighted networks where dynamical
flows are embedded into the link weights. Flow graphs provide an integrated
representation of the structure and dynamics of the system, which can then be
analyzed with standard tools from network theory. Conversely, a structural
network feature of our choice can also be used as the basis for the
construction of a flow graph that will then encompass a dynamics biased by such
a feature. We illustrate the ideas by focusing on the mathematical properties
of generic linear processes on complex networks that can be represented as
biased random walks and also explore their dual consensus dynamics.
