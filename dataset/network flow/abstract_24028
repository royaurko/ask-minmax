The launching of Scopus and Google Scholar, and methodological developments
in Social Network Analysis have made many more indicators for evaluating
journals available than the traditional Impact Factor, Cited Half-life, and
Immediacy Index of the ISI. In this study, these new indicators are compared
with one another and with the older ones. Do the various indicators measure new
dimensions of the citation networks, or are they highly correlated among them?
Are they robust and relatively stable over time? Two main dimensions are
distinguished -- size and impact -- which together shape influence. The H-index
combines the two dimensions and can also be considered as an indicator of reach
(like Indegree). PageRank is mainly an indicator of size, but has important
interactions with centrality measures. The Scimago Journal Ranking (SJR)
indicator provides an alternative to the Journal Impact Factor, but the
computation is less easy.
