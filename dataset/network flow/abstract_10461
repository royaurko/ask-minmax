Research in network science has shown that many naturally occurring and
technologically constructed networks are scale free, that means a power law
degree distribution emerges from a growth model in which each new node attaches
to the existing network with a probability proportional to its number of links
(=degree). Little is known about whether the same principles of local
attachment and global properties apply to societies as well. Empirical evidence
from six ethnographic case studies shows that complex social networks have
significantly lower scaling exponents gamma ~ 1 than have been assumed in the
past. Apparently humans do not only look for the most prominent players to play
with. Moreover cooperation in humans is characterized through reciprocity, the
tendency to give to those from whom one has received in the past. Both
variables -- reciprocity and the scaling exponent -- are negatively correlated
($r=-0.767, sig=0.075$). If we include this effect in simulations of growing
networks, degree distributions emerge that are much closer to those empirically
observed. While the proportion of nodes with small degrees decreases
drastically as we introduce reciprocity, the scaling exponent is more robust
and changes only when a relatively large proportion of attachment decisions
follow this rule. If social networks are less scale free than previously
assumed this has far reaching implications for policy makers, public health
programs and marketing alike.
