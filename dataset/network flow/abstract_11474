In this paper, a new comparative definition for community in networks is
proposed and the corresponding detecting algorithm is given. A community is
defined as a set of nodes, which satisfy that each node's degree inside the
community should not be smaller than the node's degree toward any other
community. In the algorithm, the attractive force of a community to a node is
defined as the connections between them. Then employing attractive force based
self-organizing process, without any extra parameter, the best communities can
be detected. Several artificial and real-world networks, including Zachary
Karate club network and College football network are analyzed. The algorithm
works well in detecting communities and it also gives a nice description for
network division and group formation.
