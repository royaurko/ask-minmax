A set of analytical and computational tools based on transition path theory
(TPT) is proposed to analyze flows in complex networks. Specifically, TPT is
used to study the statistical properties of the reactive trajectories by which
transitions occur between specific groups of nodes on the network. Sampling
tools are built upon the outputs of TPT that allow to generate these reactive
trajectories directly, or even transition paths that travel from one group of
nodes to the other without making any detour and carry the same probability
current as the reactive trajectories. These objects permit to characterize the
mechanism of the transitions, for example by quantifying the width of the tubes
by which these transitions occur, the location and distribution of their
dynamical bottlenecks, etc. These tools are applied to a network modeling the
dynamics of the Lennard-Jones cluster with 38 atoms (LJ38) and used to
understand the mechanism by which this cluster rearranges itself between its
two most likely states at various temperatures.
