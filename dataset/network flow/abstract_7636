The dynamics of small spheres, which are held by linear springs in a low
Reynolds number shear flow at neighboring locations is investigated. The flow
elongates the beads and the interplay of the shear gradient with the nonlinear
behavior of the hydrodynamic interaction among the spheres causes in a large
range of parameters a bifurcation to a surprising oscillatory bead motion. The
parameter ranges, wherein this bifurcation is either super- or subcritical, are
determined.
