We present the first measurements of identified hadron production, azimuthal
anisotropy, and pion interferometry from Au+Au collisions below the nominal
injection energy at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) facility. The
data were collected using the large acceptance STAR detector at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$
= 9.2 GeV from a test run of the collider in the year 2008. Midrapidity results
on multiplicity density (dN/dy) in rapidity (y), average transverse momentum
(<pT>), particle ratios, elliptic flow, and HBT radii are consistent with the
corresponding results at similar $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ from fixed target experiments.
Directed flow measurements are presented for both midrapidity and forward
rapidity regions. Furthermore the collision centrality dependence of identified
particle dN/dy, <pT>, and particle ratios are discussed. These results also
demonstrate the readiness of the STAR detector to undertake the proposed QCD
critical point search and the exploration of the QCD phase diagram at RHIC.
