A hybrid equation of state for dense matter is presented that satisfies
phenomenological constraints from modern compact star observations which
indicate high maximum masses of about 2 M_sun and large radii of R> 12 km. The
corresponding isospin symmetric equation of state is consistent with flow data
analyses of heavy-ion collisions. The transition from nuclear to two-flavor
color superconducting quark matter at n approximately 0.55 fm^{-3} is almost a
crossover.
