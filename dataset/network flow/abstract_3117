Navigability, an ability to find a logarithmically short path between
elements using only local information is one of the most fascinating properties
of real-life networks. However the exact mechanism responsible for the
formation of navigation properties remained unknown. We show that navigability
can be achieved by using only two ingredients present in majority of networks:
network growth and local homophily, giving a persuasive answer how the
navigation appears in real-life networks. A very simple algorithm produces
hierarchical self-similar optimally wired navigable small world networks with
exponential degree distribution by using only local information. Adding
preferential attachment produces a scale-free network which has shorter greedy
paths, but worse (polynomial) scaling of the information extraction locality.
Many features of the model are observed in real-life networks, in particular in
the brain neural networks, supporting earlier suggestions that they are
navigable. The model can be used as a guide to build artificial navigable
networks using only local information.
