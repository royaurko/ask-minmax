We introduce a special stochastic perturbation of the flow of diffuse matter
as a curve in the group of diffeomorphisms of flat n-dimensional torus such
that the perturbed system yields a solution of Burgers equation in the tangent
space at unit of the diffeomorphism group. The same perturbation of the flow of
perfect incompressible fluid yields a solution of Reynolds type equation but
under some special external force on the diffeomorphism group it transforms
into a solution of Navier-Stokes equation without external force.
