A novel technique to identify and split clusters created by multiple charged
particles in the ATLAS pixel detector using a set of artificial neural networks
is presented. Such merged clusters are a common feature of tracks originating
from highly energetic objects, such as jets. Neural networks are trained using
Monte Carlo samples produced with a detailed detector simulation. This
technique replaces the former clustering approach based on a connected
component analysis and charge interpolation. The performance of the neural
network splitting technique is quantified using data from proton--proton
collisions at the LHC collected by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and from Monte
Carlo simulations. This technique reduces the number of clusters shared between
tracks in highly energetic jets by up to a factor of three. It also provides
more precise position and error estimates of the clusters in both the
transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolution.
