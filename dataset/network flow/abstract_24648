At present moment, there is a great interest in development of information
systems operating in cloud infrastructures. Generally, many of tasks remain
unresolved such as tasks of optimization of large databases in a hybrid cloud
infrastructure, quality of service (QoS) at different levels of cloud services,
dynamic control of distribution of cloud resources in application systems and
many others. Research and development of new solutions can be limited in case
of using emulators or international commercial cloud services, due to the
closed architecture and limited opportunities for experimentation. Article
provides answers to questions on the establishment of a pilot cloud practically
"at home" with the ability to adjust the width of the emulation channel and
delays in data transmission. It also describes architecture and configuration
of the experimental setup. The proposed modular structure can be expanded by
available computing power.
