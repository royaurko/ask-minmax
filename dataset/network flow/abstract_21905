When an asymmetric bubble collapses it generally produces a well defined high
velocity jet. This is remarkable because one might expect such a collapse to
produce a complex or chaotic flow rather than an ordered one. I present a
dimensional argument for the ubiquity of jets from collapsing bubbles, and
model the aspherical collapse of a bubble with pieces of Rayleigh's solution
for spherical collapse and its cylindrical analogue. This model explains the
ubiquity of jet formation in aspherical collapse, and predicts the shape and
velocity profile of the resulting jet. These predictions may be tested in the
laboratory or by numerical calculation. An application to solid spall is
suggested.
