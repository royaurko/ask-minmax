In this paper we consider the price of anarchy (PoA) in multi-commodity flows
where the latency or delay function on an edge has a heterogeneous dependency
on the flow commodities, i.e. when the delay on each link is dependent on the
flow of individual commodities, rather than on the aggregate flow. An
application of this study is the performance analysis of a network with
differentiated traffic that may arise when traffic is prioritized according to
some type classification. This study has implications in the debate on
net-neutrality. We provide price of anarchy bounds for networks with $k$ (types
of) commodities where each link is associated with heterogeneous polynomial
delays, i.e. commodity $i$ on edge $e$ faces delay specified by
$g_{i1}(e)f^{\theta}_1(e) + g_{i2}(e)f^{\theta}_2(e) + \ldots +
g_{ik}(e)f^{\theta}_k(e) + c_i(e), $ where $f_i(e)$ is the flow of the $i$th
commodity through edge $e$, $\theta \in {\cal N}$, $g_{i1}(e), g_{i2}(e),
\ldots, g_{ik}(e)$ and $c_i(e)$ are nonnegative constants. We consider both
atomic and non-atomic flows.
  For networks with decomposable delay functions where the delay induced by a
particular commodity is the same, i.e. delays on edge $e$ are defined by
$a_1(e)f_1^\theta(e) + a_2(e)f_2^\theta(e) + \ldots + c(e)$ where $\forall j ,
\forall e: g_{1j}(e) = g_{2j}(e) = \ldots = a_j(e)$, we show an improved bound
on the price of anarchy.
  Further, we show bounds on the price of anarchy for uniform latency functions
where each edge of the network has the same delay function.
