The connectivity pattern of networks, which are based on a correlation
between ground level temperature time series, shows a dominant dense stripe of
links in the southern ocean. We show that statistical categorization of these
links yields a clear association with the pattern of an atmospheric Rossby
wave, one of the major mechanisms associated with the weather system and with
planetary scale energy transport. It is shown that alternating densities of
negative and positive links (correlations) are arranged in half Rossby wave
distances around 3,500 km, 7,000 km and 10,000 km and are aligned with the
expected direction of energy flow, distribution of time delays and the
seasonality of these waves. It is also shown that long distance links (i.e., of
distances larger than 2,000 km) that are associated with Rossby waves are the
most dominant in the climate network. Climate networks may thus be used as an
efficient new way to detect and analyze Rossby waves, based on reliable and
available ground level measurements, in addition to the frequently used 300 hPa
reanalysis meridional wind data.
