Using both numerical simulations and scaling arguments, we study the behavior
of a random walker on a one-dimensional small-world network. For the properties
we study, we find that the random walk obeys a characteristic scaling form.
These properties include the average number of distinct sites visited by the
random walker, the mean-square displacement of the walker, and the distribution
of first-return times. The scaling form has three characteristic time regimes.
At short times, the walker does not see the small-world shortcuts and
effectively probes an ordinary Euclidean network in $d$-dimensions. At
intermediate times, the properties of the walker shows scaling behavior
characteristic of an infinite small-world network. Finally, at long times, the
finite size of the network becomes important, and many of the properties of the
walker saturate. We propose general analytical forms for the scaling properties
in all three regimes, and show that these analytical forms are consistent with
our numerical simulations.
