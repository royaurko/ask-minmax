This paper uses a database of collaboration recording between Econophysics
Scientists to study the community structure of this collaboration network,
which with a single type of vertex and a type of undirected, weighted edge.
Hierarchical clustering and the algorithm of Girvan and Newman are presented to
analyze the data. And it emphasizes the influence of the weight to results of
communities by comparing the different results obtained in different weights. A
function D is proposed to distinguish the difference between above results. At
last the paper also gives explanation to the results and discussion about
community structure.
