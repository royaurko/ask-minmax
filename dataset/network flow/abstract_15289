A challenging problem in multi-band multi-cell self-organized wireless
systems, such as multi-channel Wi-Fi networks, femto/pico cells in 3G/4G
cellular networks, and more recent wireless networks over TV white spaces, is
of distributed resource allocation. This involves four components: channel
selection, client association, channel access, and client scheduling. In this
paper, we present a unified framework for jointly addressing the four
components with the global system objective of maximizing the clients
throughput in a proportionally fair manner. Our formulation allows a natural
dissociation of the problem into two sub-parts. We show that the first part,
involving channel access and client scheduling, is convex and derive a
distributed adaptation procedure for achieving Pareto-optimal solution. For the
second part, involving channel selection and client association, we develop a
Gibbs-sampler based approach for local adaptation to achieve the global
objective, as well as derive fast greedy algorithms from it that achieve good
solutions.
