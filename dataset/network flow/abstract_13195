In this paper we discuss a theoretical model for the interfacial profiles of
progressive non-linear waves which result from introducing a triangular
obstacle, of finite height, attached to the bottom below the flow of a
stratified, ideal, two layer fluid, bounded from above by a rigid boundary. The
derived equations are solved by using a nonlinear perturbation method. The
dependence of the interfacial profile on the triangular obstacle size, as well
as its dependence on some flow parameters, such as the ratios of depths and
densities of the two fluids, have been studied.
