This paper uses the estimates of phase-locked parameters at the onset of
bursting presented in a companion paper to derive logarithmic correlations for
turbulent friction factor losses in time-independent power law fluids.
  Two different techniques for analysis were used. They gave logarithmic
correlations with different coefficients. But both correlations predicted 264
data points of friction factors published in the literature with a standard
error of 1.3%.
  The derivations show how modern understanding of coherent structures embedded
in turbulent flow fields can be used to derive engineering correlations for
head losses.
