The Parity Source Coder is a protocol for data compression which is based on
a set of parity checks organized in a sparse random network. We consider here
the case of memoryless unbiased binary sources. We show that the theoretical
capacity saturate the Shannon limit at large K. We also find that the first
corrections to the leading behavior are exponentially small, so that the
behavior at finite K is very close to the optimal one.
