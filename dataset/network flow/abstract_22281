As we re-examine the known holographic N=1 supersymmetric renormalization
group flow in four dimensions, we describe the mass-deformed Bagger-Lambert
theory or equivalently the mass-deformed U(2) x U(2) Chern-Simons gauge theory
with level k=1 or 2, that has G_2 symmetry, by adding a mass term for one of
the eight adjoint superfields. We obtain a detailed correspondence between the
fields of AdS_4 supergravity and composite operators of the infrared field
theory in three dimensions. The geometric superpotential from an eleven
dimensional viewpoint is obtained for M2-brane probe analysis.
