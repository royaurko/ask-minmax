We attempt is to provide accumulated evidence and qualitative understanding
of the associated atmospheric phenomena of the Arctic bromine explosion and
their role in the functioning of the biotic Earth. We rationalize the empirical
expression of the bromine influx into atmospheric boundary layer and calculate
total amounts of the tropospheric BrO and Bry of the Arctic origin. Based on
the quantities and partitioning of the reactive bromine species, we estimate
the biogeochemical parametric constraint on the surface ozone field of the
springtime NH. The constraint expresses strong relationship between
atmosphere-climate control factors of the Earth's life and of external energy
source. Physical atmosphere can be seen as a complex network of maximum
complexity. Henceforth, we analyze the network context of the Arctic bromine
pollution. We suggest that demonstrated attitudinal approach to the distributed
surface flux would be successfully used in the innovative atmospheric modeling.
The analysis is illustrated by GEM model results which stay in a good agreement
with the observational data and support the original idea of the global NH
effect of bromine chemistry.
