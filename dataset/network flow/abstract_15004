Transport in weighted networks is dominated by the minimum spanning tree
(MST), the tree connecting all nodes with the minimum total weight. We find
that the MST can be partitioned into two distinct components, having
significantly different transport properties, characterized by centrality --
number of times a node (or link) is used by transport paths. One component, the
{\it superhighways}, is the infinite incipient percolation cluster; for which
we find that nodes (or links) with high centrality dominate. For the other
component, {\it roads}, which includes the remaining nodes, low centrality
nodes dominate. We find also that the distribution of the centrality for the
infinite incipient percolation cluster satisfies a power law, with an exponent
smaller than that for the entire MST. The significance of this finding is that
one can improve significantly the global transport by improving a tiny fraction
of the network, the superhighways.
