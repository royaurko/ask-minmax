Nowadays the radio interface of several standards is enhanced with advanced
technologies such as OFDMA and extension technology such as relay. By using
those promising transmission technology for the next generation wireless
communications, scheduling problem becomes more crucial and challenging. In our
work, we aim to maximize the overall system capacity while selecting the most
suitable relay station under fairness constraint among both users and relay
station by proposing a Gap- based scheduling. This one considers the channel
state information and the unbalanced rate capacity of the two hops links.
Simulations results show the effectiveness of our approach in terms of fairness
and the overall system performance.
