Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) had been deployed by many data
networking service providers, including the next-generation mobile backhaul
networks, because of its undeniable potential in terms of virtual private
network (VPN) management, traffic engineering, etc. In MPLS networks, IP
packets are transmitted along a Label Switched Path (LSP) established between
edge nodes. To improve the efficiency of resource use in MPLS networks, it is
essential to utilize the LSPs efficiently.
  This paper proposes a method of selecting the optimal LSP pair from among
multiple LSP pairs which are established between the same pair of edge nodes,
on the assumption that both the upward and downward LSPs are established as a
pair (both-way operation). It is supposed that both upward and downward
bandwidths are allocated simultaneously in the selected LSP pair for each
service request. It is demonstrated by simulation evaluations that the proposal
method could reduce the total amount of the bandwidth required by up to 15%
compared with the conventional selection method. The proposed method can also
reuse the know-how and management tools in many existing networks which are
based on both-way operation.
