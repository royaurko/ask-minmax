In that report solution to incompressible Navier - Stokes equations in non -
dimensional form will be presented. Standard fundamental methods: SIMPLE,
SIMPLER (SIMPLE Revised) and Vorticity-Stream function approach are compared
and results of them are analyzed for standard CFD test case - Drived Cavity
flow. Different aspect ratios of cavity and different Reynolds numbers are
studied.
