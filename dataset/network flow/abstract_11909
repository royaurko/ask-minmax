In stochastic models of biochemical reaction networks, the dynamics is
usually represented by a Markov process which describes the evolution of the
copy-numbers or molecular counts of the constituent species. It is often of
biological interest to determine if this Markov process has a unique stationary
distribution and for this to hold, it is necessary that the state-space is
irreducible in the sense that all the states are reachable from each other in a
finite time, with a positive probability. Finding such irreducible state-spaces
is quite challenging, because the Markovian dynamics can usually access
infinitely many states and the presence of conservation relations among species
can constrain the dynamics in complicated ways. The aim of this paper is to
develop a computational framework for finding irreducible state-spaces for
reaction networks that typically arise in Systems and Synthetic Biology. Our
results can help in assessing the long-term behavior of a network and also in
explicitly obtaining the stationary distributions in certain cases. The
framework we present relies only on elementary linear algebra and linear
programming, which makes it highly scalable and efficient, even for very large
networks. We illustrate the wide applicability of our framework through several
examples.
