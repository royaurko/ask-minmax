Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are networks of nodes equipped with cognitive
radios that can optimize performance by adapting to network conditions. While
cognitive radio networks (CRN) are envisioned as intelligent networks,
relatively little research has focused on the network level functionality of
CRNs. Although various routing protocols, incorporating varying degrees of
adaptiveness, have been proposed for CRNs, it is imperative for the long term
success of CRNs that the design of cognitive routing protocols be pursued by
the research community. Cognitive routing protocols are envisioned as routing
protocols that fully and seamless incorporate AI-based techniques into their
design. In this paper, we provide a self-contained tutorial on various AI and
machine-learning techniques that have been, or can be, used for developing
cognitive routing protocols. We also survey the application of various classes
of AI techniques to CRNs in general, and to the problem of routing in
particular. We discuss various decision making techniques and learning
techniques from AI and document their current and potential applications to the
problem of routing in CRNs. We also highlight the various inference, reasoning,
modeling, and learning sub tasks that a cognitive routing protocol must solve.
Finally, open research issues and future directions of work are identified.
