Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations are used to investigate the
structural stability of cooling flows that are episodically heated by jets from
a central AGN. The radial profile of energy deposition is controlled by (a) the
power of the jets, and (b) the pre-outburst density profile. A delay in the
ignition of the jets causes more powerful jets to impact on a more centrally
concentrated medium. The net effect is a sufficient increase in the central
concentration of energy deposition to cause the post-outburst density profile
to be less centrally concentrated than that of an identical cluster in which
the outburst happened earlier and was weaker. These results suggest that the
density profiles of cooling flows oscillate around an attracting profile, thus
explaining why cooling flows are observed to have similar density profiles. The
possibility is raised that powerful FR II systems are ones in which this
feedback mechanism has broken down and a runaway growth of the source
parameters has occurred.
