Biological phenomena differ significantly from physical phenomena. At the
heart of this distinction is the fact that biological entities have
computational abilities and thus they are inherently difficult to predict. This
is the reason why simplified models that provide the minimal requirements for
computation turn out to be very useful to study networks of many components. In
this chapter, we briefly review the dynamical aspects of models of regulatory
networks, discussing their most salient features, and we also show how these
models can give clues about the way in which networks may organize their
capacity to evolve, by providing simple examples of the implementation of
robustness and modularity.
