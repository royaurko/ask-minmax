Since September 2007, a large scale lexical network for French is under
construction through methods based on some kind of popular consensus by means
of games (JeuxDeMots project). Human intervention can be considered as
marginal. It is limited to corrections, adjustments and validation of the
senses of terms, which amounts to less than 0,5 % of the relations in the
network. To appreciate the quality of this resource built by non-expert users
(players of the game), we use a similar approach to its construction. The
resource must be validated by laymen, persistent in time, on open class
vocabulary. We suggest to check whether our tool is able to solve the Tip of
the Tongue (TOT) problem. Just like JeuxDeMots, our tool can be considered as
an on-line game. Like the former, it allows the acquisition of new relations,
enriching thus the (existing) network.
