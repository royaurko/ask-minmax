Travel activities have been widely applied to quantify spatial interactions
between places, regions and nations. In this paper, we model the spatial
connectivities between 652 Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) in Beijing by a taxi
OD dataset. First, we unveil the gravitational structure of intra-urban spatial
connectivities of Beijing. On overall, the inter-TAZ interactions are well
governed by the Gravity Model $G_{ij} = {\lambda}p_{i}p_{j}/d_{ij}$, where
$p_{i}$, $p_{j}$ are degrees of TAZ $i$, $j$ and $d_{ij}$ the distance between
them, with a goodness-of-fit around 0.8. Second, the network based analysis
well reveals the polycentric form of Beijing. Last, we detect the semantics of
inter-TAZ connectivities based on their spatiotemporal patterns. We further
find that inter-TAZ connections deviating from the Gravity Model can be well
explained by link semantics.
