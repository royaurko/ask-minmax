The article reviews fluid flow models implemented in the leading CFD software
tools and designed for simulation of multi-component and multi-phase flows,
compressible flows, flows with heat transfer, cavitation and other phenomena.
The article shows that these software tools (CFX, Fluent, STAR-CD, etc.) allow
for adequate simulation of complex physical effects of different nature, even
for problems where performing of physical experiment is extremely difficult.
