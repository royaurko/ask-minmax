From extensive molecular dynamics simulations on immiscible two-phase flows,
we find the relative slipping between the fluids and the solid wall everywhere
to follow the generalized Navier boundary condition, in which the amount of
slipping is proportional to the sum of tangential viscous stress and the
uncompensated Young stress. The latter arises from the deviation of the
fluid-fluid interface from its static configuration. We give a continuum
formulation of the immiscible flow hydrodynamics, comprising the generalized
Navier boundary condition, the Navier-Stokes equation, and the Cahn-Hilliard
interfacial free energy. Our hydrodynamic model yields interfacial and velocity
profiles matching those from the molecular dynamics simulations at the
molecular-scale vicinity of the contact line. In particular, the behavior at
high capillary numbers, leading to the breakup of the fluid-fluid interface, is
accurately predicted.
