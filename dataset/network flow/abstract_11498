This research is to search for alternatives to the resolution of complex
medical diagnosis where human knowledge should be apprehended in a general
fashion. Successful application examples show that human diagnostic
capabilities are significantly worse than the neural diagnostic system. Our
research describes a constructive neural network algorithm with
backpropagation; offer an approach for the incremental construction of
nearminimal neural network architectures for pattern classification. The
algorithm starts with minimal number of hidden units in the single hidden
layer; additional units are added to the hidden layer one at a time to improve
the accuracy of the network and to get an optimal size of a neural network. Our
algorithm was tested on several benchmarking classification problems including
Cancer1, Heart, and Diabetes with good generalization ability.
