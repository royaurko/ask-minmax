We showed that various expressions of stress in different models of fluids
and in different forms of applying Newton's Second Law can be chosen, however
there is always one Newton's Second Law which restricts and provides
flexibility in these expressions. When fluids are regarded as being made of
cells from a microscopic point of view, temperature force (gradient of internal
kinetic energy) can also drive them flow.
