We report first results on elliptic flow of identified particles at
mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=130$ GeV using the STAR
TPC at RHIC. The elliptic flow as a function of transverse momentum and
centrality differs significantly for particles of different masses. This
dependence can be accounted for in hydrodynamic models, indicating that the
system created shows a behavior consistent with collective hydrodynamical flow.
The fit to the data with a simple model gives information on the temperature
and flow velocities at freeze-out.
