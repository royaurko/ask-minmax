It is a correction paper on "P.J. Wan and C.W. Yi, "Coverage by Randomly
Deployed Wireless Sensor Networks", IEEE Transaction On Information Theory,
vol.52, No.6, June 2006."
  In the above paper, Lemma (4), on page 2659 play the key role for deriving
the main results in the paper. The statement as well as the proof of Lemma (4),
page $2659,$ is not correct. We have given the correct version of Lemma. This
change in Lemma leads a drastic change in all the result derived in the above
paper.
