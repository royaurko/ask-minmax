We analyze the performance of a linear code used for a data compression of
Slepian-Wolf type. In our framework, two correlated data are separately
compressed into codewords employing Gallager-type codes and casted into a
communication network through two independent input terminals. At the output
terminal, the received codewords are jointly decoded by a practical algorithm
based on the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer approach. Our analysis shows that the
achievable rate region presented in the data compression theorem by Slepian and
Wolf is described as first-order phase transitions among several phases. The
typical performance of the practical decoder is also well evaluated by the
replica method.
