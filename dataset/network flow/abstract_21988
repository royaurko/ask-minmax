We show that the vorticity appearing in stationary vacuum spacetimes is
always related to the existence of a flow of super-energy on the plane
orthogonal to the vorticity vector. This result, toghether with the previously
established link between vorticity and super--energy in radiative (Bondi-Sachs)
spacetimes strength further the case for this latter quantity as the cause of
frame dragging.
