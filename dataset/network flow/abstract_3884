Geometric frustration leads to complex phases of matter with exotic
properties. Antiferromagnets on triangular lattices and square ice are two
simple models of geometrical frustration. We map their highly degenerated
ground-state phase spaces as discrete networks such that network analysis tools
can be introduced to phase-space studies. The resulting phase spaces establish
a novel class of complex networks with Gaussian spectral densities. Although
phase-space networks are heterogeneously connected, the systems are still
ergodic except under periodic boundary conditions. We elucidate the boundary
effects by mapping the two models as stacks of cubes and spheres in higher
dimensions. Sphere stacking in various containers, i.e. square ice under
various boundary conditions, reveals challenging combinatorial questions. This
network approach can be generalized to phase spaces of some other complex
systems.
