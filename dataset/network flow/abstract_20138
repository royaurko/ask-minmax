We examine the effect of thermal conduction on the observational properties
of a super critical hot magnetized flow. We obtained self-similar solution of a
magnetized disc when the thermal conduction plays an important role. Follow of
our first paper (Ghasemnezhad et al. 2012 (hereafter GKA12)) we have extended
our solution on the observational appearance of the disc to show how physical
condition such as thermal conduction, viscosity, and advection will change the
observed luminosity of the disc, Continuous spectra and surface temperature of
such discs was plotted. We apply the present model to black-hole X-ray binary
LMC X-3 and narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies, which are supposed to be under
critical accretion rate. Our results show clearly that the surface temperature
is strongly depends on the thermal conduction, the magnetic field and advection
parameter. However we see that thermal conduction acts to oppose the
temperature gradient as we expect and observed luminosity of the disc will
reduce when thermal conduction is high. We have shown that in this model the
spectra of critical accretion flows strongly depends on the inclination angle.
