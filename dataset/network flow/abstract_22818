The aim of this paper is to prove the Kolmogorov theorem of persistence of
Diophantine flows for nearly-integrable Poisson systems associated to a real
analytic Hamiltonian with aperiodic time dependence, provided that the
perturbation is asymptotically vanishing. The paper is an extension of an
analogous result by the same contributors for canonical Hamiltonian systems; the
flexibility of the Lie series method developed by A. Giorgilli et al., is
profitably used in the present generalisation.
