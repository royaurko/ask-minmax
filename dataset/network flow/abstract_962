In the Flow Edge-Monitor Problem, we are given an undirected graph G=(V,E),
an integer k > 0 and some unknown circulation \psi on G. We want to find a set
of k edges in G, so that if we place k monitors on those edges to measure the
flow along them, the total number of edges for which the flow can be uniquely
determined is maximized. In this paper, we first show that the Flow
Edge-Monitor Problem is NP-hard, and then we give two approximation algorithms:
a 3-approximation algorithm with running time O((m+n)^2) and a 2-approximation
algorithm with running time O((m+n)^3), where n = |V| and m=|E|.
