We introduce an algorithm which estimates the number of circuits in a graph
as a function of their length. This approach provides analytical results for
the typical entropy of circuits in sparse random graphs. When applied to
real-world networks, it allows to estimate exponentially large numbers of
circuits in polynomial time. We illustrate the method by studying a graph of
the Internet structure.
