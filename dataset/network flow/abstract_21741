We connect a possible solution for the ``cosmological constant problem'' to
the existence of a (postulated) conformal fixed point in a fundamental theory.
The resulting cosmology leads to quintessence, where the present acceleration
of the expansion of the universe is linked to a crossover in the flow of
coupling constants.
