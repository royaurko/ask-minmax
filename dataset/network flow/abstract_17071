Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze the effects of artificial
periodic arrays of pinning sites on the critical current of superconducting
thin films as a function of vortex density. We analyze two types of periodic
pinning arrays: hexagonal and Kagom\'e. For the Kagome pinning network we
calculate, using two directions of transport current: longitudinal and
transversal. Our results show that the hexagonal pinning array presents higher
critical currents than Kagom\'e and random pinning configuration for all vortex
densities. In addition, the Kagom\'e network shows anisotropy in their
transport properties.
