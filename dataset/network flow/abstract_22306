We construct gradient K\"ahler-Ricci solitons on Ricci-flat K\"ahler cone
manifolds and on line bundles over toric Fano manifolds. Certain shrinking and
expanding solitons are pasted together to form eternal solutions of the Ricci
flow. The method we employ is the Calabi ansatz over Sasaki-Einstein manifolds,
and the results generalize constructions of Cao and Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf.
