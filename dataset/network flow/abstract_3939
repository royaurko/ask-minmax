In this paper we propose Time Synchronized One-Time-Password scheme to
provide secure wake up authentication. The main constraint of wireless sensor
networks is their limited power resource that prevents us from using radio
transmission over the network to transfer the passwords. On the other hand
computation power consumption is insignificant when compared to the costs
associated with the power needed for transmitting the right set of keys. In
addition to prevent adversaries from reading and following the timeline of the
network, we propose to encrypt the tokens using symmetric encryption to prevent
replay attacks.
