Antiferromagnetic Ising spins on the scale-free Barabasi-Albert network are
studied via the Monte Carlo method. Using the replica exchange algorithm, we
calculate the temperature dependence of various physical quantities of interest
including the overlap and the Binder parameters. We observe a transition
between a paramagnetic phase and a spin glass phase and estimate the critical
temperature for the phase transition to be $T \sim 4.0(1)$ in units of $J/k_B$,
where $J$ is the coupling strength between spins and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann
constant. Using the scaling behaviour of the Binder parameter, we estimate the
scaling exponent to be $\nu \sim 1.10(2)$.
