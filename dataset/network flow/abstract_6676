The ways in which an innovation (e.g., new behaviour, idea, technology,
product) diffuses among people can determine its success or failure. In this
paper, we address the problem of diffusion of innovations over multiplex social
networks where the neighbours of a person belong to one or multiple networks
(or layers) such as friends, families, or colleagues. To this end, we
generalise one of the basic game-theoretic diffusion models, called networked
coordination game, for multiplex networks. We present analytical results for
this extended model and validate them through a simulation study, finding among
other properties a lower bound for the success of an innovation.While simple
and leading to intuitively understandable results, to the best of our knowledge
this is the first extension of a game-theoretic innovation diffusion model for
multiplex networks and as such it provides a basic framework to study more
sophisticated innovation dynamics.
