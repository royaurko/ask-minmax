In this paper we present a new model for the lifetime of wireless sensor
networks used for sea water communications. The new model for power
communications takes into consideration parameters such as power consumption
for the active mode, power consumption for the sleep mode, power consumption
for the transient mode, transmission period, transient mode duration, sleep
mode duration, and active mode duration. The power communications model is
incorporated in the life time model of wireless sensor networks. The life time
model takes into consideration several parameters such as the total number of
sensors, network size, percentage of sink nodes, location of sensors, the
mobility of sensors, power consumption when nodes move and the power
consumption of communications. The new model for power consumption in
communications shows more accurate results about the lifetime of the sensor
network in comparison with previously published results.
