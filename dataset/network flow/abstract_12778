This note argues that when dot-plotting distributions typically found in
papers about web and social networks (degree distributions, component-size
distributions, etc.), and more generally distributions that have high
variability in their tail, an exponentially binned version should always be
plotted, too, and suggests Fibonacci binning as a visually appealing,
easy-to-use and practical choice.
