Hot Jupiters can experience mass loss driven by heating from UV radiation
from their host stars, and this flow is often controlled by magnetic fields.
More specifically, near the planetry surface, the magnetic pressure dominates
the ram pressure of the outflow by several orders of magnitude. After leaving
the vicinity of the planet, the flow must connect onto the background
environment provided by the stellar wind and the stellar magnetic field. This
contribution considers magnetically controlled planetary outflows and extends
previous work by comparing two different geometries for the background magnetic
field provided by the star. In the first case, stellar field is assumed to
retain the form of a dipole, which is anti-aligned with the dipole field of the
planet. In the second case, the stellar outflow opens up the stellar magnetic
field structure so that the background field at the location of the planet is
perpendicular to the planetary dipole. Using numerical simulations, we consider
the launch of the planetary wind with these field configurations.
