We show the existence of continuous viscosity solutions to the equation
describing the flow of a graph in the Carnot group G x R according to its
horizontal Gauss curvature. In doing so, we prove a comparison principle for
degenerate parabolic equations of the form u_t + F(D_0u, (D_0^2u)^*) = 0 for u
defined on G.
