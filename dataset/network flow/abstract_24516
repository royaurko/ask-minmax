If we have a system of binary variables and we measure the pairwise
correlations among these variables, then the least structured or maximum
entropy model for their joint distribution is an Ising model with pairwise
interactions among the spins. Here we consider inhomogeneous systems in which
we constrain (for example) not the full matrix of correlations, but only the
distribution from which these correlations are drawn. In this sense, what we
have constructed is an inverse spin glass: rather than choosing coupling
constants at random from a distribution and calculating correlations, we choose
the correlations from a distribution and infer the coupling constants. We argue
that such models generate a block structure in the space of couplings, which
provides an explicit solution of the inverse problem. This allows us to
generate a phase diagram in the space of (measurable) moments of the
distribution of correlations. We expect that these ideas will be most useful in
building models for systems that are nonequilibrium statistical mechanics
problems, such as networks of real neurons.
