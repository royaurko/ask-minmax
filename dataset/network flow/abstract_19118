We investigate the effect of preferentially connecting oscillators with
similar frequency to each other in networks of coupled phase oscillators (i.e.,
frequency assortativity). Using the network Kuramoto model as an example, we
find that frequency assortativity can induce chaos in the macroscopic dynamics.
By applying a mean-field approximation in combination with the dimension
reduction method of Ott and Antonsen, we show that the dynamics can be
described by a low dimensional system of equations. We use the reduced system
to characterize the macroscopic chaos using Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation
diagrams, and time-delay embeddings. Finally, we show that the emergence of
chaos stems from the formation of multiple groups of synchronized oscillators,
i.e., meta-oscillators.
