We construct chiral perturbation theory for the gradient flow of the
microscopic Dirac eigenvalues and compute the density of and correlations
between the microscopic eigenvalues at zero and non-zero flow time. The results
show that the repulsion of the microscopic Dirac eigenvalues from the dynamical
quark mass decreases with increasing gradient flow time. Furthermore, the flow
of the spectral resolvent is compared to the flow of the chiral condensate
obtained from a fermionic gradient flow.
