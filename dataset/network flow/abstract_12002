Diluted neural networks with continuous neurons and nonmonotonic transfer
function are studied, with both fixed and dynamic synapses. A noisy stimulus
with periodic variance results in a mechanism for controlling chaos in neural
systems with fixed synapses: a proper amount of external perturbation forces
the system to behave periodically with the same period as the stimulus.
