The dynamics and the stationary states for the competition between pattern
reconstruction and asymmetric sequence processing are studied here in an
exactly solvable feed-forward layered neural network model of binary units and
patterns near saturation. Earlier work by Coolen and Sherrington on a parallel
dynamics far from saturation is extended here to account for finite stochastic
noise due to a Hebbian and a sequential learning rule. Phase diagrams are
obtained with stationary states and quasi-periodic non-stationary solutions.
The relevant dependence of these diagrams and of the quasi-periodic solutions
on the stochastic noise and on initial inputs for the overlaps is explicitly
discussed.
