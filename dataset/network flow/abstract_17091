Simulations of the Simmel effect are performed for agents in a scale-free
social network. The social hierarchy of an agent is determined by the degree of
her node. Particular features, once selected by a highly connected agent,
became common in lower class but soon fall out of fashion and extinct.
Numerical results reflect the dynamics of frequency of American babies names in
1880-2011.
