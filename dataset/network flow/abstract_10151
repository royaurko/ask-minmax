In this contribution first results of experiments on pedestrian flow through
bottlenecks are presented and then compared to simulation results obtained with
the Social Force Model in the Vissim simulation framework. Concerning the
experiments it is argued that the basic dependence between flow and bottleneck
width is not a step function but that it is linear and modified by the effect
of a psychological phenomenon. The simulation results as well show a linear
dependence and the parameters can be calibrated such that the absolute values
for flow and time fit to range of experimental results.
