We prove that the Ricci flow on CP^n blown-up at one point starting with any
rotationally symmetric Kahler metric must develop Type I singularities. In
particular, if the total volume does not go to zero at the singular time, the
parabolic blow-up limit of the Type I Ricci flow along the exceptional divisor
is a complete non-flat shrinking gradient Kahler-Ricci soliton on a complete
Kahler manifold homeomorphic to C^n blown-up at one point.
