A nationwide interoperable public safety broadband network is being planned
by the United States government. The network will be based on long term
evolution (LTE) standards and use recently designated spectrum in the 700 MHz
band. The public safety network has different objectives and traffic patterns
than commercial wireless networks. In particular, the public safety network
puts more emphasis on coverage, reliability and latency in the worst case
scenario. Moreover, the routine public safety traffic is relatively light,
whereas when a major incident occurs, the traffic demand at the incident scene
can be significantly heavier than that in a commercial network. Hence it is
prohibitively costly to build the public safety network using conventional
cellular network architecture consisting of an infrastructure of stationary
base transceiver stations. A novel architecture is proposed in this paper for
the public safety broadband network. The architecture deploys stationary base
stations sparsely to serve light routine traffic and dispatches mobile base
stations to incident scenes along with public safety personnel to support heavy
traffic. The analysis shows that the proposed architecture can potentially
offer more than 75% reduction in terms of the total number of base stations
needed.
