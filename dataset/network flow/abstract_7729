This fluid dynamics video shows the release of a 1/15th scale model store
into a Mach 1.5 free-stream flow from a rectangular cavity. The images were
acquired with a high-speed schlieren photography system using a Photron Ultima
APX camera. Acoustic measurements showed that the unsteady shear layer over the
cavity had a prominent oscillation at approximately 810 Hz which corresponds to
fluctuations seen in the cavity's leading edge shock structure in the video.
The video demonstrates the similarity in the time scales of the flow field
dynamics and the residence time of the store in the shear layer.
