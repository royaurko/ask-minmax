In this paper a new supersymmetric extension of conformal mechanics is put
forward. The beauty of this extension is that all variables have a clear
geometrical meaning and the super-Hamiltonian turns out to be the
Lie-derivative of the Hamiltonian flow of standard conformal mechanics. In this
paper we also provide a supersymmetric extension of the other conformal
generators of the theory and find their "square-roots". The whole superalgebra
of these charges is then analyzed in details. We conclude the paper by showing
that, using superfields, a constraint can be built which provides the exact
solution of the system.
