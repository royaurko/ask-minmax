This article presents direct numerical simulations of the growth of turbulent
spots in the transitional regime of plane Couette flow. A quantitative
description of the growth process and of the detail of the quadrupolar flow
around the spot is given. Focus is put on formation of spanwise vorticity in
the velocity streaks that resembles a secondary shear instability. The main
features of the instability (coherence lengths, advection velocity) are studied
in the context of the turbulent spot, below and above the threshold Reynolds
number of appearance of the oblique turbulent bands of plane Couette flow.
