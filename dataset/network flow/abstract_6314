We study numerically the spectrum and eigenstate properties of the Google
matrix of various examples of directed networks such as vocabulary networks of
dictionaries and university World Wide Web networks. The spectra have gapless
structure in the vicinity of the maximal eigenvalue for Google damping
parameter $\alpha$ equal to unity. The vocabulary networks have relatively
homogeneous spectral density, while university networks have pronounced
spectral structures which change from one university to another, reflecting
specific properties of the networks. We also determine specific properties of
eigenstates of the Google matrix, including the PageRank. The fidelity of the
PageRank is proposed as a new characterization of its stability.
