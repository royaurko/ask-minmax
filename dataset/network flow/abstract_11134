Transceiver impairments, including phase noise, residual frequency offset,
and imperfect channel estimation, significantly affect the performance of
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system. However, these impairments are
not well addressed when analyzing the throughput performance of MIMO Ad Hoc
networks. In this paper, we present an analytical framework to evaluate the
throughput of MIMO OFDM system under the impairments of phase noise, residual
frequency offset, and imperfect channel estimation. Using this framework, we
evaluate the Maximum Sum Throughput (MST) in Ad Hoc networks by optimizing the
power and modulation schemes of each user. Simulations are conducted to
demonstrate not only the improvement in the MST from using multiple antennas,
but also the loss in the MST due to the transceiver impairments. The proposed
analytical framework is further applied for the distributed implementation of
MST in Ad Hoc networks, where the loss caused by impairments is also evaluated.
