Initial results from the Madison Dynamo Experiment provide details of the
inductive response of a turbulent flow of liquid sodium to an applied magnetic
field. The magnetic field structure is reconstructed from both internal and
external measurements. A mean toroidal magnetic field is induced by the flow
when an axial field is applied, thereby demonstrating the omega effect.
Poloidal magnetic flux is expelled from the fluid by the poloidal flow.
Small-scale magnetic field structures are generated by turbulence in the flow.
The resulting magnetic power spectrum exhibits a power-law scaling consistent
with the equipartition of the magnetic field with a turbulent velocity field.
The magnetic power spectrum has an apparent knee at the resistive dissipation
scale. Large-scale eddies in the flow cause significant changes to the
instantaneous flow profile resulting in intermittent bursts of non-axisymmetric
magnetic fields, demonstrating that the transition to a dynamo is not smooth
for a turbulent flow.
