The most general form of the nonrelativistic Grad-Shafranov equation
describing anisotropic pressure effects is formulated within the double
adiabatic approximation. It gives a possibility to analyze quantitatively how
the anisotropic pressure affects the 2D structure of the ideal
magnetohydrodynamical flows.
