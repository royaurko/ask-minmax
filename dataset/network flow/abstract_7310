James et al. (2012) presented simulations that apparently falsify the
analytical result by Bastolla et al. (2009), who showed that nested mutualistic
interactions decrease interspecific competition and increase biodiversity in
model ecosystems. This contradiction, however, mainly stems from the incorrect
application of formulas derived for fully connected networks to empirical,
sparse networks.
