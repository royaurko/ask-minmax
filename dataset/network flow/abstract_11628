We demonstrate in this paper the use of tools of complex network theory to
describe the strategy of Australia and England in the recently concluded Ashes
2013 Test series. Using partnership data made available by cricinfo during the
Ashes 2013 Test series, we generate batting partnership network (BPN) for each
team, in which nodes correspond to batsmen and links represent runs scored in
partnerships between batsmen. The resulting network display a visual summary of
the pattern of run-scoring by each team, which helps us in identifying
potential weakness in a batting order. We use different centrality scores to
quantify the performance, relative importance and effect of removing a player
from the team. We observe that England is an extremely well connected team, in
which lower order batsmen consistently contributed significantly to the team
score. Contrary to this Australia showed dependence on their top order batsmen.
