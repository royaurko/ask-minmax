A macroscopic elastic description of stresses in static, preloaded granular
media is derived systematically from the microscopic elasticity of individual
inter-grain contacts. The assumed preloaded state and friction at contacts
ensure that the network of inter-grain contacts is not altered by small
perturbations. The texture of this network, set by the preparation of the
system, is encoded in second and fourth order fabric tensors. A small
perturbation generates both normal and tangential inter-grain forces, the
latter causing grains to reorient. This reorientation response and the
incremental stress are expressed in terms of the macroscopic strain.
