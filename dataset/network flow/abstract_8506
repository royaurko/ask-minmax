We propose general principles for semantic networks allowing them to be
implemented as dynamical neural networks. Major features of our scheme include:
(a) the interpretation that each node in a network stands for a bound
integration of the meanings of all nodes and external events the node links
with; (b) the systematic use of nodes that stand for categories or types, with
separate nodes for instances of these types; (c) an implementation of
relationships that does not use intrinsically typed links between nodes.
