A short review of both theoretical and experimental aspects of the radiative
return method is presented with the emphasize on the results obtained within
the EURIDICE network. It is shown that the method gives not only possibility of
an independent from the scan method measurement of the hadronic cross section,
but also can provide information concerning details of the hadronic
interactions.
