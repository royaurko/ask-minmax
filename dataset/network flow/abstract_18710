We perform simulations of random Ising models defined over small-world
networks and we check the validity and the level of approximation of a recently
proposed effective field theory. Simulations confirm a rich scenario with the
presence of multicritical points with first- or second-order phase transitions.
In particular, for second-order phase transitions, independent of the dimension
d_0 of the underlying lattice, the exact predictions of the theory in the
paramagnetic regions, such as the location of critical surfaces and correlation
functions, are verified. Quite interestingly, we verify that the
Edwards-Anderson model with d_0=2 is not thermodynamically stable under graph
noise.
