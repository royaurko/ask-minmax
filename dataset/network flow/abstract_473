The water flow through the poly(acrylamide) gel under a constant water
pressure is measured by newly designed apparatus. The time evolution of the
water flow in the gel, is calculated based on the collective diffusion model of
the polymer network coupled with the friction between the polymer network and
the water. The friction coefficient are determined from the equilibrium
velocity of water flow. The Young modulus and the Poisson's ratio of the rod
shape gels are measured by the uni-axial elongation experiments, which
determine the longitudinal modulus independently from the water flow
experiments. With the values of the longitudinal modulus and of the friction
determined by the experiments, the calculated results are compared with the
time evolution of the flow experiments. We find that the time evolution of the
water flow is well described by a single characteristic relaxation time
predicted by the collective diffusion model coupled with the water friction.
