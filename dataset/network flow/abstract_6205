Spherical Couette flow (flow between concentric rotating spheres) is one of
flows under consideration for the laboratory magnetic dynamos. Recent
experiments have shown that such flows may excite Coriolis restored inertial
modes. The present work aims to better understand the properties of the
observed modes and the nature of their excitation. Using numerical solutions
describing forced inertial modes of a uniformly rotating fluid inside a
spherical shell, we first identify the observed oscillations of the Couette
flow with non-axisymmetric, retrograde, equatorially anti-symmetric inertial
modes, confirming first attempts using a full sphere model. Although the model
has no differential rotation, identification is possible because a large
fraction of the fluid in a spherical Couette flow rotates rigidly. From the
observed sequence of the excited modes appearing when the inner sphere is
slowed down by step, we identify a critical Rossby number associated with a
given mode and below which it is excited. The matching between this critical
number and the one derived from the phase velocity of the numerically computed
modes shows that these modes are excited by an instability likely driven by the
critical layer that develops in the shear layer staying along the tangent
cylinder of the inner sphere.
