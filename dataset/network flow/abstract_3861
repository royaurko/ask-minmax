Networks are a natural and popular mechanism for the representation and
investigation of a broad class of systems. But extracting information from a
network can present significant challenges. We present NetzCope, a software
application for the display and analysis of networks. Its key features include
the visualization of networks in two or three dimensions, the organization of
vertices to reveal structural similarity, and the detection and visualization
of network communities by modularity maximization.
