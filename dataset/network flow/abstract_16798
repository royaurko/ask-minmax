Siphons in a chemical reaction system are subsets of the species that have
the potential of being absent in a steady state. We present a characterization
of minimal siphons in terms of primary decomposition of binomial ideals, we
explore the underlying geometry, and we demonstrate the effective computation
of siphons using computer algebra software. This leads to a new method for
determining whether given initial concentrations allow for various boundary
steady states.
