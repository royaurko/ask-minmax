We consider the gradient flow of the Yang-Mills-Higgs functional of twist
Higgs pairs on a Hermitian vector bundle $(E,H_0)$ over a Riemann surface $X$.
It is already known the gradient flow with initial data $(A_0,\phi_0)$
converges to a critical point $(A_\infty, \phi_\infty)$ of this functional.
Using a modified Chern-Weil type inequality, we prove that the limiting twist
Higgs bundle $(E, d_{A_\infty}", \phi_\infty)$ is given by the graded twist
Higgs bundle defined by the Harder-Narasimhan-Seshadri filtration of the
initial twist Higgs bundle $(E,d_{A_0}",\phi_0)$, generalizing Wilkin's results
for untwist Higgs bundle.
