A mathematical model describing motion of an inhomogeneous incompressible
fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell is considered. Linear stability analysis of shear
flow class is provided. The role of inertia, linear friction and impermeable
boundaries in Kelvin--Helmholtz instability development is studied. Hierarchy
of simplified one-dimensional models of viscosity- and density-stratified flows
is obtained in long-wave approximation. Interpretation of Saffman--Taylor
instability development is given in the framework of these models.
