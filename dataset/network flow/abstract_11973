In this paper we consider how to organize the sharing of information in a
distributed network of sensors and data processors so as to provide
explanations for sensor readings with minimal expenditure of energy. We point
out that the Minimum Description Length principle provides an approach to
information fusion that is more naturally suited to energy minimization than
traditional Bayesian approaches. In addition we show that for networks
consisting of a large number of identical sensors Kohonen self-organization
provides an exact solution to the problem of combining the sensor outputs into
minimal description length explanations.
