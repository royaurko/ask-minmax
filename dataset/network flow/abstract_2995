In this paper, we consider the mean curvature flow of convex hypersurfaces in
Euclidean spaces with a general forcing term. We show that the flow may shrink
to a point in finite time if the forcing term is small, or exist for all times
and expand to infinity if the forcing term is large enough. The flow can also
converge to a round sphere for some special forcing term and initial
hypersurface. Furthermore, the normalization of the flow is carried out so that
long time existence and convergence of the rescaled flow are studied. Our work
extends Huisken's well-known mean curvature flow and McCoy's mixed volume
preserving mean curvature flow.
