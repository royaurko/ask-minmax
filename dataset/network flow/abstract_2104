Introduced and investigated new kind of percolation problem - so called
internal percolation problem (IP). In usual percolation problem current flows
from top to bottom of the system and here it can be called as external
percolation problem (EP) despite of the IP case when voltage is applied to the
system through bars which are inside of the hole in system. EP problem has two
major parameters: M size of system and a0 size of inclusion, lattice size etc.
IP holds one more parameter the size of hole - L. Results of computer
simulation show that critical indexes of conductance for IP problem are very
close to those in EP problem. In opposite indexes of relative spectral noise
density of 1/f noise and higher moments are really differs from EP problem. The
source of such behaviour is discussed.
