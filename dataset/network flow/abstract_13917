The dynamics of linear perturbations is studied in magnetized plasma shear
flows with a constant shearing rate and with gravity-induced stratification.
The general set of linearized equations is derived and the two-dimensional case
is considered in detail. The Boussinesq approximation is used in order to
examine relatively small-scale perturbations of low-frequency modes:
Gravito-Alfven waves (GAW) and Entropy Mode (EM) perturbations. It is shown
that for flows with arbitrary shearing rate there exists a finite time interval
of non-adiabatic evolution of the perturbations. The non-adiabatic behavior
manifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and
by the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations. It is shown that these
phenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into the
energy of the perturbations for moderate and high shearing rate solar plasma
flows. Efficient generation of GAW by EM takes place for shearing rates about
an order of magnitude smaller than necessary for development of a shear
instability. The latter fact could have important consequences for the problem
of angular momentum redistribution within the Sun and solar-type stars.
