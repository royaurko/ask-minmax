Two-dimensional correlation functions in $\Delta\eta-\Delta \phi$ for charged
hadrons emitted in heavy-ion collisions are calculated in event-by-event
hydrodynamics. With the Glauber model for the initial density distributions in
the transverse plane and elongated density profiles in the longitudinal
direction, the flow patterns in the azimuthal angle of the two-dimensional
correlation function are properly reproduced. We show that the additional
fall-off of the same-side ridge in the longitudinal direction can be explained
as an effect of local charge conservation at a late stage of the evolution.
This additional non-flow effect increases the harmonic flow coefficients for
the unlike-sign particle pairs.
