A directed acyclic network is considered where all the terminals need to
recover the sum of the symbols generated at all the sources. We call such a
network a sum-network. It is shown that there exists a solvably (and linear
solvably) equivalent sum-network for any multiple-unicast network, and thus for
any directed acyclic communication network. It is also shown that there exists
a linear solvably equivalent multiple-unicast network for every sum-network. It
is shown that for any set of polynomials having integer coefficients, there
exists a sum-network which is scalar linear solvable over a finite field F if
and only if the polynomials have a common root in F. For any finite or cofinite
set of prime numbers, a network is constructed which has a vector linear
solution of any length if and only if the characteristic of the alphabet field
is in the given set. The insufficiency of linear network coding and
unachievability of the network coding capacity are proved for sum-networks by
using similar known results for communication networks. Under fractional vector
linear network coding, a sum-network and its reverse network are shown to be
equivalent. However, under non-linear coding, it is shown that there exists a
solvable sum-network whose reverse network is not solvable.
