The dynamic character of most social networks requires to model evolution of
networks in order to enable complex analysis of theirs dynamics. The following
paper focuses on the definition of differences between network snapshots by
means of Graph Differential Tuple. These differences enable to calculate the
diverse distance measures as well as to investigate the speed of changes. Four
separate measures are suggested in the paper with experimental study on real
social network data.
