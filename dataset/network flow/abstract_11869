In this paper we analyze a cognitive radio network with one primary and one
secondary transmitter, in which the primary transmitter has bursty arrivals
while the secondary node is assumed to be saturated (i.e. always has a packet
waiting to be transmitted). The secondary node transmits in a cognitive way
such that it does not impede the performance of the primary node. We assume
that the receivers have multipacket reception (MPR) capabilities and that the
secondary node can take advantage of the MPR capability by transmitting
simultaneously with the primary under certain conditions. We obtain analytical
expressions for the stationary distribution of the primary node queue and we
also provide conditions for its stability. Finally, we provide expressions for
the aggregate throughput of the network as well as for the throughput at the
secondary node.
