Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society.
Frequently cited examples include Internet, WWW, a network of chemicals linked
by chemical reactions, social relationship networks, citation networks, etc.
The research of complex networks has attracted many scientists' attention.
Physicists have shown that these networks exhibit some surprising characters,
such as high clustering coefficient, small diameter, and the absence of the
thresholds of percolation. Scientists in mathematical epidemiology discovered
that the threshold of infectious disease disappears on contact networks that
following Scale-Free distribution. Researchers in economics and public health
also find that the imitation behavior could lead to cluster phenomena of
vaccination and un-vaccination. In this note, we will review the basic concepts
of complex networks; Basic epidemic models; the development of complex networks
and epidemiology.
