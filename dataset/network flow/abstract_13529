The concept of movable evidence masses that flow from supersets to subsets as
specified by experts represents a suitable framework for reasoning under
uncertainty. The mass flow is controlled by specialization matrices. New
evidence is integrated into the frame of discernment by conditioning or
revision (Dempster's rule of conditioning), for which special specialization
matrices exist. Even some aspects of non-monotonic reasoning can be represented
by certain specialization matrices.
