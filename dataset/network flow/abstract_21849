We estimate terrestrial antineutrino and neutrino fluxes according to
different models of Earth composition. We find large variations, corresponding
to uncertainties on the estimated $U$, $Th$ and $K$ abundances in the mantle.
Information on the mantle composition can be derived from antineutrino flux
measurements after subtracting the crust contribution. This requires a good
description of the crust composition in the region of the detector site.
Measurements of terrestrial antineutrinos will provide a direct insight on the
main sources of Earth's heat flow.
