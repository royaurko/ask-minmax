Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of large number of low-cost,
resource-constrained sensor nodes. The constraints of the wireless sensor node
is their characteristics which include low memory, low computation power, they
are deployed in hostile area and left unattended, small range of communication
capability and low energy capabilities. Base on those characteristics makes
this network vulnerable to several attacks, such as sinkhole attack. Sinkhole
attack is a type of attack were compromised node tries to attract network
traffic by advertise its fake routing update. One of the impacts of sinkhole
attack is that, it can be used to launch other attacks like selective
forwarding attack, acknowledge spoofing attack and drops or altered routing
information. It can also used to send bogus information to base station. This
paper is focus on exploring and analyzing the existing solutions which used to
detect and identify sinkhole attack in wireless sensor network. The analysis is
based on advantages and limitation of the proposed solutions.
