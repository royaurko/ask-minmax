We propose a formal foundation for reasoning about access control policies
within a Dynamic Coalition, defining an abstraction over existing access
control models and providing mechanisms for translation of those models into
information-flow domain. The abstracted information-flow domain model, called a
Common Representation, can then be used for defining a way to control the
evolution of Dynamic Coalitions with respect to information flow.
