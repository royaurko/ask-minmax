We show that the ``perfect fluid'' elliptic flow of the bulk hadrons and the
unexpectedly strong quenching of heavy quark jet fragments in Au+Au reactions
at 200 AGeV can be simultaneously accounted for within leading order AdS/CFT
holography with a common large t'Hooft coupling $\lambda=g^2_{YM} N_c \sim 30$.
In contrast, weakly coupled quark-gluon plasma models have so far failed to
describe the observed correlation between these soft and hard observables even
for couplings extrapolated to $\alpha_s\sim 0.5$. We show that phenomenological
applications of the classical trailing string AdS/CFT holographic solution are
furthermore remarkably robust to higher order curvature corrections
$\mathcal{O}(1/\lambda^{3/2})$ in type IIB supergravity theories, as well as to
worldsheet fluctuation corrections $\mathcal{O}(1/\lambda^{1/2})$ that were not
considered previously. We emphasize the importance of future measurements at
RHIC and LHC of the correlation between {\em identified} charm and beauty quark
hard ($p_T > 10-30$ GeV) jet quenching observables and low transverse momenta
($p_T\le 1$ GeV) bulk elliptic flow observables to further tests the limits of
applicability of conformal holography to strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma.
