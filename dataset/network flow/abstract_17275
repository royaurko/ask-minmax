Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian
model for topic inference. In spite of its great success, inferring the latent
topic distribution with LDA is time-consuming. Motivated by the transfer
learning approach proposed by~\newcite{hinton2015distilling}, we present a
novel method that uses LDA to supervise the training of a deep neural network
(DNN), so that the DNN can approximate the costly LDA inference with less
computation. Our experiments on a document classification task show that a
simple DNN can learn the LDA behavior pretty well, while the inference is
speeded up tens or hundreds of times.
