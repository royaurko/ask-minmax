Discretizations of the Bogoyavlensky lattices are introduced, belonging to
the same hierarchies as the continuous--time systems. The construction
exemplifies the general scheme for integrable discretization of systems on Lie
algebras with $r$--matrix Poisson brackets. An initial value problem for the
difference equations is solved in terms of a factorization problem in a group.
Interpolating Hamiltonian flow is found.
