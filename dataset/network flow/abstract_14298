Our experiments show that for two or more pieces of a wire, of different
lengths in general, combined in parallel and connected to a dc source, the
current ratio evolves towards unity as the combination is cooled to the
superconducting transition temperature Tc, and remains pinned at that value
below it. This re-distribution of the total current towards equipartition
without external fine tuning is a surprise. It can be physically understood in
terms of a mechanism that involves the flux-flow resistance associated with the
transport current in a wire of type-II superconducting material. It is the fact
that the flux-flow resistance increases with current that drives the current
division towards equipartition.
