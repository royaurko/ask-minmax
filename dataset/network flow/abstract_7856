By methods of modern spectral analysis, we rigorously find distributions of
eigenvalues of linearized operators associated with an ideal hydromagnetic
Couette-Taylor flow. Transition to instability in the limit of vanishing
magnetic field has a discontinuous change compared to the Rayleigh stability
criterion for hydrodynamical flows, which is known as the
Velikhov-Chandrasekhar paradox.
