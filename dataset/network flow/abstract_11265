Performance of routing protocols in mobile ad-hoc networks is greatly
affected by the dynamic nature of nodes, route failures, wireless channels with
variable bandwidth and scalability issues. A mobility model imitates the real
world movement of mobile nodes and is central component to simulation based
studies. In this paper we consider mobility nodes which mimic the vehicular
motion of nodes like Manhattan mobility model and City Section mobility model.
We also propose a new Group Vehicular mobility model that takes the best
features of group mobility models like Reference Point Group mobility model and
applies it to vehicular models. We analyze the performance of our model known
as Group Vehicular mobility model (GVMM) and other vehicular mobility models
with various metrics. This analysis provides us with an insight about the
impact of mobility models on the performance of routing protocols for ad-hoc
networks. The routing protocols are simulated and measured for performance and
finally we arrive at the correlation about the impact of mobility models on
routing protocols, which are central to the design of mobile adhoc networks.
