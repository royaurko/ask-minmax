In a recent preprint \cite{eck}, the temporal dynamics of an e-mail network
has been investigated by J.P. Eckmann, E. Moses and D. Sergi. Specifically, the
time period between an e-mail message and its reply were recorded. It will be
shown here that their data agrees quantitatively with the frame work proposed
to explain a recent experiment on the response of ``internauts'' to a news
publication \cite{www2} despite differences in communication channels, topics,
time-scale and socio-economic characteristics of the two population. This
suggest a generalized response time distribution $\sim t^{-1}$ for human
populations in the absence of deadlines with important implications for
psychological and social studies as well the study of dynamical networks.
