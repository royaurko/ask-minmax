We investigate the chemical equilibration of the parton distributions in
collisions of two heavy nuclei. We use initial conditions obtained from a
self-screened parton cascade calculation and, for comparison, from the HIJING
model. We consider a one-dimensional, as well as a three-dimensional expansion
of the parton plasma and find that the onset of the transverse expansion
impedes the chemical equilibration. At energies of 100 GeV/nucleon, the results
for one-dimensional and three-dimensional expansion are quite similar except at
large values of the transverse radius. At energies of several TeV/nucleon, the
plasma initially approaches chemical equilibrium, but then is driven away from
it, when the transverse velocity gradients develop. We find that the total
parton multiplicity density remains essentially unaffected by the flow, but the
individual concentrations of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons are sensitive to
the transverse flow. The consequences of the flow are also discernible in the
transverse momenta of the partons and in the lepton pair spectra, where the
flow causes a violation of the so-called $M_T$ scaling.
