We analyze a model of mutually-propelled filaments suspended in a
two-dimensional solvent. The system undergoes a mean-field isotropic-nematic
transition for large enough filament concentrations and the nematic order
parameter is allowed to vary in space and time. We show that the interplay
between non-uniform nematic order, activity and flow results in spatially
modulated relaxation oscillations, similar to those seen in excitable media. In
this regime the dynamics consists of nearly stationary periods separated by
"bursts" of activity in which the system is elastically distorted and solvent
is pumped throughout. At even higher activity the dynamics becomes chaotic.
