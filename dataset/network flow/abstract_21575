We perform a statistical analysis of experimental fully developed turbulence
longitudinal velocity data in the Fourier space. We address the controversial
issue of statistical intermittency of spatial Fourier modes by acting on the
finite spectral resolution. We derive a link between velocity structure
functions and the flatness of Fourier modes thanks to cascade models. Similar
statistical behaviors are recovered in the analysis of spatial Fourier modes of
vorticity obtained in an acoustic scattering experiment. We conclude that
vorticity is long-range correlated and found more intermittent than
longitudinal velocity.
