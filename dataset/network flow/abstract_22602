The IEEE P1600.1 Standard Upper Ontology (SUO) project aims to specify an
upper ontology that will provide a structure and a set of general concepts upon
which domain ontologies could be constructed. The Information Flow Framework
(IFF), which is being developed under the auspices of the SUO Working Group,
represents the structural aspect of the SUO. The IFF is based on category
theory. Semantic integration of object-level ontologies in the IFF is
represented with its fusion construction. The IFF maintains ontologies using
powerful composition primitives, which includes the fusion construction.
