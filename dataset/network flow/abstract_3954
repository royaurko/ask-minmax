Peer to peer network architecture introduces many desired features including
self-scalability that led to achieving higher efficiency rate than the
traditional server-client architecture. This was contributed to the highly
distributed architecture of peer to peer network. Meanwhile, the lack of a
centralized control unit in peer to peer network introduces some challenge. One
of these challenges is key distribution and management in such an architecture.
This research will explore the possibility of developing a novel scheme for
distributing and managing keys in peer to peer network architecture
efficiently.
