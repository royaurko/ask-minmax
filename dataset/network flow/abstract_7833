Two basic approaches to producing thermonuclear fusion with a sheared flow
stabilized z-pinch are considered. One consists of heating the entire length of
the z-pinch column to the required temperatures. The other basic approach
considered here involves the concept of fast ignition. A localized "hot-spot"
is produced under the proper conditions to ignite a thermonuclear burn wave in
the z-pinch plasma. Here we demonstrate that sheared flow stabilization is more
efficient in the fast-ignition method with isentropic compression then in a
z-pinch where the entire plasma column is heated.
