The representation of complex systems as networks is inappropriate for the
study of certain problems. We show several examples of social, biological,
ecological and technological systems where the use of complex networks gives
very limited information about the structure of the system. We propose to use
hypergraphs to represent these systems by introducing the concept of the
complex hyper-network. We define several structural measures for complex
hyper-networks. These measures characterize hyper-network structures on the
basis of node participation in different hyper-edges (groups) and
sub-hypergraphs. We also define two clustering coefficients, one characterizing
the transitivity in the hyper-network through the proportion of hyper-triangles
to paths of length two and the other characterizing the formation of triples of
mutually adjacent groups in the hyper-network. All of these characteristics are
studied in two different hyper-networks; a scientific collaboration
hyper-network and an ecological competence hyper-network.
