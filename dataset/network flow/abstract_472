A problem which has recently attracted research attention is that of
estimating the distribution of flow sizes in internet traffic. On high traffic
links it is sometimes impossible to record every packet. Researchers have
approached the problem of estimating flow lengths from sampled packet data in
two separate ways. Firstly, different sampling methodologies can be tried to
more accurately measure the desired system parameters. One such method is the
sample-and-hold method where, if a packet is sampled, all subsequent packets in
that flow are sampled. Secondly, statistical methods can be used to ``invert''
the sampled data and produce an estimate of flow lengths from a sample.
  In this paper we propose, implement and test two variants on the
sample-and-hold method. In addition we show how the sample-and-hold method can
be inverted to get an estimation of the genuine distribution of flow sizes.
Experiments are carried out on real network traces to compare standard packet
sampling with three variants of sample-and-hold. The methods are compared for
their ability to reconstruct the genuine distribution of flow sizes in the
traffic.
