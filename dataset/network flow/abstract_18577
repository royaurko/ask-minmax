Relaying is a promising enhancement to current radio technologies, which has
been considered in IMT-Advanced candidate technologies such as 3GPP
LTE-Advanced and IEEE 802.16m. Relay enhanced networks are expected to fulfill
the demanding coverage and capacity requirements in a cost efficient way. Among
various relaying architectures multi-hop moving relays can provide additional
capacity for the cases when fixed relays are inaccessible or not able to
provide adequate solutions in terms of cost. In this paper, an overview of
multi-hop moving relays along with some of the envisioned deployment scenarios
is presented. Furthermore, different types of multi-hop moving relays are
discussed and the challenges are addressed.
