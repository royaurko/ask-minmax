In this note, we present few examples of Piecewise Deterministic Markov
Processes and their long time behavior. They share two important features: they
are related to concrete models (in biology, networks, chemistry,. . .) and they
are mathematically rich. Their math-ematical study relies on coupling method,
spectral decomposition, PDE technics, functional inequalities. We also relate
these simple examples to recent and open problems.
