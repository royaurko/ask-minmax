In this paper, we are exploring strategies for the reduction of the
congestion in the complex networks. The nodes without buffers are considered,
so, if the congestion occurs, the information packets will be dropped. The
focus is on the efficient routing. The routing strategies are compared using
two generic models, i.e., Barab\`asi-Albert scale-free network and scale-free
network on lattice, and the academic router networks of the Netherlands and
France. We propose a dynamic deflection routing algorithm which automatically
extends path of the packet before it arrives at congested node. The simulation
results indicate that the dynamic routing strategy can further reduce number of
dropped packets in a combination with the efficient path routing proposed by
Yan et al. [Phys. Rev. E 73, 046108 (2006)].
