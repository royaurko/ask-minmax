Robustness of ecological flow networks under random failure of arcs is
considered with respect to two different functionalities: coherence and
circulation. In our previous work, we showed that each functionality is
associated with a natural path notion: lateral path for the former and directed
path for the latter. Robustness of a network is measured in terms of the size
of the giant laterally connected arc component and that of the giant strongly
connected arc component, respectively. We study how realistic structures of
ecological flow networks affect the robustness with respect to each
functionality. To quantify the impact of realistic network structures, two null
models are considered for a given real ecological flow network: one is random
networks with the same degree distribution and the other is those with the same
average degree. Robustness of the null models is calculated by theoretically
solving the size of giant components for the configuration model. We show that
realistic network structures have positive effect on robustness for coherence,
whereas they have negative effect on robustness for circulation.
