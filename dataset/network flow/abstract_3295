We consider the inverse curvature flows $\dot x=F^{-p}\nu$ of closed
star-shaped hypersurfaces in Euclidean space in case $0<p\not=1$ and prove that
the flow exists for all time and converges to infinity, if $0<p<1$, while in
case $p>1$, the flow blows up in finite time, and where we assume the initial
hypersurface to be strictly convex. In both cases the properly rescaled flows
converge to the unit sphere.
