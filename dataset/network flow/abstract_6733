Dramatic data traffic growth, especially wireless data, is driving a
significant surge in energy consumption in the last mile access of the
telecommunications infrastructure. The growing energy consumption not only
escalates the operators' operational expenditures (OPEX) but also leads to a
significant rise of carbon footprints. Therefore, enhancing the energy
efficiency of broadband access networks is becoming a necessity to bolster
social, environmental, and economic sustainability. This article provides an
overview on the design and optimization of energy efficient broadband access
networks, analyzes the energy efficient design of passive optical networks,
discusses the enabling technologies for next generation broadband wireless
access networks, and elicits the emerging technologies for enhancing the energy
efficiency of the last mile access of the network infrastructure.
