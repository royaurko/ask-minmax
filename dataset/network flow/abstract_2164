Currently, it is urgent to ensure QoS in distributed computing systems. This
became especially important to the development and spread of cloud services.
Big data structures become heavily distributed. Necessary to consider the
communication channels and data transmission systems and virtualization and
scalability in future design of computational models in problems of designing
cloud systems, evaluating the effectiveness of the algorithms, the assessment
of economic performance data centers. Requires not only the monitoring of data
flows and computing resources, but also the operational management of these
resources to QoS provide. Such a tool may be just the introduction of feedback
in computational models. The article presents the main dynamic model with
feedback as a basis for a new model of distributed computing processes. The
research results are presented here. Formulated in this work can be used for
other complex tasks - estimation of structural complexity of distributed
databases, evaluation of dynamic characteristics of systems operating in the
hybrid cloud, etc.
