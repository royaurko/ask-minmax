We numerically demonstrate the feasibility of kinematic fast dynamos for a
class of time-periodic axisymmetric flows of conducting fluid confined inside a
sphere. The novelty of our work is in considering the realistic flows, which
are self-consistently determined from the Navier-Stokes equation with specified
boundary driving. Such flows can be achieved in a new plasma experiment, whose
spherical boundary is capable of differential driving of plasma flows in the
azimuthal direction. We show that magnetic fields are self-excited over a range
of flow parameters such as amplitude and frequency of flow oscillations, fluid
Reynolds (Re) and magnetic Reynolds (Rm) numbers. In the limit of large Rm, the
growth rates of the excited magnetic fields are of the order of the advective
time scales and practically independent of Rm, which is an indication of the
fast dynamo.
