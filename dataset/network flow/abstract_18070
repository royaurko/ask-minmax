We simulated the remagnetization dynamics of the ultra-dense and ultra-thin
magnetic dot array system with dipole-dipole and exchange coupling
interactions. Within the proposed 2D XY superlattice model, the square dots are
modeled by the spatially modulated exchange-couplings. The dipole-dipole
interactions were approximated by the hierarchical sums and dynamics was
reduced to damping term of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The simulation
of 40 000 spin system leads to nonequilibrium nonuniform configurations with
soliton-antisoliton pairs detected at intra-dot and inter-dot scales. The
classification of intra-dot magnetic configurations was performed using the
self-adaptive neural networks with varying number of neurons.
