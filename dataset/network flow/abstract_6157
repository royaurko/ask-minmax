Gene regulatory network reconstruction is a fundamental problem in
computational biology. We recently developed an algorithm, called PANDA
(Passing Attributes Between Networks for Data Assimilation), that integrates
multiple sources of 'omics data and estimates regulatory network models. This
approach was initially implemented in the C++ programming language and has
since been applied to a number of biological systems. In our current research
we are beginning to expand the algorithm to incorporate larger and most diverse
data-sets, to reconstruct networks that contain increasing numbers of elements,
and to build not only single network models, but sets of networks. In order to
accomplish these "Big Data" applications, it has become critical that we
increase the computational efficiency of the PANDA implementation. In this
paper we show how to recast PANDA's similarity equations as matrix operations.
This allows us to implement a highly readable version of the algorithm using
the MATLAB/Octave programming language. We find that the resulting M-code much
shorter (103 compared to 1128 lines) and more easily modifiable for potential
future applications. The new implementation also runs significantly faster,
with increasing efficiency as the network models increase in size. Tests
comparing the C-code and M-code versions of PANDA demonstrate that this
speed-up is on the order of 20-80 times faster for networks of similar
dimensions to those we find in current biological applications.
