Resent works of Hawking and Susskind suggested that information is conserved
in the universe. We extend this thesis and propose that dynamics of information
- computations can conserve in Anti-de-Sitter cosmological model. Information
geometry formalism is proposed to analyze information in dynamical systems. We
consider entropy flow as a geometrical flow on statistical manifold and develop
a Dynamic Cores model to analyze migration of information in dynamical systems.
Geometrical flow on the statistical manifold was considered as a transition of
local dynamical systems in original d+1-dim AdS space to their delocalized
holographic representation in d-dim Conformal Field Theory (CFT). It was noted
that geometrical flow related to renormalization group flow and provide
semi-conservation of informational invariants. Those invariants interpreted as
types of computations.
