Some micro-algae are sensitive to light intensity gradients. This property is
known as phototaxis: the algae swim toward a light source (positive
phototaxis). We use this property to control the motion of micro-algae within a
Poiseuille flow using light. The combination of flow vorticity and phototaxis
results in a concentration of algae around the center of the flow. Intermittent
light exposure allows analysis of the dynamics of this phenomenon and its
reversibility. With this phenomenon, we hope to pave the way toward new algae
concentration techniques (a bottleneck challenge in hydrogen algal production)
and toward the improvement of pollutant bio-detector technology.
