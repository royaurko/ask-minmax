We consider a fully distributed constrained convex optimization problem over
a multi-agent (no central coordinator) network. We propose an asynchronous
gossip-based random projection (GRP) algorithm that solves the distributed
problem using only local communications and computations. We analyze the
convergence properties of the algorithm for an uncoordinated diminishing
stepsize and a constant stepsize. For a diminishing stepsize, we prove that the
iterates of all agents converge to the same optimal point with probability 1.
For a constant stepsize, we establish an error bound on the expected distance
from the iterates of the algorithm to the optimal point. We also provide
simulation results on a distributed robust model predictive control problem.
