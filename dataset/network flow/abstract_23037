The suppression of high transverse momentum particles, recently discovered at
RHIC, is commonly interpreted as due to parton energy loss. In high energy
nuclear collisions, QCD jets would deposit a large fraction of their energy and
into the produced matter. The question of how this energy is degraded and
whether we can use this phenomenon to probe the properties of the produced
matter is now under active discussion. It has been proposed that if this
matter, which is now being referred to as a {\em strongly coupled Quark-Gluon
Plasma} (sQGP), may behave as a liquid with a very small viscosity.
 In this case, a very specific collective excitation should be produced, called
the ``conical flow'', similar e.g. to the sonic booms generated by the shock
waves produced by supersonic planes. The RHIC experiments seem indeed to be
obtaining some indication that the production of particles emitted opposite to
a high-$p_t$ jet may actually be peaked away from the quenched jet direction,
at an angle roughly consistent with the direction expected in case a shock wave
is produced (i.e. orthogonal to the Mach cone). In this note we speculate that
for tagged heavy-quark jets one may observe a shrinkage of the Mach cone at
moderate $p_t$. The experimental observation of such an effect would be a very
good test for the validity of the whole picture currently emerging from the
study of partonic matter in nuclear collisions.
