The Gaia satellite, planned for launch by the European Space Agency (ESA) in
2013, is the next generation astrometry mission following Hipparcos. Gaia's
primary science goal is to determine the kinematics, chemical structure and
evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy. In addition to this core science goal, the
Gaia space mission is expected to discover thousands of Solar System Objects.
Because of orbital constraints Gaia will only have a limited opportunity for
astrometric follow-up of these discoveries. In 2010, the Gaia consortium DPAC
initiated a program to identify ground-based optical telescopes for a Gaia
follow-up network for Solar System Objects to perform the following critical
tasks: confirmation of discovery, identification of body, object tracking to
constrain orbits. To date this network comprises 37 observing sites
(representing 53 instruments). The Zadko Telescope, located in Western
Australia, was highlighted as an important network node because of its southern
location, longitude and automated scheduling system. We describe the first
follow-up tests using the fast moving Potentially Hazardous Asteroid 2005 YU55
as the target.
