The analytical treatment of nonlinear evolution of the shear-flow-modified
current driven ion cyclotron instability and shear-flow-driven ion cyclotron
kinetic instabilities of magnetic field--aligned plasma shear flow is
presented. Analysis is performed on the base of the nonlinear dispersion
equation, which accounts for a new combined effect of plasma turbulence and
shear flow. It consists in turbulent scattering of ions across the shear flow
with their convection by shear flow and results in enhanced nonlinear
broadening of ion cyclotron resonances. This effect is found to lead to the
saturation of ion cyclotron instabilities as well as to the development of
nonlinear shear flow driven ion cyclotron instability. 52.35.Ra
