In this Letter, we proposed a mixing navigation mechanism, which interpolates
between random-walk and shortest-path protocol. The navigation efficiency can
be remarkably enhanced via a few routers. Some advanced strategies are also
designed: For non-geographical scale-free networks, the targeted strategy with
a tiny fraction of routers can guarantee an efficient navigation with low and
stable delivery time almost independent of network size. For geographical
localized networks, the clustering strategy can simultaneously increase the
efficiency and reduce the communication cost. The present mixing navigation
mechanism is of significance especially for information organization of
wireless sensor networks and distributed autonomous robotic systems.
