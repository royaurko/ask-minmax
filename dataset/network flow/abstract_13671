This fluid dynamics video, presented at the 66th Annual Meeting of the
American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics (Pittsburgh, PA), shows
how dielectric colloidal polystyrene (PS) particles with a negative surface
charge in a dilute suspension flowing through a microchannel can be manipulated
and assembled into streamwise structures by using a combination of shear and an
applied negative electric field along the streamwise direction. Interestingly,
these structures are only observed within about 1 um of the wall, which also
has a negative surface charge, and are not present in the bulk flow.
