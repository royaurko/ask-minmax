Modern ways of communications, such as in a web services environment, also
influences trust relationships between organisations. This concept of web-based
(way towards semantic web services) trust is new and has as yet not been
resolved. We hope that some of the trust properties mentioned above can be
successfully employed to improve the understanding of trust between machines.
So, trust is a vital ingredient of any successful interaction between
individuals, among organizations and/or in society at large. In this paper, we
suggested a trust model using fuzzy logic in semantic network of nodes. Trust
is an aggregation of consensus given a set of past interaction among nodes
(semantic network based on machines, agents etc.). We applied our suggested
model to semantic networks in order to show how trust mechanisms are involved
in communicating algorithm to choose the proper path from source to
destination. Authors use the terms untrust and distrust as synonyms for the
condition opposite to the trust.
