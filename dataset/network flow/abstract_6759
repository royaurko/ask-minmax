The basic parameters determining the flow pattern for a nonviscous,
non-heat-conducting gas in a semidetached binary system without a magnetic
field are identified. Three-dimensional gas-dynamical modeling of the mass
transfer enables investigation of the influence of these parameters on the
structure of gas flows. The parameter on which the flow pattern depends most
strongly is the adiabatic index $\gamma$. The effect of other parameters is
small, and only leads to unimportant quantitative changes in the solutions
obtained. The main properties of flows typical of semidetached binaries without
magnetic fields are summarized.
