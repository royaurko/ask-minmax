We investigate flows on graphs whose links have random capacities. For binary
trees we derive the probability distribution for the maximal flow from the root
to a leaf, and show that for infinite trees it vanishes beyond a certain
threshold that depends on the distribution of capacities. We then examine the
maximal total flux from the root to the leaves. Our methods generalize to
simple graphs with loops, e.g., to hierarchical lattices and to complete
graphs.
