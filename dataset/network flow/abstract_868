This paper investigates a network information flow problem for a
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian wireless network with $K$-users
and a single intermediate relay having $M$ antennas. In this network, each user
intends to convey a multicast message to all other users while receiving $K-1$
independent messages from the other users via an intermediate relay. This
network information flow is termed a MIMO Gaussian $K$-way relay channel. For
this channel, we show that $\frac{K}{2}$ degrees of freedom is achievable if
$M=K-1$. To demonstrate this, we come up with an encoding and decoding strategy
inspired from cryptography theory. The proposed encoding and decoding strategy
involves a \textit{signal space alignment for an encryption message} for the
multiple access phase (MAC) and \textit{zero forcing with successive network
code decoding} for the broadcast (BC) phase. The idea of the \emph{signal space
alignment for an encryption message} is that all users cooperatively choose the
precoding vectors to transmit the message so that the relay can receive a
proper encryption message with a special structure, \textit{network code chain
structure}. During the BC phase, \emph{zero forcing combined with successive
network code decoding} enables all users to decipher the encryption message
from the relay despite the fact that they all have different self-information
which they use as a key.
