Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in network analysis. In
many applications, notably in genetics, a partially observed network may not
contain any negative examples of absent edges, which creates a difficulty for
many existing supervised learning approaches. We develop a new method which
treats the observed network as a sample of the true network with different
sampling rates for positive and negative examples. We obtain a relative ranking
of potential links by their probabilities, utilizing information on node
covariates as well as on network topology. Empirically, the method performs
well under many settings, including when the observed network is sparse. We
apply the method to a protein-protein interaction network and a school
friendship network.
