We propose a method for characterizing large complex networks by introducing
a new matrix structure, unique for a given network, which encodes structural
information; provides useful visualization, even for very large networks; and
allows for rigorous statistical comparison between networks. Dynamic processes
such as percolation can be visualized using animations. Applications to graph
theory are discussed, as are generalizations to weighted networks, real-world
network similarity testing, and applicability to the graph isomorphism problem.
