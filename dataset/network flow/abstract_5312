As tools for dynamic system modelling both conventional methods such as
transfer function or state space representation and modern power flow based
methods are available. The latter methods do not depend on energy domain, are
able to preserve physical system structures, visualize power conversion or
coupling or split, identify power losses or storage, run on conventional
software and emphasize the relevance of energy as basic principle of known
physical domains. Nevertheless common control structures as well as analysis
and design tools may still be applied. Furthermore the generalization of power
flow methods as pseudo-power flow provides with a universal tool for any
dynamic modelling. The phenomenon of power flow constitutes an up to date
education methodology. Thus the paper summarizes fundamentals of selected power
flow oriented modelling methods, presents a Bond Graph block library for
teaching power oriented modelling as compact menu-driven freeware, introduces
selected examples and discusses special features.
