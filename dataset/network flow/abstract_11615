In this paper, based on the gravity principle of classical physics, we
propose a tunable gravity-based model, which considers tag usage pattern to
weigh both the mass and distance of network nodes. We then apply this model in
solving the problems of information filtering and network evolving.
Experimental results on two real-world data sets, \emph{Del.icio.us} and
\emph{MovieLens}, show that it can not only enhance the algorithmic
performance, but can also better characterize the properties of real networks.
This work may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the effect of
gravity model.
