Discovering overlapping community structures is a crucial step to
understanding the structure and dynamics of many networks. In this paper we
develop a symmetric binary matrix factorization model (SBMF) to identify
overlapping communities. Our model allows us not only to assign community
memberships explicitly to nodes, but also to distinguish outliers from
overlapping nodes. In addition, we propose a modified partition density to
evaluate the quality of community structures. We use this to determine the most
appropriate number of communities. We evaluate our methods using both synthetic
benchmarks and real world networks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.
