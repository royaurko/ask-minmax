We analyze the effect of correlations in a simple model of small world
network by obtaining exact analytical expressions for the distribution of
shortest paths in the network. We enter correlations into a simple model with a
distinguished site, by taking the random connections to this site from an Ising
distribution. Our method shows how the transfer matrix technique can be used in
the new context of small world networks.
