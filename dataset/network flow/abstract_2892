We consider the problem of securing a multicast network against a wiretapper
that can intercept the packets on a limited number of arbitrary network edges
of its choice. We assume that the network employs the network coding technique
to simultaneously deliver the packets available at the source to all the
receivers.
  We show that this problem can be looked at as a network generalization of the
wiretap channel of type II introduced in a seminal paper by Ozarow and Wyner.
In particular, we show that the transmitted information can be secured by using
the Ozarow-Wyner approach of coset coding at the source on top of the existing
network code. This way, we quickly and transparently recover some of the
results available in the literature on secure network coding for wiretap
networks. Moreover, we derive new bounds on the required alphabet size that are
independent of the network size and devise an algorithm for the construction of
secure network codes. We also look at the dual problem and analyze the amount
of information that can be gained by the wiretapper as a function of the number
of wiretapped edges.
