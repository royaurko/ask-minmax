We describe abstract (p,q) string networks which are the string networks of
Sen without the information about their embedding in a background spacetime.
The non-perturbative dynamical formulation invented for spin networks, in terms
of causal evolution of dual triangulations, is applied to them. The formal
transition amplitudes are sums over discrete causal histories that evolve (p,q)
string networks. The dynamics depend on two free SL(2,Z) invariant functions
which describe the amplitudes for the local evolution moves.
