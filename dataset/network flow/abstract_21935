The anisotropy of magnetophydrodynamic turbulence is investigated by using
solar wind data from the Helios 2 spacecraft. We investigate the behaviour of
the complete high-order moment tensors of magnetic field increments and we
compare the usual longitudinal structure functions which have both isotropic
and anisotropic contributions, to the fully anisotropic contribution. Scaling
exponents have been extracted by an interpolation scaling function. Unlike the
usual turbulence in fluid flows, small-scale magnetic fluctuations remain
anisotropic. We discuss the radial dependence of both anisotropy and
intermittency and their relationship.
