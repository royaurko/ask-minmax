The recent success of structured solutions for a class of
information-theoretic network problems, calls for exploring their limits. We
show that sum-product channels resist a solution by structured (as well as
random) codes. We conclude that the structured approach fails whenever the
channel operations do not commute (or for general functional channels, when the
channel function is non decomposable).
