Distribution systems hold a very significant position in the power system
since it is the main point of link between bulk power and consumers. A planned
and effective distribution network is the key to cope up with the ever
increasing demand for domestic, industrial and commercial load. The load-flow
study of radial distribution network is of prime importance for effective
planning of load transfers. Power companies are interested in finding the most
efficient configuration for minimization of real power loses and load balancing
among distribution feeders to save energy and enhance the over all performance
of distribution system.
  This thesis presents a fast and efficient method for load-flow analysis of
radial distribution networks. The proposed method is based on linear data
structure. The order of time and space complexity is reported here. There is
significant saving in no. of steps execution. Using graph theory concept and
exploiting multi-cores architecture, the proposed method for load flow can be
further investigated for obtaining more optimized solutions.
