Differential elliptic flow out to p_t ~ 5 GeV/c is calculated using the MPC
elastic parton cascade model for Au+Au at Ecm ~ 130A GeV. The results are
compared to recent STAR/RHIC elliptic flow data. An elliptic flow pattern
comparable to the data seems to require initial parton densities at least twice
higher than predicted by the HIJING model. Elliptic flow is also shown to be
sensitive to the hadronization procedure.
