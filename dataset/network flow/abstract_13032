If X is a hyperbolic metric space in the sense of Gromov and G a non-
elementary discrete group of isometries acting properly discontinuously on X,
it is shown that the geodesic flow on the quotient space Y=X/G is topologically
mixing, provided that the non-wandering set of the flow equals the whole
quotient space of geodesics GY:=GX/G and geodesics in X satisfy certain
uniqueness and convergence properties. In addition, the boundary of X is
assumed to be connected and a counter example is given concerning the necessity
of this assumption.
