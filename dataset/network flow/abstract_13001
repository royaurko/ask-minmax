Simple, self-similar, elliptic solutions of non-relativistic fireball
hydrodynamics are presented, generalizing earlier results for spherically
symmetric fireballs with Hubble flows and homogeneous temperature profiles. The
transition from one dimensional to three dimensional expansions is investigated
in an efficient manner.
