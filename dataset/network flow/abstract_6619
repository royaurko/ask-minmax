In this paper, we explore the formation of network relationships among
disaster relief agencies during the process of responding to an unexpected
event. The relationship is investigated through variables derived from the
policy network theory, and four cases from three developed countries such as
(i) Hurricane Katrina in the US; (ii) Typhoon Maemi in South Korea; (iii) Kobe;
and, (iv) Tohoku Earthquake in Japan that failed to cope with extreme events
forms the basis for case study presented here. We argue that structural
characteristics of multi-jurisdictional coordination may facilitate or impede
in responding to a complex nature of recent disaster. We further highlight the
promise of policy network approach in facilitating the development of
multi-jurisdictional coordination process which may provide new avenue to
improve the communication and coordination of hierarchical command control
driven organizations with the local community. Our proposed novel approach in
investigating the usefulness of network approach through media content analysis
for emergency may provide opportunity as a countermeasure to a traditional
hierarchical coordination, which may give further insights in establishing a
more effective network for emergency.
