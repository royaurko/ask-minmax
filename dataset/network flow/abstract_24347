This paper explores using RSS measurements on many links in a wireless
network to estimate the breathing rate of a person, and the location where the
breathing is occurring, in a home, while the person is sitting, laying down,
standing, or sleeping. The main challenge in breathing rate estimation is that
"motion interference", i.e., movements other than a person's breathing,
generally cause larger changes in RSS than inhalation and exhalation. We
develop a method to estimate breathing rate despite motion interference, and
demonstrate its performance during multiple short (3-7 minute) tests and during
a longer 66 minute test. Further, for the same experiments, we show the
location of the breathing person can be estimated, to within about 2 m average
error in a 56 square meter apartment. Being able to locate a breathing person
who is not otherwise moving, without calibration, is important for applications
in search and rescue, health care, and security.
