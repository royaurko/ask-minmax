We are interested in a nonlocal conservation law which describes the
morphodynamics of sand dunes sheared by a fluid flow, recently proposed by
Andrew C. Fowler. We prove that constant solutions of Fowler's equation are
non-linearly unstable. We also illustrate this fact using a finite difference
scheme.
