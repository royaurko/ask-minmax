We present some results from simulation of a network of nodes connected by
c-NOT gates with nearest neighbors. Though initially we begin with pure states
of varying boundary conditions, the updating with time quickly involves a
complicated entanglement involving all or most nodes. As a normal c-NOT gate,
though unitary for a single pair of nodes, seems to be not so when used in a
network in a naive way, we use a manifestly unitary form of the transition
matrix with c?-NOT gates, which invert the phase as well as flipping the qubit.
This leads to complete entanglement of the net, but with variable coefficients
for the different components of the superposition. It is interesting to note
that by a simple logical back projection the original input state can be
recovered in most cases. We also prove that it is not possible for a sequence
of unitary operators working on a net to make it move from an aperiodic regime
to a periodic one, unlike some classical cases where phase-locking happens in
course of evolution. However, we show that it is possible to introduce by hand
periodic orbits to sets of initial states, which may be useful in forming
dynamic pattern recognition systems.
