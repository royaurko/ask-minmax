In this paper, we present the time evolution of a rotationally axisymmetric
gas ring around a non rotating black hole using two dimensional grid-based
hydrodynamic simulation. We show the way in which angular momentum transport is
included in simulations of non-self-gravitating accretion of matter towards a
black hole. We use the Shakura-Sunyaev {\alpha} viscosity prescription to
estimate the turbulent viscosity for all major viscous stress tensors. We
investigate how a gas ring which is initially assumed to rotate with Keplerian
angular velocity is accreted on to a black hole and hence forms accretion disc
in the presence of turbulent viscosity. We show that the centrifugal pressure
supported sub-Keplerian flow with shocks forms when the ring starts to disperse
with inclusion of relatively small amount of viscosity. But, if the viscosity
is above the critical value, the shock disappears altogether and the whole disc
becomes Kepleiran which is subsonic everywhere except in a region close to the
horizon, where it supersonically enters to the black hole. We discovered a
multiple valued Mach number solution and the corresponding density
distributions that connects matter (a) from the initial Keplerian gas ring to a
sub-Keplerian disc with shocks in presence of small amount of viscosity and (b)
from the sub-Keplerian flow to a Keplerian disc in presence of huge amount of
viscosity. We calculate the temporal variations of the magnitude of various
time scales which ensure us about the stability of the flow.
