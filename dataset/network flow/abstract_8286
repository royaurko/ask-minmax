We present a simple model that enables us to analytically characterize a
floppy to rigid transition and an associated self-adaptive intermediate phase
in a random bond network. In this intermediate phase, the network adapts itself
to lower the stress due to constraints. Our simulations verify this picture. We
use these insights to identify applications of these ideas in computational
problems such as vertex cover and K-SAT.
