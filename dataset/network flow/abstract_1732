This special issue collects contributions from the participants of the
"Information in Dynamical Systems and Complex Systems" workshop, which cover a
wide range of important problems and new approaches that lie in the
intersection of information theory and dynamical systems. The contributions
include theoretical characterization and understanding of the different types
of information flow and causality in general stochastic processes, inference
and identification of coupling structure and parameters of system dynamics,
rigorous coarse-grain modeling of network dynamical systems, and exact
statistical testing of fundamental information-theoretic quantities such as the
mutual information. The collective efforts reported herein reflect a modern
perspective of the intimate connection between dynamical systems and
information flow, leading to the promise of better understanding and modeling
of natural complex systems and better/optimal design of engineering systems.
