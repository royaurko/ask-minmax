A certain complexity threshold is proposed which defines the term `complex
network' for RSN, e.g. Kauffman networks with s>=2 - more than two equally
probable state variants. Such Kauffman networks are no longer Boolean networks.
RSN are different than RWN and RNS. This article is the second one of three
steps in description of `structural tendencies' which are an effect of adaptive
evolution of complex RSN. This complexity threshold is based on the appearances
of chaotic features of a network during its random growth and disappearance of
small network effects. Distribution of damage size (after small disturbance)
measured in a fraction of damaged nodes, or in number of damaged external
outputs and degree of chaos is investigated using simulation. It is done during
growth (up to N=4000 nodes) for different: network types (including
scale-free), numbers of node inputs (K=2,3,4, fixed for a network) and numbers
of signal variants (s=2,3,4,16). In this distribution two peaks emerge and
in-between them there appears an area of zero frequency - this is the best
practical criterion of complexity threshold found in the investigation. No
critical points are found in the area of emerging complexity. A special
simplified algorithm (`reversed-annealed') is used which omits the problem of
circular attractors. The investigated `transition' to chaos in respect to N is
different from the known phase transition near K=2 for s=2.
