The paper deals with the existence and almost periodic homogenization of some
model of generalized Navier-Stokes equations. We first establish an existence
result for non-stationary Ladyzhenskaya equations with a given non constant
density. The external force depends nonlinearly on the velocity. Next, to
proceed with homogenization, as the density of the fluid is non constant, we
combine the sigma-convergence method with some compactness arguments.
