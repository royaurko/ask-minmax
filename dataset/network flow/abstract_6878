A numerical model was developed for flows involving an interface between a
homogenous fluid and a porous medium. The numerical model is based on the
finite volume method with body-fitted and multi-block grids. The
Darcy-Forchheimer extended model is used to govern the flow in the porous
medium region. At its interface, a shear stress jump was imposed, together with
a continuity of normal stress. Furthermore, the effect of the jump condition on
the diffusive flux is considered, additional to that on the convective part
which has been usually considered. Numerical results of three flow
configurations are presented. The modeling is suitable for problems which have
complex interface boundary conditions coupling between two flow domains.
