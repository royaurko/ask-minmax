The alternative replica technique which involve summation over all integer
momenta of the partition function and which does not require analytic
continuation to non-integer values of the replica parameter $n$ is discussed.
In terms of this technique (which does not involve any replica symmetry
breaking "magic operations") rigorous solution for the average free energy of
the Random Energy Model is recovered in a very simple way.
