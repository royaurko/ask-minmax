This is a brief review of the recent developments in the theory of magnetic
acceleration of relativistic jets. We attempt to explain the key results of
this complex theory using basic physical arguments and simple calculations. The
main focus is on the standard model, which describes steady-state axisymmetric
ideal MHD flows. We argue that this model is over-restrictive and discuss
various alternatives.
