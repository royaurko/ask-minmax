We study a simplified, solvable model of a fully-connected metabolic network
with constrained quenched disorder to mimic the conservation laws imposed by
stoichiometry on chemical reactions. Within a spin-glass type of approach, we
show that in presence of a conserved metabolic pool the flux state
corresponding to maximal growth is stationary independently of the pool size.
In addition, and at odds with the case of unconstrained networks, the volume of
optimal flux configurations remains finite, indicating that the frustration
imposed by stoichiometric constraints, while reducing growth capabilities,
confers robustness and flexibility to the system. These results have a clear
biological interpretation and provide a basic, fully analytical explanation to
features recently observed in real metabolic networks.
