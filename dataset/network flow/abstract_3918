A model for epidemic spreading on rewiring networks is introduced and
analyzed for the case of scale free steady state networks. It is found that
contrary to what one would have naively expected, the rewiring process
typically tends to suppress epidemic spreading. In particular it is found that
as in static networks, rewiring networks with degree distribution exponent
$\gamma >3$ exhibit a threshold in the infection rate below which epidemics die
out in the steady state. However the threshold is higher in the rewiring case.
For $2<\gamma \leq 3$ no such threshold exists, but for small infection rate
the steady state density of infected nodes (prevalence) is smaller for rewiring
networks.
