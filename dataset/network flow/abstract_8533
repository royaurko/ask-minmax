Mobile Agents (MAs) represent a distributed computing technology that
promises to address the scalability problems of centralized network management.
A critical issue that will affect the wider adoption of MA paradigm in
management applications is the development of MA Platforms (MAPs) expressly
oriented to distributed management. However, most of available platforms impose
considerable burden on network and system resources and also lack of essential
functionality. In this paper, we discuss the design considerations and
implementation details of a complete MAP research prototype that sufficiently
addresses all the aforementioned issues. Our MAP has been implemented in Java
and tailored for network and systems management applications.
