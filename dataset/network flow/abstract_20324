The filamentation (Weibel) instability plays a key role in the formation of
collisionless shocks which are thought to produce Gamma-Ray-Bursts and
High-Energy-Cosmic-Rays in astrophysical environments. While it has been known
for long that a flow-aligned magnetic field can completely quench the
instability, it was recently proved in 2D that in the cold regime, such
cancelation is possible if and only if the field is perfectly aligned. Here,
this result is finally extended to a 3D geometry. Calculations are conducted
for symmetric and asymmetric counter-streaming relativistic plasma shells. 2D
results are retrieved in 3D: the instability can never be completely canceled
for an oblique magnetic field. In addition, the maximum growth-rate is always
larger for wave vectors lying in the plan defined by the flow and the oblique
field. On the one hand, this bears consequences on the orientation of the
generated filaments. On the other hand, it certifies 2D simulations of the
problem can be performed without missing the most unstable filamentation modes.
