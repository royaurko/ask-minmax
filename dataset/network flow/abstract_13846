The mean-eddy interaction in a flow is investigated in terms of the energy
transfer between its mean and eddy processes. In a Reynolds decomposition
framework, energy transfer can be defined from the decomposed energy equations,
but the definition is subjective with the classical energetics formalism. This
paper shows that a faithful formalism can be rigorously established within the
same framework. The resulting transfer sums to zero everywhere over the
decomposed subspaces, representing a mere redistribution of energy between the
mean and eddy processes, without generating or destroying energy as a whole.
For this reason, it has been referred to as perfect transfer in distinction
from other energy transfers one may have encountered. The perfect transfer has
a simple form in expression, with the introduction of an eddy flow coupled with
the mean and eddy processes of the field under concern. The eddy or turbulence
production is then totally determined by the divergence of this flow. This
formalism has been validated with a well-known barotropic instability model,
and a wake control problem. It is expected to be useful for the harnessing of
turbulence, in that it may help to identify the best locations to place passive
controls, or design the performance functional for active controls.
