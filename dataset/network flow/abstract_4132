In this paper, the general formulation for inextensible flows of curves on
oriented surface in $\mathbb{R}^3 $ is investigated. The necessary and
sufficient conditions for inextensible curve flow lying an oriented surface are
expressed as a partial differential equation involving the geodesic curvature
and the geodesic torsion. Moreover, some special cases of inextensible curves
on oriented surface are given.
