Markovian properties of a discrete random multiplicative cascade model of
log-normal type are discussed. After taking small-scale resummation and
breaking of the ultrametric hierarchy into account, qualitative agreement with
Kramers-Moyal coefficients, recently deduced from a fully developed turbulent
flow, is achieved.
