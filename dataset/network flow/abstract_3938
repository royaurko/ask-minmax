Random networks generators like Erdoes-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz and
Barabasi-Albert models are used as models to study real-world networks. Let
G^1(V,E_1) and G^2(V,E_2) be two such networks on the same vertex set V. This
paper studies the degree distribution and cluster coefficient of the resultant
networks, G(V, E_1 U E_2).
