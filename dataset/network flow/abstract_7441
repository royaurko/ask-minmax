With the eventual aim of describing flowing elasto-plastic materials, we
focus on the elementary brick of such a flow, a plastic event, and compute the
long-range perturbation it elastically induces in a medium submitted to a
global shear strain. We characterize the effect of a nearby wall on this
perturbation, and quantify the importance of finite size effects. Although for
the sake of simplicity most of our explicit formulae deal with a 2D situation,
our statements hold for 3D situations as well.
