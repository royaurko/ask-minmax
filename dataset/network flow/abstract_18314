Integrating the sensing capabilities in Internet Protocol network will open
the opportunities to build a wide range of novel multimedia applications. The
problem when using sensors (e.g. temperature sensor, camera, audio, humidity,
etc.) connected to the network is to know dynamically at any time if they are
always connected or not, what type of data they can transmit and where they are
geographically located. This paper describes an application enabler: IMS Sensor
Search Engine Enabler (iSSEE), which allows IMS applications using sensors and
IMS based devices, to get information about the sensor availability, its
location and the type of the sensor. Using data collected by sensors and from
the web, mash-ups convergent applications use cases are proposed by combining
the contents from heterogeneous data.
