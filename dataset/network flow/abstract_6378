In mobile ad hoc networks, by attacking the corresponding routing protocol,
an attacker can easily disturb the operations of the network. For ad hoc
networks, till now many secured routing protocols have been proposed which
contains some disadvantages. Therefore security in ad hoc networks is a
controversial area till now. In this paper, we proposed a Lightweight and
Attack Resistant Authenticated Routing Protocol (LARARP) for mobile ad hoc
networks. For the route discovery attacks in MANET routing protocols, our
protocol gives an effective security. It supports the node to drop the invalid
packets earlier by detecting the malicious nodes quickly by verifying the
digital signatures of all the intermediate nodes. It punishes the misbehaving
nodes by decrementing a credit counter and rewards the well behaving nodes by
incrementing the credit counter. Thus it prevents uncompromised nodes from
attacking the routes with malicious or compromised nodes. It is also used to
prevent the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The efficiency and effectiveness
of LARARP are verified through the detailed simulation studies.
