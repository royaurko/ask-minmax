This thesis is concerned with the energy efficiency of cellular networks. It
studies the dominant power consumer in future cellular networks, the Long Term
Evolution radio base stations (BS), and proposes mechanisms that enhance the BS
energy efficiency by reducing its power consumption under target rate
constraints. These mechanisms trade spare capacity for power saving.
