We show that some of the Josephson couplings of junctions arranged to form an
inhomogeneous network undergo a non-perturbative renormalization provided that
the network's connectivity is pertinently chosen. As a result, the zero-voltage
Josephson critical currents $I_c$ turn out to be enhanced along directions
selected by the network's topology. This renormalization effect is possible
only on graphs whose adjacency matrix admits an hidden spectrum (i.e. a set of
localized states disappearing in the thermodynamic limit). We provide a
theoretical and experimental study of this effect by comparing the
superconducting behavior of a comb-shaped Josephson junction network and a
linear chain made with the same junctions: we show that the Josephson critical
currents of the junctions located on the comb's backbone are bigger than the
ones of the junctions located on the chain. Our theoretical analysis, based on
a discrete version of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, leads to results which
are in good quantitative agreement with experimental results.
