We present the 158 standard stars that define the u'g'r'i'z' photometric
system. These stars form the basis for the photometric calibration of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The defining instrument system and filters, the
observing process, the reduction techniques, and the software used to create
the stellar network are all described. We briefly discuss the history of the
star selection process, the derivation of a set of transformation equations for
the UBVRcIc system, and plans for future work.
