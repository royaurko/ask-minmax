We propose a generic scaling theory for critical phenomena that includes
power-law and essential singularities in finite and infinite dimensional
systems. In addition, we clarify its validity by analyzing the Potts model in a
simple hierarchical network, where a saddle-node bifurcation of the
renormalization-group fixed point governs the essential singularity.
