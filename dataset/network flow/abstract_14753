The induced electric field in a tokamak drives a parallel electron current
flow. In an inhomogeneous, finite beta plasma, when this electron flow is
comparable to the ion thermal speed, the Alfven mode wave solutions of the
electromagnetic gyrokinetic equation can become nearly purely growing kink
modes. Using the new "low-flow" version of the gyrokinetic code GS2 developed
for momentum transport studies [Barnes et al 2013 Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,
055005], we are able to model the effect of the induced parallel electric field
on the electron distribution to study the destabilizing influence of current on
stability. We identify high mode number kink modes in GS2 simulations and make
comparisons to analytical theory in sheared magnetic geometry. We demonstrate
reassuring agreement with analytical results both in terms of parametric
dependences of mode frequencies and growth rates, and regarding the radial mode
structure.
