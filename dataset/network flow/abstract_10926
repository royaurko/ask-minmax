The categorization properties of an attractor network of three-state neurons
which infers three-state concepts from examples are studied. The evolution
equations governing the parallel dynamics at zero temperature for the overlap
between the state of the network and the examples, the state of the network and
the concepts as well as the neuron activity are discussed in the limit of
extreme dilution. A transition from a retrieval region to a categorization
region is found when the number of examples or their correlations are
increased. If the pattern activity is small enough, the examples (concepts) are
very well retrieved (categorized) for an appropriate choice of the
zero-activity threshold of the neurons.
