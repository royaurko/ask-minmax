We propose a synthetical weights' dynamic mechanism for weighted networks
which takes into account the influences of strengths of nodes, weights of links
and incoming new vertices. Strength/Weight preferential strategies are used in
these weights' dynamic mechanisms, which depict the evolving strategies of many
real-world networks. We give insight analysis to the synthetical weights'
dynamic mechanism and study how individual weights' dynamic strategies interact
and cooperate with each other in the networks' evolving process. Power-law
distributions of strength, degree and weight, nontrivial strength-degree
correlation, clustering coefficients and assortativeness are found in the model
with tunable parameters representing each model. Several homogenous
functionalities of these independent weights' dynamic strategy are generalized
and their synergy are studied.
