Visual analytics is a subdomain of data analysis which combines both human
and machine analytical abilities and is applied mostly in decision-making and
data mining tasks. Triclustering, based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), was
developed to detect groups of objects with similar properties under similar
conditions. It is used in Social Network Analysis (SNA) and is a basis for
certain types of recommender systems. The problem of triclustering algorithms
is that they do not always produce meaningful clusters. This article describes
a specific triclustering algorithm and a prototype of a visual analytics
platform for working with obtained clusters. This tool is designed as a testing
frameworkis and is intended to help an analyst to grasp the results of
triclustering and recommender algorithms, and to make decisions on
meaningfulness of certain triclusters and recommendations.
