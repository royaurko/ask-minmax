In this paper, we prove almost tight bounds on the size of sound monotone
switching networks accepting permutations sets of directed trees. This roughly
corresponds to proving almost tight bounds bounds on the monotone memory
efficiency of the directed ST-connectivity problem for the special case in
which the input graph is guaranteed to have no path from s to t or be
isomorphic to a specific directed tree.
