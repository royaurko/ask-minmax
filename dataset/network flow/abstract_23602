We describe a scheme for moving living code between a set of distributed
processes coordinated with unification based Linda operations, and its
application to building a comprehensive Logic programming based Internet
programming framework. Mobile threads are implemented by capturing first order
continuations in a compact data structure sent over the network. Code is
fetched lazily from its original base turned into a server as the continuation
executes at the remote site. Our code migration techniques, in combination with
a dynamic recompilation scheme, ensure that heavily used code moves up smoothly
on a speed hierarchy while volatile dynamic code is kept in a quickly updatable
form. Among the examples, we describe how to build programmable client and
server components (Web servers, in particular) and mobile agents.
