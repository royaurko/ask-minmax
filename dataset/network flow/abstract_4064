In this talk, we report an analysis of elliptic flow ($v_2$), non-flow
($\delta_{2}$), and $v_2$ fluctuations ($\sigma_{v_{2}}$) for the STAR
collaboration at middle rapidity in $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV Au+Au
collisions. We compare the results to models of the fluctuations in the initial
eccentricity of the overlap zone.
