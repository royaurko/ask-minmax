Percolation theory has been largely used in the study of structural
properties of complex networks such as the robustness, with remarkable results.
Nevertheless, a purely topological description is not sufficient for a correct
characterization of networks behaviour in relation with physical flows and
spreading phenomena taking place on them. The functionality of real networks
also depends on the ability of the nodes and the edges in bearing and handling
loads of flows, energy, information and other physical quantities. We propose
to study these properties introducing a process of inhomogeneous percolation,
in which both the nodes and the edges spread out the flows with a given
probability.
  Generating functions approach is exploited in order to get a generalization
of the Molloy-Reed Criterion for inhomogeneous joint site bond percolation in
correlated random graphs. A series of simple assumptions allows the analysis of
more realistic situations, for which a number of new results are presented. In
particular, for the site percolation with inhomogeneous edge transmission, we
obtain the explicit expressions of the percolation threshold for many
interesting cases, that are analyzed by means of simple examples and numerical
simulations. Some possible applications are debated.
