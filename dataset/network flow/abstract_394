We propose a branch flow model for the anal- ysis and optimization of mesh as
well as radial networks. The model leads to a new approach to solving optimal
power flow (OPF) that consists of two relaxation steps. The first step
eliminates the voltage and current angles and the second step approximates the
resulting problem by a conic program that can be solved efficiently. For radial
networks, we prove that both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there
are no upper bounds on loads. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always
exact but the angle relaxation may not be exact, and we provide a simple way to
determine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We propose convexification
of mesh networks using phase shifters so that OPF for the convexified network
can always be solved efficiently for an optimal solution. We prove that
convexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the
network and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power
flows, generation, loads, or operating constraints. Part I introduces our
branch flow model, explains the two relaxation steps, and proves the conditions
for exact relaxation. Part II describes convexification of mesh networks, and
presents simulation results.
