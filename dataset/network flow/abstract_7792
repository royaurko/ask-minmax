In this paper, we define, via Fourier transform, an ergodic flow of
transformations of a Wiener space which preserves the law of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and which interpolates the iterations of a
transformation previously defined by Jeulin and Yor. Then, we give a more
explicit expression for this flow, and we construct from it a continuous
gaussian process indexed by R^2, such that all its restriction obtained by
fixing the first coordinate are Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.
