We evaluate the probability that a Boolean network returns to an attractor
after perturbing h nodes. We find that the return probability as function of h
can display a variety of different behaviours, which yields insights into the
state-space structure. In addition to performing computer simulations, we
derive analytical results for several types of Boolean networks, in particular
for Random Boolean Networks. We also apply our method to networks that have
been evolved for robustness to small perturbations, and to a biological
example.
