We consider the problem of decentralized detection in a network consisting of
a large number of nodes arranged as a tree of bounded height, under the
assumption of conditionally independent, identically distributed observations.
We characterize the optimal error exponent under a Neyman-Pearson formulation.
We show that the Type II error probability decays exponentially fast with the
number of nodes, and the optimal error exponent is often the same as that
corresponding to a parallel configuration. We provide sufficient, as well as
necessary, conditions for this to happen. For those networks satisfying the
sufficient conditions, we propose a simple strategy that nearly achieves the
optimal error exponent, and in which all non-leaf nodes need only send 1-bit
messages.
