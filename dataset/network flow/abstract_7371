Flow of matter onto strongly magnetized neutron stars in X-ray binaries
proceeds through accretion funnels that roughly follow geometry of the magnetic
field. X-rays originate near surface of the neutron star, and it may happen
that the accretion flow passes through the line of sight as the star rotates.
We consider the effects of such accretion flow eclipses on the X-ray light
curves of accretion powered pulsars, and present a set of X-ray light-curves
measured by BATSE for A0535+262 for which this phenomenon is very likely to
take place.
