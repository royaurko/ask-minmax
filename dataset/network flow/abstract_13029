The Ruelle zeta-function of the geodesic flow on the sphere bundle $S(X)$ of
an even-dimensional compact locally symmetric space $X$ of rank $1$ is a
meromorphic function in the complex plane that satisfies a functional equation
relating its values in $s$ and $-s$. The multiplicity of its singularity in
the central critical point $s = 0$ only depends on the hyperbolic structure of
the flow and can be calculated by integrating a secondary characteristic class
canonically associated to the flow- invariant foliations of $S(X)$ for which a
representing differential form is given.
