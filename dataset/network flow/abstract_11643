Increased use of Wireless sensor Networks (WSNs) in variety of applications
has enabled the designers to create autonomous sensors, which can be deployed
randomly, without human supervision, for the purpose of sensing and
communicating valuable data. Many energy-efficient routing protocols are
designed for WSNs based on clustering structure. In this paper, we have
proposed iMODLEACH protocol which is an extension to the MODLEACH protocol.
Simulation results indicate that iMODLEACH outperforms MODLEACH in terms of
network life-time and packets transferred to base station. The mathematical
analysis helps to select such values of these parameters which can suit a
particular wireless sensor network application.
