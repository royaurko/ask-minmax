We report Molecular Dynamics simulations for a new model of tetrahedral
network glass-former, based on short-range, spherical potentials. Despite the
simplicity of the forcefield employed, our model reproduces some essential
physical properties of silica, an archetypal network-forming material.
Structural and dynamical properties, including dynamic heterogeneities and the
nature of local rearrangements, are investigated in detail and a direct
comparison with models of close-packed, fragile glass-formers is performed. The
outcome of this comparison is rationalized in terms of the properties of the
Potential Energy Surface, focusing on the unstable modes of the stationary
points. Our results indicate that the weak degree of dynamic heterogeneity
observed in network glass-formers may be attributed to an excess of localized
unstable modes, associated to elementary dynamical events such as bond breaking
and reformation. On the contrary, the more fragile Lennard-Jones mixtures are
characterized by a larger fraction of extended unstable modes, which lead to a
more cooperative and heterogeneous dynamics.
