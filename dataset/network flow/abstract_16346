We apply the successful Monte Carlo Glauber and IP-Glasma initial state
models of heavy ion collisions to the much smaller size systems produced in
proton-proton, proton-nucleus and deuteron- nucleus collisions. We observe a
significantly greater sensitivity of the initial state geometry to details of
multi-particle production in these models compared to nucleus-nucleus
collisions. In particular, we find that the size of the system produced in p+A
collisions is very similar to the one produced in p+p collisions, and predict
comparable Hanbury-Brown-Twiss radii in the absence of flow in both systems.
Differences in the eccentricities computed in the models are large, while
differences amongst the generated flow coefficients v_2 and v_3 are smaller.
For a large number of participants in proton-lead collisions, the v_2 generated
in the IP-Glasma model is comparable to the value obtained in proton-proton
collisions. Viscous corrections to flow are large over characteristic lifetimes
in the smaller size systems. In contrast, viscous contributions are
significantly diminished over the longer space-time evolution of a heavy ion
collision.
