This paper discusses transmission strategies for dealing with the problem of
self-interference in multi-hop wireless networks in which the nodes communicate
in a full- duplex mode. An information theoretic study of the simplest such
multi-hop network: the two-hop source-relay-destination network, leads to a
novel transmission strategy called structured self-interference cancellation
(or just "structured cancellation" for short). In the structured cancellation
strategy the source restrains from transmitting on certain signal levels, and
the relay structures its transmit signal such that it can learn the residual
self-interference channel, and undo the self-interference, by observing the
portion of its own transmit signal that appears at the signal levels left empty
by the source. It is shown that in certain nontrivial regimes, the structured
cancellation strategy outperforms not only half-duplex but also full-duplex
schemes in which time-orthogonal training is used for estimating the residual
self-interference channel.
