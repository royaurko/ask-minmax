The linear deterministic model has been used recently to get a first order
understanding of many wireless communication network problems. In many of these
cases, it has been pointed out that the capacity regions of the network and its
reciprocal (where the communication links are reversed and the roles of the
sources and the destinations are swapped) are the same. In this paper, we
consider a linear deterministic communication network with multiple unicast
information flows. For this model and under the restriction to the class of
linear coding, we show that the rate regions for a network and its reciprocal
are the same. This can be viewed as a generalization of the linear
reversibility of wireline networks, already known in the network coding
literature.
