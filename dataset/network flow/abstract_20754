We study stable matching problems in networks where players are embedded in a
social context, and may incorporate friendship relations or altruism into their
decisions. Each player is a node in a social network and strives to form a good
match with a neighboring player. We consider the existence, computation, and
inefficiency of stable matchings from which no pair of players wants to
deviate. When the benefits from a match are the same for both players, we show
that incorporating the well-being of other players into their matching
decisions significantly decreases the price of stability, while the price of
anarchy remains unaffected. Furthermore, a good stable matching achieving the
price of stability bound always exists and can be reached in polynomial time.
We extend these results to more general matching rewards, when players matched
to each other may receive different utilities from the match. For this more
general case, we show that incorporating social context (i.e., "caring about
your friends") can make an even larger difference, and greatly reduce the price
of anarchy. We show a variety of existence results, and present upper and lower
bounds on the prices of anarchy and stability for various matching utility
structures. Finally, we extend most of our results to network contribution
games, in which players can decide how much effort to contribute to each
incident edge, instead of simply choosing a single node to match with.
