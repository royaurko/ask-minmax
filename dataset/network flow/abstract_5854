In this paper we apply the concept of overlay cognitive radio to the
communication between nodes in a wireless mesh network. Based on the overlay
cognitive radio model, it is possible to have two concurrent transmissions in a
given interference region, where usually only one communication takes place at
a given time. We analyze the cases of wireless mesh networks with regular and
random topologies. Numerical results show that considerable network capacity
gains can be achieved.
