From MRI rheometry we show that a pure emulsion can be turned from a simple
yield stress fluid to a thixotropic material by adding a small fraction of
colloidal particles. The two fluids have the same behavior in the liquid regime
but the loaded emulsion exhibits a critical shear rate below which no steady
flows can be observed. For a stress below the yield stress, the pure emulsion
abruptly stops flowing, whereas the viscosity of the loaded emulsion
continuously increases in time, which leads to an apparent flow stoppage. This
phenomenon can be very well represented by a model assuming a progressive
increase of the number of droplet links via colloidal particles.
