I describe how lattice computations are being used to extract experimentally
relevant features of the quark gluon plasma. I deal specifically with
relaxation times, photon emissivity, strangeness yields, event by event
fluctuations of conserved quantities and hydrodynamic flow. Finally I give
evidence that the plasma is liquid-like in some ways.
