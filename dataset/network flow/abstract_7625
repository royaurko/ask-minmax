It is proved that (a) the solutions of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic
equation, which describe the equlibrium states of a cylindrical plasma with
purely poloidal flow and arbitrary cross sectional shape [G. N.
Throumoulopoulos and G. Pantis, Plasma Phys. and Contr. Fusion 38, 1817 (1996)]
are also valid for incompressible equlibrium flows with the axial velocity
component being a free surface quantity and (b) for the case of isothermal
incompressible equilibria the magnetic surfaces have necessarily circular cross
section.
