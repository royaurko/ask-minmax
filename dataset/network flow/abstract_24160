We examine the problem of accepting a new request for a pre-stored VBR video
stream that has been smoothed using any of the smoothing algorithms found in
the literature. The output of these algorithms is a piecewise constant-rate
schedule for a Variable Bit-Rate (VBR) stream. The schedule guarantees that the
decoder buffer does not overflow or underflow. The problem addressed in this
paper is the determination of the minimal time displacement of each new
requested VBR stream so that it can be accomodated by the network and/or the
video server without overbooking the committed traffic. We prove that this
call-admission control problem for multiple requested VBR streams is
NP-complete and inapproximable within a constant factor, by reducing it from
the VERTEX COLOR problem. We also present a deterministic morphology-sensitive
algorithm that calculates the minimal time displacement of a VBR stream
request. The complexity of the proposed algorithm make it suitable for
real-time determination of the time displacement parameter during the call
admission phase.
