In the context of astrophysical dynamos we illustrate that the no-cosines
flow, with zero mean helicity, can drive fast dynamo action and study the
dynamo's mode of operation during both the linear and non-linear saturation
regime: It turns out that in addition to a high growth rate in the linear
regime, the dynamo saturates at a level significantly higher than normal
turbulent dynamos, namely at exact equipartition when the magnetic Prandtl
number is on the order of unity. Visualization of the magnetic and velocity
fields at saturation will help us to understand some of the aspects of the
non-linear dynamo problem.
