A simple lemma is derived that allows to transform a general scalar
(non-Gaussian, non-additive) continuous-alphabet channel as well as a general
multiple-access channel into a modulo-additive noise channel. While in general
the transformation is information lossy, it allows to leverage linear coding
techniques and capacity results derived for networks comprised of additive
Gaussian nodes to more general networks.
