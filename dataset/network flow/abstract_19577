The one-dimensional Kondo lattice model is investigated by means of Wegner's
flow equation method. The renormalization procedure leads to an effective
Hamiltonian which describes a free one-dimensional electron gas and a
Heisenberg chain. The localised spins of the effective model are coupled by the
well-known RKKY interaction. They are treated within a Schwinger boson mean
field theory which permits the calculation of static and dynamic correlation
functions. In the regime of small interaction strength static expectation
values agree well with the expected Luttinger liquid behaviour. The parameter
K_rho of the Luttinger liquid theory is estimated and compared to recent
results from density matrix renormalization group studies.
