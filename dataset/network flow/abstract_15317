The Wireless GIS technology is progressing rapidly in the area of mobile
communications. Location-based spatial queries are becoming an integral part of
many new mobile applications. The Skyline queries are latest apps under
Location-based services. In this paper we introduce Goal Directed Relative
Skyline queries on Time dependent (GD-RST) road networks. The algorithm uses
travel time as a metric in finding the data object by considering multiple
query points (multi-source skyline) relative to user location and in the user
direction of travelling. We design an efficient algorithm based on Filter
phase, Heap phase and Refine Skyline phases. At the end, we propose a dynamic
skyline caching (DSC) mechanism which helps to reduce the computation cost for
future skyline queries. The experimental evaluation reflects the performance of
GD-RST algorithm over the traditional branch and bound algorithm for skyline
queries in real road networks.
