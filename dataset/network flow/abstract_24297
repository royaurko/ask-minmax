Access control to data in traditional enterprises is typically enforced
through reference monitors. However, as more and more enterprise data is
outsourced, trusting third party storage servers is getting challenging. As a
result, cryptography, specifically Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is getting
popular for its expressiveness. The challenge of ABE is revocation.
  To address this challenge, we propose PIRATTE, an architecture that supports
fine-grained access control policies and dynamic group membership. PIRATTE is
built using attribute-based encryption; a key and novel feature of our
architecture, however, is that it is possible to remove access from a user
without issuing new keys to other users or re-encrypting existing ciphertexts.
We achieve this by introducing a proxy that participates in the decryption
process and enforces revocation constraints. The proxy is minimally trusted and
cannot decrypt ciphertexts or provide access to previously revoked users. We
describe the PIRATTE construction and provide a security analysis along with
performance evaluation.We also describe an architecture for online social
network that can use PIRATTE, and prototype application of PIRATTE on Facebook.
