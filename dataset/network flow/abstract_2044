In this paper, we present a polynomial-sized linear programming formulation
of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The proposed linear program is a
network flow-based model. Numerical implementation issues and results are
discussed. (The exposition and proofs are much more detailed in an edition
which I wrote in collaboration with Dr. M.H. Karwan in 2012-2014 . That edition
is available at
