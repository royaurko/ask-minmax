The nonlinear Schroedinger equation in the presence of disorder is
considered. The dynamics of an initially localized wave packet is studied. A
subdiffusive spreading of the wave packet is explained in the framework of a
continuous time random walk. A probabilistic description of subdiffusion is
suggested and a transport exponent of subdiffusion is obtained to be 2/5.
