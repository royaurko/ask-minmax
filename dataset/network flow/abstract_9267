While actin bundles are used by living cells for structural fortification,
the microscopic origin of the elasticity of bundled networks is not understood.
Here, we show that above a critical concentration of the actin binding protein
fascin, a solution of actin filaments organizes into a pure network of bundles.
While the elasticity of weakly crosslinked networks is dominated by the affine
deformation of tubes, the network of bundles can be fully understood in terms
of non-affine bending undulations.
