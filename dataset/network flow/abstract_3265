We study the Ricci flow of initial metrics which are C^0-perturbations of the
hyperbolic metric on H^n. If the perturbation is bounded in the L^2-sense, and
small enough in the C^0-sense, then we show the following: In dimensions four
and higher, the scaled Ricci harmonic map heat flow of such a metric converges
smoothly, uniformly and exponentially fast in all C^k-norms and in the L^2-norm
to the hyperbolic metric as time approaches infinity. We also prove a related
result for the Ricci flow and for the two-dimensional conformal Ricci flow.
