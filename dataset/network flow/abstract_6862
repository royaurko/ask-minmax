Recent measurements of elliptic flow (v_2) and the nuclear modification
factor (R_{CP}) of strange mesons and baryons in the intermediate p_T domain in
Au+Au collisions demonstrate a scaling with the number of constituent-quarks.
This suggests hadron production via quark coalescence from a thermalized parton
system. Measuring the elliptic flow of charmed hadrons, which are believed to
originate rather from fragmentation than from coalescence processes, might
therefore change our view of hadron production in heavy ion collisions.
  While direct v_2 measurements of charmed hadrons are currently not available,
single electron v_2 at sufficiently high transverse momenta can serve as a
substitute. At transverse momenta above 2 GeV/c, the production of single
electrons from non-photonic sources is expected to be dominated by the decay of
charmed hadrons. Simulations show a strong correlation between the flow of the
charmed hadrons and the flow of their decay electrons for p_T > 2 GeV/c.
  We will present preliminary STAR results from our single electron v_2
measurements from Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies.
