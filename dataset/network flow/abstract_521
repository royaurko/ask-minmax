In this paper, we propose and test an intuitive assumption that the pressure
field in single conduits and networks of interconnected conduits adjusts itself
to minimize the total energy consumption required for transporting a specific
quantity of fluid. We test this assumption by using linear flow models of
Newtonian fluids transported through rigid tubes and networks in conjunction
with a simulated annealing (SA) protocol to minimize the total energy cost. All
the results confirm our hypothesis as the SA algorithm produces very close
results to those obtained from the traditional deterministic methods of
identifying the flow fields by solving a set of simultaneous equations based on
the conservation principles. The same results apply to electric ohmic
conductors and networks of interconnected ohmic conductors. Computational
experiments conducted in this regard confirm this extension. Further studies
are required to test the energy minimization hypothesis for the non-linear flow
systems.
