Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are one of the most challenging threats to
Internet security. An attacker typically compromises a large number of
vulnerable hosts and uses them to flood the victim's site with malicious
traffic, clogging its tail circuit and interfering with normal traffic. At
present, the network operator of a site under attack has no other resolution
but to respond manually by inserting filters in the appropriate edge routers to
drop attack traffic. However, as DoS attacks become increasingly sophisticated,
manual filter propagation becomes unacceptably slow or even infeasible.
  In this paper, we present Active Internet Traffic Filtering, a new automatic
filter propagation protocol. We argue that this system provides a guaranteed,
significant level of protection against DoS attacks in exchange for a
reasonable, bounded amount of router resources. We also argue that the proposed
system cannot be abused by a malicious node to interfere with normal Internet
operation. Finally, we argue that it retains its efficiency in the face of
continued Internet growth.
