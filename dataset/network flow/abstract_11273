nformation security is an issue of global concern. As the Internet is
delivering great convenience and benefits to the modern society, the rapidly
increasing connectivity and accessibility to the Internet is also posing a
serious threat to security and privacy, to individuals, organizations, and
nations alike. Finding effective ways to detect, prevent, and respond to
intrusions and hacker attacks of networked computers and information systems.
This paper presents a knowledge discovery frame work to detect DoS attacks at
the boundary controllers (routers). The idea is to use machine learning
approach to discover network features that can depict the state of the network
connection. Using important network data (DoS relevant features), we have
developed kernel machine based and soft computing detection mechanisms that
achieve high detection accuracies. We also present our work of identifying DoS
pertinent features and evaluating the applicability of these features in
detecting novel DoS attacks. Architecture for detecting DoS attacks at the
router is presented. We demonstrate that highly efficient and accurate
signature based classifiers can be constructed by using important network
features and machine learning techniques to detect DoS attacks at the boundary
controllers.
