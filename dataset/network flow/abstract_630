A detailed empirical analysis of the productivity of non financial firms
across several countries and years shows that productivity follows a
non-Gaussian distribution with power law tails. We demonstrate that these
empirical findings can be interpreted as consequence of a mechanism of
exchanges in a social network where firms improve their productivity by direct
innovation or/and by imitation of other firm's technological and organizational
solutions. The type of network-connectivity determines how fast and how
efficiently information can diffuse and how quickly innovation will permeate or
behaviors will be imitated. From a model for innovation flow through a complex
network we obtain that the expectation values of the productivity level are
proportional to the connectivity of the network of links between firms. The
comparison with the empirical distributions reveals that such a network must be
of a scale-free type with a power-law degree distribution in the large
connectivity range.
