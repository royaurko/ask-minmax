A micro-scale model is proposed for the evolution of the limit order book.
Within this model, the flows of orders (claims) are described by doubly
stochastic Poisson processes taking account of the stochastic character of
intensities of bid and ask orders that determine the price discovery mechanism
in financial markets. The process of {\it order flow imbalance} (OFI) is
studied. This process is a sensitive indicator of the current state of the
limit order book since time intervals between events in a limit order book are
usually so short that price changes are relatively infrequent events. Therefore
price changes provide a very coarse and limited description of market dynamics
at time micro-scales. The OFI process tracks best bid and ask queues and change
much faster than prices. It incorporates information about build-ups and
depletions of order queues so that it can be used to interpolate market
dynamics between price changes and to track the toxicity of order flows. The
{\it two-sided risk processes} are suggested as mathematical models of the OFI
process.
