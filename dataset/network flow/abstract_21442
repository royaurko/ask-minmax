This paper presents an initial survey of the properties of accretion flows in
the Kerr metric from three-dimensional, general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion tori. We consider three fiducial
models of tori around rotating, both prograde and retrograde, and nonrotating
black holes; these three fiducial models are also contrasted with axisymmetric
simulations and a pseudo-Newtonian simulation with equivalent initial
conditions to delineate the limitations of these approximations.
