Elliptic flow measurements as a function of p_T of charged (pi^+- and low-p_T
protons) and strange (Lambda and K^0_S) particles from Pb+Au collisions at 158
AGeV/c are presented, together with measurements of phi and K^0_S meson
production. A mass ordering effect was observed. Scaling to the number of
constituent quarks and transverse rapidity y^fs_T scaling are presented. The
results are compared with results from the NA49 and STAR experiments and with
hydrodynamical calculations. For the first time in heavy-ion collisions, phi
mesons were reconstructed in the same experiment both in the K^+K^- and in the
e^+e^- decay channels. The obtained transverse mass distributions of phi mesons
are compared with results from the NA49 and NA50 experiments. The yield and the
inverse slope parameter of the K^0_S mesons were reconstructed from two
independent analyses. Our results are compared with those from the NA49 and
NA57 experiments.
