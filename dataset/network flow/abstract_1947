We present an algorithm for multi-hop routing and scheduling of requests in
wireless networks in the \sinr\ model. The goal of our algorithm is to maximize
the throughput or maximize the minimum ratio between the flow and the demand.
  Our algorithm partitions the links into buckets. Every bucket consists of a
set of links that have nearly equivalent reception powers. We denote the number
of nonempty buckets by $\sigdiv$. Our algorithm obtains an approximation ratio
of $O(\sigdiv \cdot \log n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes. For the
case of linear powers $\sigdiv =1$, hence the approximation ratio of the
algorithm is $O(\log n)$. This is the first practical approximation algorithm
for linear powers with an approximation ratio that depends only on $n$ (and not
on the max-to-min distance ratio).
  If the transmission power of each link is part of the input (and arbitrary),
then $\sigdiv = O(\log\Gamma + \log \Delta)$, where $\Gamma$ denotes the ratio
of the max-to-min power, and $\Delta$ denotes the ratio of the max-to-min
distance. Hence, the approximation ratio is $O(\log n \cdot (\log\Gamma + \log
\Delta))$.
  Finally, we consider the case that the algorithm needs to assign powers to
each link in a range $[\pmin,\pmax]$. An extension of the algorithm to this
case achieves an approximation ratio of $O[(\log n + \log \log \Gamma) \cdot
(\log\Gamma + \log \Delta)]$.
