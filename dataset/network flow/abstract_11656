A crucial task in the analysis of on-line social-networking systems is to
identify important people --- those linked by strong social ties --- within an
individual's network neighborhood. Here we investigate this question for a
particular category of strong ties, those involving spouses or romantic
partners. We organize our analysis around a basic question: given all the
connections among a person's friends, can you recognize his or her romantic
partner from the network structure alone? Using data from a large sample of
Facebook users, we find that this task can be accomplished with high accuracy,
but doing so requires the development of a new measure of tie strength that we
term `dispersion' --- the extent to which two people's mutual friends are not
themselves well-connected. The results offer methods for identifying types of
structurally significant people in on-line applications, and suggest a
potential expansion of existing theories of tie strength.
