Starting from the linear flow of homogeneous fluid, five modes are defined as
eigenvectors of the basic system of conservation laws.
 Quasi-plane geometry is considered. Projectors that separate overall
perturbation of the fluid into specific modes are calculated and applied to
nonlinear flow. Dynamic equations for the interacting modes are obtained in the
frames of the method. A particular case of streaming caused by acoustic pulse
is considered, illustrations on temporal behavior of streaming velocity and
streamlines are presented.
