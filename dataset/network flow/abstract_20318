Numerical simulations of flows are required for numerous applications, and
are usually carried out using shallow water equations. We describe the FullSWOF
software which is based on up-to-date finite volume methods and well-balanced
schemes to solve this kind of equations. It consists of a set of open source
C++ codes, freely available to the community, easy to use, and open for further
development. Several features make FullSWOF particularly suitable for
applications in hydrology: small water heights and wet-dry transitions are
robustly handled, rainfall and infiltration are incorporated, and data from
grid-based digital topographies can be used directly. A detailed mathematical
description is given here, and the capabilities of FullSWOF are illustrated
based on analytic solutions and datasets of real cases. The codes, available in
1D and 2D versions, have been validated on a large set of benchmark cases,
which are available together with the download information and documentation at
