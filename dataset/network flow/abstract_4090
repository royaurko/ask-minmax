Granular solid hydrodynamics, constructed to describe quasi-elastic and
plastic motion of granular solid, is shown also capable of accounting for the
rheology of granular dense flow. This makes it a unified, though still
qualitative, hydrodynamic description, enabling one to tackle fluidization and
jamming, the hysteretic transition between elasto-plastic motion and uniform
dense flow.
