We review recent work on the statistical mechanics of Von Neumann's growth
model and discuss its application to cellular metabolic networks. In this
context, we present a detailed analysis of the physiological scenario
underlying optimality a la Von Neumann in the metabolism of the bacterium
Escherichia coli, showing that optimal solutions are characterized by a
considerable microscopic flexibility accompanied by a robust emergent picture
for the key physiological functions. This suggests that the ideas behind
optimal economic growth in Von Neumann's model can be helpful in uncovering
functional organization principles of cell energetics.
