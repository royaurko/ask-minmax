Fire ants use their claws to grip diverse surfaces, including each other. As
a result of their mutual adhesion and large numbers, ant colonies flow like
inanimate fluids. In this sequence of films, we demonstrate how ants behave
similarly to the spreading of drops, the capillary rise of menisci, and
gravity-driven flow down a wall. By emulating the flow of fluids, ant colonies
can remain united under stressful conditions.
