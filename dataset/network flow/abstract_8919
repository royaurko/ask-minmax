The aim of this work is to establish that the bifurcation parameter value
leading to a canard explosion in dimension two obtained by the so-called
Geometric Singular Perturbation Method can be found according to the Flow
Curvature Method. This result will be then exemplified with the classical Van
der Pol oscillator.
