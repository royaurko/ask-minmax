The European viDeo MeteOr Network Database (EDMOND) is a database of video
meteor orbits resulting from cooperation and data sharing among several
European national networks and the International Meteor Organization Video
Meteor Network, IMO VMN. At present, the 4th version of the EDMOND database,
which contains 83 369 video meteor orbits, has been released. The first results
of the database analysis, in which we studied minor streams, are presented.
Using the radiant-geocentric velocity method we identified 267 meteor showers,
among them 67 established showers and 200 from the working list of the IAU MDC.
Making a more detailed examination, we clearly identified 22 showers of 65 pro
tempore showers of the working list of the IAU MDC (updated in August 2013).
The identification of 18 meteor showers was questionable, while 25 showers were
not found. For all the identified temporary meteor showers, we list the
weighted mean orbital elements, the radiant position and the geocentric
velocity.
