RG flow of central charge $c_{\rm eff}$ is investigated for the two boundary
sine-Gordon model at the free Fermi limit. Thermodynamic Bethe ansatz approach
is used to check the non-monotonic decreasing properties of $c_{\rm eff}$, its
resonance, and the modification of $c_{\rm eff}$ due to the mismatch of the
periodicity of a Lagrangian parameter and that of the boundary scattering
parameter. The detailed analysis uses the singularity structure of the system
on the complex rapidity plane.
