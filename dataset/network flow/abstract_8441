In the wireless environment, dissemination techniques may improve data access
for the users. In this paper, we show a description of dissemination
architecture that fits the overall telecommunication network. This architecture
is designed to provide efficient data access and power saving for the mobile
units. A concurrency control approach, MCD, is suggested for data consistency
and conflict checking. A performance study shows that the power consumption,
space overhead, and response time associated with MCD is far less than other
previous techniques.
