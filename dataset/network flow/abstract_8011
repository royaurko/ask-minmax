We study the controllability of linearized shape-dependent operators for flow
problems. The first operator is a mapping from the shape of the computational
domain to the tangential wall velocity of the potential flow problem and the
second operator maps to the wall shear stress of the Stokes problem. We derive
linearizations of these operators, provide their well-posedness and finally
show approximate controllability. The controllability of the linearization
shows in what directions the observable can be changed by applying
infinitesimal shape deformations.
