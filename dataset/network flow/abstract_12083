A fundamental understanding of gain provided by motion prediction in wireless
ad hoc routing is currently lacking. This paper examines benefits in routing
obtainable via prediction. A theoretical best-case non-predictive routing model
is quantified in terms of both message overhead and update time for
non-predictive routing. This best- case model of existing routing performance
is compared with predictive routing. Several specific instances of predictive
improvements in routing are examined. The primary contribution of this paper is
quantification of predictive gain for wireless ad hoc routing.
