Discrete-time regulatory networks are dynamical systems on directed graphs,
with a structure inspired on natural systems of interacting units. There is a
natural notion of determination amongst vertices, which we use to classify the
nodes of the network, and to determine what we call "sets of dominant
vertices". In this paper we prove that in the asymptotic regime, the projection
of the dynamics on a dominant set allows us to determine the state of the whole
system at all times. We provide an algorithm to find sets of dominant vertices,
and we test its accuracy on three families of theoretical examples. Then, by
using the same algorithm, we study the relation between the structure of the
underlying network and the corresponding dominant set of vertices. We also
present a result concerning the inheritability of the dominance between
strongly connected networks.
