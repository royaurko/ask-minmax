Using techniques developed in a previous paper three-point functions in field
theories described by holographic renormalization group flows are computed. We
consider a system of one active scalar and one inert scalar coupled to gravity.
For the GPPZ flow, their dual operators create states that are interpreted as
glueballs of the N=1 SYM theory, which lies at the infrared end of the
renormalization group flow. The scattering amplitudes for three-glueball
processes are calculated providing precise predictions for glueball decays in
N=1 SYM theory. Numerical results for low-lying glueballs are included.
