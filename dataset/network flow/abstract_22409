We present a three-dimensional reconstruction of an eruption that occurred on
3 April 2010 using observations from SWAP onboard PROBA2 and SECCHI onboard
STEREO. The event unfolded in two parts: an initial flow of cooler material
confined to low in the corona, followed by a flux rope eruption higher in the
corona. We conclude that mass off-loading from the first part triggered a rise,
and, subsequently, catastrophic loss of equilibrium of the flux rope.
