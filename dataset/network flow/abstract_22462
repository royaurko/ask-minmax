A 2008 general overview on Weil-Petersson geometry is offered. A preliminary
plan for the subsequent CBMS lectures at Central Connecticut State University
is included. Mirzakhani's solution of Witten-Kontsevich is not included - this
work essentially requires its own lectures. Lectures on Mirzakhani's
Witten-Kontsevich were given at the 2011 Park City Mathematics Institute.
Research on WP geometry coming after 2008 includes the Brock-Masur-Minsky
second paper, Asymptotics of WP geodesics II: bounded geometry and unbounded
entropy; the Burns-Masur-Wilkinson, The WP geodesic flow is ergodic; and the
Wolpert, Geodesic-Length Functions and the WP curvature tensor.
