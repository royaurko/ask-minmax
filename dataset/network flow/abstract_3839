We introduce a stochastic model of growing networks where both, the number of
new nodes which joins the network and the number of connections, vary
stochastically. We provide an exact mapping between this model and zero range
process, and use this mapping to derive an analytical solution of degree
distribution for any given evolution rule. One can also use this mapping to
infer about a possible evolution rule for a given network. We demonstrate this
for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
