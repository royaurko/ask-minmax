The social presence theory in social psychology suggests that
computer-mediated online interactions are inferior to face-to-face, in-person
interactions. In this paper, we consider the scenarios of organizing in person
friend-making social activities via online social networks (OSNs) and formulate
a new research problem, namely, Hop-bounded Maximum Group Friending (HMGF), by
modeling both existing friendships and the likelihood of new friend making. To
find a set of attendees for socialization activities, HMGF is unique and
challenging due to the interplay of the group size, the constraint on existing
friendships and the objective function on the likelihood of friend making. We
prove that HMGF is NP-Hard, and no approximation algorithm exists unless P =
NP. We then propose an error-bounded approximation algorithm to efficiently
obtain the solutions very close to the optimal solutions. We conduct a user
study to validate our problem formulation and per- form extensive experiments
on real datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm.
