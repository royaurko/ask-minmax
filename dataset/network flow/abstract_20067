We show how to use a central limit approximation for additive co-cycles to
describe non-equilibrium and far from equilibrium thermodynamic behavior. We
consider first two weakly coupled Hamiltonian dynamical systems initially at
different micro-canonical temperatures. We describe a stochastic model where
the energy-transfer between the two systems is considered as a random variable
satisfying a central limit approximation. We show that fluctuations in energy
observables are linearly related to the heat-transfer (dissipation). As a
result, on average, heat flows from hot to cold. We also consider the far from
equilibrium situation of a non-Hamiltonian thermostatted system as in Evans et
al. {\em Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.} {\bf 71}, 2401 (1993). Applying the same central
limit approximation we re-derive their relation for the violation of the 2nd
law of thermodynamics. We note that time-reversal symmetry is not used in our
derivation.
