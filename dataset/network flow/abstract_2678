In this paper, we investigate the mean curvature flows starting from all
non-minimal orbits (which are isoparametric submanifolds) of a certain kind of
solvable group action on a symmetric space of non-compact type. We prove that
the mean curvature flow starting from each non-minimal orbit of the action
exists in infinite time, if the action admits no minimal orbit, then the flow
asymptotes the self-similar flow starting from another orbit, and if the action
admits a minimal orbit (in this case, it is shwon that there exists the only
one minimal orbit), then the flow converges to the minimal orbit of the action
in $C^{\infty}$-topology.
