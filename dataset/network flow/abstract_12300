In this paper, the performance of adaptive modulation in multi-user cognitive
radio networks over fading channels is analyzed. Multi-user diversity is
considered for opportunistic user selection among multiple secondary users. The
analysis is obtained for Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. Both adaptive continuous
rate and adaptive discrete rate schemes are analysed in opportunistic spectrum
access and spectrum sharing. Numerical results are obtained and depicted to
quantify the effects of multi-user fading environments on adaptive modulation
operating in cognitive radio networks.
