We proposed an authentication mechanism in the wireless sensor network.
Sensor network uses the Kerberos authentication scheme for the authentication
of bases station in the network. Kerberos provides a centralized authentication
server whose function is to authenticate user by providing him the ticket to
grant request to the base station. In this paper we have provided architecture
for the authentication of base station in the wireless sensor network based on
the Kerberos server authentication scheme.
