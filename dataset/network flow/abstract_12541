A classic measure of ecological stability describes the tendency of a
community to return to equilibrium after small perturbation. While many
advances show how the network structure of these communities severely
constrains such tendencies, few if any of these advances address one of the
most fundamental properties of network structure: heterogeneity among nodes
with different numbers of links. Here we systematically explore this property
of "degree heterogeneity" and find that its effects on stability systematically
vary with different types of interspecific interactions. Degree heterogeneity
is always destabilizing in ecological networks with both competitive and
mutualistic interactions while its effects on networks of predator-prey
interactions such as food webs depend on prey contiguity, i.e., the extent to
which the species consume an unbroken sequence of prey in community niche
space. Increasing degree heterogeneity stabilizes food webs except those with
the most contiguity. These findings help explain previously unexplained
observations that food webs are highly but not completely contiguous and, more
broadly, deepens our understanding of the stability of complex ecological
networks with important implications for other types of dynamical systems.
