We present and analyse in this paper three models of coupled continuum
equations all united by a common theme: the intuitive notion that sandpile
surfaces are left smoother by the propagation of avalanches across them. Two of
these concern smoothing at the `bare' interface, appropriate to intermittent
avalanche flow, while one of them models smoothing at the effective surface
defined by a cloud of flowing grains across the `bare' interface, which is
appropriate to the regime where avalanches flow continuously across the
sandpile.
