If we impose infinitesimal invariance up to a boundary term of the action
functional for Lagrangian ordinary differential equations, we are led to
Killing-type equations, which are related to first integrals through Noether
theorem. We review the "on-flow" and "strong" interpretations of the
Killing-type equation, and for each we detail the complete explicit structure
of the solution set in terms of the associated first integral. We give examples
that reappraise the usefulness of the "on-flow" solutions. Finally, we describe
an equivalent alternative approach to variational invariance.
