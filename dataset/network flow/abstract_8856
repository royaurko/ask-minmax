We show the existence and uniqueness of a DiPerna-Lions flow for relativistic
particles subject to a Lorentz force in an electromagnetic field. The electric
and magnetic fields solves the linear Maxwell system in the void but for
singular initial conditions. As the corresponding force field is only in $L^2$,
we have to perform a careful analysis of the cancellations over a trajectory.
