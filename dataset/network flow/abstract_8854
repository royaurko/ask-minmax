This short note studies the collapsing behavior of the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on
a compact K\"ahler manifold X admitting a holomorphic submersion X -> B where B
is a K\"ahler manifold of lower dimension than X. We give cohomological and
curvature conditions under which the fibers collapse at the optimal rate
