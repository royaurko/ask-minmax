We study a two dimensional Ising model between thermostats at different
temperatures. By applying the recently introduced KQ dynamics, we show that the
system reaches a steady state with coexisting phases transversal to the heat
flow. The relevance of such complex states on thermodynamic or geometrical
observables is investigated. In particular, we study energy, magnetization and
metric properties of interfaces and clusters which, in principle, are sensitive
to local features of configurations. With respect to equilibrium states, the
presence of the heat flow amplifies the fluctuations of both thermodynamic and
geometrical observables in a domain around the critical energy. The dependence
of this phenomenon on various parameters (size, thermal gradient, interaction)
is discussed also with reference to other possible diffusive models.
