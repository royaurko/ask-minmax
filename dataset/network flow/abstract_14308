We show that the `orthogonal' characteristics of the observed rapidity gaps
and large forward energy flows in deep inelastic scattering at HERA, can be
described within a single framework. Our Monte Carlo model is based on
perturbative QCD matrix elements and parton showers together with Lund string
model hadronization, but has in addition a new mechanism for soft colour
interactions which modifies the perturbative colour structure and thereby the
hadronization. Effects of perturbative multiparton emission are investigated
and the non-perturbative treatment of the proton remnant is discussed and
comparison to the observed transverse energy flow is made. We investigate the
resulting diffractive-like properties of the model; such as rapidity gap
events, $t$- and $M_X$-distributions and the diffractive structure function in
comparison to H1 data.
