Within the framework of stochastic one-body approach a simulation procedure
to study the Vlasov dynamics for fermi system on phase space lattice is
presented. To deal with fermions on lattice, the phase cell occupancy factors
are taken to be either 1 or 0 in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle.
This has significant implications. First, the dynamical evolution does not
alter initial temperature of the system and secondly, at finite temperature,
the proper statistical behaviour related to the fluctuations over the samples
is ensured. This method is applied for two distinct cases viz. the monopole
vibration of cold dilute nucleus and the evolution of ring shaped matter
distribution at finite temperature in the presence of radial flow. In the
latter case, fragment multiplicities are found to be depend on the flow
velocity. To check the reliability of the present calculations simulations have
been performed with different choices of the grid size.
