We present a novel lattice Boltzmann method that has a capability of
simulating thermodynamic multiphase flows. This approach is fully
thermodynamically consistent at the macroscopic level. Using this new method, a
liquid-vapor boiling process, including liquid-vapor formation and coalescence
together with a full coupling of temperature, is simulated for the first time.
