In this paper, a new scheme of downlink co-channel interference (CCI)
cancellation in OFDM cellular networks is introduced for users at the
cell-edge. Coordinated symbol transmission between base stations (BS) is
operated where the same symbol is transmitted from different BS on different
sub-carriers. At the mobile station (MS) receiver, we introduce a soft decision
maximum likelihood CCI canceler and a modified maximum ratio combining (M-MRC)
to obtain an estimate of the transmitted symbols. Weights used in the combining
method are derived from the channels coefficients between the cooperated BS and
the MS. Simulations show that the proposed scheme works well under
frequency-selective channels and frequency non-selective channels. A gain of 9
dB and 6 dB in SIR is obtained under multipath fading and flat-fading channels,
respectively.
