We compare measurements of horizontal flows on the surface of the Sun using
helioseismic time--distance inversions and coherent structure tracking of solar
granules. Tracking provides 2D horizontal flows on the solar surface, whereas
the time--distance inversions estimate the full 3-D velocity flows in the
shallow near-surface layers. Both techniques use HMI observations as an input.
We find good correlations between the various measurements resulting from the
two techniques. Further, we find a good agreement between these measurements
and the time-averaged Doppler line-of-sight velocity, and also perform sanity
checks on the vertical flow that resulted from the 3-D time--distance
inversion.
