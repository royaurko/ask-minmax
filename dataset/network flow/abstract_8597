A new strategy is introduced for estimating networked population
characteristics. Sample selection is based on the one-wave snowball sampling
design. A generalized stochastic block model is posited for the population's
network topology. Inference is based on a Bayesian data augmentation procedure.
This procedure has the advantage over existing methods in that it can be
applied to a networked population of unknown size. An application is provided
to a study of an empirical population at risk for HIV/AIDS. The results
demonstrate that efficient estimates of the size and distribution of the
population can be achieved with this novel strategy.
