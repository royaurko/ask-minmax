Cellular and Broadcast services have been traditionally treated independently
due to the different market requirements, thus resulting in different business
models and orthogonal frequency allocations. However, with the advent of cheap
memory and smart caching, this traditional paradigm can converge into a single
system which can provide both services in an efficient manner. This paper
focuses on multimedia delivery through an integrated network, including both a
cellular (also known as unicast or broadband) and a broadcast last mile
operating over shared spectrum. The subscribers of the network are equipped
with a cache which can effectively create zero perceived latency for multimedia
delivery, assuming that the content has been proactively and intelligently
cached. The main objective of this work is to establish analytically the
optimal content popularity threshold, based on a intuitive cost function. In
other words, the aim is to derive which content should be broadcasted and which
content should be unicasted. To facilitate this, Cooperative Multi- Point
(CoMP) joint processing algorithms are employed for the uni and broad-cast PHY
transmissions. To practically implement this, the integrated network controller
is assumed to have access to traffic statistics in terms of content popularity.
Simulation results are provided to assess the gain in terms of total spectral
efficiency. A conventional system, where the two networks operate
independently, is used as benchmark.
