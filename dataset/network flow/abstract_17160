In the setting of finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras ${\mathcal A}$ we define
what we call a Riemannian metric for ${\mathcal A}$, which when ${\mathcal A}$
is commutative is very closely related to a finite resistance network. We
explore the relationship with Dirichlet forms and corresponding seminorms that
are Markov and Leibniz, with corresponding matricial structure and metric on
the state space. We also examine associated Laplace and Dirac operators,
quotient energy seminorms, resistance distance, and the relationship with
standard deviation.
