This study presents an ANWSER model (asset network systemic risk model) to
quantify the risk of financial contagion which manifests itself in a financial
crisis. The transmission of financial distress is governed by a heterogeneous
bank credit network and an investment portfolio of banks. Bankruptcy
reproductive ratio of a financial system is computed as a function of the
diversity and risk exposure of an investment portfolio of banks, and the
denseness and concentration of a heterogeneous bank credit network. An analytic
solution of the bankruptcy reproductive ratio for a small financial system is
derived and a numerical solution for a large financial system is obtained. For
a large financial system, Large diversity among banks in the investment
portfolio makes financial contagion more damaging on the average. But large
diversity is essentially effective in eliminating the risk of financial
contagion in the worst case of financial crisis scenarios. A bank-unique
specialization portfolio is more suitable than a uniform diversification
portfolio and a system-wide specialization portfolio in strengthening the
robustness of a financial system.
