A shear flow of particles in a laser-driven two-dimensional (2D) dusty plasma
are observed in a further study of viscous heating and thermal conduction.
Video imaging and particle tracking yields particle velocity data, which we
convert into continuum data, presented as three spatial profiles: mean particle
velocity (i.e., flow velocity), mean-square particle velocity, and mean-square
fluctuations of particle velocity. These profiles and their derivatives allow a
spatially-resolved determination of each term in the energy and momentum
continuity equations, which we use for two purposes. First, by balancing these
terms so that their sum (i.e., residual) is minimized while varying viscosity
$\eta$ and thermal conductivity $\kappa$ as free parameters, we simultaneously
obtain values for $\eta$ and $\kappa$ in the same experiment. Second, by
comparing the viscous heating and thermal conduction terms, we obtain a
spatially-resolved characterization of the viscous heating.
