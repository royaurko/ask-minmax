With the increasing concern for security in the network, many approaches are
laid out that try to protect the network from uncontributorised access. New methods
have been adopted in order to find the potential discrepancies that may damage
the network. Most commonly used approach is the vulnerability assessment. By
vulnerability, we mean, the potential flaws in the system that make it prone to
the attack. Assessment of these system vulnerabilities provide a means to
identify and develop new strategies so as to protect the system from the risk
of being damaged. This paper focuses on the usage of various vulnerability
scanners and their related methodology to detect the various vulnerabilities
available in the web applications or the remote host across the network and
tries to identify new mechanisms that can be deployed to secure the network.
