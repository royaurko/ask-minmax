We review recent developments in the theory of renormalisation group flows in
minimal models with boundaries. Among these, we discuss in particular the
perturbative calculations of Recknagel et al, not only as a tool to predict the
IR endpoints of certain flows, but also as a motivation for considering the
particular limiting case of c = 1. By treating this limit, we are able to
investigate a wide class of perturbations by considering them as deformations
away from the c = 1 point. We also present the truncated conformal space
approach as a tool for investigating the space of RG flows and checking
particular predictions.
