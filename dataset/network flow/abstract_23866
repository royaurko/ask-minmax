Is collective intelligence just individual intelligence writ large, or are
there fundamental differences? This position paper argues that a cognitive
history methodology can shed light into the nature of collective intelligence
and its differences from individual intelligence. To advance this proposed area
of research, a small case study on the structure of argument and proof is
presented. Quantitative metrics from network science are used to compare the
artifacts of deduction from two sources. The first is the work of Archimedes of
Syracuse, putatively an individual, and of other ancient Greek mathematicians.
The second is work of the Polymath Project, a massively collaborative
mathematics project that used blog posts and comments to prove new results in
combinatorics.
