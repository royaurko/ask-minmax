A space-time adaptive method is presented for the reactive Euler equations
describing chemically reacting gas flow where a two species model is used for
the chemistry. The governing equations are discretized with a finite volume
method and dynamic space adaptivity is introduced using multiresolution
analysis. A time splitting method of Strang is applied to be able to consider
stiff problems while keeping the method explicit. For time adaptivity an
improved Runge--Kutta--Fehlberg scheme is used. Applications deal with
detonation problems in one and two space dimensions. A comparison of the
adaptive scheme with reference computations on a regular grid allow to assess
the accuracy and the computational efficiency, in terms of CPU time and memory
requirements.
