We present the first results from the Shellflow program, an all-sky
Tully-Fisher (TF) peculiar velocity survey of 276 Sb-Sc galaxies with redshifts
between 4500 and 7000 km/s. Shellflow was designed to minimize systematic
errors between observing runs and between telescopes, thereby removing the
possibility of a spurious bulk flow caused by data inhomogeneity. A fit to the
data yields a bulk flow amplitude V_bulk = 70{+100}{-70} km/s (1 sigma error)
with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background, i.e., consistent with being at
rest. At the 95% confidence level, the flow amplitude is < 300 km/s. Our
results are insensitive to which Galactic extinction maps we use, and to the
parameterization of the TF relation. The larger bulk motion found in analyses
of the Mark III peculiar velocity catalog are thus likely to be due to
non-uniformities between the subsamples making up Mark III. The absence of bulk
flow is consistent with the study of Giovanelli and collaborators and flow
field predictions from the observed distribution of IRAS galaxies.
