We perform a systematic study of the role played by the equation of state in
the hydrodynamic evolution of the matter produced in relativistic heavy ion
collisions. By using the same initial conditions and freeze-out scenario, the
effects of different equations of state are compared by calculating their
respective hydrodynamical evolution, particle spectra and elliptic flow
parameter $v_2$. Three different types of equation of state are studied, each
focusing on different features, such as the nature of the phase transition, as
well as strangeness and baryon densities. Different equations of state imply
different hydrodynamic responses, the impact thereof on final state
anisotropies are investigated. The results of our calculations are compared to
the data of two RHIC energies, 130 GeV and 200 GeV. It is found that the three
equations of state used in the calculations describe the data reasonably well;
differences can be observed, but they are quite small. The insensitivity to the
equation of state weakens the need for a locally thermalized description of the
system, at least for the observables analysed in the present work.
