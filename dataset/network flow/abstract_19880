We present Spitzer IRAC images of the HH 111 outflow, that show a wealth of
condensations/knots in both jet and counterjet. Studying the positional
distribution of these knots, we find very suggestive evidence of a mirror
symmetric pattern in the jet/counterjet flow. We model this pattern as the
result of an orbital motion of the jet source around a binary companion. From a
fit of an analytic, ballistic model to the observed path of the HH 111 system,
we find that the motion in a binary with two approx. 1 Msolar stars (one of
them being the HH 111 source), in a circular orbit with a separation of approx.
186 AU would produce the mirror symmetric pattern seen in the outflow.
