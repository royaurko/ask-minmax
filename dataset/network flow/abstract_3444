We develop a general method to explore how the function performed by a
biological network can constrain both its structural and dynamical network
properties. This approach is orthogonal to prior studies which examine the
functional consequences of a given structural feature, for example a scale free
architecture. A key step is to construct an algorithm that allows us to
efficiently sample from a maximum entropy distribution on the space of boolean
dynamical networks constrained to perform a specific function, or cascade of
gene expression. Such a distribution can act as a "functional null model" to
test the significance of any given network feature, and can aid in revealing
underlying evolutionary selection pressures on various network properties.
Although our methods are general, we illustrate them in an analysis of the
yeast cell cycle cascade. This analysis uncovers strong constraints on the
architecture of the cell cycle regulatory network as well as significant
selection pressures on this network to maintain ordered and convergent
dynamics, possibly at the expense of sacrificing robustness to structural
perturbations.
