Based on the concept and techniques of first-passage probability in Markov
chain theory, this letter provides a rigorous proof for the existence of the
steady-state degree distribution of the scale-free network generated by the
Barabasi-Albert (BA) model, and mathematically re-derives the exact analytic
formulas of the distribution. The approach developed here is quite general,
applicable to many other scale-free types of complex networks.
