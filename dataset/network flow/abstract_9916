Semi-empirical procedure of obtaining the boundary conditions for strong
evaporation of a polyatomic gas from a plane surface is proposed. The procedure
is based on specifying the dependencies of specific momentum and enthalpy of
the flow from the gas flow rate. The latter are derived from the analysis of
the available data concerning the evaporation of polyatomic and monatomic
gases. The procedure predicts the exactly sonic terminal velocity of the flow
and leads to some corrections of existing boundary conditions in transonic
region. Thus, for j = 2 and sonic flow the corrections for pressure,
temperature and fraction of back-scattered molecules are about 0.7%, -3% and
-8%.
