Within the AdS/CFT correspondence, the shockwave metric has been widely used
as a gravity dual for a fast moving nucleus. Here we propose a picture for
particle production in deep inelastic scattering off a shockwave with the
projectile represented by the $\mathcal{R}$-current. By using the method
developed in \cite{Avsar:2009xf} to find an explicit expression for the
scattered field, we are able to show that the scattered field can be written in
terms of time-like and space-like vacuum states where the time-like states are
identified with the outgoing particles. To support this picture, we calculate
the contribution of the time-like modes to the energy-momentum tensor of the
scattered field and show that the energy flow in the fifth dimension is
directly related to the imaginary part of the action. The energy flow in the
fifth dimension is also compared to the incoming energy flow to determine which
fraction of the initial energy goes to the produced particles. The last two
sections are devoted to localize the energy flow in momentum and coordinate
space, first by finding the virtualities that contribute the most to the total
flow, and second by finding an approximate trajectory in coordinate space.
