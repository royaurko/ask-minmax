We consider the geodesic flow of reversible Finsler metrics on the 2-sphere
and the 2-torus, whose geodesic flow has vanishing topological entropy.
Following a construction of A. Katok, we discuss examples of Finsler metrics on
both surfaces, which have large ergodic components for the geodesic flow in the
unit tangent bundle. On the other hand, using results of J. Franks and M.
Handel, we prove that ergodicity and dense orbits cannot occur in the full unit
tangent bundle of the 2-sphere, if the Finsler metric has positive flag
curvatures and at least two closed geodesics. In the case of the 2-torus, we
show that ergodicity is restricted to strict subsets of tubes between
flow-invariant tori in the unit tangent bundle of the 2-torus.
