We compute analytically the probability distribution function ${\cal
P}(\epsilon)$ of the dissipation field $\epsilon =(\nabla \theta)^{2}$ of a
passive scalar $\theta$ advected by a $d$-dimensional random flow, in the limit
of large Peclet and Prandtl numbers (Batchelor-Kraichnan regime). The tail of
the distribution is a stretched exponential: for $\epsilon \to \infty$, $\ln
{\cal P}(\epsilon)\sim -(d^2\epsilon)^{1/3}$.
