We investigate the clustering ability in bipartite networks where cycles of
size three are absent and therefore the standard definition of clustering
coefficient cannot be used. Instead, we use another coefficient given by the
fraction of cycles with size four, showing that both coefficients yield the
same clustering properties. The new coefficient is computed for two networks of
sexual contacts, one monopartite and another bipartite. In both cases the
clustering ability is similar. Furthermore, combining both clustering
coefficients we deduce an expression for estimating cycles of larger size,
which improves previous estimations and is suitable for either monopartite and
multipartite networks.
