The evolution of self-adaptive systems poses the problems of their coherence
and the resume of the systems' functioning taking into account the accomplished
work. While they are the base of the self-adaptive systems, these two aspects
are not considered in the related works. In this paper, we propose a
methodological based approach. In such approach, the adaptive system's
evolution is thought at its model level where its execution is made on the
system by exploiting a methodological process. For its concretization, we use
colored Petri nets to describe the agents' individual tasks. To handle the
system's functioning resume, we exploit the property of Petri nets on which the
control flow depends on last marking only.
