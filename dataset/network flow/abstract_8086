We review the results from the various hydrodynamical and transport models on
the collective flow observables from AGS to RHIC energies. A critical
discussion of the present status of the CERN experiments on hadron collective
flow is given. We emphasize the importance of the flow excitation function from
1 to 50 A$\cdot$GeV: here the hydrodynamic model has predicted the collapse of
the $v_1$-flow and of the $v_2$-flow at $\sim 10$ A$\cdot$GeV; at 40
A$\cdot$GeV it has been recently observed by the NA49 collaboration. Since
hadronic rescattering models predict much larger flow than observed at this
energy we interpret this observation as evidence for a first order phase
transition at high baryon density $\rho_B$. Moreover, the connection of the
elliptic flow $v_2$ to jet suppression is examined. It is proven experimentally
that the collective flow is not faked by minijet fragmentation. Additionally,
detailed transport studies show that the away-side jet suppression can only
partially ($<$ 50%) be due to hadronic rescattering. Furthermore, the change in
sign of $v_1, v_2$ closer to beam rapidity is related to the occurence of a
high density first order phase transition in the RHIC data at 62.5, 130 and 200
A$\cdot$GeV.
