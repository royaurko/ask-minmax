This paper, third in the series on Indian tradition of physics, describes
conceptions of the cosmos with ideas that are clearly spelt out in texts such
as Yoga Vasishtha.In particular, the conception of multiple universes that
occurs often in this text will be examined in the framework of the Indian
physics. The other surprising concepts that are discussed include flow of time
and its variability with respect to different observers, and the possibility of
passage across universes.
