In secure communications networks there are a great number of user
behavioural problems, which need to be dealt with. Curious players pose a very
real and serious threat to the integrity of such a network. By traversing a
network a Curious player could uncover secret information, which that user has
no need to know, by simply posing as a loyalty check. Loyalty checks are done
simply to gauge the integrity of the network with respect to players who act in
a malicious manner. We wish to propose a method, which can deal with Curious
players trying to obtain "Need to Know" information using a combined
Fault-tolerant, Cryptographic and Game Theoretic Approach.
