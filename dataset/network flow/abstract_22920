We introduce a special class of random matrices (DUE) whose spectral
statistics corresponds to statistics of microscopical quantities detected in
vehicular flows. Comparing the level spacing distribution (for ordered
eigenvalues in unfolded spectra of DUE matrices) with the time-clearance
distribution extracted from various areas of the flux-density diagram
(evaluated from original traffic data measured on Czech expressways with high
occupancies) we demonstrate that the set of classical systems showing an
universality associated with Random Matrix Ensembles can be extended by traffic
systems.
