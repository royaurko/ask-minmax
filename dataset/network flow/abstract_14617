The aim of these notes is to present in a comprehensive and relatively
self-contained way some recent developments in the mathematical analysis of
two-dimensional viscous flows. We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations in the whole plane, and assume that the initial vorticity is a finite
measure. This general setting includes vortex patches, vortex sheets, and point
vortices. We first prove the existence of a unique global solution, for any
value of the viscosity parameter, and we investigate its long-time behavior. We
next consider the particular case where the initial flow is a finite collection
of point vortices. In that situation, we show that the solution behaves, in the
vanishing viscosity limit, as a superposition of Oseen vortices whose centers
evolve according to the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff point vortex system. The proof
requires a careful stability analysis of the Oseen vortices in the large
Reynolds number regime, as well as a precise computation of the deformations of
the vortex cores due to mutual interactions.
