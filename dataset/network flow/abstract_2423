Nuclear reaction rates determine the abundances of isotopes in stellar
burning processes. A multitude of reactions determine the reaction flow pattern
which is described in terms of reaction network simulations. The reaction rates
are determined by laboratory experiments supplemented by nuclear reaction and
structure theory. We will discuss the experimental approach as well as the
theoretical tools for obtaining the stellar reaction rates. A detailed analysis
of a reaction is only possible for a few selected cases which will be
highlighted in this section. The bulk of nuclear reaction processes is however
described in terms of a statistical model approach, which relies on global
nuclear structure and reaction parameters such as level density and mass and
barrier penetration, respectively. We will discuss a variety of experimental
facilities and techniques used in the field, this includes low energy stable
beam experiments, measurements at radioactive beam accelerators, and neutron
beam facilities.
