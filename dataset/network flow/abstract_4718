Power-law fluctuation in observed Internet packet flow are discussed. The
data is obtained by a multi router traffic grapher (MRTG) system for 9 months.
The internet packet flow is analyzed using the detrended fluctuation analysis.
By extracting the average daily trend, the data shows clear power-law
fluctuations. The exponents of the fluctuation for the incoming and outgoing
flow are almost unity. Internet traffic can be understood as a daily periodic
flow with power-law fluctuations.
