The spherically symmetric steady accretion of polytropic perfect fluids onto
a black hole is the simplest flow model that can demonstrate the effects of
backreaction. The analytic and numerical investigation reveals that
backreaction keeps intact most of the characteristics of the sonic point. For
any such system, with the only free parameter being the relative abundance of
the fluid, the mass accretion rate achieves maximal value when the mass of the
fluid is universally 1/3 of the total mass.
