In this article, we analyze a two-level finite element method for the
equations of motion arising in the flow of 2D Oldroyd model with non-smooth
initial data. It involves solving the non-linear problem on a coarse grid of
mesh-size $H$ and solving a linearized problem on a fine grid of mesh-size $h,
h<<H$. The method gives optimal convergence rate for velocity in $H^1$-norm and
for pressure in $L^2$-norm. The analysis takes in to account the loss of
regularity of the solution of the Oldroyd model at initial time.
