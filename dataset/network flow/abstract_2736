A complex network is said to show topological isotropy if the topological
structure around a particular node looks the same in all directions of the
whole network. Topologically anisotropic networks are those where the local
neighborhood around a node is not reproduced at large scale for the whole
network. The existence of topological isotropy is investigated by the existence
of a power-law scaling between a local and a global topological characteristic
of complex networks obtained from graph spectra. We investigate this structural
characteristic of complex networks and its consequences for 32 real-world
networks representing informational, technological, biological, social and
ecological systems.
