In this Letter we show that the time reversal asymmetry of a stationary time
series provides information about the entropy production of the physical
mechanism generating the series, even if one ignores any detail of that
mechanism. We develop estimators for the entropy production which can detect
non-equilibrium processes even when there are no measurable flows in the time
series.
