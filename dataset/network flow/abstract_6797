Field-channelled accretion flows occur in a variety of astrophysical objects,
including T Tauri stars,magnetic cataclysmic variables and X-ray pulsars. We
consider a curvilinear coordinate system and derive a general hydrodynamic
formulation for accretion onto stellar objects confined by a stellar dipole
magnetic field. The hydrodynamic equations are solved to determine the
velocity, density and temperature profiles of the flow. We use accreting
magnetic white-dwarf stars as an illustrative example of astrophysical
applications. Our calculations show that the compressional heating due to the
field geometry is as important as radiative cooling and gravity in determining
the structure of the post-shock flow in accreting white-dwarf stars. The
generalisation of the formulation to accretion flows channelled by higher-order
fields and the applications to other astrophysical systems are discussed.
