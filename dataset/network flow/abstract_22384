The dependence of the barchan dune dynamics on the size of the grains
involved is investigated experimentally. Downsized barchan dune slices are
observed in a narrow water flow tube. The relaxation time from an initial
symmetric triangular heap towards an asymmetric shape attractor increases with
dune mass and decreases with grain size. The dune velocity increases with grain
size. In contrast, the velocity scaling and the shape of the barchan dune is
independent of the size of the grains.
