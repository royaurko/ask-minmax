We construct a symplectic realization of the KM-system and obtain the higher
order Poisson tensors and commuting flows via the use of a recursion operator.
This is achieved by doubling the number of variables through Volterra's
coordinate transformation. An application of Oevel's theorem yields master
symmetries, invariants and deformation relations.
