The phase behavior of charged rods in the presence of inter-rod linkers is
studied theoretically as a model for the equilibrium behavior underlying the
organization of actin filaments by linker proteins in the cytoskeleton. The
presence of linkers in the solution modifies the effective inter-rod
interaction and can lead to inter-filament attraction. Depending on the
system's composition and physical properties such as linker binding energies,
filaments will either orient perpendicular or parallel to each other, leading
to network-like or bundled structures. We show that such a system can have one
of three generic phase diagrams, one dominated by bundles, another by networks,
and the third containing both bundle and network-like phases. The first two
diagrams can be found over a wide range of interaction energies, while the
third occurs only for a narrow range. These results provide theoretical
understanding of the classification of linker proteins as bundling proteins or
crosslinking proteins. In addition, they suggest possible mechanisms by which
the cell may control cytoskeletal morphology.
