The past studies treated the perturbed distribution of circulating electrons
as adiabatic one when studying the dispersion relation of electrostatic
geodesic acoustic mode(GAM). In this paper, the flow of electron geodesic
current (FEGC) is added to modify this adiabatic distribution. Based on the
drift kinetic theory, it is found that FEGC obviously increases the magnitude
of the standard GAM's frequency and reduces its damping rate. The increase of
frequency results from the contribution of FEGC to the radial flow. The reason
for the reduction of damping rate is that when the effect of FEGC counts, the
new resonant velocity becomes much larger than ions thermal velocity with
equilibrium distribution obeying Maxwellian distribution, compared with
unmodified Landau resonant velocity. Especially, FEGC changes the characters of
the frequency and damping rate of low-frequency GAM as functions of safety
factor $q$ .
