Understanding the subgraph distribution in random networks is important for
modelling complex systems. In classic Erdos networks, which exhibit a
Poissonian degree distribution, the number of appearances of a subgraph G with
n nodes and g edges scales with network size as \mean{G} ~ N^{n-g}. However,
many natural networks have a non-Poissonian degree distribution. Here we
present approximate equations for the average number of subgraphs in an
ensemble of random sparse directed networks, characterized by an arbitrary
degree sequence. We find new scaling rules for the commonly occurring case of
directed scale-free networks, in which the outgoing degree distribution scales
as P(k) ~ k^{-\gamma}. Considering the power exponent of the degree
distribution, \gamma, as a control parameter, we show that random networks
exhibit transitions between three regimes. In each regime the subgraph number
of appearances follows a different scaling law, \mean{G} ~ N^{\alpha}, where
\alpha=n-g+s-1 for \gamma<2, \alpha=n-g+s+1-\gamma for 2<\gamma<\gamma_c, and
\alpha=n-g for \gamma>\gamma_c, s is the maximal outdegree in the subgraph, and
\gamma_c=s+1. We find that certain subgraphs appear much more frequently than
in Erdos networks. These results are in very good agreement with numerical
simulations. This has implications for detecting network motifs, subgraphs that
occur in natural networks significantly more than in their randomized
counterparts.
