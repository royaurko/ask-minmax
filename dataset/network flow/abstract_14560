Fluctuations in the initial geometry of a nucleus-nucleus collision have been
recently shown to result in a new type of directed flow (v_1) that, unlike the
usual directed flow, is also present at midrapidity. We compute this new v_1
versus transverse momentum and centrality for Au-Au collisions at RHIC using
the hydrodynamic code NeXSPheRIO. We find that the event plane of v_1 is
correlated with the angle of the initial dipole of the distribution, as
predicted, though with a large dispersion. It is uncorrelated with the reaction
plane. Our results are in excellent agreement with results inferred from STAR
correlation data.
