We study the effect of stochastic wireless channel models on the connectivity
of ad hoc networks. Unlike in the deterministic geometric disk model where
nodes connect if they are within a certain distance from each other, stochastic
models attempt to capture small-scale fading effects due to shadowing and
multipath received signals. Through analysis of local and global network
observables, we present conclusive evidence suggesting that network behaviour
is highly dependent upon whether a stochastic or deterministic connection model
is employed. Specifically we show that the network mean degree is lower
(higher) for stochastic wireless channels than for deterministic ones, if the
path loss exponent is greater (lesser) than the spatial dimension. Similarly,
the probability of forming isolated pairs of nodes in an otherwise dense random
network is much less for stochastic wireless channels than for deterministic
ones. The latter realisation explains why the upper bound of $k$-connectivity
is tighter for stochastic wireless channels. We obtain closed form analytic
results and compare to extensive numerical simulations.
