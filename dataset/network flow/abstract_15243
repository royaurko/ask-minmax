We view a complex liquid as a network of bonds connecting each particle to
its nearest neighbors; the dynamics of this network is a chain of discrete
events signaling particles rearrangements. Within this picture, we studied a
two-dimensional complex liquid and found a stretched-exponential decay of the
network memory and a power-law for the distribution of the times for which a
particle keeps its nearest neighbors; the dependence of this distribution on
temperature suggests a possible dynamical critical point. We identified and
quantified the underlying spatio-temporal phenomena. The equilibrium liquid
represents a hierarchical structure, a mosaic of long-living crystallites
partially separated by less-ordered regions. The long-time dynamics of this
structure is dominated by particles redistribution between dynamically and
structurally different regions. We argue that these are generic features of
locally ordered but globally disordered complex systems. In particular, these
features must be taken into account by any coarse-grained theory of dynamics of
complex fluids and glasses.
