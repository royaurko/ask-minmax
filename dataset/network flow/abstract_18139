Several Networks of Excellence have been set up in the framework of the
European FP5 research program. Among these Networks of Excellence, the NEMIS
project focuses on the field of Text Mining.
  Within this field, document processing and visualization was identified as
one of the key topics and the WG1 working group was created in the NEMIS
project, to carry out a detailed survey of techniques associated with the text
mining process and to identify the relevant research topics in related research
areas.
  In this document we present the results of this comprehensive survey. The
report includes a description of the current state-of-the-art and practice, a
roadmap for follow-up research in the identified areas, and recommendations for
anticipated technological development in the domain of text mining.
