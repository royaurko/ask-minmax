Let $X$ be a toric surface and $u$ be a normalized symplectic potential on
the corresponding polygon $P$. Suppose that the Riemannian curvature is bounded
by a constant $C_1$ and $\int_{\partial P} u ~ d \sigma < C_2, $ then there
exists a constant $C_3$ depending only on $C_1, C_2$ and $P$ such that the
diameter of $X$ is bounded by $C_3$. Moreoever, we can show that there is a
constant $M > 0$ depending only on $C_1, C_2$ and $P$ such that Donaldson's
$M$-condition holds for $u$. As an application, we show that if $(X,P)$ is
(analytic) relative $K$-stable, then the modified Calabi flow converges to an
extremal metric exponentially fast by assuming that the Calabi flow exists for
all time and the Riemannian curvature is uniformly bounded along the Calabi
flow.
