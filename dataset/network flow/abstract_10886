We describe a new holographic RG flow starting from $AdS_4 \times S^7$ and
going to $\widehat{AdS_5} \times {\cal B}_6$ where ${\cal B}_6$ is conformal to
a K\"ahler manifold and $\widehat{AdS_5}$ is Poincar\'e $AdS_5$ with one
spatial direction compactified and fibered over ${\cal B}_6$. This new solution
"flows up dimensions," going from the $(2+1)$-dimensional conformal field
theory on M2 branes in the UV to a $(3+1)$-dimensional field theory on
intersecting M5 branes in the infra-red. The M2 branes indeed completely
polarize into M5 branes along the flow and the Poincar\'e sections of the
$\widehat{AdS_5}$ are the $(3+1)$-dimensional common intersection of the M5
branes. The emergence of the extra dimension in the infra-red suggests a new
strongly-coupled phase of the M2-brane and ABJM theories in which charged
solitons are becoming massless. The flow solution is first analyzed in
four-dimensional ${\cal N}=8$ gauged supergravity, where the solution appears
to be quite singular. The uplift to eleven-dimensional supergravity is then
obtained and the remarkable and regular (up to orbifolding) infra-red geometry
becomes apparent. Our construction is a non-trivial application of the newly
derived uplift formulae for fluxes, going well beyond the earlier constructions
of stationary points solutions. The eleven-dimensional supersymmetry is also
analyzed and shows how M2-brane supersymmetry in the UV is polarized entirely
into M5-brane supersymmetry in the infra-red.
