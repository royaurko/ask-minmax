We consider a network multicast example that relates the solvability of the
multicast problem with the existence of an entropy function. As a result, we
provide an alternative approach to the proving of the insufficiency of linear
(and abelian) network codes and demonstrate the utility of non-Shannon
inequalities to tighten outer bounds on network coding capacity regions.
