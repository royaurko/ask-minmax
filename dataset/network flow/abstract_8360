This paper examines the emerging phenomenon of blogging, using three
different Polish blogging services as the base of the research. Authors show
that blog networks are sharing their characteristics with complex networks
gamma coefficients, small worlds, cliques, etc.). Elements of sociometric
analysis were used to prove existence of some social structures in the blog
networks.
