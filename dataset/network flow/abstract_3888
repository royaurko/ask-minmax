This comment reexamines Simard et al.'s work in [D. Simard, L. Nadeau, H.
Kroger, Phys. Lett. A 336 (2005) 8-15]. We found that Simard et al. calculated
mistakenly the local connectivity lengths Dlocal of networks. The right results
of Dlocal are presented and the supervised learning performance of feedforward
neural networks (FNNs) with different rewirings are re-investigated in this
comment. This comment discredits Simard et al's work by two conclusions: 1)
Rewiring connections of FNNs cannot generate networks with small-world
connectivity; 2) For different training sets, there do not exist networks with
a certain number of rewirings generating reduced learning errors than networks
with other numbers of rewiring.
