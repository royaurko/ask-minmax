The paper presents the method of transferring PCM (Pulse-Code Modulation)
based audio messages through SMS (Short Message Service) over GSM (Global
System for Mobile Communications) network. As SMS is text based service, and
could not send voice. Our method enables voice transferring through SMS, by
converting PCM audio into characters. Than Huffman coding compression technique
is applied in order to reduce numbers of characters which will latterly set as
payload text of SMS. Testing the said method we develop an application using
J2me platform
