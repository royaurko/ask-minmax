Using analytic solutions of the Yang-Mills equations we calculate the initial
flow of energy of the classical gluon field created in collisions of large
nuclei at high energies. We find radial and elliptic flow which follows
gradients in the initial energy density, similar to a simple hydrodynamic
behavior. In addition we find a rapidity-odd transverse flow field which
implies the presence of angular momentum and should lead to directed flow in
final particle spectra. We trace those energy flow terms to transverse fields
from the non-abelian generalization of Gauss' Law and Ampere's and Faraday's
Laws.
