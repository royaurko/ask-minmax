In this paper we present a synthesis of work performed on tow information
retrieval models: Bayesian network information retrieval model witch encode
(in) dependence relation between terms and possibilistic network information
retrieval model witch make use of necessity and possibility measures to
represent the fuzziness of pertinence measure. It is known that the use of a
general Bayesian network methodology as the basis for an IR system is difficult
to tackle. The problem mainly appears because of the large number of variables
involved and the computational efforts needed to both determine the
relationships between variables and perform the inference processes. To resolve
these problems, many models have been proposed such as BNR model. Generally,
Bayesian network models doesn't consider the fuzziness of natural language in
the relevance measure of a document to a given query and possibilistic models
doesn't undertake the dependence relations between terms used to index
documents. As a first solution we propose a hybridization of these two models
in one that will undertake both the relationship between terms and the
intrinsic fuzziness of natural language. We believe that the translation of
Bayesian network model from the probabilistic framework to possibilistic one
will allow a performance improvement of BNRM.
