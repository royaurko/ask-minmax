In many complex systems, states and interaction structure coevolve towards a
dynamic equilibrium. For the adaptive contact process, we obtain approximate
expressions for the degree distributions that characterize the interaction
network in such active steady states. These distributions are shown to agree
quantitatively with simulations except when rewiring is much faster than state
update, and used to predict and to explain general properties of steady-state
topologies. The method generalizes easily to other coevolutionary dynamics.
