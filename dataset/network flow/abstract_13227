Lower branch coherent states in plane Couette flow have an asymptotic
structure that consists of O(1) streaks, $O(R^{-1})$ streamwise rolls and a
weak sinusoidal wave that develops a critical layer, for large Reynolds number
$R$. Higher harmonics become negligible. These unstable lower branch states
appear to have a single unstable eigenvalue at all Reynolds numbers. These
results suggests that the lower branch coherent states control transition to
turbulence and that they may be promising targets for new turbulence prevention
strategies.
