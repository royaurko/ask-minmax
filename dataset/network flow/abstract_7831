From event-driven simulations of a gravity-driven channel flow of inelastic
hard-disks, we show that the velocity distribution function remains close to a
Gaussian for a wide range densities (even when the Knudsen number is of order
one) if the walls are smooth and the particle collisions are nearly elastic.
For dense flows, a transition from a Gaussian to a power-law distribution for
the high velocity tails occurs with increasing dissipation in the center of the
channel, irrespective of wall-roughness. For a rough wall, the near-wall
distribution functions are distinctly different from those in the bulk even in
the quasielastic limit.
