One of interesting phenomena due to topological heterogeneities in complex
networks is the friendship paradox: Your friends have on average more friends
than you do. Recently, this paradox has been generalized for arbitrary node
attributes, called generalized friendship paradox (GFP). The origin of GFP at
the network level has been shown to be rooted in positive correlations between
degrees and attributes. However, how the GFP holds for individual nodes needs
to be understood in more detail. For this, we first analyze a solvable model to
characterize the paradox holding probability of nodes for the uncorrelated
case. Then we numerically study the correlated model of networks with tunable
degree-degree and degree-attribute correlations. In contrast to the network
level, we find at the individual level that the relevance of degree-attribute
correlation to the paradox holding probability may depend on whether the
network is assortative or dissortative. These findings help us to understand
the interplay between topological structure and node attributes in complex
networks.
