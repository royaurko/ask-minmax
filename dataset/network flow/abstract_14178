Recently, with the advances in computational speed and availability there has
been a growth in the number and resolution of fully 3-D hydrodynamical
simulations. However, all of these simulations are purely hydrodynamical and
there has been little attempt to include the effects of radiative transfer
except in a purely phenomenological manner because the computational cost is
too large even for modern supercomputers. While there has been an effort to
develop 3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes, most of these have been for
static atmospheres or have employed the Sobolev approximation, which limits
their applicability to studying purely geometric effects such as macroscopic
mixing. Also the computational requirements of Monte Carlo methods are such
that it is difficult to couple with 3-D hydrodynamics. Here, we present an
algorithm for calculating 1-D spherical radiative transfer in the presence of
non-monotonic velocity fields in the co-moving frame. Non-monotonic velocity
flows will occur in convective, and Raleigh--Taylor unstable flows, in flows
with multiple shocks, and in pulsationally unstable stars such as Mira and
Cepheids. This is a first step to developing fully 3-D radiative transfer than
can be coupled with hydrodynamics. We present the computational method and the
results of some test calculations.
