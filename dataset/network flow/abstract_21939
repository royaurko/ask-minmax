Computing according to laymens procedures is changed to contain a paradigm of
inoptimality in the high level and assembled code. The code is changed to
maximize the flow of information contained in the electrons so that they
function more as a group and without unwanted coherence effects. Exponential
effects are suspected in the improved operation of the programming. From a
laymens point of view the maladjustment of substandard code could result in a
factor of a thousand in such programs as Microsoft Works which can be speed
intensive.
