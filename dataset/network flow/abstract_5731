We study the properties of 2D fibre clusters and networks formed by
deposition processes. We first examine the growth and scaling properties of
single clusters. We then consider a network of such clusters, whose spatial
distribution obeys some effective pair distribution function. In particular, we
derive an expression for the two-point density autocorrelation function of the
network, which includes the internal structure of a cluster and the effective
cluster-cluster pair distribution function. This formula can be applied to
obtain information about nontrivial correlations in fibre networks.
