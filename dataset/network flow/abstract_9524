We propose a multistage version of the independent cascade model, which we
call a multistage independent cascade (MIC) model, on networks. This model is
parameterized by two probabilities: the probability $T_1$ that a node adopting
a fad increases the awareness of a neighboring susceptible node, and the
probability $T_2$ that an adopter directly causes a susceptible node to adopt
the fad. We formulate a tree approximation for the MIC model on an uncorrelated
network with an arbitrary degree distribution $p_k$. Applied on a random
regular network with degree $k=6$, this model exhibits a rich phase diagram,
including continuous and discontinuous transition lines for fad percolation,
and a continuous transition line for the percolation of susceptible nodes. In
particular, the percolation transition of fads is discontinuous (continuous)
when $T_1$ is larger (smaller) than a certain value. A similar discontinuous
transition is also observed in random graphs and scale-free networks.
Furthermore, assigning a finite fraction of initial adopters dramatically
changes the phase boundaries.
