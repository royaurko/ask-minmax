Many real networks have cliques as their constitutional units. Here we
present a family of scale-free network model consist of cliques, which is
established by a simple recursive algorithm. We investigate the networks both
analytically and numerically. The obtained analytical solution shows that the
networks follow a power-law degree distribution, with degree exponent
continuously tuned between 2 and 3, coinciding with the empirically found
results. The exact expression of clustering coefficient is also provided for
the networks. Furthermore, the investigation of the average path length reveals
that the networks possess small-world feature.
