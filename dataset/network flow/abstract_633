The sharing of network traces is an important prerequisite for the
development and evaluation of efficient anomaly detection mechanisms.
Unfortunately, privacy concerns and data protection laws prevent network
operators from sharing these data. Anonymization is a promising solution in
this context; however, it is unclear if the sanitization of data preserves the
traffic characteristics or introduces artifacts that may falsify traffic
analysis results. In this paper, we examine the utility of anonymized flow
traces for anomaly detection. We quantitatively evaluate the impact of IP
address anonymization, namely variations of permutation and truncation, on the
detectability of large-scale anomalies. Specifically, we analyze three weeks of
un-sampled and non-anonymized network traces from a medium-sized backbone
network. We find that all anonymization techniques, except prefix-preserving
permutation, degrade the utility of data for anomaly detection. We show that
the degree of degradation depends to a large extent on the nature and mix of
anomalies present in a trace. Moreover, we present a case study that
illustrates how traffic characteristics of individual hosts are distorted by
anonymization.
