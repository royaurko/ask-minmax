L-selectin mediated tethers result in leukocyte rolling only above a
threshold in shear. Here we present biophysical modeling based on recently
published data from flow chamber experiments (Dwir et al., J. Cell Biol. 163:
649-659, 2003) which supports the interpretation that L-selectin mediated
tethers below the shear threshold correspond to single L-selectin carbohydrate
bonds dissociating on the time scale of milliseconds, whereas L-selectin
mediated tethers above the shear threshold are stabilized by multiple bonds and
fast rebinding of broken bonds, resulting in tether lifetimes on the timescale
of $10^{-1}$ seconds. Our calculations for cluster dissociation suggest that
the single molecule rebinding rate is of the order of $10^4$ Hz. A similar
estimate results if increased tether dissociation for tail-truncated L-selectin
mutants above the shear threshold is modeled as diffusive escape of single
receptors from the rebinding region due to increased mobility. Using computer
simulations, we show that our model yields first order dissociation kinetics
and exponential dependence of tether dissociation rates on shear stress. Our
results suggest that multiple contacts, cytoskeletal anchorage of L-selectin
and local rebinding of ligand play important roles in L-selectin tether
stabilization and progression of tethers into persistent rolling on endothelial
surfaces.
