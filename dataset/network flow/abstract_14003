The phenomenon, channel segregates (CS) as a result of gravity-driven flow
due to density contrast occurred in the solid-liquid mushy zones1during
solidification, often causes the severe destruction of homogeneity and even
some fatal damages. Investigation on its mechanism sheds light on the
understanding and controlling of the formation of solidifying metals,earth's
core, igneous rock and sea ice. Until now, it still remains controversial what
composes the density contrasts and, to what extent, how it affects channel
segregates. Here, we show that in experimental 500kg and 100 ton commercial
cast steel ingots CS originates from oxide Al2O3/MnS impurity clusters (OICs)
initially nucleated from the oxide (Al2O3) particles, which induce an extra
flow due to sharp density contrast between clusters and melt. The results
uncover that, as OICs enrich and grow, their driven flow becomes stronger than
the traditionally recognized inter-dendritic thermo-solutal convection,
dominating the subsequent opening of the channels. This study extends the
classical macrosegregation theory, highlights a significant technological
breakthrough to control CS, and could quickly yield practical benefits to the
worldwide manufacture of over 50 million tons of ingots, super-thick slab and
heavy castings annually, as well as has general implications for the
elaboration of other related natural phenomena.
