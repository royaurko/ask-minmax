Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the creation and evolution of boost
invariant anisotropic, strongly coupled N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma.
In the dual gravitational description, this corresponds to horizon formation in
a geometry driven to be anisotropic by a time-dependent change in boundary
conditions.
