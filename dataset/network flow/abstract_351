We present a self-organising, decentralised control method for material flows
in networks. The concept applies to networks where time sharing mechanisms
between conflicting flows in nodes are required and where a coordination of
these local switches on a system-wide level can improve the performance. We
show that, under certain assumptions, the control of nodes can be mapped to a
network of phase-oscillators.
  By synchronising these oscillators, the desired global coordination is
achieved. We illustrate the method in the example of traffic signal control for
road networks. The proposed concept is flexible, adaptive, robust and
decentralised. It can be transferred to other queuing networks such as
production systems. Our control approach makes use of simple synchronisation
principles found in various biological systems in order to obtain collective
behaviour from local interactions.
