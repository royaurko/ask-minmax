In this paper we consider inverse problems for resistor networks and for
models obtained via the Finite Element Method (FEM) for the conductivity
equation. These correspond to discrete versions of the inverse conductivity
problem of Calder\'on. We characterize FEM models corresponding to a given
triangulation of the domain that are equivalent to certain resistor networks,
and apply the results to study nonuniqueness of the discrete inverse problem.
It turns out that the degree of nonuniqueness for the discrete problem is
larger than the one for the partial differential equation. We also study
invisibility cloaking for FEM models, and show how an arbitrary body can be
surrounded with a layer so that the cloaked body has the same boundary
measurements as a given background medium.
