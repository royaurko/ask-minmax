Abrasion resistance of solution polymerized styrene-butadiene rubber (SSBR)
based composites is a typical and crucial property in practical applications.
Previous studies show that the abrasion resistance can be calculated by the
multiple linear regression model. In our study, considering this relationship
can also be described into the non-linear conditions, a Multilayer Feed-forward
Neural Networks model with 3 nodes (MLFN-3) was successfully established to
describe the relationship between the abrasion resistance and other properties,
using 23 groups of data, with the RMS error 0.07. Our studies have proved that
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model can be used to predict the SSBR-based
composites, which is an accurate and robust process.
