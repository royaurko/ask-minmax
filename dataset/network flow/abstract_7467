Hamilton flows on K\"ahler manifold for which all trajectories are $H$-planar
curves (complex analog of geodesics) are considered. These flows are called
$H$-planar. The equation which has to obey the Hamiltonian of $H$-planar
Hamilton flow is received and the method of finding general solution of this
equation is proposed.
  Trajectories of charged particles in magnetic fields of special form on
K\"ahler manifolds of constant holomorphic sectional curvature are studied.
Using the fact that K\"ahler manifolds of constant holomorphic sectional
curvature admit $H$-projective mapping on flat space the equation of particle
motion is reduced to an ordinary differential equation of second order.
