Subspace codes were introduced by K\"otter and Kschischang for error control
in random linear network coding. In this paper, a layered type of subspace
codes is considered, which can be viewed as a superposition of multiple
component subspace codes. Exploiting the layered structure, we develop two
decoding algorithms for these codes. The first algorithm operates by separately
decoding each component code. The second algorithm is similar to the successive
interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm for conventional superposition
coding, and further permits an iterative version. We show that both algorithms
decode not only deterministically up to but also probabilistically beyond the
error-correction capability of the overall code. Finally we present possible
applications of layered subspace codes in several network coding scenarios.
