Preferential concentration of inertial particles in turbulent flow is studied
by high resolution direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional turbulence.
The formation of network-like regions of high particle density, characterized
by a length scale which depends on the Stokes number of inertial particles, is
observed. At smaller scales, the size of empty regions appears to be
distributed according to a scaling law.
