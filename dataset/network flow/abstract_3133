Recently, motivated by the pioneer works that reveal the small-world effect
and scale-free property of various real-life networks, many scientists devote
themselves into studying complex networks. One of the ultimate goals is to
understand how the topological structures of networks affect the dynamics upon
them. In this paper, we give a brief review on the studies of epidemic dynamics
on complex networks, including the description of classical epidemic models,
the epidemic spread on small-world and scale-free networks, and network
immunization. Finally, a prospect is addressed and some interesting problems
are listed.
