Lower-branch traveling waves and equilibria computed in pipe flow and other
shear flows appear intermediate between turbulent and laminar motions. We take
a step towards connecting these lower-branch solutions to transition by
deriving a numerical method for finding certain special disturbances of the
laminar flow in a short pipe. These special disturbances cause the disturbed
velocity field to approach the lower-branch solution by evolving along its
stable manifold. If the disturbance were slightly smaller, the flow would
relaminarize, and if slightly larger, it would transition to a turbulent state.
