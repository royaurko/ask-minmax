Consider the motion of a material point of unit mass in a central field
determined by a homogeneous potential of the form $(-1/r^{\alpha})$,
$\alpha>0,$ where $r$ being the distance to the centre of the field. Due to the
singularity at $r=0,$ in computer-based simulations, usually, the potential is
replaced by a similar potential that is smooth, or at least continuous.
  In this paper, we compare the global flows given by the smoothed and
non-smoothed potentials. It is shown that the two flows are topologically
equivalent for $\alpha < 2,$ while for $\alpha \geq 2,$ smoothing introduces
fake orbits. Further, we argue that for $\alpha\geq 2,$ smoothing should be
applied to the amended potential $c/(2r^2)-1/r^{\alpha},$ where $c$ denotes the
angular momentum constant.
