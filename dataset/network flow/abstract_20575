In this paper we advance physical background of the energy- and flux-budget
turbulence closure based on the budget equations for the turbulent kinetic and
potential energies and turbulent fluxes of momentum and buoyancy, and a new
relaxation equation for the turbulent dissipation time-scale. The closure is
designed for stratified geophysical flows from neutral to very stable and
accounts for the Earth rotation. In accordance to modern experimental evidence,
the closure implies maintaining of turbulence by the velocity shear at any
gradient Richardson number Ri, and distinguishes between the two principally
different regimes: "strong turbulence" at Ri << 1 typical of boundary-layer
flows and characterised by the practically constant turbulent Prandtl number;
and "weak turbulence" at Ri > 1 typical of the free atmosphere or deep ocean,
where the turbulent Prandtl number asymptotically linearly increases with
increasing Ri (which implies very strong suppression of the heat transfer
compared to the momentum transfer). For use in different applications, the
closure is formulated at different levels of complexity, from the local
algebraic model relevant to the steady-state regime of turbulence to a
hierarchy of non-local closures including simpler down-gradient models,
presented in terms of the eddy-viscosity and eddy-conductivity, and general
non-gradient model based on prognostic equations for all basic parameters of
turbulence including turbulent fluxes.
