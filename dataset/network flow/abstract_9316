With the increased competition for the electromagnetic spectrum, it is
important to characterize the impact of interference in the performance of a
wireless network, which is traditionally measured by its throughput. This paper
presents a unifying framework for characterizing the local throughput in
wireless networks. We first analyze the throughput of a probe link from a
connectivity perspective, in which a packet is successfully received if it does
not collide with other packets from nodes within its reach (called the audible
interferers). We then characterize the throughput from a
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) perspective, in which a packet
is successfully received if the SINR exceeds some threshold, considering the
interference from all emitting nodes in the network. Our main contribution is
to generalize and unify various results scattered throughout the literature. In
particular, the proposed framework encompasses arbitrary wireless propagation
effects (e.g, Nakagami-m fading, Rician fading, or log-normal shadowing), as
well as arbitrary traffic patterns (e.g., slotted-synchronous,
slotted-asynchronous, or exponential-interarrivals traffic), allowing us to
draw more general conclusions about network performance than previously
available in the literature.
