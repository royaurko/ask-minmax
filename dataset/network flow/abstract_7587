We have recently proposed a new method of flow analysis, based on a cumulant
expansion of multiparticle azimuthal correlations. Here, we describe the
practical implementation of the method. The major improvement over traditional
methods is that the cumulant expansion eliminates order by order correlations
not due to flow, which are often large but usually neglected.
