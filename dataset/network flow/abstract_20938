The formal verification of large probabilistic models is important and
challenging. Exploiting the concurrency that is often present is one way to
address this problem. Here we study a restricted class of asynchronous
distributed probabilistic systems in which the synchronizations determine the
probability distribution for the next moves of the participating agents. The
key restriction we impose is that the synchronizations are deterministic, in
the sense that any two simultaneously enabled synchronizations must involve
disjoint sets of agents. As a result, this network of agents can be viewed as a
succinct and distributed presentation of a large global Markov chain. A rich
class of Markov chains can be represented this way.
  We define an interleaved semantics for our model in terms of the local
synchronization actions. The network structure induces an independence relation
on these actions, which, in turn, induces an equivalence relation over the
interleaved runs in the usual way. We construct a natural probability measure
over these equivalence classes of runs by exploiting Mazurkiewicz trace theory
and the probability measure space of the associated global Markov chain.
  It turns out that verification of our model, called DMCs (distributed Markov
chains), can often be efficiently carried out by exploiting the partial order
nature of the interleaved semantics. To demonstrate this, we develop a
statistical model checking (SMC) procedure and use it to verify two large
distributed probabilistic networks.
