This is a sequel to [OZ1] in which we studied the adiabatic degeneration of
Floer trajectories to "disk-flow-disk" configurations and the recovering
gluing, where the gradient flow part had length 0. In the present paper we
study the case when the gradient flow part has a positive length. Unlike the
standard gluing problem, we study the problem of gluing 1-dimensional gradient
segments and 2-dimensional (perturbed) J-holomorphic curves. The two also have
different convergence rates near the ends: linear convergence for the finite
gradient segments and exponential convergence for J-holomorphic maps.
  As an immediate application, we outline the proof that when a finite number
of Hamiltonian deformations of a non-exact Lagrangian submanifold collapse
simultaneously, the pearl complex moduli spaces used in [BC] are diffeomorphic
to the J-holomorphic polygon moduli spaces in [FOOO] provided the dimension of
the moduli spaces is sufficiently small. This is enough to prove that the
A_{\infty}-structures appearing in the two pictures are isomorphic to each
other. The main gluing theorem also provides another proof of the isomorphism
property of PSS map which is different from that of [OZ1]: It bypasses the
nodal Floer trajectories by going directly from "disk-flow-disk" configurations
to resolved Floer trajectories.
