Biological information processing as implemented by regulatory and signaling
networks in living cells requires sufficient specificity of molecular
interaction to distinguish signals from one another, but much of regulation and
signaling involves somewhat fuzzy and promiscuous recognition of molecular
sequences and structures, which can leave systems vulnerable to crosstalk. This
paper examines a simple computational model of protein-protein interactions
which reveals both a sharp onset of crosstalk and a fragmentation of the
neutral network of viable solutions as more proteins compete for regions of
sequence space, revealing intrinsic limits to reliable signaling in the face of
promiscuity. These results suggest connections to both phase transitions in
constraint satisfaction problems and coding theory bounds on the size of
communication codes.
