The Artificial Neural network is a functional imitation of simplified model
of the biological neurons and their goal is to construct useful computers for
real world problems. The ANN applications have increased dramatically in the
last few years fired by both theoretical and practical applications in a wide
variety of applications. A brief theory of ANN is presented and potential areas
are identified and future trends are discussed.
