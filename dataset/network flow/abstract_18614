This paper considers a network of stochastic evidence accumulators, each
represented by a drift-diffusion model accruing evidence towards a decision in
continuous time by observing a noisy signal and by exchanging information with
other units according to a fixed communication graph. We bring into focus the
relationship between the location of each unit in the communication graph and
its certainty as measured by the inverse of the variance of its state. We show
that node classification according to degree distributions or geodesic
distances cannot faithfully capture node ranking in terms of certainty.
Instead, all possible paths connecting each unit with the rest in the network
must be incorporated. We make this precise by proving that node classification
according to information centrality provides a rank ordering with respect to
node certainty, thereby affording a direct interpretation of the certainty
level of each unit in terms of the structural properties of the underlying
communication graph.
