We use a one dimensional symmetric exclusion model to study pressure and
osmosis driven flows through molecular-sized channels, such as biological
membrane channels and zeolite pores. Analytic expressions are found for the
steady-state flow which show rich nonlinear behavior. We find a maximum in the
flow rates depending upon pore radius, pore energetics, reservoir temperature,
and driving force. We also present exact mean-field results of transport
through pores with internal defects. The interesting nonlinear dependences
suggest numerous diagnostic experiments in biological and zeolitic systems
which may reveal the features presented.
