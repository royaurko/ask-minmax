Roles of turbulence in the context of magnetic reconnection are investigated
with special emphasis on the mutual interaction between flow (large-scale
inhomogeneous structure) and turbulence. In order to evaluate the effective
transport due to turbulence, in addition to the {\it intensity} information of
turbulence represented by the turbulent energy, the {\it structure} information
represented by pseudoscalar statistical quantities (helicities) is important.
On the basis of the evolution equation, mechanisms that provide turbulence with
cross helicity are presented. Magnetic-flux freezing in highly turbulent media
is considered with special emphasis on the spatial distribution of the
turbulent cross helicity. The cross-helicity effects in the context of magnetic
reconnection are also investigated. It is shown that the large-scale flow and
magnetic-field configurations favorable for the cross-helicity generation is
compatible with the fast reconnection. In this sense, turbulence and
large-scale structures promote magnetic reconnection mediated by the turbulent
cross helicity.
