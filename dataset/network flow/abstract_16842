Consider $n$ sensors whose positions are represented by $n$ uniform,
independent and identically distributed random variables assuming values in the
open unit interval $(0,1)$. A natural way to guarantee connectivity in the
resulting sensor network is to assign to each sensor as its range, the maximum
of the two possible distances to its two neighbors. The interference at a given
sensor is defined as the number of sensors that have this sensor within their
range. In this paper we prove that the expected maximum interference of the
sensors is $\Theta (\sqrt{\ln n})$.
