An existence and uniqueness result, up to fattening, for a class of
crystalline mean curvature flows with natural mobility is proved. The results
are valid in any dimension and for arbitrary, possibly unbounded, initial
closed sets. The comparison principle is obtained by means of a suitable weak
formulation of the flow, while the existence of a global-in-time solution
follows via a minimizing movements approach.
