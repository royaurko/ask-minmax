We study classes of dynamical systems that can be obtained by constructing
recursive networks with monotone Boolean functions. Stack filters in nonlinear
signal processing are special cases of such systems. We show an analytical
connection between coefficients used to optimize the statistical properties of
stack filters and their sensitivity, a measure that can be used to characterize
the dynamical properties of Boolean networks constructed from the corresponding
monotone functions. A connection is made between the rank selection
probabilities (RSPs) and the sensitivity. We also examine the dynamical
behavior of monotone functions corresponding to filters that are optimal in
terms of their noise suppression capability, and find that the optimal filters
are dynamically chaotic. This contrasts with the optimal information
preservation properties of critical networks in the case of small perturbations
in Boolean networks, and highlights the difference between such perturbations
and those corresponding to noise. We also consider a generalization of Boolean
networks that is obtained by utilizing stack filters on continuous-valued
states. It can be seen that for such networks, the dynamical regime can be
changed when binary variables are made continuous.
