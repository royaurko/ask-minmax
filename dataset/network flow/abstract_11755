The extension of the master stability function (MSF) to analyze stability of
generalized synchronization for coupled nearly identical oscillators is
discussed. The nearly identical nature of the coupled oscillators comes from
some parameter mismatch while the dynamical equations are the same for all the
oscillators. From the stability criteria of the MSF, we construct optimal
networks with better synchronization property, i. e. the synchronization is
stable for widest possible range of coupling parameter. In the optimized
networks the nodes with parameter value at one extreme are selected as hubs.
The pair of nodes with larger parameter difference are preferred to create
links in the optimized networks. And the optimized networks are found to be
disassortative in nature, i. e. the nodes with high degree tend to connect with
nodes with low degree.
