This is a case study discussing the supervised artificial neural network for
the purpose of forecasting with comparison of the Box-Jenkins methodology by
using the data of well known emergency service Rescue 1122. We fits a variety
of neural network (NN) models and many problems were revealed while fitting the
ANNs model to achieve the local minima. Moreover ANNs model is giving much
better out of sample forecasts as compare to the ARIMA model. However we use
diagnostic checks for the comparison of models.
