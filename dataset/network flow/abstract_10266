A circuit is considered in the shape of a ring, with a battery of negligible
size and a wire of uniform resistance. A linear charge distribution along the
wire maintains an electrostatic field and a steady current, which produces a
constant magnetic field. Earlier studies of the Poynting vector and the rate of
flow of energy considered only idealized geometries in which the Poynting
vector was confined to the space within the circuit. But in more realistic
cases the Poynting vector is nonzero outside as well as inside the circuit. An
expression is obtained for the Poynting vector in terms of products of
integrals, which are evaluated numerically to show the energy flow. Limiting
expressions are obtained analytically. It is shown that the total power
generated by the battery equals the energy flowing into the wire per unit time.
