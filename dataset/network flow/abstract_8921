For Hagen-Poiseuille flow the mechanism of laminar-to-turbulent transition
originated from the deceleration of disturbed streams on the pipe wall is
analyzed. An expression for the critical Reynolds number and the disturbance in
the form of ring obstacle is derived. The good qualitative agreement between
the theoretical results and published experimental data is demonstrated
