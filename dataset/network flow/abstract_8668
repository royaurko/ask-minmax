In this document, a privacy-preserving distributed profile matching protocol
is proposed in a particular network context called \emph{mobile social
network}. Such networks are often deployed in more or less hostile
environments, requiring rigorous security mechanisms. In the same time, energy
and computational resources are limited as these heterogeneous networks are
frequently constituted by wireless components like tablets or mobile phones.
This is why a new encryption algorithm having an high level of security while
preserving resources is proposed in this paper. The approach is based on
elliptic curve cryptography, more specifically on an almost completely
homomorphic cryptosystem over a supersingular elliptic curve, leading to a
secure and efficient preservation of privacy in distributed profile matching.
