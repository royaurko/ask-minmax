While mobile IPTV services are supported through the mobile WiMAX networks,
there must need some guaranteed bandwidth for the IPTV services especially if
IPTV and non-IPTV services are simultaneously supported by the mobile WiMAX
networks. The quality of an IPTV service definitely depends on the allocated
bandwidth for that channel. However, due to the high quality IPTV services and
to support of huge non-IPTV traffic over mobile WiMAX networks, it is not
possible to guarantee the sufficient amount of the limited mobile WiMAX
bandwidth for the mobile IPTV services every time. A Service Level Agreement
(SLA) between the mobile IPTV service provider and mobile WiMAX network
operator to reserve sufficient bandwidth for the IPTV calls can increase the
satisfaction level of the mobile IPTV users. In this paper, we propose a SLA
negotiation procedure for mobile IPTV users over mobile WiMAX networks. The
Bandwidth Broker controls the allocated bandwidth for IPTV and non-IPTV users.
The proposed dynamically reserved bandwidth for the IPTV services increases the
IPTV user's satisfaction level. The simulation results state that, our proposed
scheme is able to provide better user satisfaction level for the IPTV users.
