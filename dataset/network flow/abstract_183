We report the first measurement of charged particle elliptic flow in Pb-Pb
collisions at 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider. The measurement is performed in the central pseudorapidity region
(|eta|<0.8) and transverse momentum range 0.2< p_t< 5.0 GeV/c. The elliptic
flow signal v_2, measured using the 4-particle correlation method, averaged
over transverse momentum and pseudorapidity is 0.087 +/- 0.002 (stat) +/- 0.004
(syst) in the 40-50% centrality class. The differential elliptic flow v_2(p_t)
reaches a maximum of 0.2 near p_t = 3 GeV/c. Compared to RHIC Au-Au collisions
at 200 GeV, the elliptic flow increases by about 30%. Some hydrodynamic model
predictions which include viscous corrections are in agreement with the
observed increase.
