We present here an optimized and parallelized version of the {\sl augmented
space recursion code} for the calculation of the electronic and magnetic
properties of bulk disordered alloys, surfaces and interfaces, either flat,
corrugated or rough, and random networks. Applications have been made to bulk
disordered alloys to benchmark our code.
