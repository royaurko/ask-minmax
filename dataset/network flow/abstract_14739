Given an open book decomposition $(\Sigma,\tau)$ of a three manifold $Y$,
Thurston and Winkelnkemper [TW] construct a specific contact form $a$ on $Y$.
Given a spin-c Dirac operator $D$ on $Y$, the contact form naturally associates
a one parameter family of Dirac operators $D_r = D - \frac{ir}{2}\cl(a)$ for
$r\geq0$. When $r>>1$, we prove that the spectrum of $D_r = D_0 -
\frac{ir}{2}\cl(a)$ within $[-(r^{1/2})/2, (r^{1/2})/2]$ are almost uniformly
distributed. With the result in Part I, it implies that the subleading order
term of the spectral flow from $D_0$ to $D_r$ is of order $r (\log
r)^{\frac{9}{2}}$. Besides the interests of the spectral flow, the method of
this paper provide a tool to analyze the Dirac operator on an open book
decomposition.
