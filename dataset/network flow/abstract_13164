The paper presents recent PHENIX results for the nuclear modification factor
R_AA in Au + Au Collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV for the electrons
originating from semi-leptonic decays of open heavy flavor carrying particles.
We also report the results of the azimuthal asymmetry (v_2) measurement for
those electrons, which is directly related to the heavy quark elliptic flow.
