We discuss the properties of equilibrium states in an autoassociative memory
model storing hierarchically correlated patterns (hereafter, hierarchical
patterns). We will show that symmetric mixed states (hereafter, mixed states)
are bi-stable on the associative memory model storing the hierarchical patterns
in a region of the ferromagnetic phase. This means that the first-order
transition occurs in this ferromagnetic phase. We treat these contents with a
statistical mechanical method (SCSNA) and by computer simulation. Finally, we
discuss a physiological implication of this model. Sugase et al. analyzed the
time-course of the information carried by the firing of face-responsive neurons
in the inferior temporal cortex. We also discuss the relation between the
theoretical results and the physiological experiments of Sugase et al.
