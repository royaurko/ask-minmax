This talk summarizes the present status of a program to quantitatively relate
data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) on collective expansion
flow to the Equation of State (EOS) of hot and dense strongly interacting
matter, including the quark-gluon plasma and the quark-hadron phase transition.
The limits reached with the present state of the art and the next steps
required to make further progress will both be discussed.
