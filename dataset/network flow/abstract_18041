Computer networking is an important specialization in Information and
Communication Technologies. However imparting the right knowledge to students
can be a challenging task due to the fact that there is not enough time to
deliver lengthy labs during normal lecture hours. Augmenting the use of
physical machines with software tools help the students to learn beyond the
limited lab sessions within the environment of higher Institutions of learning
throughout the world. The Institutions focus mostly on effective use of
available resources i.e. a lab may have few lab sessions scheduled within a day
for different courses. Hence a particular lab session must begin and end on
time. A slow student who did not complete his/her lab exercise must vacate the
lab because another class is about to commence. Hence using free software tools
such as OPNET IT guru, Packet trace and NS2 will help the student to learn
beyond the College time. A Student will gain an insight into Computer
networking field by repeatedly doing the same labs at the comfort of his laptop
or PC at home, hence increasing deeper understanding into the subject. The main
objective of this paper is to explore the software tools which will enhance the
networks practical skills among higher education students at College of Applied
Sciences Salalah. The paper also discusses the methodologies of implementing
and executing lab sessions after the normal college hours. The limitations and
suggestions for the improvements are also specified at the end of this paper.
