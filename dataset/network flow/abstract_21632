Properties of the hadronic final state in photoproduction events with large
transverse energy are studied at the electron-proton collider HERA.
Distributions of the transverse energy, jets and underlying event energy are
compared to $\overline{p}p$ data and QCD calculations. The comparisons show
that the $\gamma p$ events can be consistently described by QCD models
including -- in addition to the primary hard scattering process -- interactions
between the two beam remnants. The differential jet cross sections
$d\sigma/dE_T^{jet}$ and $d\sigma/d\eta^{jet}$ are measured.
