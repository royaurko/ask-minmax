We study the middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAfv) in humans
using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). The time series of the axial
flow velocity averaged over a cardiac beat interval is found to exhibit clear
multifractal properties for healthy subjects. We observe a loss of
multifractality for subjects with migraine.
