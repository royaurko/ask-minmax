Let C be a cone in the space of algebraic curvature tensors. Moreover, let
(M,g) be a compact Einstein manifold with the property that the curvature
tensor of (M,g) lies in the cone C at each point on M. We show that (M,g) has
constant sectional curvature if the cone C satisfies certain structure
conditions.
