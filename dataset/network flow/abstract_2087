Research work in the area of the Global Electric Circuit (GEC) has rapidly
expanded in recent years mainly through observations of lightning from
satellites and ground-based networks and observations of optical emissions
between cloud and the ionosphere. After reviewing this progress, we critically
examine the role of various generators of the currents flowing in the lower and
upper atmosphere and supplying currents to the GEC. The role of aerosols and
cosmic rays in controlling the GEC and linkage between climate,
solarterrestrial relationships and the GEC has been briefly discussed. Some
unsolved problems in this area are reported for future investigations.
