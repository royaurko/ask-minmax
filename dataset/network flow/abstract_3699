The dynamics of gradient and Hamiltonian flows with particular application to
flows on adjoint orbits of a Lie group and the extension of this setting to
flows on a loop group are discussed. Different types of gradient flows that
arise from different metrics including the so-called normal metric on adjoint
orbits of a Lie group and the K\"ahler metric are compared. It is discussed how
a K\"ahler metric can arise from a complex structure induced by the Hilbert
transform. Hybrid and metriplectic flows that arise when one has both
Hamiltonian and gradient components are examined. A class of metriplectic
systems that is generated by completely antisymmetric triple brackets is
described and for finite-dimensional systems given a Lie algebraic
interpretation. A variety of explicit examples of the several types of flows
are given.
