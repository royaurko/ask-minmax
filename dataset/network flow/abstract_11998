Recently, Watts and Strogatz introduced the so-called small-world networks in
order to describe systems which combine simultaneously properties of regular
and of random lattices. In this work we study diffusion processes defined on
such structures by considering explicitly the probability for a random walker
to be present at the origin. The results are intermediate between the
corresponding ones for fractals and for Cayley trees.
