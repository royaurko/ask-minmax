We show how the motion of free material test particles in arbitrary spatial
flows is easily determined within the context of ordinary vector calculus. This
may be useful for everyone, including engineers and other non-specialists, when
thinking about gravitational problems. It already has valid application to
simple problems such as the problems of motion in rotating and accelerating
frames and to the gravitational problem of the single spherically symmetric
attractor. When applied to the two body gravitational problem, it may help us
determine the actual direction of the flow.
