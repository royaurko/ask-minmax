Multi-stage interconnection networks (MIN) can be designed to achieve fault
tolerance and collision solving by providing a set of disjoint paths. In this
paper, we are discussing the new simulator added to the tool designed for
developing fault tolerant MINs. The designed tool is one of its own kind and
will help the user in developing 2 and 3-disjoint path networks. The java
technology has been used to design the tool and have been tested on different
software platform.
