The key Standard-Physics inputs of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) are the
light nuclei reaction rates. Both the network and the nuclear rates have been
recently reanalyzed and updated, and cosmological and New-Physics constraints
(taking into account the WMAP Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies
measurement) obtained with a new code are presented.
