We experimentally perform open and closed-loop control of a separating
turbulent boundary layer downstream from a sharp edge ramp. The turbulent
boundary layer just above the separation point has a Reynolds number
$Re_{\theta}\approx 3\,500$ based on momentum thickness. The goal of the
control is to mitigate separation and early re-attachment. The forcing employs
a spanwise array of active vortex generators. The flow state is monitored with
skin-friction sensors downstream of the actuators. The feedback control law is
obtained using model-free genetic programming control (GPC) (Gautier et al.
2015). The resulting flow is assessed using the momentum coefficient, pressure
distribution and skin friction over the ramp and stereo PIV. The PIV yields
vector field statistics, e.g. shear layer growth, the backflow area and vortex
region. GPC is benchmarked against the best periodic forcing. While open-loop
control achieves separation reduction by locking-on the shedding mode, GPC
gives rise to similar benefits by accelerating the shear layer growth.
Moreover, GPC uses less actuation energy.
