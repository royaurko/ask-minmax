In this paper, we present an illustration to the history of Artificial
Intelligence(AI) with a statistical analysis of publish since 1940. We
collected and mined through the IEEE publish data base to analysis the
geological and chronological variance of the activeness of research in AI. The
connections between different institutes are showed. The result shows that the
leading community of AI research are mainly in the USA, China, the Europe and
Japan. The key institutes, contributors and the research hotspots are revealed. It
is found that the research institutes in the fields like Data Mining, Computer
Vision, Pattern Recognition and some other fields of Machine Learning are quite
consistent, implying a strong interaction between the community of each field.
It is also showed that the research of Electronic Engineering and Industrial or
Commercial applications are very active in California. Japan is also publishing
a lot of papers in robotics. Due to the limitation of data source, the result
might be overly influenced by the number of published articles, which is to our
best improved by applying network keynode analysis on the research community
instead of merely count the number of publish.
