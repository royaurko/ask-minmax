We analyze the anonymous communication patterns of 2.5 million customers of a
Belgian mobile phone operator. Grouping customers by billing address, we build
a social network of cities, that consists of communications between 571 cities
in Belgium. We show that inter-city communication intensity is characterized by
a gravity model: the communication intensity between two cities is proportional
to the product of their sizes divided by the square of their distance.
