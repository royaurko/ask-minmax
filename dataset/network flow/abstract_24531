Caching is emerging as a vital tool for alleviating the severe capacity
crunch in modern content-centric wireless networks. The main idea behind
caching is to store parts of popular content in end-users' memory and leverage
the locally stored content to reduce peak data rates. By jointly designing
content placement and delivery mechanisms, recent works have shown order-wise
reduction in transmission rates in contrast to traditional methods. In this
work, we consider the secure caching problem with the additional goal of
minimizing information leakage to an external wiretapper. The fundamental cache
memory vs. transmission rate trade-off for the secure caching problem is
characterized. Rather surprisingly, these results show that security can be
introduced at a negligible cost, particularly for large number of files and
users. It is also shown that the rate achieved by the proposed caching scheme
with secure delivery is within a constant multiplicative factor from the
information-theoretic optimal rate for almost all parameter values of practical
interest.
