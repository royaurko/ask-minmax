We present the interactive Java-based open-source traffic simulator available
at www.traffic-simulation.de. In contrast to most closed-source commercial
simulators, the focus is on investigating fundamental issues of traffic
dynamics rather than simulating specific road networks. This includes testing
theories for the spatiotemporal evolution of traffic jams, comparing and
testing different microscopic traffic models, modeling the effects of driving
styles and traffic rules on the efficiency and stability of traffic flow, and
investigating novel ITS technologies such as adaptive cruise control,
inter-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure communication.
