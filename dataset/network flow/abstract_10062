The description of almost periodic or quasiperiodic structures has a long
tradition in mathematical physics, in particular since the discovery of
quasicrystals in the early 80's. Frequently, the modelling of such structures
leads to different types of dynamical systems which include, depending on the
concept of quasiperiodicity being considered, skew products over quasiperiodic
or almost-periodic base flows, mathematical quasicrystals or maps of the real
line with almost-periodic displacement. An important problem in this context is
to know whether the considered system is semiconjugate to a rigid translation.
We solve this question in a general setting that includes all the
above-mentioned examples and also allows to treat scalar differential equations
that are almost-periodic both in space and time. To that end, we study a
certain class of flows that preserve a one-dimensional foliation and show that
a semiconjugacy to a minimal translation flow exists if and only if a
boundedness condition, concerning the distance of orbits of the flow to those
of the translation, holds.
