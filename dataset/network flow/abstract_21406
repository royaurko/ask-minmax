We briefly discuss the status of the intermittency hypothesis, according to
which the grand minima type variability in solar-type stars may be understood
in terms of dynamical intermittency. We review concrete examples which
establish this hypothesis in the mean-field setting. We discuss some
difficulties and open problems regarding the establishment of this hypothesis
in more realistic settings as well as its operationally decidability.
