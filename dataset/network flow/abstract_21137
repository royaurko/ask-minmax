In this paper we present a rule based formalism for filtering variables
domains of constraints. This formalism is well adapted for solving dynamic CSP.
We take diagnosis as an instance problem to illustrate the use of these rules.
A diagnosis problem is seen like finding all the minimal sets of constraints to
be relaxed in the constraint network that models the device to be diagnosed
