We investigate a prototypical agent-based model, the Naming Game, on
two-dimensional random geometric networks. The Naming Game [A. Baronchelli et
al., J. Stat. Mech.: Theory Exp. (2006) P06014.] is a minimal model, employing
local communications that captures the emergence of shared communication
schemes (languages) in a population of autonomous semiotic agents. Implementing
the Naming Games with local broadcasts on random geometric graphs, serves as a
model for agreement dynamics in large-scale, autonomously operating wireless
sensor networks. Further, it captures essential features of the scaling
properties of the agreement process for spatially-embedded autonomous agents.
Among the relevant observables capturing the temporal properties of the
agreement process, we investigate the cluster-size distribution and the
distribution of the agreement times, both exhibiting dynamic scaling. We also
present results for the case when a small density of long-range communication
links are added on top of the random geometric graph, resulting in a
"small-world"-like network and yielding a significantly reduced time to reach
global agreement. We construct a finite-size scaling analysis for the agreement
times in this case.
