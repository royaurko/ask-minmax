This paper answers an open question of Chen, Doty, and Soloveichik [1], who
showed that a function f:N^k --> N^l is deterministically computable by a
stochastic chemical reaction network (CRN) if and only if the graph of f is a
semilinear subset of N^{k+l}. That construction crucially used "leaders": the
ability to start in an initial configuration with constant but non-zero counts
of species other than the k species X_1,...,X_k representing the input to the
function f. The contributors asked whether deterministic CRNs without a leader
retain the same power.
  We answer this question affirmatively, showing that every semilinear function
is deterministically computable by a CRN whose initial configuration contains
only the input species X_1,...,X_k, and zero counts of every other species. We
show that this CRN completes in expected time O(n), where n is the total number
of input molecules. This time bound is slower than the O(log^5 n) achieved in
[1], but faster than the O(n log n) achieved by the direct construction of [1]
(Theorem 4.1 in the latest online version of [1]), since the fast construction
of that paper (Theorem 4.4) relied heavily on the use of a fast, error-prone
CRN that computes arbitrary computable functions, and which crucially uses a
leader.
