Blue phases (BPs) are liquid crystals made up by networks of defects, or
disclination lines. While existing phase diagrams show a striking variety of
competing metastable topologies for these networks, very little is known as to
how to kinetically reach a target structure, or how to switch from one to the
other, which is of paramount importance for devices. We theoretically identify
two confined blue phase I systems in which by applying an appropriate series of
electric field it is possible to select one of two bistable defect patterns.
Our results may be used to realise new generation and fast switching
energy-saving bistable devices in ultrathin surface treated BPI wafers.
