Using simulations and a simple mean-field theory, we investigate jamming
transitions in a two-species lattice gas under non-equilibrium steady-state
conditions. The two types of particles diffuse with different mobilities on a
square lattice, subject to an excluded volume constraint and biased in opposite
directions. Varying filling fraction, differential mobility, and drive, we map
out the phase diagram, identifying first order and continuous transitions
between a free-flowing disordered and a spatially inhomogeneous jammed phase.
Ordered structures are observed to drift, with a characteristic velocity, in
the direction of the more mobile species.
