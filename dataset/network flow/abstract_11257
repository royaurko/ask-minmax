Many emerging applications in mobile adhoc networks involve group-oriented
communication. Multicast is an efficient way of supporting group oriented
applications, mainly in mobile environment with limited bandwidth and limited
power. For using such applications in an adversarial environment as military,
it is necessary to provide secure multicast communication. Key management is
the fundamental challenge in designing secure multicast communications. In many
multicast interactions, new member can join and current members can leave at
any time and existing members must communicate securely using multicast key
distribution within constrained energy for mobile adhoc networks. This has to
overcome the challenging element of "1 affects n" problem which is due to high
dynamicity of groups. Thus this paper shows the specific challenges towards
multicast key management protocols for securing multicast key distribution in
mobile ad hoc networks, and present relevant multicast key management protocols
in mobile ad hoc networks. A comparison is done against some pertinent
performance criteria.
