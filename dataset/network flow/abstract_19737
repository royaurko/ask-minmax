Numerical simulations are made for forced turbulence at a sequence of
increasing values of Reynolds number, R, keeping fixed a strongly stable,
volume-mean density stratification. At smaller values of R, the turbulent
velocity is mainly horizontal, and the momentum balance is approximately
cyclostrophic and hydrostatic. This is a regime dominated by so-called pancake
vortices, with only a weak excitation of internal gravity waves and large
values of the local Richardson number, Ri, everywhere. At higher values of R
there are successive transitions to (a) overturning motions with local
reversals in the density stratification and small or negative values of Ri; (b)
growth of a horizontally uniform vertical shear flow component; and (c) growth
of a large-scale vertical flow component. Throughout these transitions, pancake
vortices continue to dominate the large-scale part of the turbulence, and the
gravity wave component remains weak except at small scales.
