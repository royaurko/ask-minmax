The spectral flow in the cores of moving dislocations is found to play an
important role in the dynamics and transport of charge density wave (CDW) by
significantly modifying the hydrodynamic effective action of the condensate.
The analogy of spectral flow in CDW with the baryogenesis in the early universe
is pointed out.
