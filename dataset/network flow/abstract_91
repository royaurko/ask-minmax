Cardinality Maximum Flow Network Interdiction Problem (CMFNIP) is known to be
strongly NP-hard problem in the literature. A particular case of CMFNIP has
been shown to have reduction from clique problem. In the present work,an effort
is being made to solve this particular case of CMFNIP in polynomial time.
Direct implication of this solution is that the clique problem gets solved in
polynomial time. 3-CNF Satisfiability and Vertex Cover problems, having
reductions to and from the Clique Problem respectively, are also being solved
in polynomial time by same algorithm. The obvious conclusion of the work is P =
NP.
