We present a universal relation between the flow of a Renyi entropy and the
full counting statistics of energy transfers. We prove the exact relation for a
flow to a system in thermal equilibrium that is weakly coupled to an arbitrary
time-dependent and non-equilibrium system. The exact correspondence, given by
this relation, provides a simple protocol to quantify the flows of Shannon and
Renyi entropies from the measurements of energy transfer statistics.
