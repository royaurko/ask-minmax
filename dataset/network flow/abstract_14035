Spectral and Temporal properties of black hole candidates can be explained
reasonably well using Chakrabarti-Titarchuk solution of two component advective
flow (TCAF). This model requires two accretion rates, namely, the Keplerian
disk accretion rate and the halo accretion rate, the latter being composed of a
sub-Keplerian, low angular momentum flow which may or may not develop a shock.
In this solution, the relevant parameter is the relative importance of the halo
(which creates the Compton cloud region) rate with respect to the Keplerian
disk rate (soft photon source). Though this model has been used earlier to
manually fit data of several black hole candidates quite satisfactorily, for
the first time, we made it user friendly by implementing it into XSPEC software
of GSFC/NASA. This enables any user to extract physical parameters of the
accretion flows, such as two accretion rates, the shock location, the shock
strength etc. for any black hole candidate. We provide some examples of fitting
a few cases using this model. Most importantly, unlike any other model, we show
that TCAF is capable of predicting timing properties from the spectral fits,
since in TCAF, a shock is responsible for deciding spectral slopes as well as
QPO frequencies.
