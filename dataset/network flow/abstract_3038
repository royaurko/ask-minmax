In this paper we study the household-structure SIS epidemic spreading on
general complex networks. The household structure gives us the way to
distinguish inner and the outer infection rate. Unlike household-structure
models on homogenous networks, such as regular and random networks, here we
consider heterogeneous networks with arbitrary degree distribution p(k). First
we introduce the epidemic model. Then rate equations under mean field
appropriation and computer simulations are used here to analyze our model. Some
unique phenomena only existing in divergent network with household structure is
found, while we also get some similar conclusions that some simple geometrical
quantities of networks have important impression on infection property of
infectous disease. It seems that in our model even when local cure rate is
greater than inner infection rate in every household, disease still can spread
on scale-free network. It implies that no disease is spreading in every single
household, but for the whole network, disease is spreading. Since our society
network seems like this structure, maybe this conclusion remind us that during
disease spreading we should pay more attention on network structure than local
cure condition.
