A first principle explanation of the origin of intermittency and nonlinear
structure formation in the Lagrangian velocity increments of a turbulent flow
is presented in the context of a scale invariant analytical formalism that is
being developed recently. The copious generation of power laws and nonlinear
exponents in the structure functions are shown to follow quite naturally in the
present formalism.
