Enabling real time applications in wireless sensor networks requires certain
delay and bandwidth which pose more challenges in the design of routing
protocols. The algorithm that is used for packet routing in such applications
should be able to establish a tradeoff between end to end delay parameter and
energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a new multi path routing
algorithm for real time applications in wireless sensor networks namely QEMPAR
which is QoS aware and can increase the network lifetime. Simulation results
show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than previous algorithms in
providing quality of service requirements of real-time applications.
