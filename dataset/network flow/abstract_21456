In the turbulent boundary layer above a flat plate, the velocity profile is
known to have the form v=v_0[(1/\kappa) ln z + constant]. The distance from the
wall in dimensionless units is z and v_0 is an uniquely defined velocity scale.
The number \kappa is universal and measurements over several decades have shown
that it is nearly 0.42. We use a randomly stirred model of turbulence to derive
the above law and find \kappa=\sqrt{\frac{108} {125 \pi}} \simeq 0.52.
