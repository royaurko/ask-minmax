Our work becomes integrated into the general problem of the stability of the
network ad hoc. Some, works attacked (affected) this problem. Among these
works, we find the modelling of the network ad hoc in the form of a graph. We
can resume the problem of coherence of the network ad hoc of a problem of
allocation of frequency We study a new class of graphs, the fat-extended P4
graphs, and we give a polynomial time algorithm to calculate the Grundy number
of the graphs in this class. This result implies that the Grundy number can be
found in polynomial time for many graphs
