Decoupling the permanent identifier of a node from the node's
topology-dependent address is a promising approach toward completely scalable
self-organizing networks. A group of proposals that have adopted such an
approach use the same structure to: address nodes, perform routing, and
implement location service. In this way, the consistency of the routing
protocol relies on the coherent sharing of the addressing space among all nodes
in the network. Such proposals use a logical tree-like structure where routes
in this space correspond to routes in the physical level. The advantage of
tree-like spaces is that it allows for simple address assignment and
management. Nevertheless, it has low route selection flexibility, which results
in low routing performance and poor resilience to failures. In this paper, we
propose to increase the number of paths using incomplete hypercubes. The design
of more complex structures, like multi-dimensional Cartesian spaces, improves
the resilience and routing performance due to the flexibility in route
selection. We present a framework for using hypercubes to implement indirect
routing. This framework allows to give a solution adapted to the dynamics of
the network, providing a proactive and reactive routing protocols, our major
contributions. We show that, contrary to traditional approaches, our proposal
supports more dynamic networks and is more robust to node failures.
