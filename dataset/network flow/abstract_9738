Network analysis has emerged as a key technique in communication studies,
economics, geography, history and sociology, among others. A fundamental issue
is how to identify key nodes in a network, for which purpose a number of
centrality measures have been developed. This paper proposes a new parametric
family of centrality measures called generalized degree. It is based on the
idea that a relationship to a more interconnected node contributes to
centrality in a greater extent than a connection to a less central one.
Generalized degree improves on degree by redistributing its sum over the
network with the consideration of the global structure. Application of the
measure is supported by a set of basic properties. A sufficient condition is
given for generalized degree to be rank monotonic, excluding counter-intuitive
changes in the centrality ranking after certain modifications of the network.
The measure has a graph interpretation and can be calculated iteratively.
Generalized degree is recommended to apply besides degree since it preserves
most favorable attributes of degree, but better reflects the role of the nodes
in the network and has an increased ability to distinguish between their
importance.
