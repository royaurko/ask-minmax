We study the classification of the pairs $(N, \,X)$ where $N$ is a Stein
surface and $X$ is a complete holomorphic vector field with isolated
singularities on $N$. We describe the role of transverse sections in the
classification of $X$ and give necessary and sufficient conditions on $X$ in
order to have $N$ biholomorphic to $\mathbb C^2$. As a sample of our results,
we prove that $N$ is biholomorphic to $\mathbb C^2$ if $H^2(N,\mathbb Z)=0$,
$X$ has a finite number of singularities and exhibits a non-nilpotent
singularity with three separatrices or, equivalently, a singularity with first
jet of the form $\lambda_1 \, x\frac{\partial }{\partial x} + \lambda_2 \,
y\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ where $\lambda_1 / \lambda_2 \in \mathbb Q_+$. We
also study flows with many periodic orbits, in a sense we will make clear,
proving they admit a meromorphic first integral or they exhibit some special
periodic orbit, whose holonomy map is a non-resonant non-linearizable
diffeomorphism map. Finally, we apply our results together with more classical
techniques of holomorphic foliations on algebraic surfaces to study the case of
flows on affine algebraic surfaces. We suppose the flow is generated by an
algebraic vector field. Such flows are then proved, under some undemanding
conditions on the singularities, to be given by closed rational linear
one-forms or admit rational first integrals.
