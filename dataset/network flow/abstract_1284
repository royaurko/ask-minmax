The rapid development and expansion of World Wide Web and network systems
have changed the computing world in the last decade and also equipped the
intruders and hackers with new facilities for their destructive purposes. The
cost of temporary or permanent damages caused by uncontributorized access of the
intruders to computer systems has urged different organizations to increasingly
implement various systems to monitor data flow in their network. The systems
are generally known as Intrusion Detection System (IDS).Our objective is to
implement an artificial network approach to the design of intrusion detection
and prevention system and finally convert the designed model to a VHDL (Very
High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Descriptive Language) code. This feature
enables the system to suggest proper actions against possible attacks. The
promising results of the present study show the potential applicability of ANNs
for developing practical IDSs.
