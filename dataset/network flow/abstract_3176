In this paper, the Turing instability in reaction-diffusion models defined on
complex networks is studied. Here, we focus on three types of models which
generate complex networks, i.e. the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, the Watts-Strogatz and
the threshold network models. From analysis of the Laplacian matrices of graphs
generated by these models, we reveal that the stable-unstable regions of a
spatially homogeneous solution completely differ, depending on network
structures. In particular, we approximately argue the existence of the
stable-unstable regions in the cases of regular enhanced ring lattices which
include regular circles, and networks generated by the threshold network model
when the number of vertices is large enough.
