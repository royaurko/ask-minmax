The dynamics of an extremely diluted neural network with high order synapses
acting as corrections to the Hopfield model is investigated. As in the fully
connected case, the high order terms may strongly improve the storage capacity
of the system. The dynamics displays a very rich behavior, and in particular a
new chaotic phase emerges depending on the weight of the high order connections
$\epsilon$, the noise level $T$ and the network load defined as the rate
between the number of stored patterns and the mean connectivity per neuron
$\alpha =P/C$.
