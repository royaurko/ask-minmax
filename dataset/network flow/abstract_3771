The evaporation of a drop from a liquid subphase is investigated. The two
liquids are immiscible, and the contact angles between them are given by the
Neumann construction. The evaporation of the drop gives rise to flows in both
liquids, which are coupled by the continuity of velocity and shear-stress
conditions. We derive self-similar solutions to the velocity fields in both
liquids close to the three-phase contact line, where the drop geometry can be
approximated by a wedge. We focus on the case where Marangoni stresses are
negligible, for which the flow field consists of three contributions: flow
driven by the evaporative flux from the drop surface, flow induced by the
receding motion of the contact line, and an eigenmode flow that satisfies the
homogeneous boundary conditions. The eigenmode flow is asymptotically
subdominant for all contact angles. The moving contact-line flow dominates when
the angle between the liquid drop and the horizontal surface of the liquid
subphase is smaller than $90^\circ$, while the evaporative-flux driven flow
dominates for larger angles. A parametric study is performed to show how the
velocity fields in the two liquids depend on the contact angles between the
liquids and their viscosity ratio.
