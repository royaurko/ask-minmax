We consider a Klein-Gordon equation (KG) on a Riemannian compact surface, for
which the flow lets invariant the two dimensional space the solutions
independent of the space variable. It turns out that in this invariant space,
there is a homoclinic orbit to the origin, and a family of periodic solutions
inside the loops of the homoclinic orbit. In this paper we study the stability
of these periodic orbits under the (KG) flow, i.e. when turning on the
nonlinear interaction with the non stationary modes. By a shadowing method, we
prove that around the periodic orbits, solutions stay close to them during a
time of order $(\log a)^2$, where $a$ is the distance between the periodic
orbit considered and the homoclinic orbit.
