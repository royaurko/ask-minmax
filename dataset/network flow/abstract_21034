In two recent interesting letters evidence was presented for the existence of
a growing dynamic correlation length when we approach the glass transition from
the liquid phase (a similar divergence is present also in the off-equilibrium
dynamics below $T_c$). Here we would like to point out that this phenomenon can
be easily predicted using the replica approach.
