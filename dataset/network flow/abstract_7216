It is known that the heterogeneity of scale-free networks helps enhancing the
efficiency of trapping processes performed on them. In this paper, we show that
transport efficiency is much lower in a fractal scale-free network than in
non-fractal networks. To this end, we examine a simple random walk with a fixed
trap at a given position on a fractal scale-free network. We calculate
analytically the mean first-passage time (MFPT) as a measure of the efficiency
for the trapping process, and obtain a closed-form expression for MFPT, which
agrees with direct numerical calculations. We find that, in the limit of a
large network order $V$, the MFPT $<T>$ behaves superlinearly as $<T > \sim
V^{{3/2}}$ with an exponent 3/2 much larger than 1, which is in sharp contrast
to the scaling $<T > \sim V^{\theta}$ with $\theta \leq 1$, previously obtained
for non-fractal scale-free networks. Our results indicate that the degree
distribution of scale-free networks is not sufficient to characterize trapping
processes taking place on them. Since various real-world networks are
simultaneously scale-free and fractal, our results may shed light on the
understanding of trapping processes running on real-life systems.
