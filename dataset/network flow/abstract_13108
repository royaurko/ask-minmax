Motivated by recent experimental and numerical results, a simple unifying
picture of intermittency in turbulent shear flows is suggested. Integral
Structure Functions (ISF), taking into account explicitly the shear intensity,
are introduced on phenomenological grounds. ISF can exhibit a universal scaling
behavior, independent of the shear intensity. This picture is in satisfactory
agreement with both experimental and numerical data. Possible extension to
convective turbulence and implication on closure conditions for Large-Eddy
Simulation of non-homogeneous flows are briefly discussed.
