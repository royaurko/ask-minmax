We characterize Maass cusp forms for any cofinite Hecke triangle group as
1-eigenfunctions of appropriate regularity of a transfer operator family. This
transfer operator family is associated to a certain symbolic dynamics for the
geodesic flow on the orbifold arising as the orbit space of the action of the
Hecke triangle group on the hyperbolic plane. Moreover we show that the Selberg
zeta function is the Fredholm determinant of the transfer operator family
associated to an acceleration of this symbolic dynamics.
