We study the risk assessment of uncertain cash flows in terms of dynamic
convex risk measures for processes as introduced in Cheridito, Delbaen, and
Kupper (2006). These risk measures take into account not only the amounts but
also the timing of a cash flow. We discuss their robust representation in terms
of suitably penalized probability measures on the optional sigma-field. This
yields an explicit analysis both of model and discounting ambiguity. We focus
on supermartingale criteria for different notions of time consistency. In
particular we show how bubbles may appear in the dynamic penalization, and how
they cause a breakdown of asymptotic safety of the risk assessment procedure.
