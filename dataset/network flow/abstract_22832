This article proposed spatial scaling laws of the kinetic energy spectrum of
compressible turbulence flow and its mass-weighted counterpart in terms of
wavenumber. The study shown that the compressible turbulence kinetic and the
mass-weighted energy spectrum does not behaves the complete similarity, but
incomplete similarity as in equation (\ref{e15}) and (\ref{e21}), and both
energy spectrum in $k^{-5/3}$ may still be preserved at small scales
($k\eta\rightarrow 0$) for compressible turbulence.
