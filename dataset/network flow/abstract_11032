Emerging mobility standards within the next generation Internet Protocol,
IPv6, promise to continuously operate devices roaming between IP networks.
Associated with the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and communication, network
technology is on the spot to deliver voice and videoconferencing as a standard
internet solution. However, current roaming procedures are too slow, to remain
seamless for real-time applications. Multicast mobility still waits for a
convincing design. This paper investigates the temporal behaviour of mobile
IPv6 with dedicated focus on topological impacts. Extending the hierarchical
mobile IPv6 approach we suggest protocol improvements for a continuous
handover, which may serve bidirectional multicast communication, as well. Along
this line a multicast mobility concept is introduced as a service for clients
and sources, as they are of dedicated importance in multipoint conferencing
applications. The mechanisms introduced do not rely on assumptions of any
specific multicast routing protocol in use.
