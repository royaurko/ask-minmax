Using the spread of the Ice Bucket Challenge on Twitter as a case study, this
research compared the concurrent diffusion patterns of both information and
behaviors in online social networks. Individual behaviors in taking the
Challenge were detected by applying text mining techniques to millions of
tweets. After comparing diffusion dynamics of information and behaviors at the
network level, the individual level, and the dyadic level, our analysis
revealed interesting differences and interactions between the two diffusion
processes and laid foundations for future predictive and prescriptive analytics
for information and behavior diffusion in social networks.
