Some multi-path routing algorithm in MANET, simultaneously send information
to the destination through several directions to reduce end-to-end delay. In
all these algorithms, the sent traffic through a path affects the adjacent path
and unintentionally increases the delay due to the use of adjacent paths.
Because, there are repetitive competitions among neighboring nodes, in order to
obtain the joint channel in adjacent paths. The represented algorithm in this
study tries to discover the distinct paths between source and destination nodes
with using Omni directional antennas, to send information through these
simultaneously. For this purpose, the number of active neighbors is counted in
each direction with using a strategy. These criterions are effectively used to
select routes. Proposed algorithm is based on AODV routing algorithm, and in
the end it is compared with AOMDV, AODVM, and IZM-DSR algorithms which are
multi-path routing algorithms based on AODV and DSR. Simulation results show
that using the proposed algorithm creates a significant improvement in energy
efficiency and reducing end-to-end delay.
