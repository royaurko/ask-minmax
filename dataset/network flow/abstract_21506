We find mode-locking steps in simulated current-voltage characteristics of
ac-driven vortex lattices with {\it random} pinning. For low frequencies there
is mode-locking above a finite ac force amplitude, while for large frequencies
there is mode-locking for any small ac force. This is correlated with the
nature of temporal order in the different regimes in the absence of ac drive.
The mode-locked state is a frozen solid pinned in the moving reference of
frame, and the depinning from the step shows plastic flow and hysteresis.
