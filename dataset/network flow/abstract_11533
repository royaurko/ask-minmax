Till today we dreamt of imperceptible delay in a network. The computer
science research grows today faster than ever offering more and more services
(computational representational, graphical, intelligent implication etc) to its
user. But the problem lies in "greater the volume of services greater the
problem of delay". So tracing delay, or performance analysis focusing on time
required for computation, in a existing or newly configured network is
necessary to conclude the improvement. In this paper, we have done the job of
delay analysis in a multi-server system,. For this proposed work we have used
continuous -parameter Markov chains (Non -Birth -Death Process),for developing
the required models, and for developing the simulator we have used queuing
networking, different scheduling algorithms at the servers queue and process
scheduling . The work can be further extended to test the performance of
wireless domain.
