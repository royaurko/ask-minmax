Constructing a connected dominating set as the virtual backbone plays an
important role in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose two novel
approximate algorithms for dominating set and connected dominating set in
wireless networks, respectively. Both of the algorithms are based on edge
dominating capability which is a novel notion proposed in this paper.
Simulations show that each of proposed algorithm has good performance
especially in dense wireless networks .
