We present a theory for self-driven fluids, such as motorized cytoskeletal
extracts or bacterial suspensions, that takes into account the underlying
periodic duty cycle carried by the active particles of which the system is
composed. We show that the fluid can enter a state in which the constituent
elements synchronize their phases. This spontaneous breaking of
time-translation invariance gives rise to flow instabilities distinct from
those arising in phase-incoherent active matter.
