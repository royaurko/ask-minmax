The electrolyte (comprising of solute ions and solvents) flow-through the
porous media is frequently encountered in nature or in many engineering
applications, such as the electrochemical systems, manufacturing of composites,
oil production, geothermal engineering, nuclear thermal disposal, soil
pollution. Our previous work derived the interfacial interaction terms between
the solid and the fluid, which can be used to investigate the details of
transports of mass, heat, electric flied, potential, or momentum in the process
of the electrochemical flows-through porous electrode. In this work, we
establish the closure models for these interfacial interaction terms to close
the governing equations from mathematical algebra. The interfacial interaction
terms regard to the electric field, potential and electric force are firstly
revealed. Our new theory provides a new approach to describe the
electrochemical flows-through porous media.
