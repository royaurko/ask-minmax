We study coherent structures in solar photospheric flows in a plage in the
vicinity of the active region AR 10930 using the horizontal velocity data
derived from Hinode/SOT magnetograms. Eulerian and Lagrangian coherent
structures are detected by computing the Q-criterion and the finite-time
Lyapunov exponents of the velocity field, respectively. Our analysis indicates
that, on average, the deformation Eulerian coherent structures dominate over
the vortical Eulerian coherent structures in the plage region. We demonstrate
the correspondence of the network of high magnetic flux concentration to the
attracting Lagrangian coherent structures (a-LCS) in the photospheric velocity
based on both observations and numerical simulations. In addition, the
computation of a-LCS provides a measure of the local rate of
contraction/expansion of the flow.
