The azimuthal anisotropy of charged particles in heavy ion collisions is an
important probe of quark-gluon plasma evolution at early stages. In the present
paper the elliptic flow pattern in Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt{s}=5.5 TeV is
analyzed for different hadron species in the frameworks of HYDJET++ Monte-Carlo
model. The influence of resonance decays on particle flow is investigated. The
different methods of elliptic flow reconstruction are compared under LHC
conditions.
