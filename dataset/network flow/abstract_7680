A manifold $M$ is locally conformally Kahler if it admits a Kahler covering
with monodromy acting by holomorphic homotheties. Let $M$ be an LCK manifold
admitting a holomorphic conformal flow of diffeomorphisms, lifted to a
non-isometric homothetic flow on the covering. We show that $M$ admits an
automorphic potential, and the monodromy group of its conformal weight bundle
is $\Z$.
