Internet evolves and operates largely without a central coordination, the
lack of which was and is critically important to the rapid growth and evolution
of Internet. However, the lack of management in turn makes it very difficult to
guarantee proper performance and to deal systematically with performance
problems. Meanwhile, the available network bandwidth and server capacity
continue to be overwhelmed by the skyrocketing Internet utilization and the
accelerating growth of bandwidth intensive content. As a result, Internet
service quality perceived by customers is largely unpredictable and
unsatisfactory. Content Distribution Network (CDN) is an effective approach to
improve Internet service quality. CDN replicates the content from the place of
origin to the replica servers scattered over the Internet and serves a request
from a replica server close to where the request originates. In this paper, we
first give an overview about CDN. We then present the critical issues involved
in designing and implementing an effective CDN and survey the approaches
proposed in literature to address these problems. An example of CDN is
described to show how a real commercial CDN operates. After this, we present a
scheme that provides fast service location for peer-to-peer systems, a special
type of CDN with no infrastructure support. We conclude with a brief projection
about CDN.
