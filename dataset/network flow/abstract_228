By exploring a local geometric property of the vorticity field along a vortex
filament, we establish a sharp relationship between the geometric properties of
the vorticity field and the maximum vortex stretching. This new understanding
leads to an improved result of the global existence of the 3-D Euler equation
under mild assumptions that are consistent with the observations from recent
numerical computations.
