We here present a fixed agents version of an original model of the emergence
of hierarchies among social agents first introduced by Bonabeau \textit{et al}.
Having interactions occurring on a social network rather than among 'walkers'
doesn't drastically alter the dynamics. But it makes social structures more
stable and give a clearer picture of the social organisation in a `mixed'
regime.
