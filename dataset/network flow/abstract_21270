Bloch oscillations (BO) in complex lattices with PT symmetry are
theoretically investigated with specific reference to optical BO in photonic
lattices with gain/loss regions. Novel dynamical phenomena with no counterpart
in ordinary lattices, such as non-reciprocal BO related to violation of the
Friedel's law of Bragg scattering in complex potentials, are highlighted.
