Many natural and engineered complex networks have intricate mesoscopic
organization, e.g., the clustering of the constituent nodes into several
communities or modules. Often, such modularity is manifested at several
different hierarchical levels, where the clusters defined at one level appear
as elementary entities at the next higher level. Using a simple model of a
hierarchical modular network, we show that such a topological structure gives
rise to characteristic time-scale separation between dynamics occurring at
different levels of the hierarchy. This generalizes our earlier result for
simple modular networks, where fast intra-modular and slow inter-modular
processes were clearly distinguished. Investigating the process of
synchronization of oscillators in a hierarchical modular network, we show the
existence of as many distinct time-scales as there are hierarchical levels in
the system. This suggests a possible functional role of such mesoscopic
organization principle in natural systems, viz., in the dynamical separation of
events occurring at different spatial scales.
