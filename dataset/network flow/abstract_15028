We propose an explicit rate indication scheme for congestion avoidance in ATM
networks. In this scheme, the network switches monitor their load on each link,
determining a load factor, the available capacity, and the number of currently
active virtual channels. This information is used to advise the sources about
the rates at which they should transmit. The algorithm is designed to achieve
efficiency, fairness, controlled queueing delays, and fast transient response.
The algorithm is also robust to measurement errors caused due to variation in
ABR demand and capacity. We present performance analysis of the scheme using
both analytical arguments and simulation results. The scheme is being
implemented by several ATM switch manufacturers.
