Captures of IP traffic contain much information on very different kinds of
activities like file transfers, users interacting with remote systems,
automatic backups, or distributed computations. Identifying such activities is
crucial for an appropriate analysis, modeling and monitoring of the traffic. We
propose here a notion of density that captures both temporal and structural
features of interactions, and generalizes the classical notion of clustering
coefficient. We use it to point out important differences between distinct
parts of the traffic, and to identify interesting nodes and groups of nodes in
terms of roles in the network.
