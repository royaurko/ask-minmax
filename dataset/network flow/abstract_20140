This paper presents a new formulation for trailing edge noise radiation from
rotating blades based on an analytical solution of the convective wave
equation. It accounts for distributed loading and the effect of mean flow and
spanwise wavenumber. A commonly used theory due to Schlinker and Amiet (1981)
predicts trailing edge noise radiation from rotating blades. However, different
versions of the theory exist; it is not known which version is the correct one
and what the range of validity of the theory is. This paper addresses both
questions by deriving Schlinker and Amiet's theory in a simple way and by
comparing it to the new formulation, using model blade elements representative
of a wind turbine, a cooling fan and an aircraft propeller. The correct form of
Schlinker and Amiet's theory (1981) is identified. It is valid at high enough
frequency, i.e. for a Helmholtz number relative to chord greater than one and a
rotational frequency much smaller than the angular frequency of the noise
sources.
