An analytic theory of species abundance patterns (SAPs) in biological
networks is presented. The theory is based on multispecies replicator dynamics
equivalent to the Lotka-Volterra equation, with diverse interspecies
interactions. Various SAPs observed in nature are derived from a single
parameter. The abundance distribution is formed like a widely observed
left-skewed lognormal distribution. As the model has a general form, the result
can be applied to similar patterns in other complex biological networks, e.g.
gene expression.
