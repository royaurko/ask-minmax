In the present work, we illustrate the process of constructing a simplified
model for complex multi-scale combustion systems. To this end, reduced models
of homogeneous ideal gas mixtures of methane and air are first obtained by the
novel Relaxation Redistribution Method (RRM) and thereafter used for the
extraction of all the missing variables in a reactive flow simulation with a
global reaction model.
