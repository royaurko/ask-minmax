We use a novel global helioseismic analysis method to infer the meridional
flow in the deep Solar interior. The method is based on the perturbation of
eigenfunctions of Solar p modes due to meridional flow. We apply this method to
time series obtained from Dopplergrams measured by the Michelson Doppler Imager
aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) covering the observation
period 2004-2010. Our results show evidence that the meridional flow reaches
down to the base of the convection zone. The flow profile has a complex spatial
structure consisting of multiple flow cells distributed in depth and latitude.
Toward the Solar surface, our results are in good agreement with flow
measurements from local helioseismology.
