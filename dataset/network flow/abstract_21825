Using the Bailey flow construction, we derive character identities for the
N=1 superconformal models SM(p',2p+p') and SM(p',3p'-2p), and the N=2
superconformal model with central charge c=3(1-2p/p') from the nonunitary
minimal models M(p,p'). A new Ramond sector character formula for
representations of N=2 superconformal algebras with central element
c=3(1-2p/p') is given.
