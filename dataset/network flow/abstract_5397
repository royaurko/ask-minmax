A vast variety of biological, social, and economical networks shows
topologies drastically differing from random graphs; yet the quantitative
characterization remains unsatisfactory from a conceptual point of view.
Motivated from the discussion of small scale-free networks, a biased link
distribution entropy is defined, which takes an extremum for a power law
distribution. This approach is extended to the node-node link
cross-distribution, whose nondiagonal elements characterize the graph structure
beyond link distribution, cluster coefficient and average path length. From
here a simple (and computationally cheap) complexity measure can be defined.
This Offdiagonal Complexity (OdC) is proposed as a novel measure to
characterize the complexity of an undirected graph, or network. While both for
regular lattices and fully connected networks OdC is zero, it takes a
moderately low value for a random graph and shows high values for apparently
complex structures as scale-free networks and hierarchical trees. The
Offdiagonal Complexity apporach is applied to the Helicobacter pylori protein
interaction network and randomly rewired surrogates.
