Using families of curves to generalize vector fields, the Lie bracket is
defined on a metric space, M. For M complete, versions of the local and global
Frobenius theorems hold, and flows are shown to commute if and only if their
bracket is zero. An example is given showing separable Hilbert space (the set
of square integrable functions on R) is controllable by two elementary flows.
