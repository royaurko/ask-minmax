We review our studies of elastic lattices driven by an external force $F$ in
the presence of random disorder, which correspond to the case of vortices in
superconducting thin films driven by external currents. Above a critical force
$F_c$ we find two dynamical phase transitions at $F_p$ and $F_t$, with
$F_c<F_p<F_t$. At $F_p$ there is a transition from plastic flow to smectic flow
where the noise is isotropic and there is a peak in the differential
resistance. At $F_t$ there is a sharp transition to a frozen transverse solid
where both the transverse noise and the diffussion fall down abruptly and
therefore the vortex motion is localized in the transverse direction. From a
generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation we calculate an effective
transverse temperature in the fluid moving phases. We find that the effective
temperature decreases with increasing driving force and becomes equal to the
equilibrium melting temperature when the dynamic transverse freezing occurs.
