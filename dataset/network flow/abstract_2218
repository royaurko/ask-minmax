We extend the concept of graph isomorphisms to multilayer networks with any
number of "aspects" (i.e., types of layering), and we identify multiple types
of isomorphisms. For example, in multilayer networks with a single aspect,
permuting vertex labels, layer labels, and both vertex labels and layer labels
each yield different isomorphism relations between multilayer networks.
Multilayer network isomorphisms lead naturally to defining isomorphisms in any
of the numerous types of network that can be represented as a multilayer
network, and we thereby obtain isomorphisms for multiplex networks, temporal
networks, networks with both of these features, and more. We reduce each of the
multilayer network isomorphism problems to a graph isomorphism problem such
that the size of the graph isomorphism problem grows linearly with the size of
the multilayer network isomorphism problem. One can thus use software that has
been developed to solve graph isomorphism problems as a practical means for
solving multilayer network isomorphism problems. Our theory lays a foundation
for extending many network analysis methods such as motifs, graphlets,
structural roles, and network alignment to any multilayer network.
