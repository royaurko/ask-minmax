We prove two results about nonunital index theory left open by [CGRS2]. The
first is that the spectral triple arising from an action of the reals on a
C*-algebra with invariant trace satisfies the hypotheses of the nonunital local
index formula. The second result concerns the meaning of spectral flow in the
nonunital case. For the special case of paths arising from the odd index
pairing for smooth spectral triples in the nonunital setting we are able to
connect with earlier approaches to the analytic definition of spectral flow.
