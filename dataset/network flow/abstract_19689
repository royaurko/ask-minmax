A multi-scale model for the evolution of the velocity gradient tensor in
fully developed turbulence is proposed. The model is based on a coupling
between a ``Restricted Euler'' dynamics [{\it P. Vieillefosse, Physica A, {\bf
14}, 150 (1984)}] which describes gradient self-stretching, and a deterministic
cascade model which allows for energy exchange between different scales. We
show that inclusion of the cascade process is sufficient to regularize the
well-known finite time singularity of the Restricted Euler dynamics. At the
same time, the model retains topological and geometrical features of real
turbulent flows: these include the alignment between vorticity and the
intermediate eigenvector of the strain-rate tensor and the typical teardrop
shape of the joint probability density between the two invariants, $R-Q$, of
the gradient tensor. The model also possesses skewed, non-Gaussian longitudinal
gradient fluctuations and the correct scaling of energy dissipation as a
function of Reynolds number. Derivative flatness coefficients are in good
agreement with experimental data.
