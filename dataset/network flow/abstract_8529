Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) is a subclass of Mobile ad hoc networks
which provides a distinguished approach for Intelligent Transport System (ITS).
The survey of routing protocols in VANET is important and necessary for smart
ITS. This paper discusses the advantages / disadvantages and the applications
of various routing protocols for vehicular ad hoc networks. It explores the
motivation behind the designed, and traces the evolution of these routing
protocols. F inally the paper concludes by a tabular comparison of the various
routing protocols for VANET.
