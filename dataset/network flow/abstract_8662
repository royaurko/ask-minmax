We investigate the impact of degree-degree correlations on the spectra of
networks. Even though density distributions exhibit drastic changes depending
on the (dis)assortative mixing and the network architecture, the short range
correlations in eigenvalues exhibit universal RMT predictions. The long range
correlations turn out to be a measure of randomness in (dis)assortative
networks. The analysis further provides insight in to the origin of high
degeneracy at the zero eigenvalue displayed by majority of the biological
networks.
