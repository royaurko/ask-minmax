Multifractal properties of a tracer density passively advected by a
compressible random velocity field are characterized. A relationship is
established between the statistical properties of mass on the dynamical fractal
attractor towards which the trajectories converge and large deviations of the
stretching rates of the flow. In the framework of the compressible Kraichnan
model, this result is illustrated by analytical calculations and confirmed by
numerical simulations.
