In thin magnetic layers with structural inversion asymmetry and spin-orbit
coupling, a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction arises at the interface. When a
spin wave current ${\bf j}_m$ flows in a system with a homogeneous
magnetization {\bf m}, this interaction produces an effective field-like torque
on the form ${\bf T}_{\rm FL}\propto{\bf m}\times({\bf z}\times{\bf j}_m)$ as
well as a damping-like torque, ${\bf T}_{\rm DL}\propto{\bf m}\times[({\bf
z}\times{\bf j}_m)\times{\bf m}]$ in the presence of spin-wave relaxation
(${\bf z}$ is normal to the interface). These torques mediated by the magnon
flow can reorient the time-averaged magnetization direction and display a
number of similarities with the torques arising from the electron flow in a
magnetic two dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. This
magnon-mediated spin-orbit torque can be efficient in the case of magnons
driven by a thermal gradient.
