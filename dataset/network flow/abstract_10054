Around 1930 Ludwig Prandtl and his colleagues O. Tietjens and W. M\"uller
published two films with visualizations of flows around surface piercing
obstacles to illustrate the unsteady process of flow separation. These
visualizations were achieved by recording the motion of fine particles
sprinkled onto the water surface in water channels. The resulting images meet
the relevant criteria of properly seeded recordings for particle image
velocimetry (PIV). Processing these image sequences with modern PIV algorithms
allows the visualization of flow quantities (e.g. vorticity) that were
unavailable prior to the development of the PIV technique. The accompanying
fluid dynamics video consists of selected original film sequences overlaid with
visualizations obtained through PIV processing.
