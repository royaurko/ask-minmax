We report new radio imaging of the large scale radio structure of M87 with
the VLA at 90 cm. These new images show the complex structure of the radio
emission more clearly than previous attempts, some of which date back to the
1940's. The images suggest that the outward flow from the M87 nucleus extends
well beyond the 2 kpc jet. Two ``bubbles'' of synchrotron emission appear to be
inflated by this flow. A simple model of the emission, combined with our
knowledge of the inner jet, suggests that the energy input into this region
from the M87 nucleus exceeds the energy being radiated away as X-rays. This
argues that the region within 40 kpc of the center of M87 is currently
dominated by energy input from the M87 nucleus. The gas in the region is
expanding, not flowing inward as is envisioned in the cooling flow model.
