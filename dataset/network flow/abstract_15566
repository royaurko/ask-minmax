The successful deployment of LTE heterogeneous networks (HetNets) depends
crucially on the inter-cell interference (ICI) management. Among ICI
coordination schemes, fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is considered as an
efficient technique well-suited to OFDMA-based HetNets. Two coupled questions
in this context are: 1) how to associate users to appropriate base-stations
considering the long list of available candidate cells, and 2) how to allocate
frequency resources among multiple cells. In this paper, we treat the
multi-cell frequency allocation as frequency partitioning among multiple reuse
patterns, and develop a novel algorithm to solve these two coupled questions in
a joint manner. We also provide practical criterion to select the set of
essential candidate patterns from all possible patterns. Results show that the
proposed joint strategy improves both the cell-edge user and overall network
throughput.
