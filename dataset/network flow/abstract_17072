We discuss a fast cross-Wigner transform based technique for detecting
gravitational wave bursts, and estimating the direction of arrival, using a
network of (three) non co-located interferometric detectors. The performances
of the detector as a function of signal strength and source location, and the
accuracy of the direction of arrival estimation are investigated by numerical
simulations.
