Delay tolerant network (DTN) is opportunistic network where each node
searches best opportunity to deliver the message called bundle to the
destination. DTN implements a store and forward message switching system by
simply introducing another new protocol layer called the Bundle Layer on top of
the transport layer. The bundle layer is responsible for storing and forwarding
entire message in message segments called bundles between source node and
destination node. This paper evaluates the performance of delay tolerant
network layer in heterogeneous highly dense mobile node environment. The
heterogeneous network is created with the help of stationary wired node and
Base Station node by introducing dynamic dense Mobile node network. Mobile
nodes are assigned with continuous mobility. Three parameters are suggested
$\Delta$, $\Theta$ and $\lambda$ to correlate the results obtained using
rigorous simulation. Results show that after some threshold values, dense
feature about mobile node does not pretend the delay cause for delay tolerant
network packets. Also, increase in number of mobile node and number of File
Transfer connection rarely change the overall performance of the delay tolerant
network.
