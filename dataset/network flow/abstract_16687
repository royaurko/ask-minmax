Decentralized search aims to find the target node in a large network by using
only local information. The applications of it include peer-to-peer file
sharing, web search and anything else that requires locating a specific target
in a complex system. In this paper, we examine the degree-based decentralized
search method. Specifically, we evaluate the efficiency of the method in
different cases with different amounts of available local information. In
addition, we propose a simple refinement algorithm for significantly shortening
the length of the route that has been found. Some insights useful for the
future developments of efficient decentralized search schemes have been
achieved.
