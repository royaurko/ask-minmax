It is well known that opportunistic scheduling algorithms are throughput
optimal under full knowledge of channel and network conditions. However, these
algorithms achieve a hypothetical achievable rate region which does not take
into account the overhead associated with channel probing and feedback required
to obtain the full channel state information at every slot. We adopt a channel
probing model where $\beta$ fraction of time slot is consumed for acquiring the
channel state information (CSI) of a single channel. In this work, we design a
joint scheduling and channel probing algorithm named SDF by considering the
overhead of obtaining the channel state information. We first analytically
prove SDF algorithm can support $1+\epsilon$ fraction of of the full rate
region achieved when all users are probed where $\epsilon$ depends on the
expected number of users which are not probed. Then, for homogenous channel, we
show that when the number of users in the network is greater than 3, $\epsilon
> 0$, i.e., we guarantee to expand the rate region. In addition, for
heterogenous channels, we prove the conditions under which SDF guarantees to
increase the rate region. We also demonstrate numerically in a realistic
simulation setting that this rate region can be achieved by probing only less
than 50% of all channels in a CDMA based cellular network utilizing high data
rate protocol under normal channel conditions.
