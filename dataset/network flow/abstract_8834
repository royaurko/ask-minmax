We find analytical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation for the flow of an
incompressible, Newtonian fluid through a porous medium in channels with a
rectangular and a circular cross section. Nield and others have developed an
analytical solution for the first case. We express it in an equivalent but a
more conventional form. In the second case, we find an exact solution when then
Forchheimer term can be ignored and approximate solution when it cannot be
ignored.
