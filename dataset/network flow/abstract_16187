Simultaneous diffusive and inertial motion of Brownian particles in laminar
Couette flow is investigated via Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions to
determine the effect of particle inertia on diffusive transport in the
long-time. The classical fluctuation dissipation theorem is used to calculate
the amplitude of random-force correlations, thereby neglecting corrections of
the order of the molecular relaxation time to the inverse shear rate. The
analytic, non-perturbative, evaluation of the particle-phase total pressure,
which is calculated to be second order in the Stokes number (a dimensionless
measure of particle inertia), shows that the particle phase behaves as a
non-Newtonian fluid. The generalized Smoluchowski convective-diffusion equation
contains a shear-dependent cross derivative term and an additional term along
the streamwise direction, quadratic in the particle Stokes number. The
long-time diffusion coefficients associated with the particle flux relative to
the carrier flow are found to depend on particle inertia such that the
streamwise diffusion coefficient becomes negative with increasing Stokes
number, whereas one of the cross coefficients is always negative. The total
diffusion coefficients measuring the rate of change of particle mean square
displacement are always positive as expected from general stability arguments.
