We present a comparative analysis of large-scale topological and evolutionary
properties of transcription networks in three species, the two distant bacteria
E. coli and B. subtilis, and the yeast S. cerevisiae. The study focuses on the
global aspects of feedback and hierarchy in transcriptional regulatory
pathways. While confirming that gene duplication has a significant impact on
the shaping of all the analyzed transcription networks, our results point to
distinct trends between the bacteria, where time constraints in the
transcription of downstream genes might be important in shaping the
hierarchical structure of the network, and yeast, which seems able to sustain a
higher wiring complexity, that includes the more feedback, intricate hierarchy,
and the combinatorial use of heterodimers made of duplicate transcription
factors.
