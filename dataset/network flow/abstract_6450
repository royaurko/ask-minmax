Intermediate-scale (or `meso-scale') structures in networks have received
considerable attention, as the algorithmic detection of such structures makes
it possible to discover network features that are not apparent either at the
local scale of nodes and edges or at the global scale of summary statistics.
Numerous types of meso-scale structures can occur in networks, but
investigations of such features have focused predominantly on the
identification and study of community structure. In this paper, we develop a
new method to investigate the meso-scale feature known as core-periphery
structure, which entails identifying densely-connected core nodes and
sparsely-connected periphery nodes. In contrast to communities, the nodes in a
core are also reasonably well-connected to those in the periphery. Our new
method of computing core-periphery structure can identify multiple cores in a
network and takes different possible cores into account. We illustrate the
differences between our method and several existing methods for identifying
which nodes belong to a core, and we use our technique to examine
core-periphery structure in examples of friendship, collaboration,
transportation, and voting networks.
