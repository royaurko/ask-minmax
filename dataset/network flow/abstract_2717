In this paper we study kinematic expansive flows on compact metric spaces,
surfaces and general manifolds. Different variations of the definition are
considered and its relationship with expansiveness in the sense of
Bowen-Walters and Komuro is analyzed. We consider continuous and smooth flows
and robust kinematic expansiveness of vector fields is considered on smooth
manifolds.
