Real networks exhibit nontrivial topological features such as heavy-tailed
degree distribution, high clustering, and small-worldness. Researchers have
developed several generative models for synthesizing artificial networks that
are structurally similar to real networks. An important research problem is to
identify the generative model that best fits to a target network. In this
paper, we investigate this problem and our goal is to select the model that is
able to generate graphs similar to a given network instance. By the means of
generating synthetic networks with seven outstanding generative models, we have
utilized machine learning methods to develop a decision tree for model
selection. Our proposed method, which is named "Generative Model Selection for
Complex Networks" (GMSCN), outperforms existing methods with respect to
accuracy, scalability and size-independence.
