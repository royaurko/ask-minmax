The fractal dimension of a liquid column is a crucial parameter in several
models describing the main features of the primary break-up occurring at the
interface of a liquid phase surrounded by the gas-flow. In this work, the
deformation of the liquid phase has been numerically studied. The gas-phase is
computed as a continuum in an Eulerian frame while the liquid phase is
discretized in droplets Lagrangian tracked and coupled via the momentum
equation with the surrounding gas flow. The interface is transported by the
flow field generated because of the particle forcing and it is numerically
computed using the Level-Set method. Finally, the fractal dimension of the
interface is locally estimated and used as criterion for the model of the
primary breakup.
