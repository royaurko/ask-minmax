Coherent network error correction is the error-control problem in network
coding with the knowledge of the network codes at the source and sink nodes.
With respect to a given set of local encoding kernels defining a linear network
code, we obtain refined versions of the Hamming bound, the Singleton bound and
the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for coherent network error correction. Similar to
its classical counterpart, this refined Singleton bound is tight for linear
network codes. The tightness of this refined bound is shown by two construction
algorithms of linear network codes achieving this bound. These two algorithms
illustrate different design methods: one makes use of existing network coding
algorithms for error-free transmission and the other makes use of classical
error-correcting codes. The implication of the tightness of the refined
Singleton bound is that the sink nodes with higher maximum flow values can have
higher error correction capabilities.
