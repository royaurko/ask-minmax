We consider network coding rates for directed and undirected $k$-pairs
networks. For directed networks, meagerness is known to be an upper bound on
network coding rates. We show that network coding rate can be $\Theta(|V|)$
multiplicative factor smaller than meagerness. For the undirected case, we show
some progress in the direction of the $k$-pairs conjecture.
