In all empirical-network studies, the observed properties of economic
networks are informative only if compared with a well-defined null model that
can quantitatively predict the behavior of such properties in constrained
graphs. However, predictions of the available null-model methods can be derived
analytically only under assumptions (e.g., sparseness of the network) that are
unrealistic for most economic networks like the World Trade Web (WTW). In this
paper we study the evolution of the WTW using a recently-proposed family of
null network models. The method allows to analytically obtain the expected
value of any network statistic across the ensemble of networks that preserve on
average some local properties, and are otherwise fully random. We compare
expected and observed properties of the WTW in the period 1950-2000, when
either the expected number of trade partners or total country trade is kept
fixed and equal to observed quantities. We show that, in the binary WTW,
node-degree sequences are sufficient to explain higher-order network properties
such as disassortativity and clustering-degree correlation, especially in the
last part of the sample. Conversely, in the weighted WTW, the observed sequence
of total country imports and exports are not sufficient to predict higher-order
patterns of the WTW. We discuss some important implications of these findings
for international-trade models.
