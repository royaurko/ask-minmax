In this paper, we consider the message forwarding problem that consists in
managing the network resources that are used to forward messages. Previous
works on this problem provide solutions that either use a significant number of
buffers (that is n buffers per processor, where n is the number of processors
in the network) making the solution not scalable or, they reserve all the
buffers from the sender to the receiver to forward only one message %while
using D buffers (where D refers to the diameter of the network) . The only
solution that uses a constant number of buffers per link was introduced in [1].
However the solution works only on a chain networks. In this paper, we propose
a snap-stabilizing algorithm for the message forwarding problem that uses the
same complexity on the number of buffers as [1] and works on tree topologies.
