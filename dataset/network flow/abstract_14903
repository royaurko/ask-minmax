Identification and extraction of vortical structures and of waves in a
disorganized flow is a mayor challegen in the study of turbulence. We present a
study of the spatio-temporal behavior of turbulent flows in the presence of
different restitutive forces. We show how to compute and analyze the
spatio-temporal spectrum from data stemming from numerical simulations and from
laboratory experiments. Four cases are considered: homogeneous and isotropic
turbulence, rotating turbulence, stratified turbulence, and water wave
turbulence. For homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the spectrum allows
identification of random sweeping. For rotating and for stratified turbulence,
the spectrum allows identification of the waves, quantification of the energy
in the waves and in the turbulent eddies, and identification of physical
mechanisms such as Doppler shift and wave absorption in critical layers.
Finally, in water wave turbulence the spectrum shows a transition from
gravity-capillary waves to bound waves as the amplitude of the forcing is
increased.
