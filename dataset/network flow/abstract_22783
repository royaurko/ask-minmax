Transshipment problem is one of the basic operational research problems. In
this paper, our first work is to develop a biologically inspired mathematical
model for a dynamical system, which is first used to solve minimum cost flow
problem. It has lower computational complexity than Physarum Solver. Second, we
apply the proposed model to solve the traditional transshipment problem.
Compared with the conditional methods, experiment results show the provided
model is simple, effective as well as handling problem in a continuous manner.
