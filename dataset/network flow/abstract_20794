A cross-layer scheme, namely ALOHA With Collision Resolution (ALOHA-CR), is
proposed for high throughput wireless communications in a cellular scenario.
Transmissions occur in a time-slotted ALOHA-type fashion but with an important
difference: simultaneous transmissions of two users can be successful. If more
than two users transmit in the same slot the collision cannot be resolved and
retransmission is required. If only one user transmits, the transmitted packet
is recovered with some probability, depending on the state of the channel. If
two users transmit the collision is resolved and the packets are recovered by
first over-sampling the collision signal and then exploiting independent
information about the two users that is contained in the signal polyphase
components. The ALOHA-CR throughput is derived under the infinite backlog
assumption and also under the assumption of finite backlog. The contention
probability is determined under these two assumptions in order to maximize the
network throughput and maintain stability. Queuing delay analysis for network
users is also conducted. The performance of ALOHA-CR is demonstrated on the
Wireless Open Access Research Platform (WARP) test-bed containing five software
defined radio nodes. Analysis and test-bed results indicate that ALOHA-CR leads
to significant increase in throughput and reduction of service delays.
