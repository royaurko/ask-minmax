We explore a framework called boosted Markov networks to combine the learning
capacity of boosting and the rich modeling semantics of Markov networks and
applying the framework for video-based activity recognition. Importantly, we
extend the framework to incorporate hidden variables. We show how the framework
can be applied for both model learning and feature selection. We demonstrate
that boosted Markov networks with hidden variables perform comparably with the
standard maximum likelihood estimation. However, our framework is able to learn
sparse models, and therefore can provide computational savings when the learned
models are used for classification.
