Small-world networks (SWN) are found to be closer to the real social systems
than both regular and random lattices. Then, a model for the evolution of
economic systems is generalized to SWN. The Sznajd model for the two-state
opinion formation problem is applied to SWN. Then a simple definition of
leaders is included. These models explain some socio-economic aspects.
