Granular gravity driven flows of glass beads have been observed in a silo
with a flat bottom. A DC high electric field has been applied perpendicularly
to the silo to tune the cohesion. The outlet mass flow has been measured. An
image subtraction technique has been applied to visualize the flow geometry and
a spatiotemporal analysis of the flow dynamics has been performed. The outlet
mass flow is independent of voltage, but a transition from funnel flow to
rathole flow is observed. This transition is of probabilistic nature and an
intermediate situation exists between the funnel and the rathole situations. At
a given voltage, two kinds of flow dynamics can occur : a continuous flow or an
intermittent flow. The electric field increases the probability to observe an
intermittent flow.
