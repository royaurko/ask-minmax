A system of identical cars on a single-lane road is treated as a
microcanonical and canonical ensemble. Behaviour of the cars is characterized
by the probability of car velocity as a function of distance and velocity of
the car ahead. The calculations a performed on a discrete 1D lattice with
discrete car velocities.
  Probability of total velocity of a group of cars as a function of density is
calculated in microcanonical approach. For a canonical ensemble, fluctuations
of car density as a function of total velocity is found. Phase transitions
between free and jammed flow for large deceleration rate of cars and formation
of queues of cars with the same velocity for low deceleration rate are
described.
