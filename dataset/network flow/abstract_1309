The flow size distribution is a useful metric for traffic modeling and
management. Its estimation based on sampled data, however, is problematic.
Previous work has shown that flow sampling (FS) offers enormous statistical
benefits over packet sampling but high resource requirements precludes its use
in routers. We present Dual Sampling (DS), a two-parameter family, which, to a
large extent, provide FS-like statistical performance by approaching FS
continuously, with just packet-sampling-like computational cost. Our work
utilizes a Fisher information based approach recently used to evaluate a number
of sampling schemes, excluding FS, for TCP flows. We revise and extend the
approach to make rigorous and fair comparisons between FS, DS and others. We
show how DS significantly outperforms other packet based methods, including
Sample and Hold, the closest packet sampling-based competitor to FS. We
describe a packet sampling-based implementation of DS and analyze its key
computational costs to show that router implementation is feasible. Our
approach offers insights into numerous issues, including the notion of `flow
quality' for understanding the relative performance of methods, and how and
when employing sequence numbers is beneficial. Our work is theoretical with
some simulation support and case studies on Internet data.
