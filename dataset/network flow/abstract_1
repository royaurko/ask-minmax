In this paper we show an O(n^(3/2) log^2 n) time algorithm for finding a
maximum flow in a planar graph with multiple sources and multiple sinks. This
is the fastest algorithm whose running time depends only on the number of
vertices in the graph. For general (non-planar) graphs the multiple-source
multiple-sink version of the maximum flow problem is as difficult as the
standard single-source single-sink version. However, the standard reduction
does not preserve the planarity of the graph, and it is not known how to
generalize existing maximum flow algorithms for planar graphs to the
multiple-source multiple-sink maximum flow problem.
