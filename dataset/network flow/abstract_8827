This movie illustrates the recent numerical and experimental discovery of a
new state of turbulence in dilute polymer solutions, Elasto-Inertial
Turbulence. Elasto-inertial turbulence is characterized by a chaotic flow state
in which both inertial and elastic effects, whose relative contributions vary
with the Reynolds number, control the flow dynamics.
