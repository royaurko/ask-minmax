Intrusion Detection System or IDS is a software or hardware tool that
repeatedly scans and monitors events that took place in a computer or a
network. A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection
Systems or NIDS to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which
are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behaviour over the
network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen.
Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that
attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a
failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion
can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other
form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for
detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual
categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low
false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in
complexity and overhead on the system. The paper presents the Evasion technique
for customized apriori algorithm. The paper aims to make a new functional
structure to evade NIDS. This framework can be used to audit NIDS. This
framework shows that a proof of concept showing how to evade a self built NIDS
considering two publicly available datasets.
