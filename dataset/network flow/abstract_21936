We present a theoretical study of electromagnetic surface waves localized at
an interface separating a conventional uniform medium and a semi-infinite 1-D
photonic crystal made of alternate left-handed metamaterial and right-handed
material which we refer to as left-handed photonic crystal. We find novel type
of surface mode's structure, the so-called surface Tamm states and demonstrate
that the presence of metamaterial in the photonic crystal structure allows for
a flexible control of the dispersion properties of surface states, and can
support the Tamm states with a backward energy flow and a vortex-like
structure.
