The homotopy analysis method is studied in the present paper. The question of
convergence of the homotopy analysis method is resolved. It is proven that
under a special constraint the homotopy analysis method does converge to the
exact solution of the sought solution of nonlinear ordinary or partial
differential equations. An optimal value of the convergence control parameter
is given through the square residual error. An error estimate is also provided.
Examples, including the Blasius flow, clearly demonstrate why and on what
interval the corresponding homotopy series generated by the homotopy analysis
method will converge to the exact solution.
