The Sensor Planning Service (SPS) is service model to define the web service
interface for requesting user driven acquisitions and observation. It's defined
by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) group to
provide standardized interface for tasking sensors to allow to defining,
checking, modifying and cancelling tasks of sensor and sensor data. The goal of
Sensor Planning Service (SPS) of OGC - SWE is standardize the interoperability
between a client and a server collection management environment. The Sensor
Planning Service (SPS) is need to automate complex data flow in a large
enterprises that are depend on live & stored data from sensors and multimedia
equipment. The obstacle are faced in Sensor Planning Service (SPS) are (I)
Observation from sensor at the right time and right place will be problem, (II)
acquisition information(data) that are collected at a specific time and
specific place will be problem. The above two obstacle are accomplished and
obtained by the web based semantic technology in order to provide & apply the
ontology based semantic rule to user driven a acquisitions and observation of
Sensor Planning Service (SPS). The novelty of our approach is by adding the
semantic rule to Sensor Planning Service model in SWE and we implemented Sensor
Planning Service (SPS) with semantic knowledge based to achieve high
standardized service model for Sensor Planning Service (SPS) of OGC - SWE.
