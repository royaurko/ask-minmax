We present a simple mathematical model of glassy dynamics seen as a random
walk in a directed, weighted network of minima taken as a representation of the
energy landscape. Our approach gives a broader perspective to previous studies
focusing on particular examples of energy landscapes obtained by sampling
energy minima and saddles of small systems. We point out how the relation
between the energies of the minima and their number of neighbors should be
studied in connection with the network's global topology, and show how the
tools developed in complex network theory can be put to use in this context.
