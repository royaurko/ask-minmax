We propose a description for transient penetration simulations of miscible
and immiscible fluid mixtures into anisotropic porous media, using the lattice
Boltzmann (LB) method. Our model incorporates hydrodynamic flow, diffusion,
surface tension, and the possibility for global and local viscosity variations
to consider various types of hardening fluids. The miscible mixture consists of
two fluids, one governed by the hydrodynamic equations and one by diffusion
equations. We validate our model on standard problems like Poiseuille flow, the
collision of a drop with an impermeable, hydrophobic interface and the
deformation of the fluid due to surface tension forces. To demonstrate the
applicability to complex geometries, we simulate the invasion process of
mixtures into wood spruce samples.
