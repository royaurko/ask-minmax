In this paper we study non-singular solutions of Ricci flow on a closed
manifold of dimension at least 4. Amongst others we prove that, if M is a
closed 4-manifold on which the normalized Ricci flow exists for all time t>0
with uniformly bounded sectional curvature, then the Euler characteristic $\chi
(M)\ge 0$. Moreover, the 4-manifold satisfies one of the following \noindent
(i) M is a shrinking Ricci solition;
  \noindent (ii) M admits a positive rank F-structure;
  \noindent (iii) the Hitchin-Thorpe type inequality holds 2\chi (M)\ge
3|\tau(M)| where $\chi (M)$ (resp. $\tau(M)$) is the Euler characteristic
(resp. signature) of M.
