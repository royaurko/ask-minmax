Monodisperse granular flows often develop regions with hexagonal close
packing of particles. We investigate this effect in a system of inelastic hard
spheres driven from below by a "thermal" plate. Molecular dynamics simulations
show, in a wide range of parameters, a close-packed cluster supported by a
low-density region. Surprisingly, the steady-state density profile, including
the close-packed cluster part, is well described by a variant of Navier-Stokes
granular hydrodynamics (NSGH). We suggest a simple explanation for the success
of NSGH beyond the freezing point.
