Till now the academic institutes in Kurdistan region not connected via
network with each other and with research centers worldwide, this paper
suggests design an optical IP-Network for academic Kurdistan region based on
DWDM (Dense wavelength Division Multiplexer) backbone. The design has been
developed using minimum spanning tree between the main realistic locations for
campuses in each province were calculated using Prim's algorithm in province
level. This proposed network simulated using OPENT IT GURU, and then
information was collected using GPS and GIS about the campuses (to obtain
realistic locations) of each university in university level, finally unique
design model was assumed for each campus in campus level. Simulation the
proposed design shows results of delay, traffic sends, traffic receives;
utility, performance (packet/second) and throughput are measured in the case of
heavy load. Addition to that the hub based network has longer response time
than the switch based network. Key words: IP-Network, OPNET, DWDM, Prim's
algorithm, Intranet, GPS and GIS.
