Lattice diffusion and internal local magnetic field gradients in solids are
investigated by numerical simulation of nuclear mangetic resonance(NMR) spin
echo experiments. The Fourier-spectrum method is employed in order to solve the
Bloch-Torrey equation with arbitrary magnetic field gradients in one- and
two-dimensional lattice restrictions.
