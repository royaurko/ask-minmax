We study the Potts model on locally tree-like random graphs of arbitrary
degree distribution. Using a population dynamics algorithm we numerically solve
the problem exactly. We confirm our results with simulations. Comparisons with
a previous approach are made, showing where its assumption of uniform local
fields breaks down for networks with nodes of low degree.
