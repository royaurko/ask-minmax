The dramatic mobile data traffic growth is not only resulting in the spectrum
crunch but is also leading to exorbitant energy consumption. It is thus
desirable to liberate mobile and wireless networks from the constraint of the
spectrum scarcity and to rein in the growing energy consumption. This article
introduces FreeNet, figuratively synonymous to "Free Network", which engineers
the spectrum and energy harvesting techniques to alleviate the spectrum and
energy constraints by sensing and harvesting spare spectrum for data
communications and utilizing renewable energy as power supplies, respectively.
Hence, FreeNet increases the spectrum and energy efficiency of wireless
networks and enhances the network availability. As a result, FreeNet can be
deployed to alleviate network congestion in urban areas, provision broadband
services in rural areas, and upgrade emergency communication capacity. This
article provides a brief analysis of the design of FreeNet that accommodates
the dynamics of the spare spectrum and employs renewable energy.
