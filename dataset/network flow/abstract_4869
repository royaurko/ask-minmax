We study the perturbative behavior of the gradient flow in a twisted box. We
apply this information to define a running coupling using the energy density of
the flow field. We study the step-scaling function and the size of cutoff
effects in SU(2) pure gauge theory. We conclude that the twisted gradient flow
running coupling scheme is a valid strategy for step-scaling purposes due to
the relatively mild cutoff effects and high precision.
