This paper presents a theoretical derivation of the empirical Blasius power
law correlation for the friction factor. The coefficients in this correlation
are shown to be dependent on the Reynolds number. Published experimental data
is well correlated.
  Key words: Blasius, friction factor, turbulence, power law, log-law, wall
