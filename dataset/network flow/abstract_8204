Gas slippage occurs when the mean free path of the gas molecules is in the
order of the characteristic pore size of a porous medium. This phenomenon leads
to the Klinkenberg's effect where the measured permeability of a gas (apparent
permeability) is higher than that of the liquid (intrinsic permeability). A
generalized lattice Boltzmann model is proposed for flow through porous media
that includes Klinkenberg's effect, which is based on the model of Guo et al.
(Z.L. Guo et al., Phys.Rev.E 65, 046308 (2002)). The second-order Beskok and
Karniadakis-Civan's correlation (A. Beskok and G. Karniadakis, Microscale
Thermophysical Engineering 3, 43-47 (1999), F. Civan, Transp Porous Med 82,
375-384 (2010)) is adopted to calculate the apparent permeability based on
intrinsic permeability and Knudsen number. Fluid flow between two parallel
plates filled with porous media is simulated to validate model. Simulations
performed in a heterogeneous porous medium with components of different
porosity and permeability indicate that the Klinkenberg's effect plays
significant role on fluid flow in low-permeability porous media, and it is more
pronounced as the Knudsen number increases. Fluid flow in a shale matrix with
and without fractures is also studied, and it is found that the fractures
greatly enhance the fluid flow and the Klinkenberg's effect leads to higher
global permeability of the shale matrix.
