We study hard constraint satisfaction problems with a decimation approach
based on message passing algorithms. Decimation induces a renormalization flow
in the space of problems, and we exploit the fact that this flow transforms
some of the constraints into linear constraints over GF(2). In particular, when
the flow hits the subspace of linear problems, one can stop decimation and use
Gaussian elimination. We introduce a new decimation algorithm which uses this
linear structure and shows a strongly improved performance with respect to the
usual decimation methods on some of the hardest locked occupation problems.
