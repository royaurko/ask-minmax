We develop a cluster expansion for the probability of full connectivity of
high density random networks in confined geometries. In contrast to percolation
phenomena at lower densities, boundary effects, which have previously been
largely neglected, are not only relevant but dominant. We derive general
analytical formulas that show a persistence of universality in a different form
to percolation theory, and provide numerical confirmation. We also demonstrate
the simplicity of our approach in three simple but instructive examples and
discuss the practical benefits of its application to different models.
