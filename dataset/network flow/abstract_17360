We derive a compact and explicit expression for the generating functional of
all correlation functions of tachyon operators in 2D string theory. This
expression makes manifest relations of the $c=1$ system to KP flow and
$W_{1+\infty}$ constraints. Moreover we derive a Kontsevich-Penner integral
representation of this generating functional.
