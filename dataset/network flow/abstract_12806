We have implemented a convolutional neural network designed for processing
sparse three-dimensional input data. The world we live in is three dimensional
so there are a large number of potential applications including 3D object
recognition and analysis of space-time objects. In the quest for efficiency, we
experiment with CNNs on the 2D triangular-lattice and 3D tetrahedral-lattice.
