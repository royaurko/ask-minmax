The experimental azimuthal dihadron distributions at RHIC show a double peak
structure in the away side ($\Delta \phi = \pi \pm 1.2$ rad.) for intermediate
$p_t$ particles. A variety of models have appeared trying to describe this
modification. We will review most of them, with special emphasis in the Conical
Flow scenario in which the observed shape is a consequence of the emission of
sound by a supersonic high momentum particle propagating in the Quark Gluon
Plasma.
