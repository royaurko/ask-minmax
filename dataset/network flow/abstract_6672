A network of signalized intersections is modeled as a queuing network. The
intersections are regulated by fixed-time (FT) controls, all with the same
cycle length or period, $T$. Vehicles arrive from outside the network at entry
links in a deterministic periodic stream, also with period $T$, make turns at
intersections in fixed proportions, and eventually leave the network. Vehicles
take a fixed time to travel along each link, and at the end of the link they
join a queue. There is a separate queue at each intersection for each movement.
The storage capacity of the queues is infinite, so there is no spill back. The
state of the network at time $t$ is the vector $x(t)$ of all queue lengths,
together with the position of vehicles traveling along the links. The state
evolves according to a delay-differential equation. Suppose the network is
stable, that is, $x(t)$ is bounded. Then (1) there exists a unique periodic
trajectory $x^*(t)$, with period $T$; (2) every trajectory converges to this
periodic trajectory; (3) if vehicles do not follow loops, the convergence
occurs in finite time. The periodic trajectory determines the performance of
the entire network.
