In this paper, we study the relation of the monotonicity of Hawking Mass and
geometric flow problems. We show that along the Hamilton-DeTurck flow with
bounded curvature coupled with the modified mean curvature flow, the Hawking
mass of the hypersphere with a sufficiently large radius in Schwarzschild
spaces is monotone non-decreasing.
