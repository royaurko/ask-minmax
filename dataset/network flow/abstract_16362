Lucid programs are data-flow programs and can be visually represented as data
flow graphs (DFGs) and composed visually. Forensic Lucid, a Lucid dialect, is a
language to specify and reason about cyberforensic cases. It includes the
encoding of the evidence (representing the context of evaluation) and the crime
scene modeling in order to validate claims against the model and perform event
reconstruction, potentially within large swaths of digital evidence. To aid
investigators to model the scene and evaluate it, instead of typing a Forensic
Lucid program, we propose to expand the design and implementation of the Lucid
DFG programming onto Forensic Lucid case modeling and specification to enhance
the usability of the language and the system and its behavior. We briefly
discuss the related work on visual programming an DFG modeling in an attempt to
define and select one approach or a composition of approaches for Forensic
Lucid based on various criteria such as previous implementation, wide use,
formal backing in terms of semantics and translation. In the end, we solicit
the readers' constructive, opinions, feedback, comments, and recommendations
within the context of this short discussion.
