Artificial Neural Network is among the most popular algorithm for supervised
learning. However, Neural Networks have a well-known drawback of being a "Black
Box" learner that is not comprehensible to the Users. This lack of transparency
makes it unsuitable for many high risk tasks such as medical diagnosis that
requires a rational justification for making a decision. Rule Extraction
methods attempt to curb this limitation by extracting comprehensible rules from
a trained Network. Many such extraction algorithms have been developed over the
years with their respective strengths and weaknesses. They have been broadly
categorized into three types based on their approach to use internal model of
the Network. Eclectic Methods are hybrid algorithms that combine the other
approaches to attain more performance. In this paper, we present an Eclectic
method called HERETIC. Our algorithm uses Inductive Decision Tree learning
combined with information of the neural network structure for extracting
logical rules. Experiments and theoretical analysis show HERETIC to be better
in terms of speed and performance.
