The dynamics of fluid vesicles in simple shear flow is studied using
mesoscale simulations of dynamically-triangulated surfaces, as well as a
theoretical approach based on two variables, a shape parameter and the
inclination angle, which has no adjustable parameters. We show that between the
well-known tank-treading and tumbling states, a new ``swinging'' state can
appear. We predict the dynamic phase diagram as a function of the shear rate,
the viscosities of the membrane and the internal fluid, and the reduced vesicle
volume. Our results agree well with recent experiments.
