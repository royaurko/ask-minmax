Preventing traffic congestion by forecasting near time traffic flows is an
important problem as it leads to effective use of transport resources. Social
network provides information about activities of humans and social events.
Thus, with the help of social network, we can extract which humans will attend
a particular event (in near time) and can estimate flow of traffic based on it.
This opens up a wide area of research which poses need to have a framework for
traffic management that can capture essential parameters of real-life behaviour
and provide a way to iterate upon and evaluate new ideas. In this paper, we
present building blocks of a framework and a system to simulate a city with its
transport system, humans and their social network. We emphasize on relevant
parameters selected and modular design of the framework. Our framework defines
metrics to evaluate congestion avoidance strategies. To show utility of the
framework, we present experimental studies of few strategies on a public
transport system.
