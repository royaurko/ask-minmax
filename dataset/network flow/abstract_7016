We here present the results of elliptical flow for the collision of different
asymmetric nuclei (10Ne20 +13 Al27, 18Ar40 +21 Sc45, 30Zn64 +28 Ni58, 36Kr86
+41 Nb93) by using the Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) model. General features
of elliptical flow are investigated with the help of theoretical simulations.
The simulations are performed at different beam energies between 40 and 105
MeV/nucleon. A significant change can be seen from in-plane to out-of-plane
elliptical flow of different fragments with incident energy. A comparison with
experimental data is also made. Further, we predict, for the first time that,
elliptical flow for different kind of fragments follow power law dependence ?
C(Atot)? for asymmetric systems.
