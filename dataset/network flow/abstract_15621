Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is a transport layer protocol that allows network
devices to transfer data over multiple concurrent paths, and hence, utilizes
the network resources more effectively than does the traditional single-path
TCP. However, as a reliable protocol, MPTCP still needs to deliver data packets
(to the upper application) at the receiver in the same order they are
transmitted at the sender. The out-of-order packet problem becomes more severe
for MPTCP due to the heterogeneous nature of delay and bandwidth of each path.
In this paper, we propose the forward-delay-based packet scheduling (FDPS)
algorithm for MPTCP to address that problem. The main idea is that the sender
dispatches packets via concurrent paths according to their estimated forward
delay and throughput differences. Via simulations with various network
conditions, the results show that our algorithm significantly maintains
in-order arrival packets at the receiver compared with several previous
algorithms.
