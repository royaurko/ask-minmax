A system of simplified equations is proposed to govern the feedback
interactions of large-scale flows present in laminar-turbulent patterns of
transitional wall-bounded flows, with small-scale Reynolds stresses generated
by the self-sustainment process of turbulence itself modeled using an extension
of Waleffe's approach (Phys. Fluids 9 (1997) 883-900), the detailed expression
of which is displayed as an annex to the main text.
