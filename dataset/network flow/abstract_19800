The PHENIX experiment has shown that J/psis are suppressed in central Au+Au
collisions at a center of mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision sqrt s(NN)
= 200 GeV, and that the suppression is larger at forward than at mid-rapidity.
Part of this difference may be explained by cold nuclear matter effects but the
most central collisions suggest that regeneration mechanisms could be at play.
In 2007, PHENIX collected almost four times more Au+Au collisions at this
energy than used for previous published results. Moreover, the addition of a
new reaction plane detector allows a much better analysis of the J/psi behavior
in the azimuthal plane. Since a large elliptic flow has been measured for open
charm, measuring J/psi azimuthal anisotropies may give a hint if J/psi are
recombined in the expanding matter. First PHENIX results of J/psi elliptic flow
as a function of transverse momentum at forward rapidity are presented in this
article. The analysis is detailed and results are compared to mid-rapidity
PHENIX preliminary results as well as to predictions.
