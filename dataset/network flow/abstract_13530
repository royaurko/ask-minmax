Using a technique, analogous to coherent population trapping in an atomic
system, we propose schemes to create transverse light propagation violating
left-right symmetry in a photonic circuit consisting of three coupled
waveguides. The frequency windows for the symmetry breaking of the left-right
energy flow span over 80 nm. Our proposed system only uses linear passive
optical materials and is easy to integrate on a chip.
