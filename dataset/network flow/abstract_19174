In $e$-beam evaporated amorphous silicon ($a$-Si), the densities of two-level
systems (TLS), $n_{0}$ and $\overline{P}$, determined from specific heat $C$
and internal friction $Q^{-1}$ measurements, respectively, have been shown to
vary by over three orders of magnitude. Here we show that $n_{0}$ and
$\overline{P}$ are proportional to each other with a constant of
proportionality that is consistent with the measurement time dependence
proposed by Black and Halperin and does not require the introduction of
additional anomalous TLS. However, $n_{0}$ and $\overline{P}$ depend strongly
on the atomic density of the film ($n_{\rm Si}$) which depends on both film
thickness and growth temperature suggesting that the $a$-Si structure is
heterogeneous with nanovoids or other lower density regions forming in a dense
amorphous network. A review of literature data shows that this atomic density
dependence is not unique to $a$-Si. These findings suggest that TLS are not
intrinsic to an amorphous network but require a heterogeneous structure to
form.
