We study the structure and properties of hot MHD accretion onto a Kerr black
hole. In such a system, the hole is magnetically coupled to the inflowing gas
and exerts a torque onto the accretion flow. A hot settling flow can form
around the hole and transport the angular momentum outward, to the outer edge
of the flow. Unlike other hot flows, such as advection- and
convection-dominated flows and inflow-outflow solutions (ADAFs, CDAFs, and
ADIOS), the properties of the hot settling flow are determined by the spin of
the central black hole, but are insensitive to the mass accretion rate.
Therefore, it may be possible to identify rapidly spinning BHs simply from
their broad-band spectra.
  Observationally, the hot settling flow around a Kerr hole is somewhat similar
to other hot flows in that they all have hard, power-law spectra and relatively
low luminosities. Thus, most black hole candidates in the low/hard and,
perhaps, intermediate X-ray state may potentially accrete via the hot settling
flow. However, a settling flow will be somewhat more luminous than
ADAFs/CDAFs/ADIOS, will exhibit high variability in X-rays, and may have
relativistic jets. This suggests that galactic microquasars and active galactic
nuclei may be powered by hot settling flows. We identify several galactic X-ray
sources as the best candidates.
