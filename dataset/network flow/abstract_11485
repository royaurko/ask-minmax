Recent advances in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology,
integrated circuits, and wireless communication have allowed the realization of
Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). WBANs promise unobtrusive ambulatory
health monitoring for a long period of time and provide real-time updates of
the patient's status to the physician. They are widely used for ubiquitous
healthcare, entertainment, and military applications. This paper reviews the
key aspects of WBANs for numerous applications. We present a WBAN
infrastructure that provides solutions to on-demand, emergency, and normal
traffic. We further discuss in-body antenna design and low-power MAC protocol
for WBAN. In addition, we briefly outline some of the WBAN applications with
examples. Our discussion realizes a need for new power-efficient solutions
towards in-body and on-body sensor networks.
