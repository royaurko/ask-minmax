Using numerical simulations we examine the static and dynamic properties of
the recently proposed vortex liquid crystal state. We confirm the existence of
a smectic-A phase in the absence of pinning. Quenched disorder can induce a
smectic state even at T=0. When an external drive is applied, a variety of
anisotropic dynamical flow states with distinct voltage signatures occur,
including elastic depinning in the hard direction and plastic depinning in the
easy direction. We discuss the implications of the anisotropic transport for
other systems which exhibit depinning phenomena, such as stripes and electron
liquid crystals.
