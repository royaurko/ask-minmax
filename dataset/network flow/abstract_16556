Simple statistical agglomeration models can provide a universal link between
the local structure and the glass transition temperature in network glasses. We
first stress the physical features of the models and the hypothesis made, and
then show how to define the glass transition temperature. The models are
applied to various types of binary, ternary and multicomponent chalcogenide
glass networks and the predictions compared to experimental data.
