In this paper, we investigate the similarity solutions for a steady laminar
incompressible boundary layer equations governing the Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
flow near the forward stagnation point of two-dimensional and axisymmetric
bodies. This leads to the study of a boundary value problem involving a third
order autonomous ordinary differential equation. Our main results are the
existence, uniqueness and nonexistence for concave or convex solutions.
