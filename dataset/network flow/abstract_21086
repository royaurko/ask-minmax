We give the explicit expression of the infinite volume limit for the random
overlap structures appearing in the mean field spin glass model. These
structures have the expected factorization property for the cavity fields, and
enjoy invariance with respect to a large class of random transformations. These
properties are typical of the Parisi Ansatz.
