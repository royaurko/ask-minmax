Many functions have been recently defined to assess the similarity among
networks as tools for quantitative comparison. They stem from very different
frameworks - and they are tuned for dealing with different situations. Here we
show an overview of the spectral distances, highlighting their behavior in some
basic cases of static and dynamic synthetic and real networks.
