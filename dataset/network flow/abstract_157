The Sun's polar magnetic fields are directly related to solar cycle
variability. The strength of the polar fields at the start (minimum) of a cycle
determine the subsequent amplitude of that cycle. In addition, the polar field
reversals at cycle maximum alter the propagation of galactic cosmic rays
throughout the heliosphere in fundamental ways. We describe a surface magnetic
flux transport model that advects the magnetic flux emerging in active regions
(sunspots) using detailed observations of the near-surface flows that transport
the magnetic elements. These flows include the axisymmetric differential
rotation and meridional flow and the non-axisymmetric cellular convective flows
(supergranules) all of which vary in time in the model as indicated by direct
observations. We use this model with data assimilated from full-disk
magnetograms to produce full surface maps of the Sun's magnetic field at
15-minute intervals from 1996 May to 2013 July (all of sunspot cycle 23 and the
rise to maximum of cycle 24). We tested the predictability of this model using
these maps as initial conditions, but with daily sunspot area data used to give
the sources of new magnetic flux. We find that the strength of the polar fields
at cycle minimum and the polar field reversals at cycle maximum can be reliably
predicted up to three years in advance. We include a prediction for the cycle
24 polar field reversal.
