A fundamental problem in the study of phylogenetic networks is to determine
whether or not a given phylogenetic network contains a given phylogenetic tree.
We develop a quadratic-time algorithm for this problem for binary nearly-stable
phylogenetic networks. We also show that the number of reticulations in a
reticulation visible or nearly stable phylogenetic network is bounded from
above by a function linear in the number of taxa.
