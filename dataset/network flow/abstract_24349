A low-power Content-Addressable-Memory (CAM) is introduced employing a new
mechanism for associativity between the input tags and the corresponding
address of the output data. The proposed architecture is based on a recently
developed clustered-sparse-network using binary-weighted connections that
on-average will eliminate most of the parallel comparisons performed during a
search. Therefore, the dynamic energy consumption of the proposed design is
significantly lower compared to that of a conventional low-power CAM design.
Given an input tag, the proposed architecture computes a few possibilities for
the location of the matched tag and performs the comparisons on them to locate
a single valid match. A 0.13 um CMOS technology was used for simulation
purposes. The energy consumption and the search delay of the proposed design
are 9.5%, and 30.4% of that of the conventional NAND architecture respectively
with a 3.4% higher number of transistors.
