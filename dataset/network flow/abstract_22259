The self-similar Lorentz billiard channel is a spatially extended
deterministic dynamical system which consists of an infinite one-dimensional
sequence of cells whose sizes increase monotonically according to their
indices. This special geometry induces a nonequilibrium stationary state with
particles flowing steadily from the small to the large scales. The
corresponding invariant measure has fractal properties reflected by the
phase-space contraction rate of the dynamics restricted to a single cell with
appropriate boundary conditions. In the near-equilibrium limit, we find
numerical agreement between this quantity and the entropy production rate as
specified by thermodynamics.
