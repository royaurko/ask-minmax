With the advent of structured data in the form of social networks, genetic
circuits and protein interaction networks, statistical analysis of networks has
gained popularity over recent years. Stochastic block model constitutes a
classical cluster-exhibiting random graph model for networks. There is a
substantial amount of literature devoted to proposing strategies for estimating
and inferring parameters of the model, both from classical and Bayesian
viewpoints. Unlike the classical counterpart, there is however a dearth of
theoretical results on the accuracy of estimation in the Bayesian setting. In
this article, we undertake a theoretical investigation of the posterior
distribution of the parameters in a stochastic block model. In particular, we
show that one obtains optimal rates of posterior convergence with routinely
used multinomial-Dirichlet priors on cluster indicators and uniform priors on
the probabilities of the random edge indicators. En route, we develop geometric
embedding techniques to exploit the lower dimensional structure of the
parameter space which may be of independent interest.
