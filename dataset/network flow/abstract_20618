We investigate the effect of wiggly cosmic strings on the cosmic microwave
background radiation anisotropy and matter power spectrum by modifying the
string network model used by Albrecht et al.. We employ the wiggly equation of
state for strings and the one-scale model for the cosmological evolution of
certain network characteristics. For the same choice of simulation parameters
we compare the results with and without including wiggliness in the model and
find that wiggliness together with the accompanying low string velocities lead
to a significant peak in the microwave background anisotropy and to an
enhancement in the matter power spectrum. For the cosmologies we have
investigated (standard CDM, and, CDM plus cosmological constant), and within
the limitations of our modeling of the string network, the anisotropy is in
reasonable agreement with current observations but the COBE normalized
amplitude of density perturbations is lower than what the data suggests. In the
case of a cosmological constant and CDM model, a bias factor of about 2 is
required.
