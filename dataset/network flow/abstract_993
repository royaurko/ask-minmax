Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) is currently one of
the hottest technologies in wireless, it is a standard-based on the IEEE 802.16
wireless technology that provides high throughput broadband connections over
long distance, which supports Point to MultiPoint (PMP) broadband wireless
access. In parallel, Voice over Internet Protocol is a promising new technology
which provides access to voice communication over internet protocol based
network, it becomes an alternative to public switched telephone networks due to
its capability of transmission of voice as packets over IP networks. Therefore
VoIP is largely intolerant of delay and hence it needs a high priority
transmission. In this paper we investigate the performances of the most common
VoIP codecs, which are G711, G7231 and G729 over a WiMAX network using various
service classes and NOAH as a transport protocol. To analyze the QoS
parameters, the popular network simulator ns2 was used. Various parameters that
determine QoS of real life usage scenarios and traffic flows of applications is
analyzed. The objective is to compare different types of service classes with
respect to the QoS parameters, such as, throughput, average jitter and average
delay.
