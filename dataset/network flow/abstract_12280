In the secure network coding for multicasting, there is loss of information
rate due to inclusion of random bits at the source node. We show a method to
eliminate that loss of information rate by using multiple statistically
independent messages to be kept secret from an eavesdropper. The proposed
scheme is an adaptation of Yamamoto et al.'s secure multiplex coding to the
secure network coding.
