We consider a simple model for steady-state luminescence of single polymer
chains in a dilute solution in the case when excitation quenching is due to
energy transfer between a donor and an acceptor attached to the ends of the
chain. We present numerical results for Rouse chains without or with
hydrodynamic interactions, which are taken into account in a perturbative
manner. We consider the situations of a quiescent solvent as well as the chain
in a shear flow and discuss the dependence of the steady-state luminescence
intensity on the strength of hydrodynamic interaction and on the shear rate in
the flow.
