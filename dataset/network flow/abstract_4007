The paper introduces a one dimensional analogy of Poincare's "section"
method. Its application to numerical study of sequences of fractional parts is
considered. As a result, the possibility of Cantorian structure of time flow is
deduced. A possible way of interrelating the time flow and time perception, is
discussed.
