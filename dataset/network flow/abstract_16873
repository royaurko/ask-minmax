We study the transport of excitations on a V-shaped network of three coupled
two-level systems that are subjected to an environment that induces incoherent
hopping between the nodes. Two of the nodes are coupled to a source while the
third node is coupled to a drain. A common feature of these networks is the
existence of a dark-state that blocks the transport to the drain. Here we
propose a means to avoid this state by a suitable choice of initial
correlations, induced by a source that is common to both coupled nodes.
