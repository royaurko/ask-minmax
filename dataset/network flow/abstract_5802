Ecology and evolution are inseparable. Motivated by some recent experiments,
we have developed models of evolutionary ecology from the perspective of
dynamic networks. In these models, in addition to the intra-node dynamics,
which corresponds to an individual-based population dynamics of species, the
entire network itself changes slowly with time to capture evolutionary
processes. After a brief summary of our recent published works on these network
models of eco-systems, we extend the most recent version of the model
incorporating predators that wander into neighbouring spatial patches for food.
