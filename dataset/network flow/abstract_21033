For a system of non-interacting electrons scattered by resonant levels of
neutral impurities, we show that virial and quasiparticle corrections have
nearly equal magnitudes. We propose a modification of the Boltzmann equation
that includes quasiparticle and virial corrections and discuss their interplay
on a dielectric function.
