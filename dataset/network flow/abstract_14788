We present a family of kernels for analysis of data generated by dynamical
systems. These so-called cone kernels feature an explicit dependence on the
dynamical vector field operating in the phase-space manifold, estimated
empirically through finite-differences of time-ordered data samples. In
particular, cone kernels assign strong affinity to pairs of samples whose
relative displacement vector lies within a narrow cone aligned with the
dynamical vector field. As a result, in a suitable asymptotic limit, the
associated diffusion operator generates diffusions along the dynamical flow,
and is invariant under a weakly restrictive class of transformations of the
data, which includes conformal transformations. Moreover, the corresponding
Dirichlet form is governed by the directional derivative of functions along the
dynamical vector field. The latter feature is metric-independent. The diffusion
eigenfunctions obtained via cone kernels are therefore adapted to the dynamics
in that they vary predominantly in directions transverse to the flow. We
demonstrate the utility of cone kernels in nonlinear flows on the 2-torus and
North Pacific sea surface temperature data generated by a comprehensive climate
model.
