We consider a generalized Ricci flow with a given (not necessarily closed)
three-form and establish the higher derivatives estimates for compact
manifolds. As an application, we prove the compactness theorem for this
generalized Ricci flow. The similar results still hold for a more generalized
Ricci flow.
