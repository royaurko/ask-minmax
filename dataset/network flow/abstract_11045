We study the evolution of abelian-Higgs string networks in numerical
simulations. These are compared against a modified velocity-dependent one scale
model for cosmic string network evolution. This incorporates the contributions
of loop production, massive radiation and friction to the energy loss processes
that are required for scaling evolution. We find that the loop distribution
statistics in the simulations are consistent with the long-time scaling of the
network being dominated by loop production. For an oscillating sinusoidal
perturbation, we also demonstrate that the power emitted into massive radiation
decays strongly with wavelength. Putting these observations together and
extrapolating, we believe there is insufficient evidence to reject the the
standard picture of string network evolution in favour of one where direct
massive radiation is the dominant decay mechanism, a proposal which has
attracted much recent interest.
