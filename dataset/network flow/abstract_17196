Endocytosis underlies many cellular functions including signaling and
nutrient uptake. The endocytosed cargo gets redistributed across a dynamic
network of endosomes undergoing fusion and fission. Here, a theoretical
approach is reviewed which can explain how the microscopic properties of
endosome interactions cause the emergent macroscopic properties of cargo
trafficking in the endosomal network. Predictions by the theory have been
tested experimentally and include the inference of dependencies and parameter
values of the microscopic processes. This theory could also be used to infer
mechanisms of signal-trafficking crosstalk. It is applicable to in vivo systems
since fixed samples at few time points suffice as input data.
