Heat transfer properties in non-reciprocal systems are discussed. An ideal
experiment employing microwave or optical isolators is considered in order to
investigate the possibility for a spontaneous transfer of energy between two
black bodies at common temperatures. Under the validity of the adopted
assumptions on the examined physical system, the effect appears to be weak but
feasible.
