We introduce a model of information packet transport on networks in which the
packets are posted by a given rate and move in parallel according to a local
search algorithm. By performing a number of simulations we investigate the
major kinetic properties of the transport as a function of the network
geometry, the packet input rate and the buffer size. We find long-range
correlations in the power spectra of arriving packet density and the network's
activity bursts. The packet transit time distribution shows a power-law
dependence with average transit time increasing with network size. This implies
dynamic queueing on the network, in which many interacting queues are mutually
driven by temporally correlated packet streams.
