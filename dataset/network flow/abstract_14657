Interaction between atmospheric mid-latitude flow and wind-driven ocean
circulation is studied coupling two idealized low-order spectral models. The
barotropic Charney-DeVore model with three components simulates a bimodal
mid-latitude atmospheric circulation in a channel with two stable flow patterns
induced by topography. The wind-driven ocean double gyre circulation in a
square basin (of half the channel length) is modeled by an equivalent
barotropic formulation of the Veronis model with 21 components, which captures
Rossby-wave dynamics and nonlinear decadal variability. When coupled, the
atmosphere forces the ocean by wind-stress while, simultaneously, the ocean
affects the atmosphere by thermal forcing in terms of a vorticity source.
Coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations show two stable flow patterns associated
with the topographically induced atmospheric bimodality and a sustained
oscillation due to interaction between atmospheric bimodality and oceanic
Rossby dynamics. The oscillation is of inter-annual to inter-decadal
periodicity and occurs in a reasonably wide parameter domain.
