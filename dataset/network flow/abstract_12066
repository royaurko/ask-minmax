The IEEE 802.11b wireless ethernet standart has several serious security
flaws. This paper describes this flaws, surveys wireless networks in the
Cologne/Bonn area to get an assessment of the security configurations of
fielded networks and analizes the legal protections provided to wireless
ethernet operators by german law. We conclude that wireless ethernets without
additional security measures are not usable for any transmissions which are not
meant for a public audience.
