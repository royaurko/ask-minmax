A recent Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiment in He II counterflow
around a cylindrical obstacle showed the existence of apparently stationary
normal fluid ddies both downstream (at the rear) and upstream (in front) of the
cylinder. This rather surprising result does not have an analogue in
experimental observations of classical fluid flows. We suggest that the
explanation for the apparent stability of such eddies can be provided entirely
from the viewpoint of classical fluid dynamics. We also discuss a possible
connection between the emergence of the normal fluid eddies and the
polarization of the vortex tangle in superfluid.
