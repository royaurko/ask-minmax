As one of major challenges, cold-start problem plagues nearly all recommender
systems. In particular, new items will be overlooked, impeding the development
of new products online. Given limited resources, how to utilize the knowledge
of recommender systems and design efficient marketing strategy for new items is
extremely important. In this paper, we convert this ticklish issue into a clear
mathematical problem based on a bipartite network representation. Under the
most widely used algorithm in real e-commerce recommender systems, so-called
the item-based collaborative filtering, we show that to simply push new items
to active users is not a good strategy. To our surprise, experiments on real
recommender systems indicate that to connect new items with some less active
users will statistically yield better performance, namely these new items will
have more chance to appear in other users' recommendation lists. Further
analysis suggests that the disassortative nature of recommender systems
contributes to such observation. In a word, getting in-depth understanding on
recommender systems could pave the way for the owners to popularize their
cold-start products with low costs.
