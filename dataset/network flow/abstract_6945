Correlation measurements imply that anisotropic flow in nuclear collisions
includes a novel triangular component along with the more familiar
elliptic-flow contribution. Triangular flow has been attributed to event-wise
fluctuations in the initial shape of the collision volume. We ask two
questions: 1) How do these shape fluctuations impact other event-by-event
observables? 2) Can we disentangle fundamental information on the early time
fluctuations from the complex flow that results? We study correlation and
fluctuation observables in a framework in which flux tubes in an early Glasma
stage later produce hydrodynamic flow. Calculated multiplicity and transverse
momentum fluctuations are in excellent agreement with data from 62.4 GeV Au+Au
up to 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb.
