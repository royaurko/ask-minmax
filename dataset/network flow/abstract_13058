The numerical implementation of finite element discretization method for the
stream function formulation of a linearized Navier-Stokes equations is
considered. Algorithm 1 is applied using Argyris element. Three global
orderings of nodes are selected and registered in order to conclude the best
banded structure of matrix and a fluid flow calculation is considered to test a
problem which has a known solution. Visualization of global node orderings,
matrix sparsity patterns and stream function contours are displayed showing the
main features of the flow.
