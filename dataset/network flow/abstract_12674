Perfect simulation of an one-dimensional loss network on $\R$ with length
distribution $\pi$ and cable capacity $C$ is performed using the clan of
ancestors method. Domination of the clan of ancestors by a branching process
with longer memory improves the sufficient conditions for the perfect scheme to
be applicable.
