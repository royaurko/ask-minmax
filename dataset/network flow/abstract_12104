We study low-energy propagation modes on string network lattice.
Specifically, we consider an infinite two-dimensional regular hexagonal string
network and analyze the low frequency propagation modes on it. The fluctuation
modes tangent to the two-dimensional plane respect the spatial rotational
symmetry on the plane, and are described by Maxwell theory. The gauge symmetry
comes from the marginal deformation of changing the sizes of the loops of the
lattice. The effective Lorentz symmetry respected at low energy will be
violated at high energy.
