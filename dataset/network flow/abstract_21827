In this paper, we present a general scheme to construct integrable systems
based on realization in the coboundary dynamical Poisson groupoids of Etingof
and Varchenko. We also present a factorization method for solving the
Hamiltonian flows. To illustrate our scheme and factorization theory, we
consider a family of hyperbolic spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider models related to
affine Toda field theories and solve the equations of motion in a simple case.
