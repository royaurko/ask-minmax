WiMAX (acronym for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a
family of technical standards based on IEEE 802.16 standard that defines the
high speed connection through radio waves unlike DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
or other wired technology. It can provide coverage to remote rural areas of
several kilometers in radius, it's an adequate response to some rural or
inaccessible areas. WiMAX can provide point-to-point (P2P) and
point-to-multipoint (PMP) modes. In parallel, it was observed that, unlike the
traditional assessment methods for quality, nowadays, current research focuses
on the user perceived quality, the existing scheduling approaches take into
account the quality of service (QoS) and many technical parameters, but does
not take into account the quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we
present a scheduling algorithm to provide QoE in WiMAX network under Manhattan
Mobility. A new approach is proposed, particularly for the Best Effort (BE)
service class WiMAX, in this approach, if a packet loss occurs on a link
connection, the system then reduces the transmission rate of this connection to
obtain its minimum allowable transmission rate. The NS-2 simulation results
show that the QoE provided to users is enhanced in terms of throughput, jitter,
packet loss rate and delay.
