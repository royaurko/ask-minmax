In the present research, possibility of predicting average summer-monsoon
rainfall over India has been analyzed through Artificial Neural Network models.
In formulating the Artificial Neural Network based predictive model, three
layered networks have been constructed with sigmoid non-linearity. The models
under study are different in the number of hidden neurons. After a thorough
training and test procedure, neural net with three nodes in the hidden layer is
found to be the best predictive model.
