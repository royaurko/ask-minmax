The study of criminal networks using traces from heterogeneous communication
media is acquiring increasing importance in nowadays society. The usage of
communication media such as phone calls and online social networks leaves
digital traces in the form of metadata that can be used for this type of
analysis. The goal of this work is twofold: first we provide a theoretical
framework for the problem of detecting and characterizing criminal
organizations in networks reconstructed from phone call records. Then, we
introduce an expert system to support law enforcement agencies in the task of
unveiling the underlying structure of criminal networks hidden in communication
data. This platform allows for statistical network analysis, community
detection and visual exploration of mobile phone network data. It allows
forensic investigators to deeply understand hierarchies within criminal
organizations, discovering members who play central role and provide connection
among sub-groups. Our work concludes illustrating the adoption of our
computational framework for a real-word criminal investigation.
