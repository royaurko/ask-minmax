From energy conservation perspective inWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),
clustering of sensor nodes is a challenging task. Clustering technique in
routing protocols play a key role to prolong the stability period and lifetime
of the network. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new routing protocol
for WSNs. Our protocol; Divide-and-Rule (DR) is based upon static clustering
and dynamic Cluster Head (CH) selection technique. This technique selects fixed
number of CHs in each round instead of probabilistic selection of CH.
Simulation results show that DR protocol outperform its counterpart routing
protocols.
