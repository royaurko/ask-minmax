Hollerbach and Rudiger have reported a new type of magnetorotational
instability (MRI) in magnetized Taylor-Couette flow in the presence of combined
axial and azimuthal magnetic fields. The salient advantage of this "helical''
MRI (HMRI) is that marginal instability occurs at arbitrarily low magnetic
Reynolds and Lundquist numbers, suggesting that HMRI might be easier to realize
than standard MRI (axial field only). We confirm their results, calculate HMRI
growth rates, and show that in the resistive limit, HMRI is a weakly
destabilized inertial oscillation propagating in a unique direction along the
axis. But we report other features of HMRI that make it less attractive for
experiments and for resistive astrophysical disks. Growth rates are small and
require large axial currents. More fundamentally, instability of highly
resistive flow is peculiar to infinitely long or periodic cylinders: finite
cylinders with insulating endcaps are shown to be stable in this limit. Also,
keplerian rotation profiles are stable in the resistive limit regardless of
axial boundary conditions. Nevertheless, the addition of toroidal field lowers
thresholds for instability even in finite cylinders.
