Disordered networks of fragile elastic elements have been proposed as a model
of inner porous regions of large bones [Gunaratne et.al., cond-mat/0009221,
http://xyz.lanl.gov]. It is shown that the ratio $\Gamma$ of responses of such
a network to static and periodic strain can be used to estimate its ultimate
(or breaking) stress. Since bone fracture in older adults results from the
weakening of porous bone, we discuss the possibility of using $\Gamma$ as a
non-invasive diagnostic of osteoporotic bone.
