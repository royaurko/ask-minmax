The paper concerns selected rule modularization techniques. Three visual
methods for inference specification for modularized rule- bases are described:
Drools Flow, BPMN and XTT2. Drools Flow is a popular technology for workflow or
process modeling, BPMN is an OMG standard for modeling business processes, and
XTT2 is a hierarchical tab- ular system specification method. Because of some
limitations of these solutions, several proposals of their integration are
given.
