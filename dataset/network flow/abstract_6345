Path delays in IP networks are important metrics, required by network
operators for assessment, planning, and fault diagnosis. Monitoring delays of
all source-destination pairs in a large network is however challenging and
wasteful of resources. The present paper advocates a spatio-temporal Kalman
filtering approach to construct network-wide delay maps using measurements on
only a few paths. The proposed network cartography framework allows efficient
tracking and prediction of delays by relying on both topological as well as
historical data. Optimal paths for delay measurement are selected in an online
fashion by leveraging the notion of submodularity. The resulting predictor is
optimal in the class of linear predictors, and outperforms competing
alternatives on real-world datasets.
