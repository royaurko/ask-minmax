Conventionally, network migration models study competition between emerging
and incumbent technologies by considering the resulting increase in revenue and
associated cost of migration. We propose to advance the science in the existing
network migration models by considering additional critical factors, including
(i) synergistic relationships across multiple technologies, (ii) reduction in
operational expenditures (OpEx) as a reason to migrate, and, (iii) implications
of local network effects on migration decisions. To this end, we propose a
novel agent-based migration model considering these factors. Based on the
model, we analyze the case study of network migration to two emerging
networking paradigms, i.e., IETF Path Computation Element (PCE) and
Software-Defined Networking (SDN). We validate our model using extensive
simulations. Our results demonstrate the synergistic effects of migration to
multiple complementary technologies, and show that a technology migration may
be eased by the joint migration to multiple technologies. In particular, we
find that migration to SDN can be eased by joint migration to PCE, and that the
benefits derived from SDN are best exploited in combination with PCE, than by
itself.
