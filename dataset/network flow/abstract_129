The network flow optimization approach is offered for restoration of
grayscale and color images corrupted by noise. The Ising models are used as a
statistical background of the proposed method. The new multiresolution network
flow minimum cut algorithm, which is especially efficient in identification of
the maximum a posteriori estimates of corrupted images, is presented. The
algorithm is able to compute the MAP estimates of large size images and can be
used in a concurrent mode. We also describe the efficient solutions of the
problem of integer minimization of two energy functions for the Ising models of
gray-scale and color images.
