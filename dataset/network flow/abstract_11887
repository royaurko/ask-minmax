IR or near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a method used to identify a
compound or to analyze the composition of a material. Calibration of NIR
spectra refers to the use of the spectra as multivariate descriptors to predict
concentrations of the constituents. To build a calibration model,
state-of-the-art software predominantly uses linear regression techniques. For
nonlinear calibration problems, neural network-based models have proved to be
an interesting alternative. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of the
conventional neural network-based approach, the use of an ensemble of neural
network models. The individual neural networks are obtained by resampling the
available training data with bootstrapping or cross-validation techniques. The
results obtained for a realistic calibration example show that the
ensemble-based approach produces a significantly more accurate and robust
calibration model than conventional regression methods.
