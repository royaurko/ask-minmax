In this paper we analyze the bipartite network of countries and products from
UN data on country production. We define the country-country and
product-product projected networks and introduce a novel method of filtering
information based on elements' similarity. As a result we find that country
clustering reveals unexpected socio-geographic links among the most competing
countries. On the same footings the products clustering can be efficiently used
for a bottom-up classification of produced goods. Furthermore we mathematically
reformulate the "reflections method" introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann as a
fixpoint problem; such formulation highlights some conceptual weaknesses of the
approach. To overcome such an issue, we introduce an alternative methodology
(based on biased Markov chains) that allows to rank countries in a conceptually
consistent way. Our analysis uncovers a strong non-linear interaction between
the diversification of a country and the ubiquity of its products, thus
suggesting the possible need of moving towards more efficient and direct
non-linear fixpoint algorithms to rank countries and products in the global
market.
