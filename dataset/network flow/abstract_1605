We study in detail a critical line on the phase diagram of the Cho-Fisher
network model separating three different phases: metallic and two distinct
localized phases with different quantized thermal Hall conductances. This
system describes non-interacting quasiparticles in disordered superconductors
that have neither time-reversal nor spin-rotational invariance. We find that in
addition to a tricritical fixed point $W_T$ on that critical line there exist
an additional repulsive fixed point $W_N$ (where the vortex disorder
concentration $W_N<W_T$), which splits RG flow into opposite directions: toward
a clean Ising model at W=0 and toward $W_T$.
