A powerful experimental approach for investigating computation in networks of
biological neurons is the use of cultured dissociated cortical cells grown into
networks on a multi-electrode array. Such preparations allow investigation of
network development, activity, plasticity, responses to stimuli, and the
effects of pharmacological agents. They also exhibit whole-culture pathological
bursting; understanding the mechanisms that underlie this could allow creation
of more useful cell cultures and possibly have medical applications.
