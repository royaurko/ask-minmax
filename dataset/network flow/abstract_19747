Coherent large-scale circulations of turbulent thermal convection in air have
been studied experimentally in a rectangular box heated from below and cooled
from above using Particle Image Velocimetry. The hysteresis phenomenon in
turbulent convection was found by varying the temperature difference between
the bottom and the top walls of the chamber (the Rayleigh number was changed
within the range of $10^7 - 10^8$). The hysteresis loop comprises the one-cell
and two-cells flow patterns while the aspect ratio is kept constant ($A=2 -
2.23$). We found that the change of the sign of the degree of the anisotropy of
turbulence was accompanied by the change of the flow pattern. The developed
theory of coherent structures in turbulent convection (Elperin et al. 2002;
2005) is in agreement with the experimental observations. The observed coherent
structures are superimposed on a small-scale turbulent convection. The
redistribution of the turbulent heat flux plays a crucial role in the formation
of coherent large-scale circulations in turbulent convection.
