We present the results of a very large aspect ratio (42.6) numerical
simulation of fully compressible turbulent convection in a polytropic
atmosphere, and focus on the properties of large-scale flows. Mesoscale
patterns dominate the turbulent energy spectrum. We show that these structures,
which had already been observed in Boussinesq simulations by Cattaneo et al.
(2001), have a genuine convective origin and do not result directly from
collective interactions of the smaller scales of the flow, even though their
growth is strongly affected by nonlinear transfers. If this result is relevant
to the solar photosphere, it suggests that the dominant convective mode below
the Sun's surface may be at mesoscales.
