As the traffic load in cellular networks grows rapidly, future generation
cellular networks will involve multiple radio access technologies (RATs) over
different frequency bands. This paper studies the spectrum allocation problem
in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with multiple RATs over different bands
using the average packet sojourn time as performance metric. The framework
developed recently in [1] is generalized to incorporate multiple RATs. In
contrast to the licensed band, the queueing model for the unlicensed band
captures the lower spectral efficiency, reliability, and additional delay due
to contention and/or listen-before-talk requirements. Under mild assumptions,
we formulate the spectrum allocation problem as a convex optimization problem.
Solving this problem gives an effective and efficient solution for user
association and spectrum allocation over multiple RATs. Simulation results show
that in the heavy-traffic regime, the proposed scheme significantly outperforms
both orthogonal spectrum allocation and full-frequency-reuse allocation. In
addition, the optimal solution to the optimization problem matches the
intuition that users with relatively high traffic demand are mostly assigned to
licensed spectrum, while those with low traffic demand and less interference
are assigned to unlicensed spectrum.
