Random basketball routing (BR) \cite {Hwang} is a simple protocol that
integrates MAC and multihop routing in a cross-layer optimized manner. Due to
its lightness and performance, BR would be quite suitable for sensor networks,
where communication nodes are usually simple devices. In this paper, we
describe how we implemented BR in a ZigBee-based (IEEE 802.15.4) sensor
network. In \cite{Hwang}, it is verified that BR takes advantages of dynamic
environments (in particular, node mobility), however, here we focus on how BR
works under static situations. For implementation purposes, we add some
features such as destination RSSI measuring and loop-free procedure, to the
original BR. With implemented testbed, we compare the performance of BR with
that of the simplified AODV with CSMA/CA. The result is that BR has merits in
terms of number of hops to traverse the network. Considering the simple
structure of BR and its possible energy-efficiency, we can conclude that BR can
be a good candidate for sensor networks both under dynamic- and static
environments.
