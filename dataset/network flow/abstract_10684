We present analytical scaling laws for self-similar advection dominated
flows. The spectra from these systems range from 10$^{8}$ - 10$^{20}$ Hz, and
are determined by considering cooling of electrons through synchrotron,
bremsstrahlung, and Compton processes. We show that the spectra can be quite
accurately reproduced without detailed numerical calculations, and that there
is a strong testable correlation between the radio and X-ray fluxes from these
systems. We describe how different regions of the spectrum scale with the mass
of the accreting black hole, $M$, the accretion rate of the gas, $\dot{M}$, and
the equilibrium temperature of the electrons, $T_e$. We show that the universal
radio spectral index of 1/3 observed in most elliptical galaxies (Slee et al.
1994) is a natural consequence of self-absorbed synchrotron radiation from
these flows. We also give expressions for the total luminosity of these flows,
and the critical accretion rate, $\dot{M}_{crit}$, above which the advection
solutions cease to exist. We find that for most cases of interest the
equilibrium electron temperature is fairly insensitive to $M$, $\dot{M}$, and
parameters in the model. We apply these results to low luminosity black holes
in galactic nuclei. We show that the problem posed by Fabian & Canizares (1988)
of whether bright elliptical galaxies host dead quasars is resolved, as pointed
out recently by Fabian & Rees (1995), by considering advection-dominated flows.
