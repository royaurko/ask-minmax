Motivated by emerging applications from imaging processing, the heat flow of
a generalized $p$-harmonic map into spheres is studied for the whole spectrum,
$1\leq p<\infty$, in a unified framework. The existence of global weak
solutions is established for the flow using the energy method together with a
regularization and a penalization technique. In particular, a $BV$-solution
concept is introduced and the existence of such a solution is proved for the
1-harmonic map heat flow. The main idea used to develop such a theory is to
exploit the properties of measures of the forms $\cA\cdot\nab\bv$ and
$\cA\wedge\nab\bv$; which pair a divergence-$L^1$, or a divergence-measure,
tensor field $\cA$, and a $BV$-vector field $\bv$. Based on these analytical
results, a practical fully discrete finite element method is then proposed for
approximating weak solutions of the $p$-harmonic map heat flow, and the
convergence of the proposed numerical method is also established.
