This paper concerns the existence of global weak solutions to the barotropic
compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscosity coefficients. We
construct suitable approximate system which has smooth solutions satisfying the
energy inequality, the BD entropy one, and the Mellet-Vasseur type estimate.
Then, after adapting the compactness results due to Mellet-Vasseur [Comm.
Partial Differential Equations 32 (2007)], we obtain the global existence of
weak solutions to the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with
degenerate viscosity coefficients in two or three dimensional periodic domains
or whole space for large initial data. This, in particular, solved an open
problem in [P. L. Lions. Mathematical topics in fluid mechanics. Vol. 2.
