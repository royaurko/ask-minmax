Crosstalk is defined as the set of unwanted interactions among the different
entities of a network. Crosstalk is present in various degrees in every system
where information is transmitted through a means that is accessible by all the
individual units of the network. Using concepts from graph theory, we introduce
a quantifiable measure for sensitivity to crosstalk, and analytically derive
the structure of the networks in which it is minimized. It is shown that
networks with an inhomogeneous degree distribution are more robust to crosstalk
than corresponding homogeneous networks. We provide a method to construct the
graph with the minimum possible sensitivity to crosstalk, given its order and
size. Finally, for networks with a fixed degree sequence, we present an
algorithm to find the optimal interconnection structure among their vertices.
