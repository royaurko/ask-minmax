Primarily guided with the idea to express zero-time transitions by means of
temporal propositional language, we have developed a temporal logic where the
time flow is isomorphic to ordinal $\omega^2$ (concatenation of $\omega$ copies
of $\omega$). If we think of $\omega^2$ as lexicographically ordered
$\omega\times \omega$, then any particular zero-time transition can be
represented by states whose indices are all elements of some
$\{n\}\times\omega$. In order to express non-infinitesimal transitions, we have
introduced a new unary temporal operator $[\omega] $ ($\omega$-jump), whose
effect on the time flow is the same as the effect of $\alpha\mapsto
\alpha+\omega$ in $\omega^2$. In terms of lexicographically ordered
$\omega\times \omega$, $[\omega] \phi$ is satisfied in $\ < i,j\ >$-th time
instant iff $\phi$ is satisfied in $\ < i+1,0\ >$-th time instant. Moreover, in
order to formally capture the natural semantics of the until operator $\mathtt
U$, we have introduced a local variant $\mathtt u$ of the until operator. More
precisely, $\phi\,\mathtt u \psi$ is satisfied in $\ < i,j\ >$-th time instant
iff $\psi$ is satisfied in $\ < i,j+k\ >$-th time instant for some nonnegative
integer $k$, and $\phi$ is satisfied in $\ < i,j+l\ >$-th time instant for all
$0\leqslant l<k$. As in many of our previous publications, the leitmotif is the
usage of infinitary inference rules in order to achieve the strong
completeness.
