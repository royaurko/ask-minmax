In this paper, we present a new routing algorithm called "the Self Avoiding
Paths Routing Algorithm". Its application to traffic flow in scale-free
networks shows a great improvement over the so called "efficient routing"
protocol while at the same time maintaining a relatively low average packet
travel time. It has the advantage of minimizing path overlapping throughout the
network in a self consistent manner with a relatively small number of
iterations by maintaining an equilibrated path distribution especially among
the hubs. This results in a significant shifting of the critical packet
generation rate over which traffic congestion occurs, thus permitting the
network to sustain more information packets in the free flow state. The
performance of the algorithm is discussed both on a Bar\'abasi-Albert (BA)
network and real autonomous system (AS) network data.
