We study BPS domain walls of N=1 supergravity coupled to a chiral multiplet
and their Lorentz invariant vacua which can be viewed as critical points of BPS
equations and the scalar potential. Supersymmetry further implies that gradient
flows of BPS equations controlled by a holomorphic superpotential and the
Kaehler geometry are unstable near local maximum of the scalar potential,
whereas they are stable around local minimum and saddles of the scalar
potential. However, the analysis using RG flows shows that such gradient flows
do not always exist particularly in infrared region.
