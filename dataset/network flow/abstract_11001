We characterize the force state of shear-loaded granular matter by relating
the macroscopic stress to statistical properties of the force network. The
purely repulsive nature of the interaction between grains naturally provides an
upper bound for the sustainable shear stress, which we analyze using an
optimization procedure inspired by the so-called force network ensemble. We
establish a relation between the maximum possible shear resistance and the
friction coefficient between individual grains, and find that anisotropies of
the contact network (or the fabric tensor) only have a subdominant effect.
These results can be considered the hyperstatic limit of the force network
ensemble and we discuss possible implications for real systems. Finally, we
argue how force anisotropies can be related quantitatively to experimental
measurements of the effective elastic constants.
