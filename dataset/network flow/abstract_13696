We demonstrate that the prolate shape of the Uranium nucleus generates
anti-correlation between spectator asymmetry and initial state ellipticity of
the collision zone, providing a way to constrain the initial event shape in U+U
collisions. As an application, we show that this can be used to separate the
background contribution due to flow from the signals of chiral magnetic effect.
