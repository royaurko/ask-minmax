Harvesting energy from the radio-frequency (RF) signal is an exciting
solution to replenish energy in energy-constrained wireless networks. In this
paper, an amplify-and-forward (AF) based wireless relay network is considered,
where the relay nodes need to harvest energy from the source's RF signal to
forward information to the destination. To improve the performance of
information transmission, we propose two distributed relay selection protocols,
Maximum Harvested Energy (MHE) protocol and Maximum Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(MSNR) protocol. Then, we derive the outage probabilities of the system with
our proposed relay selection protocols and prove that the proposed selection
protocols indeed can improve the system performances and the MSNR protocol
outperforms the MHE protocol. Simulation results verify the analysis and
theorems. In addition, the effects of key system parameters are also
investigated via simulations.
