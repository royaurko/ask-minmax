As mobile network users look forward to the connectivity speeds of 5G
networks, service providers are facing challenges in complying with
connectivity demands without substantial financial investments. Network
Function Virtualization (NFV) is introduced as a new methodology that offers a
way out of this bottleneck. NFV is poised to change the core structure of
telecommunications infrastructure to be more cost-efficient. In this paper, we
introduce a Network Function Virtualization framework, and discuss the
challenges and requirements of its use in mobile networks. In particular, an
NFV framework in the virtual environment is proposed. Moreover, in order to
reduce signaling traffic and achieve better performance, this paper proposes a
criterion to bundle multiple functions of virtualized evolved packet-core in a
single physical device or a group of adjacent devices. The analysis shows that
the proposed grouping can reduce the network control traffic by 70 percent.
