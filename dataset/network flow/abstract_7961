We give an algorithmic introduction to Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs)
using a newly developed computational engine, LCS Tool. LCSs are most
repelling, attracting and shearing material lines that form the centerpieces of
observed tracer patterns in two-dimensional unsteady dynamical systems. LCS
Tool implements the latest geodesic theory of LCSs for two-dimensional flows,
uncovering key transport barriers in unsteady flow velocity data as explicit
solutions of differential equations. After a review of the underlying theory,
we explain the steps and numerical methods used by LCS Tool, and illustrate its
capabilities on three unsteady fluid flow examples.
