The dynamics of a packages diffusion process within a selforganized network
is analytically studied by means of an extended $f$% -spin facilitated kinetic
Ising model (Fredrickson-Andersen model) using a Fock-space representation for
the master equation. To map the three component system (active, passive and
packages cells) onto a lattice we apply two types of second quantized
operators. The active cells correspond to mobile states whereas the passive
cells correspond to immobile states of the Fredrickson-Andersen model. An
inherent cooperativity is included assuming that the local dynamics and
subsequently the local mobilities are restricted by the occupation of
neighboring cells. Depending on a temperature-like parameter $h^{-1}$
(interconnectivity) the diffusive process of the packages (information) can be
almost stopped, thus we get a well separation of the time regimes and a
quasi-localization for the intermediate range at low temperatures.
