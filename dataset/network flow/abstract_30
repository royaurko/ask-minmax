In this paper we consider random access wireless multi-hop mesh networks with
multi-packet reception capabilities where multiple flows are forwarded to the
gateways through node disjoint paths. We address the issue of aggregate
throughput optimal flow rate allocation with bounded packet delay guarantees
for flows exhibiting both intra- and inter-path interference. We propose a
distributed flow rate allocation scheme that formulates flow rate allocation as
an optimization problem and derive the conditions for non-convexity for an
illustrative topology. Furthermore we employ a simple model for the average
aggregate throughput achieved by all flows that captures both intra- and
inter-path interference. The proposed scheme is evaluated through NS-2
simulations of several random wireless scenarios. Simulation results reveal
that our model accurately captures the average aggregate throughput achieved by
all flows for all random scenarios employed. We also compare in terms of
average aggregate throughput our flow allocation scheme with the following
schemes: a scheme that assigns flows on paths on a round-robin fashion, one
that optimally utilizes the best path only and another one that assigns the
maximum possible flow on each path. Simulation results show that our scheme
achieves significantly higher average aggregate throughput from these schemes.
