We consider a particle diffusing in the y-direction, dy/dt=\eta(t), subject
to a transverse shear flow in the x-direction, dx/dt=f(y), where x \ge 0 and
x=0 is an absorbing boundary. We treat the class of models defined by f(y) =
\pm v_{\pm}(\pm y)^\alpha where the upper (lower) sign refers to y>0 (y<0). We
show that the particle survives with probability Q(t) \sim t^{-\theta} with
\theta = 1/4, independent of \alpha, if v_{+}=v_{-}. If v_{+} \ne v_{-},
however, we show that \theta depends on both \alpha and the ratio v_{+}/v_{-},
and we determine this dependence.
