Ranking the nodes' ability for spreading in networks is a fundamental problem
which relates to many real applications such as information and disease
control. In the previous literatures, a network decomposition procedure called
k-shell method has been shown to effectively identify the most influential
spreaders. In this paper, we find that the k-shell method have some limitations
when it is used to rank all the nodes in the network. We also find that these
limitations are due to considering only the links between the remaining nodes
(residual degree) while entirely ignoring all the links connecting to the
removed nodes (exhausted degree) when decomposing the networks. Accordingly, we
propose a mixed degree decomposition (MDD) procedure in which both the residual
degree and the exhausted degree are considered. By simulating the epidemic
process on the real networks, we show that the MDD method can outperform the
k-shell and the degree methods in ranking spreaders. Finally, the influence of
the network structure on the performance of the MDD method is discussed.
