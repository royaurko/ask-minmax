Intrigued by the capacity of random networks, we start by proving a max-flow
min-cut theorem that is applicable to any random graph obeying a suitably
defined independence-in-cut property. We then show that this property is
satisfied by relevant classes, including small world topologies, which are
pervasive in both man-made and natural networks, and wireless networks of dual
devices, which exploit multiple radio interfaces to enhance the connectivity of
the network. In both cases, we are able to apply our theorem and derive
max-flow min-cut bounds for network information flow.
