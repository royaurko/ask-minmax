We represent an algorithm reducing the $(M+1)$-dimensional nonlinear partial
differential equation (PDE) representable in the form of one-dimensional flow
$u_t + w_{x_1}(u,u_{x},u_{xx},\dots)=0$, (where $w$ is an arbitrary local
function of $u$ and its $x_i$-derivatives, $i=1,\dots,M$) to the family of
$M$-dimensional nonlinear PDEs $F(u,w)=0$, where $F$ is general (or particular)
solution of a certain second order two-dimensional nonlinear PDE. Particularly,
the $M$-dimensional PDE might be an ODE which, in some cases, may be integrated
yielding the explicite solutions to the original ($M+1$)-dimensional PDE.
Moreover, the spectral parameter may be introduced into the function $F$ which
yields a linear spectral equation associated with the original PDE. Simplest
examples of nonlinear PDEs with explicite solutions are given.
