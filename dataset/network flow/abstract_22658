We analyze the time series of CaII H-line obtained from Hinode/SOT on the
solar limb. The time-distance analysis shows that the axis of spicule undergos
quasi-periodic transverse displacement at different heights from the
photosphere. The mean period of transverse displacement is ~180 s and the mean
amplitude is 1 arcsec. Then, we solve the dispersion relation of magnetic tube
waves and plot the dispersion curves with upward steady flows. The theoretical
analysis shows that the observed oscillation may correspond to the fundamental
harmonic of standing kink waves.
