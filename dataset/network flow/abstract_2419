In this work, we investigate the ageing behavior of soft glassy solids of
aqueous suspension of laponite under shear flow. We observe that when an
imposed time is normalized by a dominating relaxation time of the system, the
rheological response at different ages shows superposition. Analysis of this
behavior suggests that the structural evolution with age under a deformation
field, as represented by the dependence of dominant relaxation mode on age,
becomes weaker as the system becomes progressively less homogeneous due to
enhanced attractive interactions caused by addition of salt. Creep-recovery
behavior at same elastic modulus shows more viscous dissipation for a system
having more salt, demonstrating increase in the mechanical fragility. This
study shows that an increase in the concentration of salt, which enhances
attractive interactions and causes greater inhomogeneity, leads to a state
wherein the particles are held together by weaker interactions. This work leads
to important insights into how microstructure affects the ageing dynamics. We
discuss the observed behavior in the context of ageing in colloidal glasses and
gels of aqueous suspension of laponite.
