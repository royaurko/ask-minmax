We study a Dirac fermion model with three kinds of disorder as well as a
marginal interaction which forms the critical line of $c=1$ conformal field
theory. Computing scaling equations by the use of a perturbative
renormalization group method, we investigate how such an interaction affects
the universality classes of disordered systems with non-interacting fermions.
We show that some specific fixed points are stable against an interaction,
whereas others are unstable and flow to new random critical points with a
finite interaction.
