We report an experimental study of the three-dimensional spatial structure of
the low frequency temperature oscillations in a cylindrical Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard
convection cell. It is found that thermal plumes are not emitted periodically,
but randomly and continuously, from the top and bottom plates. We further found
that the oscillation of the temperature field does not originate from the
boundary layers, but rather is a result of the horizontal motion of the hot
ascending and cold descending fluids being modulated by the twisting and
sloshing motion of the bulk flow field.
