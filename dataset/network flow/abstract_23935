Experimental observations of animal collective behavior have shown stunning
evidence for the emergence of large-scale cooperative phenomena resembling
phase transitions in physical systems. Indeed, quantitative studies have found
scale-free correlations and critical behavior consistent with the occurrence of
continuous, second-order phase transitions. The Standard Vicsek Model (SVM), a
minimal model of self-propelled particles in which their tendency to align with
each other competes with perturbations controlled by a noise term, appears to
capture the essential ingredients of critical flocking phenomena. In this
paper, we review recent finite-size scaling and dynamical studies of the SVM,
which present a full characterization of the continuous phase transition
through dynamical and critical exponents. We also present a complex network
analysis of SVM flocks and discuss the onset of ordering in connection with
XY-like spin models.
