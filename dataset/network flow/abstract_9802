The continuum theory of partially fluidized shear granular flows is tested
and calibrated using two dimensional soft particle molecular dynamics
simulations. The theory is based on the relaxational dynamics of the order
parameter that describes the transition between static and flowing regimes of
granular material. We define the order parameter as a fraction of static
contacts among all contacts between particles. We also propose and verify by
direct simulations the constitutive relation based on the splitting of the
shear stress tensor into a``fluid part'' proportional to the strain rate
tensor, and a remaining ``solid part''. The ratio of these two parts is a
function of the order parameter. The rheology of the fluid component agrees
well with the kinetic theory of granular fluids even in the dense regime. Based
on the hysteretic bifurcation diagram for a thin shear granular layer obtained
in simulations, we construct the ``free energy'' for the order parameter. The
theory calibrated using numerical experiments with the thin granular layer is
applied to the surface-driven stationary two dimensional granular flows in a
thick granular layer under gravity.
