We present a comprehensive rheological study of a suspension of
thermosensitive particles dispersed in water. The volume fraction of these
particles can be adjusted by the temperature of the system in a continuous
fashion. Due to the finite polydispersity of the particles (standard deviation:
17%), crystallization is suppressed and no fluid-crystal transition intervenes.
Hence, the moduli $G'$ and $G"$ in the linear viscoelastic regime as well as
the flow curves (shear stress $\sigma(\dot{\gamma})$ as the function of the
shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$) could be measured in the fluid region up to the
vicinity of the glass transition. Moreover, flow curves could be obtained over
a range of shear rates of 8 orders of magnitude while $G'$ and $G"$ could be
measured spanning over 9 orders of magnitude. Special emphasis has been laid on
precise measurements down to the smallest shear rates/frequencies. It is
demonstrated that mode-coupling theory generalized in the integration through
transients framework provides a full description of the flow curves as well as
the viscoelastic behavior of concentrated suspensions with a single set of
well-defined parameters.
