Cooperative multicast is an effective solution to address the bottleneck
problem of single-hop broadcast in wireless networks. By incorporating with the
random linear network coding technique, the existing schemes can reduce the
retransmission overhead significantly. However, the receivers may incur large
decoding delay and complexity due to the batch decoding scheme. In addition,
the dependency on the explicit feedback leads to scalability problem in larger
networks. In this paper, a cooperative multicast protocol named MWNCast is
proposed based on a novel moving window network coding technique. We prove
three properties of the proposed scheme. Firstly, without explicit feedback,
MWNCast can approach the cooperative capacity with the packet loss probability
dropping almost exponentially with the increase of window size. Secondly, the
average decoding delay of a receiver is on the order of
$O(\frac{1}{(1-\rho)^2})$ with respect to its traffic intensity $\rho$.
Thirdly, MWNCast can achieve the linear decoding complexity of $O(W)$ with
respect to the window size $W$. Simulation results show that MWNCast
outperforms the existing schemes by achieving better tradeoff between the
throughput and decoding delay, meanwhile keeping the packet loss probability
and decoding complexity at a very low levelwithout explicit feedback.
