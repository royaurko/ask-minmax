The description of free surface flows can often be simplified to thin film
(or lubrication) equations, when the slopes of the liquid-gas interface are
small. Here we present a long wavelength theory that remains fully quantitative
for steep interface slopes, by expanding about Stokes flow in a wedge. For
small capillary numbers, the variations of the interface slope are slow and can
be treated perturbatively. This geometry occurs naturally for flows with
contact lines: we quantify the difference with ordinary lubrication theory
through a numerical example and analytically recover the full Cox-Voinov
asymptotic solution.
