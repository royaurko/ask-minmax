Spatial and temporal noise power spectra of stripe patterns are investigated,
using as a model a Swift-Hohenberg equation with a stochastic term. In
particular, the analytical and numerical investigations show: 1) the temporal
noise spectra are of 1/f^alpha form, where alpha=1+(3-D)/4 with D the spatial
dimension of the system; 2) that the stochastic fluctuations of the stripe
position are sub-diffusive.
