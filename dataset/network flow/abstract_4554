We consider a dynamical network model in which two competitors have fixed and
different states, and each normal agent adjusts its state according to a
distributed consensus protocol. The state of each normal agent converges to a
steady value which is a convex combination of the competitors' states, and is
independent of the initial states of agents. This implies that the competition
result is fully determined by the network structure and positions of
competitors in the network. We compute an Influence Matrix (IM) in which each
element characterizing the influence of an agent on another agent in the
network. We use the IM to predict the bias of each normal agent and thus
predict which competitor will win. Furthermore, we compare the IM criterion
with seven node centrality measures to predict the winner. We find that the
competitor with higher Katz Centrality in an undirected network or higher
PageRank in a directed network is much more likely to be the winner. These
findings may shed new light on the role of network structure in competition and
to what extent could competitors adjust network structure so as to win the
competition.
