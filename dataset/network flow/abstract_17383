We study the KdV and Burgers nonlinear systems and show in a consistent way
that they can be mapped to each other through a strong requirement about their
evolutions's flows to be connected. We expect that the established mapping
between these particular systems should shed more light towards accomplishing
some unification's mechanism for KdV hierarchy's integrable systems.
