Mobile crowdsensing takes advantage of pervasive mobile devices to collect
and process data for a variety of applications (e.g., traffic monitoring,
spectrum sensing). In this study, a socially-aware crowdsensing system is
advocated, in which a cloud-based platform incentivizes mobile users to
participate in sensing tasks} by leveraging social trust among users, upon
receiving sensing requests. For this system, social trust assisted reciprocity
(STAR) - a synergistic marriage of social trust and reciprocity, is exploited
to design an incentive mechanism that stimulates users' participation.
  Given the social trust structure among users, the efficacy of STAR for
satisfying users' sensing requests is thoroughly investigated. Specifically, it
is first shown that all requests can be satisfied if and only if sufficient
social credit can be "transferred" from users who request more sensing service
than they can provide to users who can provide more than they request. Then
utility maximization for sensing services under STAR is investigated, and it is
shown that it boils down to maximizing the utility of a circulation flow in the
combined social graph and request graph. Accordingly, an algorithm that
iteratively cancels a cycle of positive weight in the residual graph is
developed, which computes the optimal solution efficiently, for both cases of
divisible and indivisible sensing service. Extensive simulation results
corroborate that STAR can significantly outperform the mechanisms using social
trust only or reciprocity only.
