Small groups of interneurons, abbreviated by CPG for central pattern
generators, are arranged into neural networks to generate a variety of core
bursting rhythms with specific phase-locked states, on distinct time scales,
that govern vital motor behaviors in invertebrates such as chewing, swimming,
etc. These movements in lower level animals mimic motions of organs in higher
animals due to evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. Hence, various neurological
diseases can be linked to abnormal movement of body parts that are regulated by
a malfunctioning CPG. In this paper, we, being inspired by recent experimental
studies of neuronal activity patterns recorded from a swimming motion CPG of
the sea slug {\it Melibe leonina}, examine a mathematical model of a 4-cell
network that can plausibly and stably underlie the observed bursting rhythm. We
develop a dynamical systems framework for explaining the existence and
robustness of phase-locked states in activity patterns produced by the modeled
CPGs. The proposed tools can be used for identifying core components for other
CPG networks with reliable bursting outcomes and specific phase relationships
between the interneurons. Our findings can be employed for identifying or
implementing the conditions for normal and pathological functioning of basic
CPGs of animals and artificially intelligent prosthetics that can regulate
various movements.
