We investigate the problem of signal transduction via a descriptive analysis
of the spatial organization of the complement of proteins exerting a certain
function within a cellular compartment. We propose a scheme to assign a
numerical value to individual proteins in a protein interaction network by
means of a simple optimization algorithm. We test our procedure against
datasets focusing on the proteomes in the neurite and soma compartments.
