We study a condition of favoring cooperation in a Prisoner's Dilemma game on
complex networks. There are two kinds of players: cooperators and defectors.
Cooperators pay a benefit b to their neighbors at a cost c, whereas defectors
only receive a benefit. The game is a death-birth process with weak selection.
Although it has been widely thought that b/c> <k> is a condition of favoring
cooperation, we find that b/c> <knn> is the condition. We also show that among
three representative networks, namely, regular, random, and scale-free, a
regular network favors cooperation the most whereas a scale-free network favors
cooperation the least. In an ideal scale-free network, cooperation is never
realized. Whether or not the scale-free network and network heterogeneity favor
cooperation depends on the details of the game, although it is occasionally
believed that these favor cooperation irrespective of the game structure.
