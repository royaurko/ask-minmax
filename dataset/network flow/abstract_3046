We consider the problem of two wireless networks operating on the same
(presumably unlicensed) frequency band. Pairs within a given network cooperate
to schedule transmissions, but between networks there is competition for
spectrum. To make the problem tractable, we assume transmissions are scheduled
according to a random access protocol where each network chooses an access
probability for its users. A game between the two networks is defined. We
characterize the Nash Equilibrium behavior of the system. Three regimes are
identified; one in which both networks simultaneously schedule all
transmissions; one in which the denser network schedules all transmissions and
the sparser only schedules a fraction; and one in which both networks schedule
only a fraction of their transmissions. The regime of operation depends on the
pathloss exponent $\alpha$, the latter regime being desirable, but attainable
only for $\alpha>4$. This suggests that in certain environments, rival wireless
networks may end up naturally cooperating. To substantiate our analytical
results, we simulate a system where networks iteratively optimize their access
probabilities in a greedy manner. We also discuss a distributed scheduling
protocol that employs carrier sensing, and demonstrate via simulations, that
again a near cooperative equilibrium exists for sufficiently large $\alpha$.
