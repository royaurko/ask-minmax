In the present work there was found a class of noninertial frames of
reference, which satisfy Einstein "equivalency" principle more than the known
noninertial frames - these are strongly swirling gaseous flows. Field intensity
and potential in the mentioned frames of reference are similar to the
corresponding values of natural gravity fields, but have the opposite sign.
Scalar curvature of this space is negative and proportional to absolute gas
temperature. There was obtained a new solution of Einstein equation which
refers to type I in Petrov's classification for cylindrical symmetrical
swirling ideal gas with variable angular velocity and nonzero pressure. The
equation of state has a more complicated form than the known equations of state
in theory of the vacuum.
