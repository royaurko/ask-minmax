Identifying the node spreading influence in networks is an important task to
optimally use the network structure and ensure the more efficient spreading in
information. In this paper, by taking into account the shortest distance
between a target node and the node set with the highest $k$-core value, we
present an improved method to generate the ranking list to evaluate the node
spreading influence. Comparing with the epidemic process results for four real
networks and the Barab\'{a}si-Albert network, the parameterless method could
identify the node spreading influence more accurately than the ones generated
by the degree $k$, closeness centrality, $k$-shell and mixed degree
decomposition methods. This work would be helpful for deeply understanding the
node importance of a network.
