We can establish a new picture, the perfect fluid sQGP core and the
dissipative hadronic corona, of the space-time evolution of produced matter in
relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC. It is also shown that the picture
works well also in the forward rapidity region through an analysis based on a
new class of the hydro-kinetic model and is a manifestation of deconfinement.
