We report on nonequilibrium interaction phenomena between adjacent but
electrostatically separated nanostructures in GaAs. A current flowing in one
externally biased nanostructure causes an excitation of electrons in a circuit
of a second nanostructure. As a result we observe a dc current generated in the
unbiased second nanostructure. The results can be qualitatively explained in
terms of acoustic phonon based energy transfer between the two mutually
isolated circuits.
