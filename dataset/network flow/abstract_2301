This paper discusses the effect of sequential conflict resolution maneuvers
of an infinite aircraft flow through a finite control volume. Aircraft flow
models are utilized to simulate traffic flows and determine stability.
Pseudo-random flow geometry is considered to determine airspace stability in a
more random airspace, where aircraft flows are spread over a given positive
width. The use of this aircraft flow model generates a more realistic flow
geometry. A set of upper bounds on the maximal aircraft deviation during
conflict resolution is derived. Also with this flow geometry it is proven that
these bounds are not symmetric, unlike the symmetric bounds derived in previous
papers for simpler flow configurations. Stability is preserved under sequential
conflict resolution algorithms for all flow geometries discussed in this paper.
