We study the space of Sasaki metrics on a compact manifold $M$ by introducing
an odd-dimensional analogue of the $J$-flow. That leads to the notion of
critical metric in the Sasakian context. In analogy to the K\"ahler case, on a
polarised Sasakian manifold there exists at most one normalised critical
metric. The flow is a tool for texting the existence of such a metric. We show
that some results proved by Chen in [7] can be generalised to the Sasakian
case. In particular, the Sasaki $J$-flow is a gradient flow which has always a
long-time solution minimising the distance on the space of Sasakian potentials
of a polarized Sasakian manifold. The flow minimises an energy functional whose
definition depends on the choice of a background transverse K\"ahler form
$\chi$. When $\chi$ has nonnegative transverse holomorphic bisectional
curvature, the flow converges to a critical Sasakian structure.
