The connected configuration space of a so called cylindric billiard system is
a flat torus minus finitely many spherical cylinders. The dynamical system
describes the uniform motion of a point particle in this configuration space
with specular reflections at the boundaries of the removed cylinders. It is
proven here that under a certain geometric condition --- slightly stronger than
the necessary condition presented in [S-Sz(1998)] --- a cylindric billiard flow
is completely hyperbolic. As a consequence, every hard ball system is
completely hyperbolic --- a result strengthening the theorem of [S-Sz(1999)].
