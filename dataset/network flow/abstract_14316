We present a hydrodynamic assessment of preliminary particle spectra observed
in Au+Au collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV. The hadronic part of the
underlying equation of state is based on explicit conservation of (measured)
particle ratios throughout the resonance gas stage after chemical freezeout by
employing chemical potentials for stable mesons, nucleons and anti-nucleons. We
find that under these conditions the data (in particular the proton spectra)
favor a low freeze-out temperature of around 100 MeV. Furthermore we show that
through inclusion of a moderate pre-hydrodynamic transverse flow field the
shape of the spectra improves with respect to the data. The effect of the
initial transverse boost on elliptic flow and the freeze-out geometry of the
system is also elucidated.
