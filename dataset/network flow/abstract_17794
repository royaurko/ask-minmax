Given a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ and a Morse-Smale
function, there are finitely many $n$-part broken trajectories of the negative
gradient flow. We show that if the manifold admits a hyperbolic metric, then
the number of $n$-part broken trajectories is always at least the hyperbolic
volume. The proof combines known theorems in Morse theory with lemmas of Gromov
about simplicial volumes of stratified spaces.
