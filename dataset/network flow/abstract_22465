The object of study in this paper is the on-shell scattering matrix $S(E)$ of
the Schr\"odinger operator with the potential satisfying assumptions typical in
the theory of shape resonances. We study the spectrum of $S(E)$ in the
semiclassical limit when the energy parameter $E$ varies from
$E_\text{res}-\varepsilon$ to $E_\text{res}+\varepsilon$, where $E_\text{res}$
is a real part of a resonance, and $\varepsilon$ is sufficiently small. The
main result of our work describes the spectral flow of the scattering matrix
through a given point on the unit circle. This result is closely related to the
Breit-Wigner effect.
