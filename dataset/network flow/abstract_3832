We propose a cyclic coefficient $R$ which represents the cyclic
characteristics of complex networks. If the network forms a perfect tree-like
structure then $R$ becomes zero. The larger value of $R$ represents that the
network is more cyclic. We measure the cyclic coefficients and the
distributions of the local cyclic coefficient for both various real networks
and the representative network models and characterize the cyclic structures of
them.
