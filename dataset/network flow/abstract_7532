We study the analog of the Yang-Mills heat flow on the moduli space of framed
bundles on a cut surface. Existence and convergence of the heat flow give a
stratification of Morse type invariant under the action of the loop group. We
use the stratification to prove versions of Kahler quantization commutes with
reduction and Kirwan surjectivity.
