A large number of complex systems find a natural abstraction in the form of
weighted networks whose nodes represent the elements of the system and the
weighted edges identify the presence of an interaction and its relative
strength. In recent years, the study of an increasing number of large scale
networks has highlighted the statistical heterogeneity of their interaction
pattern, with degree and weight distributions which vary over many orders of
magnitude. These features, along with the large number of elements and links,
make the extraction of the truly relevant connections forming the network's
backbone a very challenging problem. More specifically, coarse-graining
approaches and filtering techniques are at struggle with the multiscale nature
of large scale systems. Here we define a filtering method that offers a
practical procedure to extract the relevant connection backbone in complex
multiscale networks, preserving the edges that represent statistical
significant deviations with respect to a null model for the local assignment of
weights to edges. An important aspect of the method is that it does not
belittle small-scale interactions and operates at all scales defined by the
weight distribution. We apply our method to real world network instances and
compare the obtained results with alternative backbone extraction techniques.
