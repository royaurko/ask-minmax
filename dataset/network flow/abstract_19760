The fluidic behavior of water at the micro/nano scale is studied by using of
single DNA molecules as a model system. Stable curved DNA patterns with spans
about one micron were generated by using of water flows, and observed by Atomic
Force Microscopy. By rigorously comparing the numerical simulation results with
these patterns, it is suggested that the form of the macroscopic hydrodynamic
equation still works quantitatively well on the fluid flows at the nanoscale.
The molecular effects, however, are still apparent that the effective viscosity
of the adjacent water is considerably larger than its bulk value. Our
observation is also helpful to understand of the dynamics of biomolecules in
solutions from nanoscale to microscale.
