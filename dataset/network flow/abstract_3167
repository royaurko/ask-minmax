This article examines the evolution of routing protocols for intermittently
connected ad hoc networks and discusses the trend toward social-based routing
protocols. A survey of current routing solutions is presented, where routing
protocols for opportunistic networks are classified based on the network graph
employed. The need to capture performance tradeoffs from a multi-objective
perspective is highlighted.
