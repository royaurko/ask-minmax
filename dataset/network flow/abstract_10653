Solving the shortest path and the min-cut problems are key in achieving high
performance and robust communication networks. Those problems have often beeny
studied in deterministic and independent networks both in their original
formulations as well as in several constrained variants. However, in real-world
networks, link weights (e.g., delay, bandwidth, failure probability) are often
correlated due to spatial or temporal reasons, and these correlated link
weights together behave in a different manner and are not always additive.
  In this paper, we first propose two correlated link-weight models, namely (i)
the deterministic correlated model and (ii) the (log-concave) stochastic
correlated model. Subsequently, we study the shortest path problem and the
min-cut problem under these two correlated models. We prove that these two
problems are NP-hard under the deterministic correlated model, and even cannot
be approximated to arbitrary degree in polynomial time. However, these two
problems are polynomial-time solvable under the (constrained) nodal
deterministic correlated model, and can be solved by convex optimization under
the (log-concave) stochastic correlated model.
