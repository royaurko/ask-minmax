We describe azimuth structure commonly associated with elliptic and directed
flow in the context of 2D angular autocorrelations for the purpose of precise
separation of so-called nonflow (mainly minijets) from flow. We extend the
Fourier-transform description of azimuth structure to include power spectra and
autocorrelations related by the Wiener-Khintchine theorem. We analyze several
examples of conventional flow analysis in that context and question the
relevance of reaction plane estimation to flow analysis. We introduce the 2D
angular autocorrelation with examples from data analysis and describe a
simulation exercise which demonstrates precise separation of flow and nonflow
using the 2D autocorrelation method. We show that an alternative correlation
measure based on Pearson's normalized covariance provides a more intuitive
measure of azimuth structure.
