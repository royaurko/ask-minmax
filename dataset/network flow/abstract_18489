The graph layouts used for complex network studies have been mainly been
developed to improve visualization. If we interpret the layouts in metric
spaces such as Euclidean ones, however, the embedded spatial information can be
a valuable cue for various purposes. In this work, we focus on the navigational
properties of spatial graphs. We use an recently user-centric navigation
protocol to explore spatial layouts of complex networks that are optimal for
navigation. These layouts are generated with a simple simulated annealing
optimization technique. We compared these layouts to others targeted at better
visualization. We discuss the spatial statistical properties of the optimized
layouts for better navigability and its implication.
