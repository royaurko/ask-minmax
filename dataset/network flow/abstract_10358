The Hubble Space Telescope composite quasar spectra presented in Telfer et
al. show a significant deficit of emission in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) for
the radio loud component of the quasar population (RLQs), compared to the radio
quiet component of the quasar population (RQQs). The composite quasar continuum
emission between 1100 \AA\, and $\sim$580 \AA\, is generally considered to be
associated with the innermost regions of the accretion flow onto the central
black hole. The deficit between 1100 \AA\, and 580 \AA\, in RLQs has a
straightforward interpretation as a missing or a suppressed innermost region of
local energy dissipation in the accretion flow. It is proposed that this can be
the result of islands of large scale magnetic flux in RLQs that are located
close to the central black hole that remove energy from the accretion flow as
Poynting flux (sometimes called magnetically arrested accretion). These
magnetic islands are natural sites for launching relativistic jets. Based on
the Telfer et al. data and the numerical simulations of accretion flows in
Penna et al., the magnetic islands are concentrated between the event horizon
and an outer boundary of $<2.8 M$ (in geometrized units) for rapidly rotating
black holes and $< 5.5M$ for modestly rotating black holes.
