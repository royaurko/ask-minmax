We show that the renormalization group flows of the massless superstring
modes in the presence of fluctuating D-branes satisfy the equations of fluid
dynamics.In particular, we show that the D-brane's U(1) field is related to the
velocity function in the Navier-Stokes equation while the dilaton plays the
role of the passive scalar advected by the turbulent flow. This leads us to
suggest a possible isomorphism between the off-shell superstring theory in the
presence of fluctuating branes and the fluid mechanical degrees of freedom.
