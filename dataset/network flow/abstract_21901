We present an exactly solvable model for queue dynamics. Our model is very
simple but provides the essential property for such dynamics. As an example,
the model has the traveling cluster solution as well as the homogeneous flow
solution. The model is the limiting case of Optimal Velocity (OV) model, which
is proposed for the car following model to induce traffic jam spontaneously.
