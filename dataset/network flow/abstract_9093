We describe algorithms for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of
user knowledge and statistical data. The algorithms have two components: a
scoring metric and a search procedure. The scoring metric takes a network
structure, statistical data, and a user's prior knowledge, and returns a score
proportional to the posterior probability of the network structure given the
data. The search procedure generates networks for evaluation by the scoring
metric. Our contributions are threefold. First, we identify two important
properties of metrics, which we call event equivalence and parameter
modularity. These properties have been mostly ignored, but when combined,
greatly simplify the encoding of a user's prior knowledge. In particular, a
user can express her knowledge-for the most part-as a single prior Bayesian
network for the domain. Second, we describe local search and annealing
algorithms to be used in conjunction with scoring metrics. In the special case
where each node has at most one parent, we show that heuristic search can be
replaced with a polynomial algorithm to identify the networks with the highest
score. Third, we describe a methodology for evaluating Bayesian-network
learning algorithms. We apply this approach to a comparison of metrics and
search procedures.
