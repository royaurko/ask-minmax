We study, within the Nambu-Goto approximation, the stability of massive
string junctions under the influence of the tensions of three strings joining
together in a Y-type configuration. The relative angle $\beta$ between the
strings at the junction is in general time-dependent and its evolution can lead
to zipping or unzipping of the three-string configuration. We find that these
configurations are stable under deformations of the tension balance condition
at the junction. The angle $\beta$ relaxes at its equilibrium value and the
junction grows relativistically. We then discuss other potential "unzipping
agents" including monopole/string forces for long strings and curvature for
loops, and we investigate specific solutions exhibiting decelerated zipping and
unzipping of the Y-junction. These results provide motivation for incorporating
the effects of realistic string interactions in network evolution models with
string junctions.
