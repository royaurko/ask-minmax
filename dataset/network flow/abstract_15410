The ability to design a transport network such that commodities are brought
from suppliers to consumers in a steady, optimal, and stable way is of great
importance for nowadays distribution systems. In this Letter, by using the
circuit laws of Kirchhoff and Ohm, we provide the exact capacities of the edges
that an optimal supply-demand network should have to operate stably under
perturbations. The perturbations we consider are the evolution of the
connecting topology, the decentralisation of hub sources or sinks, and the
intermittence of suppliers/consumers characteristics. We analyse these
conditions and the impact of our results, both on the current UK power-grid
structure and on numerically generated evolving archetypal network topologies.
