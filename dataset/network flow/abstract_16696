It has been speculated that cosmic string networks could produce ultra-high
energy cosmic rays as a by-product of their evolution. By making use of recent
work on the evolution of such networks, it will be shown that the flux of
cosmic rays from cosmologically useful, that is GUT scale strings, is too small
to be used as a test for strings with any foreseeable technology.
