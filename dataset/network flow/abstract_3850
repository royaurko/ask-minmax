We propose a network characterization of combinatorial fitness landscapes by
adapting the notion of inherent networks proposed for energy surfaces. We use
the well-known family of NK landscapes as an example. In our case the inherent
network is the graph where the vertices represent the local maxima in the
landscape, and the edges account for the transition probabilities between their
corresponding basins of attraction. We exhaustively extracted such networks on
representative small NK landscape instances, and performed a statistical
characterization of their properties. We found that most of these network
properties can be related to the search difficulty on the underlying NK
landscapes with varying values of K.
