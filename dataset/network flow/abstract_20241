In this article, results have been presented for the two-time correlation
functions for a free and a harmonically confined Brownian particle in a simple
shear flow. For a free Brownian particle, the motion along the direction of
shear exhibit two distinct dynamics, with the mean-square-displacement being
diffusive at short times while at late times scales as $t^3$. In contrast the
cross-correlation $\la x(t) y(t) \ra $ scales quadratically for all times. In
the case of a harmonically trapped Brownian particle, the
mean-square-displacement exhibits a plateau determined by the strength of the
confinement and the shear. Further, the analysis is extended to a chain of
Brownian particles interacting via a harmonic and a bending potential. Finally,
the persistence probability is constructed from the two-time correlation
functions.
