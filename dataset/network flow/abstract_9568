Wireless sensor network comprises of small sensor nodes with limited
resources. Clustered networks have been proposed in many researches to reduce
the power consumption in sensor networks. LEACH is one of the most interested
techniques that offer an efficient way to minimize the power consumption in
sensor networks. However, due to the characteristics of restricted resources
and operation in a hostile environment, WSNs are subjected to numerous threats
and are vulnerable to attacks. This research proposes a solution that can be
applied on LEACH to increase the level of security. In Watchdog-LEACH, some
nodes are considered as watchdogs and some changes are applied on LEACH
protocol for intrusion detection. Watchdog-LEACH is able to protect against a
wide range of attacks and it provides security, energy efficiency and memory
efficiency. The result of simulation shows that in comparison to LEACH, the
energy overhead is about 2% so this method is practical and can be applied to
WSNs.
