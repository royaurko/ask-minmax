We reveal a discontinuous transition in the saturated flux for aeolian
saltation by simulating explicitly particle motion in turbulent flow. The
discontinuity is followed by a coexistence interval with two metastable
solutions. The modification of the wind profile due to momentum exchange
exhibits a second maximum at high shear strength. The saturated flux depends on
the strength of the wind as $q_s=q_0+A(u_*-u_t)(u_*^2+u_t^2)$.
