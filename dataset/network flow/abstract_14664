We present the results on elliptic flow with multi-strange baryons produced
in Pb-Pb collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 TeV. The analysis is performed with
the ALICE detector at LHC. Multi-strange baryons are reconstructed via their
decay topologies and the v_2 values are analyzed with the two-particle scalar
product method. The p_T differential v_2 values are compared to the VISH2+1
model calculation and to the STAR measurements at 200 GeV in Au+Au collisions.
We found that the model describes \Xi and \Omega v_2 measurements within
experimental uncertainties. The differential flow of \Xi and \Omega is similar
to the STAR measurements at 200 GeV in Au+Au collisions.
