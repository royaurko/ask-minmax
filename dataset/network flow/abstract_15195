We solve the Unanimity Rule on networks with exponential, uniform and
scalefree degree distributions. In particular we arrive at equations relating
the asymptotic number of nodes in one of two states to the initial fraction of
nodes in this state. The solutions for exponential and uniform networks are
exact, the approximation for the scalefree case is in perfect agreement with
simulation results. We use these solutions to provide a theoretical
understanding for experimental data on biodiversity loss in foodwebs, which is
available for the three network types discussed. The model allows in principle
to estimate the critical value of species that have to be removed from the
system to induce its complete collapse.
