We model information traffic on scale-free networks by introducing the
bandwidth as the delivering ability of links. We focus on the effects of
bandwidth on the packet delivering ability of the traffic system to better
understand traffic dynamic in real network systems. Such ability can be
measured by a phase transition from free flow to congestion. Two cases of node
capacity C are considered, i.e., C=constant and C is proportional to the node's
degree. We figured out the decrease of the handling ability of the system
together with the movement of the optimal local routing coefficient $\alpha_c$,
induced by the restriction of bandwidth. Interestingly, for low bandwidth, the
same optimal value of $\alpha_c$ emerges for both cases of node capacity. We
investigate the number of packets of each node in the free flow state and
provide analytical explanations for the optimal value of $\alpha_c$. Average
packets traveling time is also studied. Our study may be useful for evaluating
the overall efficiency of networked traffic systems, and for allevating traffic
jam in such systems.
