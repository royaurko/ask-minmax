Steady accretion of a radiating gas onto a central mass point is described
and compared to classic Bondi accretion. Radiation losses are essential for
accretion flows to be observed. Unlike Bondi flows, radiating Bondi flows pass
through a sonic point at a finite radius and become supersonic near the center.
The morphology of all radiating Bondi flows is described by a single
dimensionless parameter. In radiating Bondi flows the mass accretion rate
varies approximately as the first power of the central mass -- this differs
significantly from the quadratic dependence on the central mass in classical
Bondi flows. Mass accretion rates onto galaxy or cluster-centered black holes
estimated from traditional and radiating Bondi flows are significantly
different. In radiating Bondi flows the gas temperature increases at large
radii, as in the cores of many galaxy groups and clusters, allowing radiating
Bondi flows to merge naturally with gas arriving from their cluster
environments. Some radiating flows cool completely before reaching the center
of the flow, and this also occurs in cooling site flows in which there is no
central gravitating mass.
