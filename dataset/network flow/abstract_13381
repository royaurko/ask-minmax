We prove that multi-soliton solutions of the Toda lattice are both linearly
and nonlinearly stable. Our proof uses neither the inverse spectral method nor
the Lax pair of the model but instead studies the linearization of the
B\"acklund} transformation which links the ($m-1$)-soliton solution to the
$m$-soliton solution. We use this to construct a conjugation between the Toda
flow linearized about an $m$-solition solution and the Toda flow linearized
about the zero solution, whose stability properties can be determined by
explicit calculation.
