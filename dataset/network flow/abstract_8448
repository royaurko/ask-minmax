Over the years, communication speed of networks has increased from a few Kbps
to several Mbps, as also the bandwidth demand, Communication Protocols, however
have not improved to that extent. With the advent of Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (WDM), it is now possible to "tune" protocols to current and
future demands. The purpose of this paper is to evolve a High Speed Network
architecture, which will cater to the needs of bandwidth-consuming
applications, such as voice, video and high definition image transmission.
