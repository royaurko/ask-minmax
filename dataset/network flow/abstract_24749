The distribution system problems, such as planning, loss minimization, and
energy restoration, usually involve the phase balancing or network
reconfiguration procedures. The determination of an optimal phase balance is,
in general, a combinatorial optimization problem. This paper proposes a novel
reconfiguration of the phase balancing using the fuzzy logic and the
combinatorial optimization-based implementation step back to back. Input to the
fuzzy step is the total load per phase of the feeders. Output of the fuzzy step
is the load change values, negative value for load releasing and positive value
for load receiving. The output of the fuzzy step is the input to the load
changing system. The load changing system uses combinatorial optimization
techniques to translate the change values (kW) into number of load points and
then selects the specific load points. It also performs the inter-changing of
the load points between the releasing and the receiving phases in an optimal
fashion. Application results using the distribution feeder network of South
Africa are presented in this paper.
