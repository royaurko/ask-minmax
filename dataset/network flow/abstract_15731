Last level cache management and core interconnection network play important
roles in performance and power consumption in multicore system. Large scale
chip multicore uses mesh interconnect widely due to scalability and simplicity
of the mesh interconnection design. As interconnection network occupied
significant area and consumes significant percent of system power, bufferless
network is an appealing alternative design to reduce power consumption and
hardware cost. We have designed and implemented a simulator for simulation of
distributed cache management of large chip multicore where cores are connected
using bufferless interconnection network. Also, we have redesigned and
implemented the our simulator which is a GPU compatible parallel version of the
same simulator using CUDA programming model. We have simulated target large
chip multicore with up to 43,000 cores and achieved up to 25 times speedup on
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 690 GPU over serial simulation.
