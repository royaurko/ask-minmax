Comment on Group method analysis of magneto-elastico-viscous flow along a
semi-infinite flat plate with heat transfer,Helal and Abd-el-Malek, Journal of
Computational and Applied Mathematics 173 (2005) 199-210.
  In the above paper the contributors treat the boundary layer flow of a elasto-
viscous liquid along an infinite plate in the presence of a transverse magnetic
field. The plate temperature is higher than the ambient fluid temperature. The
boundary layer equations are transformed into ordinary ones using the group
theory and subsequently are solved numerically. Velocity, temperature, shear
stress and heat transfer profiles are presented for values of magnetic
parameter M=0, 0.5 and 1. This is an interesting work but there are some
fundamental errors which are presented below.
