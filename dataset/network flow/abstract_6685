In this work we analyzed the relationships between powerful politicians and
businessmen of Chile in order to study the phenomenon of social power. We
developed our study according to Complex Network Theory but also using
traditional sociological theories of Power and Elites. Our analyses suggest
that the studied network displays common properties of Complex Networks, such
as scaling in connectivity distribution, properties of small-world networks,
and modular structure, among others. We also observed that social power (a
proposed metric is presented in this work) is also distributed inhomogeneously.
However, the most interesting observation is that this inhomogeneous power and
connectivity distribution, among other observed properties, may be the result
of a dynamic and unregulated process of network growth in which powerful people
tend to link to similar others. The compatibility between people, increasingly
selective as the network grows, could generate the presence of extremely
powerful people, but also a constant inequality of power where the difference
between the most powerful is the same as among the least powerful. Our results
are also in accordance with sociological theories.
