Collecting information about user activity in peer-to-peer systems is a key
but challenging task. We describe here a distributed platform for doing so on
the eDonkey network, relying on a group of honeypot peers which claim to have
certain files and log queries they receive for these files. We then conduct
some measurements with typical scenarios and use the obtained data to analyze
the impact of key parameters like measurement duration, number of honeypots
involved, and number of advertised files. This illustrates both the possible
uses of our measurement system, and the kind of data one may collect using it.
