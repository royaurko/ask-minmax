The paper presents a simple probabilistic analysis of the energy consumption
in preamble sampling MAC protocols. We validate the analytical results with
simulations. We compare the classical MAC protocols (B-MAC and X-MAC) with
LAMAC, a method proposed in a companion paper. Our analysis highlights the
energy savings achievable with LA-MAC with respect to B-MAC and X-MAC. It also
shows that LA-MAC provides the best performance in the considered case of high
density networks under traffic congestion.
