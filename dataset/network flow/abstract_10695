Using the black hole transient X-ray source A0620-00 as an example we study
the physical interplay of three theoretical constituents for modelling these
transient sources: (1) the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) onto the
central black hole, (2) the evaporation of matter from the cool outer disk
forming a coronal flow and (3) standard disk evolution leading to outburst
cycles by accretion disk instability (dwarf nova mechanism).
  We investigate the evolution of accretion disks during quiescence including
the evaporation of gas in the inner part of the disk. About 20% of the matter
is lost in a wind from the corona. The mass flow rate obtained from our model
for the coronal flow towards the black hole, is about half of the matter
flowing over from the companion star. It agrees with the rate independently
derived from the ADAF spectral fits by Narayan et al. (1997). About one third
of the matter accumulates in the outer cool disk. The computed disk evolution
is consistent with the observational data from the outburst in 1975. The
evolution of the accretion disk until the instability is reached shows that the
critical surface density can not be reached for rates only slightly less than
the rate derived here for A0620-00. Systems with such accretion rates would be
globally stable, suggesting that many such faint permanently quiescent black
hole X-ray binaries exist.
