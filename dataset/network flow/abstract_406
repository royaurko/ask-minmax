This tutorial summarizes recent advances in the convex relaxation of the
optimal power flow (OPF) problem, focusing on structural properties rather than
algorithms. Part I presents two power flow models, formulates OPF and their
relaxations in each model, and proves equivalence relations among them. Part II
presents sufficient conditions under which the convex relaxations are exact.
