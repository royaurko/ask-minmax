Understanding the complex behavior of pedestrians walking in crowds is a
challenge for both science and technology. In particular, obtaining reliable
models for crowd dynamics, capable of exhibiting qualitatively and
quantitatively the observed emergent features of pedestrian flows, may have a
remarkable impact for matters as security, comfort and structural
serviceability. Aiming at a quantitative understanding of basic aspects of
pedestrian dynamics, extensive and high-accuracy measurements of pedestrian
trajectories have been performed. More than 100.000 real-life, time-resolved
trajectories of people walking along a trafficked corridor in a building of the
Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands, have been recorded. A
measurement strategy based on Microsoft Kinect\texttrademark has been used; the
trajectories of pedestrians have been analyzed as ensemble data. The main
result consists of a statistical descriptions of pedestrian characteristic
kinematic quantities such as positions and fundamental diagrams, possibly
conditioned to local crowding status (e.g., one or more pedestrian(s) walking,
presence of co-flows and counter-flows).
