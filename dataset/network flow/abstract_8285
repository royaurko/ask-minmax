We study vibrational modes and spectrum of a model system of atoms and
springs on a scale-free network in order to understand the nature of
excitations with many degrees of freedom on the scale-free network. We assume
that the atoms and springs are distributed as nodes and links of a scale-free
network, assigning the mass $M_{i}$ and the specific oscillation frequency
$\omega_{i}$ of the $i$-th atom and the spring constant $K_{ij}$ between the
$i$-th and $j$-th atoms.
