We carry out an analytical study of laminar circular hydraulic jumps, in
generalized-Newtonian fluids obeying the two-parametric power-law model of
Ostwald-de Waele. Under the boundary-layer approximation we obtained exact
expressions determining the flow, an implicit relation for the jump radius is
derived. Corresponding results for Newtonian fluids can be retrieved as a
limiting case for the flow behavior index n=1, predictions are made for fluids
deviating from Newtonian behavior.
