The scope of this project's work focuses on the research and prototyping of
the extension of the Distributed MARF such that its services can be managed
through the most popular management protocol familiarly, SNMP. The rationale
behind SNMP vs. MARF's proprietary management protocols, is that can be
integrated with the use of common network service and device management, so the
administrators can manage MARF nodes via a already familiar protocol, as well
as monitor their performance, gather statistics, set desired configuration,
etc. perhaps using the same management tools they've been using for other
network devices and application servers.
