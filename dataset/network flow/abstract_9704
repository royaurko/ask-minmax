Benford's Law states that the frequency of first digits of numbers in
naturally occurring systems is not evenly distributed. Numbers beginning with a
1 occur roughly 30\% of the time, and are six times more common than numbers
beginning with a 9. We show that Benford's Law applies to social and behavioral
features of users in online social networks. We consider social data from five
major social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Pinterest, and Live
Journal. We show that the distribution of first significant digits of friend
and follower counts for users in these systems follow Benford's Law. The same
holds for the number of posts users make. We extend this to egocentric
networks, showing that friend counts among the people in an individual's social
network also follow the expected distribution. We discuss how this can be used
to detect suspicious or fraudulent activity online and to validate datasets.
