We study partial analyticity of solutions to elliptic systems and analyticity
of level sets of solutions to nonlinear elliptic systems. We consider several
applications, including analyticity of flow lines for bounded stationary
solutions to the 2-d Euler equation, and analyticity of water waves with and
without surface tension.
