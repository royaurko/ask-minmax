To enjoy more social network services, users nowadays are usually involved in
multiple online social networks simultaneously. The shared users between
different networks are called anchor users, while the remaining unshared users
are named as non-anchor users. Connections between accounts of anchor users in
different networks are defined as anchor links and networks partially aligned
by anchor links can be represented as partially aligned networks. In this
paper, we want to predict anchor links between partially aligned social
networks, which is formally defined as the partial network alignment problem.
The partial network alignment problem is very difficult to solve because of the
following two challenges: (1) the lack of general features for anchor links,
and (2) the "one-to-one$_\le$" (one to at most one) constraint on anchor links.
To address these two challenges, a new method PNA (Partial Network Aligner) is
proposed in this paper. PNA (1) extracts a set of explicit anchor adjacency
features and latent topological features for anchor links based on the anchor
meta path concept and tensor decomposition techniques, and (2) utilizes the
generic stable matching to identify the non-anchor users to prune the redundant
anchor links attached to them. Extensive experiments conducted on two
real-world partially aligned social networks demonstrate that PNA can solve the
partial network alignment problem very well and outperform all the other
comparison methods with significant advantages.
