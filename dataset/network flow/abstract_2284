We consider a gradient flow related to the mean field type equation. First,
we show that this flow exists for all time. Next, we prove a compactness result
for this flow allowing us to get, under suitable hypothesis on its energy, the
convergence of the flow to a solution of the mean field type equation. We also
get a divergence result if the energy of the initial data is largely negative.
