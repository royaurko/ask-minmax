A more connected world has brought major consequences such as facilitate the
spread of diseases all over the world to quickly become epidemics, reason why
researchers are concentrated in modeling the propagation of epidemics and
outbreaks in Multilayer Networks. In this networks all nodes interact in
different layers with different type of links. However, in many scenarios such
as in the society, a Multiplex Network framework is not completely suitable
since not all individuals participate in all layers. In this paper, we use a
partially overlapped Multiplex Network where only a fraction of the individuals
are shared by the layers. We develop a mitigation strategy for stopping a
disease propagation, considering the Susceptible-Infected-Recover model, in a
system consisted by two layers. We consider a random immunization in one of the
layers and study the effect of the overlapping fraction in both, the
propagation of the disease and the immunization strategy. Using branching
theory, we study this scenario theoretically and via simulations and find a
lower epidemic threshold than in the case without strategy.
