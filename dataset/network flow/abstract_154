Recent studies have pointed out the importance of the basal friction on the
dynamics of granular flows. We present experimental results on the influence of
the roughness of the inclined plane on the dynamics of a monodisperse dry
granular flow. We found experimentally that it exists a maximum of the friction
for a given relative roughness. This maximum is shown to be independent of the
angle of the slope. This behavior is observed for four planes with different
bump sizes (given by the size of the beads glued on the plane) from 200 microns
to 2 mm. The relative roughness corresponding to the maximum of the friction
can be predicted with a geometrical model of stability of one single bead on
the plane. The main parameters are the size of the bumps and the size of the
flowing beads. In order to obtain a higher precision, the model also takes into
account of the spacing between the bumps of the rough plane. Experimental
results and model are in good agreement for all the planes we studied. Other
parameters, like the sphericity of the beads, or irregularities in the
thickness of the layer of glued particles, are shown to be of influence on the
friction.
