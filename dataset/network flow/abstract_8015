In this paper, we prove logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and Li-Yau or
Hamilton type differential Harnack inequalities for the heat equation of the
Witten Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds equipped with $K$-super Perelman Ricci
flow. Moreover, we establish the $W$-entropy formula and prove a rigidity
theorem on complete Riemannian manifolds satisfying the $CD(K, m)$ condition
for $K\in \mathbb{R}$ and $m\in [n, \infty)$. Finally, we extend the
$W$-entropy formula to time dependent Witten Laplacian on compact Riemannian
manifolds with $K$-super Perelman Ricci flow.
