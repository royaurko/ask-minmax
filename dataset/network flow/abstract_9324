In this paper, a hierarchical cross-layer design approach is proposed to
increase energy efficiency in ad hoc networks through joint adaptation of
nodes' transmitting powers and route selection. The design maintains the
advantages of the classic OSI model, while accounting for the cross-coupling
between layers, through information sharing. The proposed joint power control
and routing algorithm is shown to increase significantly the overall energy
efficiency of the network, at the expense of a moderate increase in complexity.
Performance enhancement of the joint design using multiuser detection is also
investigated, and it is shown that the use of multiuser detection can increase
the capacity of the ad hoc network significantly for a given level of energy
consumption.
