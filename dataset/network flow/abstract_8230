Studies have been made on the phase transition phenomena of an oscillator
network model based on a standard Hebb learning rule like the Hopfield model.
The relative phase informations---the in-phase and anti-phase, can be embedded
in the network. By self-consistent signal-to-noise analysis (SCSNA), it was
found that the storage capacity is given by $\alpha_c = 0.042$, which is better
than that of Cook's model. However, the retrieval quality is worse. In
addition, an investigation was made into an acceleration effect caused by
asymmetry of the phase dynamics. Finally, it was numerically shown that the
storage capacity can be improved by modifying the shape of the coupling
function.
