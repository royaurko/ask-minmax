We argue that RHIC data, in particular those on the anisotropic flow
coefficients v_2 and v_4, suggest that the matter produced in the early stages
of nucleus-nucleus collisions is incompletely thermalized. We interpret the
parameter (1/S)(dN/dy), where S is the transverse area of the collision zone
and dN/dy the multiplicity density, as an indicator of the number of collisions
per particle at the time when elliptic flow is established, and hence as a
measure of the degree of equilibration. This number serves as a control
parameter which can be varied experimentally by changing the system size, the
centrality of the collision, or the beam energy. We provide predictions for
Cu-Cu collisions at RHIC as well as for Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.
