This paper studies the impact of mobility on the power consumption of
wireless networks. With increasing mobility, we show that the network should
dedicate a non negligible fraction of the useful rate to estimate the different
degrees of freedom. In order to keep the rate constant, we quantify the
increase of power required for several cases of interest. In the case of a
point to point MIMO link, we calculate the minimum transmit power required for
a target rate and outage probability as a function of the coherence time and
the number of antennas. Interestingly, the results show that there is an
optimal number of antennas to be used for a given coherence time and power
consumption. This provides a lower bound limit on the minimum power required
for maintaining a green network.
