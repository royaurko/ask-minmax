The orbits of fluid particles in two dimensions effectively act as
topological obstacles to material lines. A spacetime plot of the orbits of such
particles can be regarded as a braid whose properties reflect the underlying
dynamics. For a chaotic flow, the braid generated by the motion of three or
more fluid particles is computed. A ``braiding exponent'' is then defined to
characterize the complexity of the braid. This exponent is proportional to the
usual Lyapunov exponent of the flow, associated with separation of nearby
trajectories. Measuring chaos in this manner has several advantages, especially
from the experimental viewpoint, since neither nearby trajectories nor
derivatives of the velocity field are needed.
