Due to dynamic network conditions, routing is the most critical part in WMNs
and needs to be optimised. The routing strategies developed for WMNs must be
efficient to make it an operationally self configurable network. Thus we need
to resort to near shortest path evaluation. This lays down the requirement of
some soft computing approaches such that a near shortest path is available in
an affordable computing time. This paper proposes a Fuzzy Logic based
integrated cost measure in terms of delay, throughput and jitter. Based upon
this distance (cost) between two adjacent nodes we evaluate minimal shortest
path that updates routing tables. We apply two recent soft computing approaches
namely Big Bang Big Crunch (BB-BC) and Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO)
approaches to enumerate shortest or near short paths. BB-BC theory is related
with the evolution of the universe whereas BBO is inspired by dynamical
equilibrium in the number of species on an island. Both the algorithms have low
computational time and high convergence speed. Simulation results show that the
proposed routing algorithms find the optimal shortest path taking into account
three most important parameters of network dynamics. It has been further
observed that for the shortest path problem BB-BC outperforms BBO in terms of
speed and percent error between the evaluated minimal path and the actual
shortest path.
