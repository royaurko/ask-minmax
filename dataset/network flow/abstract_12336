In this technical note we address the problem of achieving consensus in a
network of homogeneous nonlinear systems. The communication network is supposed
to be switching within a finite set of topologies which may be disconnected for
finite time intervals. We prove that if the length of the time intervals in
which connected topologies are active satisfy an average dwell-time condition
consensus is achieved. Lyapunov arguments proposed in the field of hybrid
nonlinear systems are adopted to prove the result.
