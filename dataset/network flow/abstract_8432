The constraints of lightweight distributed computing environments such as
wireless sensor networks lend themselves to the use of symmetric cryptography
to provide security services. The lack of central infrastructure after
deployment of such networks requires the necessary symmetric keys to be
predistributed to participating nodes. The rich mathematical structure of
combinatorial designs has resulted in the proposal of several key
predistribution schemes for wireless sensor networks based on designs. We
review and examine the appropriateness of combinatorial designs as a tool for
building key predistribution schemes suitable for such environments.
