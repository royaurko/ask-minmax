This paper deals with a group of generalized power series associated to any
augmented operad, focusing on the case of the PreLie operad. The solution of
flow equations using the pre-Lie structure on vector fields on an affine space
gives rise to an interesting element of this group, which deserves to be called
the PreLie exponential.
