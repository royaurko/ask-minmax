This paper studies zeros of networked linear systems with time-invariant
interconnection topology. While the characterization of zeros is given for both
heterogeneous and homogeneous networks, homogeneous networks are explored in
greater detail. In the current paper, for homogeneous networks with
time-invariant interconnection dynamics, it is illustrated how the zeros of
each individual agent's system description and zeros definable from the
interconnection dynamics contribute to generating zeros of the whole network.
We also demonstrate how zeros of networked systems and those of their
associated blocked versions are related.
