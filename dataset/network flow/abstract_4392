Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTN) have been a popular subject of recent
research and development. These networks are characterized by frequent, lengthy
outages and a lack of contemporaneous end-to-end paths. In this work we discuss
techniques for extending IP to operate more effectively in DTN scenarios. Our
scheme, Disruption Tolerant IP (DIP) uses existing IP packet headers, uses the
existing socket API for applications, is compatible with IPsec, and uses
familiar Policy-Based Routing techniques for network management.
