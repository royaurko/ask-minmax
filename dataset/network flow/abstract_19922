We show that the issue of the drag exerted by an incompressible fluid on a
body in uniform motion has played a major role in the early development of
fluid dynamics. In 1745 Euler came close, technically, to proving the vanishing
of the drag for a body of arbitrary shape; for this he exploited and
significantly extended existing ideas on decomposing the flow into thin
fillets; he did not however have a correct picture of the global structure of
the flow around a body. Borda in 1766 showed that the principle of live forces
implied the vanishing of the drag and should thus be inapplicable to the
problem. After having at first refused the possibility of a vanishing drag,
d'Alembert in 1768 established the paradox, but only for bodies with a
head-tail symmetry. A full understanding of the paradox, as due to the neglect
of viscous forces, had to wait until the work of Saint-Venant in 1846.
