The dynamics of noise-resilient Boolean networks with majority functions and
diverse topologies is investigated. A wide class of possible topological
configurations is parametrized as a stochastic blockmodel. For this class of
networks, the dynamics always undergoes a phase transition from a non-ergodic
regime, where a memory of its past states is preserved, to an ergodic regime,
where no such memory exists and every microstate is equally probable. Both the
average error on the network, as well as the critical value of noise where the
transition occurs are investigated analytically, and compared to numerical
simulations. The results for "partially dense" networks, comprised of
relatively few, but dynamically important nodes, which have a number of inputs
which greatly exceeds the average for the entire network, give very general
upper bounds on the maximum resilience against noise attainable on globally
sparse systems.
