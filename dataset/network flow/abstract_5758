We find that the fractal scaling in a class of scale-free networks originates
from the underlying tree structure called skeleton, a special type of spanning
tree based on the edge betweenness centrality. The fractal skeleton has the
property of the critical branching tree. The original fractal networks are
viewed as a fractal skeleton dressed with local shortcuts. An in-silico model
with both the fractal scaling and the scale-invariance properties is also
constructed. The framework of fractal networks is useful in understanding the
utility and the redundancy in networked systems.
