In this paper, a simple 1D crowd model is proposed, which aim is to properly
describe the crowd-flow phenomena occurring when pedestrians walk on a flexible
footbridge. The crowd is assumed to behave like a continuous compressible fluid
and the pedestrian flow is modeled in a 1-D framework using the (total) mass
(of pedestrians) conservation equation. This crowd model is then coupled with a
simple model for the dynamical behavior of the footbridge and an optimized
modeling of synchronization effects is performed. Numerical simulations are
presented to show some preliminary results.
