A search technique locating network modules, i.e., internally densely
connected groups of nodes in directed networks is introduced by extending the
Clique Percolation Method originally proposed for undirected networks. After
giving a suitable definition for directed modules we investigate their
percolation transition in the Erdos-Renyi graph both analytically and
numerically. We also analyse four real-world directed networks, including
Google's own webpages, an email network, a word association graph and the
transcriptional regulatory network of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The
obtained directed modules are validated by additional information available for
the nodes. We find that directed modules of real-world graphs inherently
overlap and the investigated networks can be classified into two major groups
in terms of the overlaps between the modules. Accordingly, in the
word-association network and among Google's webpages the overlaps are likely to
contain in-hubs, whereas the modules in the email and transcriptional
regulatory networks tend to overlap via out-hubs.
