How to identify the influential spreaders in social networks is crucial for
accelerating/hindering information diffusion, increasing product exposure,
controlling diseases and rumors, and so on. In this paper, by viewing the
k-shell value of each node as its mass and the shortest path distance between
any two nodes as their distance, then inspired by the idea of the gravity
formula, we propose a gravity centrality index to identify the influential
spreaders in complex networks. The comparison between the gravity centrality
index with some well-known centralities, such as degree centrality, betweenness
centrality, closeness centrality, and k-shell centrality, and so forth,
indicates that our method can effectively identify the influential spreaders in
real networks as well as artificial networks. We also use the classical
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model to verify the good
performance of our method.
