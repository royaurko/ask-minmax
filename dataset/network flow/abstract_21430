We review recent results from Chandra observations of the X-ray bright cores
of clusters of galaxies. We discuss the detection of ``cold fronts'' and their
implication for thermal conduction, the interaction of cooling flow and radio
source in the Perseus cluster and the dynamical state of the central region of
A1795. The radial distribution of metals in A1795 and the azimuthal variation
in metallicity in 4C+55.16 are presented.
