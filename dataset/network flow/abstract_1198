Macroscopic gas motions are widespread throughout the solar atmosphere and
shearing motions couple to the non--ideal effects, destabilising low frequency
fluctuations in the medium. The origin of this non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic
instability lies in the collisional coupling of the neutral particles to the
magnetized plasma in the presence of a sheared background flow. Unsurprisingly,
the maximum growth rate and most unstable wavenumber depend on the flow
gradient and ambient diffusivities.
  The orientation of the magnetic field, velocity shears and perturbation wave
vector play a crucial role in assisting the instability. When the magnetic
field and wave vector are both vertical, ambipolar and Ohm diffusion can be
combined as Pedersen diffusion and cause only damping; in this case only Hall
drift in tandem with shear flow drives the instability. However, for
non-vertical fields and oblique wave vectors, both ambipolar diffusion and Hall
drift are destabilizing.
  We investigate the stability of magnetic elements in the network and
internetwork regions. The shear scale is not yet observationally determined,
but assuming a typical shear flow gradient $\sim 0.1 \,\mbox{s}^{-1}$ we show
that the magnetic diffusion shear instability grows on a time scale of one
minute. Thus, it is plausible that network--internetwork magnetic elements are
subject to this fast growing, diffusive shear instability, which could play an
important role in driving low frequency turbulence in the plasma in the solar
photosphere and chromosphere.
