The conditions for emergence of Kolmogorov turbulence, and related weak wave
turbulence, in finite size systems are analyzed by analytical methods and
numerical simulations of simple models. The analogy between Kolmogorov energy
flow from large to small spacial scales and conductivity in disordered solid
state systems is proposed. It is argued that the Anderson localization can stop
such an energy flow. The effects of nonlinear wave interactions on such a
localization are analyzed. The results obtained for finite size system models
show the existence of an effective chaos border between the
Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) integrability at weak nonlinearity, when energy
does not flow to small scales, and developed chaos regime emerging above this
border with the Kolmogorov turbulent energy flow from large to small scales.
