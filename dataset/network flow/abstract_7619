We study the dynamical appearance of scaling solutions in relativistic
hydrodynamics. The phase transition effects are included through the
temperature dependent sound velocity. If a pre-equilibrium transverse flow is
included in the initial conditions, then it may reach the form of the
asymptotic Hubble flow, r/t, in short evolution times, 7-15 fm. The numerical
solutions are found to support to the freeze-out models (Blast-Wave, Buda-Lund,
Cracow).
