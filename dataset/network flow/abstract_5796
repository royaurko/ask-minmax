We investigate the behavior of a threshold model for the spreading of fads
and similar phenomena in society. The model is giving the fad dynamics and is
intended to be confined to an underlying network structure. We investigate the
whole parameter space of the fad dynamics on three types of network models. The
dynamics we discover is rich and highly dependent on the underlying network
structure. For some range of the parameter space, for all types of substrate
networks, there are a great variety of sizes and life-lengths of the fads --
what one see in real-world social and economical systems.
