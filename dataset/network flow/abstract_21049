We have performed dielectric spectroscopy on the molecular glass-formers
glycerol, propylene carbonate (PC) and the ionic melts CKN and CRN. The
frequency range covers almost 20 decades from some micro-Hz to some THz. The
meausrement results are compared to neutron and light scattering data and
analysed with mode coupling theory.
