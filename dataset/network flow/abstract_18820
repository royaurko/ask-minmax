In this paper, we study the spectrum usage efficiency by applying wideband
methods and systems to the existing analog systems and applications. The
essential motivation of this work is to define the prospective coexistence
between analog FM and digital Spread Spectrum systems in an efficient way
sharing the same frequency band. The potential overlaid Spread Spectrum (SS)
system can spectrally coincide within the existing narrowband Frequency
Modulated (FM) broadcasting system upon several limitations, originating a key
motivation for the use of the FM radio frequency band in many applications,
encompassing wireless personal and sensors networks. The performance of the SS
system due to the overlaying analog FM system, consisting of multiple
narrowband FM stations, is investigated in order to derive the relevant bit
error probability and maximum achievable data rates. The SS system uses direct
sequence (DS) spreading, through maximal length pseudorandom sequences with
long spreading codes. The SS signal is evaluated throughout theoretical and
simulation-based performance analysis, for various types of spreading
scenarios, for different carrier frequency offset ({\Delta}f) and
signal-to-interference ratios, in order to derive valuable results for future
developing and planning of an overlay scenario.
