High energy heavy-ion collisions are proposed as a novel means to constrain
stringently the high density (HD) behaviour of nuclear symmetry energy. Within
an isospin-dependent hadronic transport model, it is shown for the first time
that the isospin asymmetry of the HD nuclear matter formed in high energy
heavy-ion collisions is uniquely determined by the HD behaviour of nuclear
symmetry energy. Experimental signatures in two sensitive probes, i.e., $\pi^-$
to $\pi^+$ ratio and neutron-proton differential collective flow, are also
investigated.
