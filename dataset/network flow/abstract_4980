We study laminar thin film flows with large distortions in the free surface
using the method of averaging across the flow. Two concrete problems are
studied: the circular hydraulic jump and the flow down an inclined plane. For
the circular hydraulic jump our method is able to handle an internal eddy and
separated flow. Assuming a variable radial velocity profile like in
Karman-Pohlhausen's method, we obtain a system of two ordinary differential
equations for stationary states that can smoothly go through the jump where
previous studies encountered a singularity. Solutions of the system are in good
agreement with experiments. For the flow down an inclined plane we take a
similar approach and derive a simple model in which the velocity profile is not
restricted to a parabolic or self-similar form. Two types of solutions with
large surface distortions are found: solitary, kink-like propagating fronts,
obtained when the flow rate is suddenly changed, and stationary jumps,
obtained, e.g., behind a sluice gate. We then include time-dependence in the
model to study stability of these waves. This allows us to distinguish between
sub- and supercritical flows by calculating dispersion relations for
wavelengths of the order of the width of the layer.
