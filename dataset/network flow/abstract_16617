We study the elasticity of fibrous materials composed of generalized stiff
polymers. It is shown that in contrast to cellular foam-like structures affine
strain fields are generically unstable. Instead, a subtle interplay between the
architecture of the network and the elastic properties of its building blocks
leads to intriguing mechanical properties with intermediate asymptotic scaling
regimes. We present exhaustive numerical studies based on a finite element
method complemented by scaling arguments.
