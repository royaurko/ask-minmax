We study connections between translation flows on flat surfaces, adic
transformations defined on Bratteli diagrams, and cutting-and-stacking
transformations. We do so by introducing a general technique which takes an
adic transformation and constructs a flat surface whose vertical translation
flow admits a cross section for which the first return map is measurably
isomorphic to the adic transformation. We show that any finite entropy,
measure-preserving flow on a standard Lebesgue space is measurably isomorphic
to the translation flow on a flat surface obtained through our construction. We
give a criterion for ergodicity of the translation flow on these surfaces and
apply this criterion to several examples, as well as describing specific
examples of infinite type flat surfaces on which the translation flow exhibits
new phenomena not found for flows on flat surfaces of finite type.
