The relationship between algebraic geometry and the inferential framework of
the Bayesian Networks with hidden variables has now been fruitfully explored
and exploited by a number of contributors. More recently the algebraic formulation
of Causal Bayesian Networks has also been investigated in this context. After
reviewing these newer relationships, we proceed to demonstrate that many of the
ideas embodied in the concept of a ``causal model'' can be more generally
expressed directly in terms of a partial order and a family of polynomial maps.
The more conventional graphical constructions, when available, remain a
powerful tool.
