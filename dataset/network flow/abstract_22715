In this paper, we study the deformation of the n-dimensional strictly convex
hypersurface in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ whose speed at a point on the hypersurface is
proportional to $\alpha$-power of positive part of Gauss Curvature. For
$\frac{1}{n}<\alpha \leq 1$, we prove that there exist the strictly convex
smooth solutions if the initial surface is strictly convex and smooth and the
solution hypersurfaces converge to a point. We also show the asymptotic
behavior of the rescaled hypersurfaces, in other words, the rescaled manifold
converges to a strictly convex smooth manifold. Moreover, there exists a
subsequence whose the limit satisfies a certain equation.
