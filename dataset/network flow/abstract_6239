In this letter, we investigate the detailed epidemic spreading process in
scale-free networks with links' weights that denote familiarity between two
individuals and find that spreading velocity reaches a peak quickly then decays
in a power-law form. Numerical study exhibits that the nodes with larger
strength is preferential to be infected, but the hierarchical dynamics are not
clearly found, which is different from the well-known result in unweighed
network case. In addition, also by numerical study, we demonstrate that larger
dispersion of weight of networks results in slower spreading, which indicates
that epidemic spreads more quickly on unweighted scale-free networks than on
weighted scale-free networks with the same condition.
