The slow inward flow of the hot gas in elliptical galaxy cooling flows is
nearly impossible to detect directly due to instrumental limitations. However,
in rotating galaxies, if the inflowing gas conserves angular momentum, it will
eventually form a disk. The X-ray signature of this phenomenon is a flattening
of the X-ray isophotes in the inner 1-10 kpc region. This effect is observable,
so we have searched for it in X-ray observations of six rotating and
non-rotating early-type galaxies, obtained mainly with the ROSAT PSPC and HRI
imagers. The ellipticities of the X-ray emission never increase toward the
central region, nor are the X-ray ellipticities significantly greater than the
ellipticities for the optical stellar emission. Central ellipticities in excess
of 0.5 were expected in rotating ellipticals whereas values of 0-0.2 are
measured. The failure to detect the expected signature requires a modification
to the standard cooling flow picture, possibly including partial galactic
winds, rapid mass drop-out, or turbulent redistribution of angular momentum.
