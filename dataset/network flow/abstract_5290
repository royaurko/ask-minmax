To any coupling between two probability measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ on a
finite set there is naturally associated a flow that represents the amount of
mass transported to change the measure $\mu_1$ into the measure $\mu_2$. This
flow is not unique since several different choices of paths are possible. We
prove that also a converse statement holds when the flow is acyclic. In
particular we show two different algorithms that associate to any acyclic flow
having divergence coinciding with $\mu_1-\mu_2$ a coupling between the two
measures. The couplings that can be obtained in this way are called
\emph{economic}. In the case of a countable set the constructions are
implemented with a limit procedure and the flows for which they hold need to
satisfy a suitable \emph{finite decomposability} condition. We show several
consequences of these constructive procedures among which a third equivalent
statement in Strassen Theorem and a constructive proof of the equivalence
between a mass transportation problem with a geodesic cost and a minimal
current problem. We illustrate the results discussing several solvable cases
