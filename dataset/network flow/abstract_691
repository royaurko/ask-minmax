In this paper we propose a novel index to quantify and measure the flow of
information on macro and micro scales. We discuss the implications of this
index for knowledge management fields and also as intellectual capital that can
thus be utilized by entrepreneurs. We explore different function and human
oriented metrics that can be used at micro-scales to process the flow of
information. We present a table of about 23 metrics, such as change in IT
inventory and percentage of employees with advanced degrees, that can be used
at micro scales to wholly quantify knowledge dispersion as intellectual
capital. At macro scales we split the economy in an industrial and consumer
sector where the flow of information in each determines how fast an economy is
going to grow and how overall an economy will perform given the aggregate
demand. Lastly, we propose a model for knowledge dispersion based on graph
theory and show how corrections in the flow become self-evident. Through the
principals of flow conservation and capacity constrains we also speculate how
this flow might seeks some equilibrium and exhibit self-correction codes. This
proposed model allows us to account for perturbations in form of local noise,
evolution of networks, provide robustness against local damage from lower
nodes, and help determine the underlying classification into network
super-families.
