This paper presents a stability test for a class of interconnected nonlinear
systems motivated by biochemical reaction networks. One of the main results
determines global asymptotic stability of the network from the diagonal
stability of a "dissipativity matrix" which incorporates information about the
passivity properties of the subsystems, the interconnection structure of the
network, and the signs of the interconnection terms. This stability test
encompasses the "secant criterion" for cyclic networks presented in our
previous paper, and extends it to a general interconnection structure
represented by a graph. A second main result allows one to accommodate state
products. This extension makes the new stability criterion applicable to a
broader class of models, even in the case of cyclic systems. The new stability
test is illustrated on a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade model,
and on a branched interconnection structure motivated by metabolic networks.
Finally, another result addresses the robustness of stability in the presence
of diffusion terms in a compartmental system made out of identical systems.
