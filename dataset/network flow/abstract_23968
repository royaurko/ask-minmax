We report a search for Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson production in
association with a $W^{\pm}$ boson. This search uses data corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of $\math rm{1.9 fb^{-1}}$ collected with the CDF
detector at Tevatron. We select events matching the $W$ + jets signature and
require at least one jets to be identified as $b$-quark jets . To further
increase discrimination between signal and background, we use kinematic
information in an artificial neural network. The number of tagged events and
the resulting neural network output distributions are consistent with the
Standard Model expectations, and we set an upper limit on the $WH$ produ ction
cross section times branching ratio $\sigma(p\bar{p} \to W{^\pm}H)\times
BR(H\to b\bar{b}) < 1.1$ to 1.0 pb for Higgs masses from 110 GeV/$c^{2}$ to 150
G eV/c$^2$ at 95% confidence level.
