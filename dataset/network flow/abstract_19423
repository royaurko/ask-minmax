Observations of the hot gas surrounding Sgr A* and a few other nearby
galactic nuclei imply electron and proton mean free paths comparable to the gas
capture radius: hot accretion likely proceeds under weakly-collisional
conditions in these systems. As a result, thermal conduction, rather than
convection, may be important on all scales and affect the global flow
properties. The self-similar ADAF solution of Narayan & Yi (1994) is
generalized to include a saturated form of thermal conduction, as is
appropriate for the weakly-collisional regime of interest. Conduction provides
extra heating and yet it reduces the free-free radiative efficiency of the
accretion flow (by potentially large factors). These idealized solutions
suggest that thermal conduction may be an important physical ingredient to
understand hot accretion onto dim accreting black holes. Conduction could also
play a role in reducing the rate at which black holes capture ambient gas and
in providing an evaporation mechanism for an underlying cold thin disk.
