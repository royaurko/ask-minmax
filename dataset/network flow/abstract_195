The elliptic flow $v_{2}$ of thermal photons at midrapidity in Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV is predicted, based on three-dimensional
ideal hydrodynamics. Because of the interplay between the asymmetry and the
strength of the transverse flow, the thermal photon $v_{2}$ reaches a maximum
at $\pt \sim $ 2GeV/$c$ and the $\pt$-integrated $v_{2}$ reaches a maximum at
about 50% centrality. The $\pt$-integrated $v_{2}$ is very sensitive to the
lower limit of the integral but not sensitive to the upper limit due to the
rapid decrease in the spectrum of the transverse momentum.
