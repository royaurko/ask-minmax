Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative transmission (CT) have
recently emerged as communication techniques that can make effective use of
collaborative/cooperative nodes to create a virtual
multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) system. Extending the lifetime of
networks composed of battery-operated nodes is a key issue in the design and
operation of wireless sensor networks. This paper considers the effects on
network lifetime of allowing closely located nodes to use CB/CT to reduce the
load or even to avoid packet-forwarding requests to nodes that have critical
battery life. First, the effectiveness of CB/CT in improving the signal
strength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes is studied.
Then, the performance improvement obtained by this technique is analyzed for a
special 2D disk case. Further, for general networks in which
information-generation rates are fixed, a new routing problem is formulated as
a linear programming problem, while for other general networks, the cost for
routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and
the effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and the simulation results, it is
seen that the proposed method can reduce the payloads of energy-depleting nodes
by about 90% in the special case network considered and improve the lifetimes
of general networks by about 10%, compared with existing techniques.
