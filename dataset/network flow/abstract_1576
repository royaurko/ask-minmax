We report on the intershell electron transport in multiwalled carbon
nanotubes (MWNT). To do this, local and nonlocal four-point measurements are
used to study the current path through the different shells of a MWNT. For
short electrode separations $\lesssim$ 1 $\mu$m the current mainly flows
through the two outer shells, described by a resistive transmission line with
an intershell conductance per length of ~(10 k\Omega)^{-1}/$\mu$m. The
intershell transport is tunnel-type and the transmission is consistent with the
estimate based on the overlap between $\pi$-orbitals of neighboring shells.
