Fixed and wireless networks are increasingly converging towards common
connectivity with IP-based core networks. Providing effective end-to-end
resource and QoS management in such complex heterogeneous converged network
scenarios requires unified, adaptive and scalable solutions to integrate and
co-ordinate diverse QoS mechanisms of different access technologies with
IP-based QoS. Policy-Based Network Management (PBNM) is one approach that could
be employed to address this challenge. Hence, a policy-based framework for
end-to-end QoS management in converged networks, CNQF (Converged Networks QoS
Management Framework) has been proposed within our project. In this paper, the
CNQF architecture, a Java implementation of its prototype and experimental
validation of key elements are discussed. We then present a fuzzy-based CNQF
resource management approach and study the performance of our implementation
with real traffic flows on an experimental testbed. The results demonstrate the
efficacy of our resource-adaptive approach for practical PBNM systems.
