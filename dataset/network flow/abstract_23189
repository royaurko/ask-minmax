We review our work on the application of the renormalization-group method to
obtain first- and second-order relativistic hydrodynamics of the relativistic
Boltzmann equation (RBE) as a dynamical system, with some corrections and new
unpublished results. For the first-order equation, we explicitly obtain the
distribution function in the asymptotic regime as the invariant manifold of the
dynamical system, which turns out to be nothing but the matching condition
defining the energy frame, i.e., the Landau-Lifshitz one. It is argued that the
frame on which the flow of the relativistic hydrodynamic equation is defined
must be the energy frame, if the dynamics should be consistent with the
underlying RBE. A sketch is also given for derivation of the second-order
hydrodynamic equation, i.e., extended thermodynamics, which is accomplished by
extending the invariant manifold so that it is spanned by excited modes as well
as the zero modes (hydrodynamic modes) of the linearized collision operator. On
the basis of thus constructed resummed distribution function, we propose a
novel ansatz for the functional form to be used in Grad moment method; it is
shown that our theory gives the same expressions for the transport coefficients
as those given in the Chapman-Enskog theory as well as the novel expressions
for the relaxation times and lengths allowing natural interpretation.
