It has been shown that a water drop can bounce persistently, when thrown on a
super-hydrophobic substrate. We present here scaling arguments which allow us
to predict the maximal deformation and the contact time of the drop. This
approach is completed by a model describing the flow inside the drop, and by
original experimental data.
