We explore the practical costs and benefits of CS for dynamic spectrum access
(DSA) networks. Firstly, we review several fast and practical techniques for
energy detection without full reconstruction and provide theoretical
guarantees. We also define practical metrics to measure the performance of
these techniques. Secondly, we perform comprehensive experiments comparing the
techniques on real signals captured over the air. Our results show that we can
significantly compressively acquire the signal while still accurately
determining spectral occupancy.
