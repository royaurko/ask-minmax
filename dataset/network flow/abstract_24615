Macroscopic mobility of wireless users is important to determine the
performance and energy effciency of a wireless network, because of the temporal
correlations it introduces in the consumed power and throughput. In this work
we introduce a methodology that obtains the long time statistics of such
metrics in a network. After describing the general approach, we present a
specific example of the uplink channel of a mobile user in the vicinity of a
massive MIMO base-station antenna array. To guarantee a fixed SINR and rate,
the user inverts the path-loss channel power, while moving around in the cell.
To calculate the long time distribution of the consumed energy of the user, we
assume his movement follows a Brownian motion, and then map the problem to the
solution of the minimum eigenvalue of a partial differential equation, which
can be solved either analytically, or numerically very fast. We also treat the
throughput of a single user. We then discuss the results and how they can be
generalized if the mobility is assumed to be a Levy random walk. We also
provide a roadmap to use this technique when one considers multiple users and
base stations.
