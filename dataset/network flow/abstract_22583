We investigate the dynamical transition from free-flow to jammed traffic,
which is related to the divergence of the relaxation time and susceptibility of
the energy dissipation rate $E_d$, in the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) model with
two different initial configurations. Different initial configurations give
rise to distinct phase transition. We argue that the phase transition of the
deterministic NS model with megajam and random initial configuration is first-
and second-order phase transition, respectively. The energy dissipation rate
$E_d$ and relaxation time follow power-law behavior in some cases. The
associated dynamic exponents have also been presented.
