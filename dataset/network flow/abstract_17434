The pseudo-integrable barrier billiard invented by Hannay and McCraw [J.
Phys. A 23, 887 (1990)] -- rectangular billiard with line-segment barrier
placed on a symmetry axis -- is generalized. It is proven that the flow on
invariant surfaces of genus two exhibits a singular continuous spectral
component.
