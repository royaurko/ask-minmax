In a finite temperature Thomas-Fermi theory, we construct caloric curves for
finite nuclei enclosed in a freeze-out volume few times the normal nuclear
volume, with and without inclusion of flow. Without flow, the caloric curve
indicates a smooth liquid-gas phase transition whereas with flow, the
transition may be very sharp. We discuss these results in the context of two
recent experiments, one for heavy symmetric system (Au + Au at 600A MeV) and
the other for highly asymmetric system (Au + C at 1A GeV) where different
behaviours in the caloric curves are seen.
