The Semantic Web (or Web of Data) represents the successful efforts towards
linking and sharing data over the Web. The cornerstones of the Web of Data are
RDF as data format and SPARQL as de-facto standard query language. Recent
trends show the evolution of the Web of Data towards the Web of Things,
integrating embedded devices and smart objects. Data stemming from such devices
do not share a common format, making the integration and querying impossible.
To overcome this problem, we present our approach to make embedded systems
first-class citizens of the Web of Things. Our framework abstracts from
individual deployments to represent them as common data sources in line with
the ideas behind the Semantic Web. This includes the execution of arbitrary
SPARQL queries over the data from a pool of embedded devices and/or external
data sources. Handling verbose RDF data and executing SPARQL queries in an
embedded network poses major challenges to minimize the involved processing and
communication cost. We therefore present an in-network query processor aiming
to push processing steps onto devices. We demonstrate the practical application
and the potential benefits of our framework in a comprehensive evaluation using
a real-world deployment and a range of SPARQL queries stemming from a common
use case of the Web of Things.
