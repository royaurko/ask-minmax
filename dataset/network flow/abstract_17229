In the standard Random Surfer Model, the teleportation matrix is necessary to
ensure that the final PageRank vector is well-defined. The introduction of this
matrix, however, results in serious problems and imposes fundamental
limitations to the quality of the ranking vectors. In this work, building on
the recently proposed NCDawareRank framework, we exploit the decomposition of
the underlying space into blocks, and we derive easy to check necessary and
sufficient conditions for random surfing without teleportation.
