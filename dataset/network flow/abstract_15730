In this paper, a novel spectrum association approach for cognitive radio
networks (CRNs) is proposed. Based on a measure of both inference and
confidence as well as on a measure of quality-of-service, the association
between secondary users (SUs) in the network and frequency bands licensed to
primary users (PUs) is investigated. The problem is formulated as a matching
game between SUs and PUs. In this game, SUs employ a soft-decision Bayesian
framework to detect PUs' signals and, eventually, rank them based on the
logarithm of the a posteriori ratio. A performance measure that captures both
the ranking metric and rate is further computed by the SUs. Using this
performance measure, a PU evaluates its own utility function that it uses to
build its own association preferences. A distributed algorithm that allows both
SUs and PUs to interact and self-organize into a stable match is proposed.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the sum of SUs'
rates by up to 20 % and 60 % relative to the deferred acceptance algorithm and
random channel allocation approach, respectively. The results also show an
improved convergence time.
