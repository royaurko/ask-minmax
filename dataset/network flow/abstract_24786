Influential users have great potential for accelerating information
dissemination and acquisition on Twitter. How to measure the influence of
Twitter users has attracted significant academic and industrial attention.
Existing influential measurement techniques, however, are vulnerable to sybil
users that are thriving on Twitter. Although sybil defenses for online social
networks have been extensively investigated, they commonly assume unique
mappings from human-established trust relationships to online social
associations and thus do not apply to Twitter where users can freely follow
each other. This paper presents TrueTop, the first sybil-resilient system to
measure the influence of Twitter users. TrueTop is firmly rooted in two
observations from real Twitter datasets. First, although non-sybil users may
incautiously follow strangers, they tend to be more careful and selective in
retweeting, replying to, and mentioning other Twitter users. Second,
influential users usually get much more retweets, replies, and mentions than
non-influential users. Detailed theoretical studies and synthetic simulations
show that TrueTop can generate very accurate influence measurement results and
also have strong resilience to sybil attacks.
