Recently there has been much interest in graph-based learning, with
applications in collaborative filtering for recommender networks, link
prediction for social networks and fraud detection. These networks can consist
of millions of entities, and so it is very important to develop highly
efficient techniques. We are especially interested in accelerating random walk
approaches to compute some very interesting proximity measures of these kinds
of graphs. These measures have been shown to do well empirically (Liben-Nowell
& Kleinberg, 2003; Brand, 2005). We introduce a truncated variation on a
well-known measure, namely commute times arising from random walks on graphs.
We present a very novel algorithm to compute all interesting pairs of
approximate nearest neighbors in truncated commute times, without computing it
between all pairs. We show results on both simulated and real graphs of size up
to 100; 000 entities, which indicate near-linear scaling in computation time.
