In a network, arrival process is converted into departure process through
network elements. The departure process suffer propagation delay in the link,
processing delay at the network elements like router and data loss due to
buffer overflow or congestion. For providing guaranteed service resources need
to be reserved before conversation takes place. To reserve such resources
estimation of them are indispensable. The idea of service curve gives
beforehand deterministic value of these parameters. In this paper, we aim to
minimum and maximum buffer space required in the router, minimum link capacity
required to guarantee a pre-specified end-to-end delay for an ongoing session
in a wired-cum-wireless scenario by analyzing minimum and maximum service
curve. We assume that the network we are analyzing is an IP based mobile
network. The findings of the work are presented in the form of tables which can
be used for resource reservation to offer quality service to end-users.
