Consider inviscid fluids in a channel {-1<y<1}. For the Couette flow
v_0=(y,0), the vertical velocity of solutions to the linearized Euler equation
at v_0 decays in time. At the nonlinear level, such inviscid damping has not
been proved. First, we show that in any (vorticity) H^{s}(s<(3/2)) neighborhood
of Couette flow, there exist non-parallel steady flows with arbitrary minimal
horizontal period. This implies that nonlinear inviscid damping is not true in
any (vorticity) H^{s}(s<(3/2)) neighborhood of Couette flow and for any
horizontal period. Indeed, the long time behavior in such neighborhoods are
very rich, including nontrivial steady flows, stable and unstable manifolds of
nearby unstable shears. Second, in the (vorticity) H^{s}(s>(3/2)) neighborhood
of Couette, we show that there exist no non-parallel steadily travelling flows
v(x-ct,y), and no unstable shears. This suggests that the long time dynamics in
H^{s}(s>(3/2)) neighborhoods of Couette might be much simpler. Such contrasting
dynamics in H^{s} spaces with the critical power s=(3/2) is a truly nonlinear
phenomena, since the linear inviscid damping near Couette is true for any
initial vorticity in L^2.
