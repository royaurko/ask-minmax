The friendship paradox states that your friends have on average more friends
than you have. Does the paradox "hold" for other individual characteristics
like income or happiness? To address this question, we generalize the
friendship paradox for arbitrary node characteristics in complex networks. By
analyzing two cocontributorship networks of Physical Review journals and Google
Scholar profiles, we find that the generalized friendship paradox (GFP) holds
at the individual and network levels for various characteristics, including the
number of cocontributors, the number of citations, and the number of publications.
The origin of the GFP is shown to be rooted in positive correlations between
degree and characteristics. As a fruitful application of the GFP, we suggest
effective and efficient sampling methods for identifying high characteristic
nodes in large-scale networks. Our study on the GFP can shed lights on
understanding the interplay between network structure and node characteristics
in complex networks.
