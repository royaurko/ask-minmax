We study the properties of gravitational system in finite regions bounded by
gravitational screens. We present the detail construction of the total energy
of such regions and of the energy and momentum balance equations due to the
flow of matter and gravitational radiation through the screen. We establish
that the gravitational screen possesses analogs of surface tension, internal
energy and viscous stress tensor, while the conservations are analogs of
non-equilibrium balance equations for a viscous system. This gives a precise
correspondence between gravity in finite regions and non-equilibrium
thermodynamics.
