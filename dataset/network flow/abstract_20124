In this article, we consider the diagonal geodesic flows on product of $k$
copies of non-compact hyperbolic spaces with finite volumes of dimension $n$
and we want to study the points on the product space such that their
trajectories under geodesic flows are divergent. We prove that the set of such
points has Hausdorff dimension $k(2n-1) -(n-1)/2$. This work is a
generalization of a result of Y. Cheung, which deals with the product space of
copies of the arithmetic space $SL(2,Z)\setminus SL(2,R)$. The proof involves
some interesting results on the distribution of the orbits of discrete group
actions on Furstenberg boundary.
