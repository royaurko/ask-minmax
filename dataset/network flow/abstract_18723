We present the development and validation of a new multivariate $b$ jet
identification algorithm ("$b$ tagger") used at the CDF experiment at the
Fermilab Tevatron. At collider experiments, $b$ taggers allow one to
distinguish particle jets containing $B$ hadrons from other jets. Employing
feed-forward neural network architectures, this tagger is unique in its
emphasis on using information from individual tracks. This tagger not only
contains the usual advantages of a multivariate technique such as maximal use
of information in a jet and tunable purity/efficiency operating points, but is
also capable of evaluating jets with only a single track. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the tagger, we employ a novel method wherein we calculate the
false tag rate and tag efficiency as a function of the placement of a lower
threshold on a jet's neural network output value in $Z+1$ jet and $t\bar{t}$
candidate samples, rich in light flavor and $b$ jets, respectively.
