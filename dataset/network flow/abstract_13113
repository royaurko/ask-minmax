We show the complete integrability of N=2 nonstandard KP flows establishing
the biHamiltonian structures. One of Hamiltonian structures is shown to be
isomorphic to the nonlinear N=2 $\hat W_{\infty}$ algebra with the bosonic
sector having $\hat W_{1+\infty}\oplus \hat W_{\infty}$ structure. A consistent
free field representation of the super conformal algebra is obtained. The
bosonic generators are found to be an admixture of free fermions and free
complex bosons, unlike the linear one. The fermionic generators become
exponential in free fields, in general.
