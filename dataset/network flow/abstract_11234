We present an efficient routing approach for delivering packets in complex
networks. On delivering a message from a node to a destination, a node forwards
the message to a neighbor by estimating the waiting time along the shortest
path from each of its neighbors to the destination. This projected waiting time
is dynamical in nature and the path through which a message is delivered would
be adapted to the distribution of messages in the network. Implementing the
approach on scale-free networks, we show that the present approach performs
better than the shortest-path approach and another approach that takes into
account of the waiting time only at the neighboring nodes. Key features in
numerical results are explained by a mean field theory. The approach has the
merit that messages are distributed among the nodes according to the
capabilities of the nodes in handling messages.
