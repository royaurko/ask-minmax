I construct combined electric and magnetic field variables which
independently represent energy flows in the forward and backward directions
respectively, and use these to re-formulate Maxwell's equations. The emphasis
is on detailed calculations, with a more general overview being published in
Phys. Rev. A72 and arXiv. These directional variables enable us to not only
judge the effect and significance of backward-travelling field components, but
also to discard them when appropriate. They thereby have the potential to
simplify numerical simulations, leading to potential speed gains of up to 100%
over standard FDTD or PSSD simulations. These field variables are also used to
derive both envelope equations useful for narrow-band pulse propagation, and a
second order wave equation. Alternative definitions are also presented, along
with their associated wave equations.
