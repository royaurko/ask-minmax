Tolls are collected on many highways as a means of traffic control and
revenue generation. However, the presence of tollbooths on highway surely slows
down traffic flow. Here, we investigate how the presence of tollbooths affect
the average car speed using a simple-minded single lane deterministic discrete
traffic model. More importantly, the model is exactly solvable.
