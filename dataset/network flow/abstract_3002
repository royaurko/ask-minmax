We provide abstract conditions which imply the existence of a robustly
invariant neighbourhood of a global section of a fibre bundle flow. We then
apply such a result to the bundle flow generated by an Anosov flow when the
fibre is the space of jets (which are described by local manifolds). As a
consequence we obtain sets of manifolds (e.g. approximations of stable
manifolds) that are left invariant, {\bf for all} negative times, by the flow
and its small perturbations. Finally, we show that the latter result can be
used to easily fix a mistake recently uncovered in the paper {\em Smooth Anosov
flows: correlation spectra and stability}, \cite{BuL}, by the present contributors.
