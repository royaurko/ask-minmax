We investigate a network of diffusively Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with
long-range synaptic coupling. By means of a specific perturbation technique, we
show by using the Lienard form of the model that it can be governed by a
complex fractional Ginzburg-Landau (CFGL) equation where analytical as well as
numerical nonlinear wave solutions can be obtained. We propose the semi
implicit Riesz fractional finite-difference scheme to solve efficiently the
obtained CFGL equation. From numerical simulations, it is found that the
fractional solutions for the nerve impulse are well-localized impulses whose
shape and stability depend on the value of the long-range parameter.
