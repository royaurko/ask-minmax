In this paper geology and planetology are considered using new conceptual
basis of high-speed flow dynamics. Recent photo technics allow to see all
details of a flow, 'cause the flow is static during very short time interval.
On the other hand, maps and images of many planets are accessible. Identity of
geological flows and high-speed gas dynamics is demonstrated. There is another
time scale, and no more. All results, as far as the concept, are new and belong
to the contributor. No formulae, pictures only.
