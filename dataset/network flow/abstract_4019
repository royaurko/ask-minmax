We study $n$-dimensional K\"ahler manifolds whose geodesic flows possess $n$
first integrals in involution that are fibrewise hermitian forms and
simultaneously normalizable. Under some mild assumption, one can associate with
such a manifold an $n$-dimensional commutative Lie algebra of infinitesimal
automorphisms. This, combined with the given $n$ first integrals, makes the
geodesic flow integrable. If the manifold is compact, then it becomes a toric
variety.
