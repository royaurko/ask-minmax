Tourism destination networks are amongst the most complex dynamical systems,
involving a myriad of human-made and natural resources. In this work we report
a complex network-based systematic analysis of the Elba (Italy) tourism
destination network, including the characterization of its structure in terms
of a set of several traditional measurements, the investigation of its
modularity, as well as its comprehensive study in terms of the recently
reported superedges approach. In particular, structural (the number of paths of
distinct lengths between pairs of nodes, as well as the number of reachable
companies) and dynamical features (transition probabilities and the
inward/outward activations and accessibilities) are measured and analyzed,
leading to a series of important findings related to the interactions between
tourism companies. Among the several reported results, it is shown that the
type and size of the companies influence strongly their respective activations
and accessibilities, while their geographical position does not seem to matter.
It is also shown that the Elba tourism network is largely fragmented and
heterogeneous, so that it could benefit from increased integration.
