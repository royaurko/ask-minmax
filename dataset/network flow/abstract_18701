We consider a wireless Device-to-Device (D2D) network where communication is
restricted to be single-hop, users make arbitrary requests from a finite
library of possible files and user devices cache information in the form of
linear combinations of packets from the files in the library (coded caching).
We consider the combined effect of coding in the caching and delivery phases,
achieving "coded multicast gain", and of spatial reuse due to local short-range
D2D communication. Somewhat counterintuitively, we show that the coded
multicast gain and the spatial reuse gain do not cumulate, in terms of the
throughput scaling laws. In particular, the spatial reuse gain shown in our
previous work on uncoded random caching and the coded multicast gain shown in
this paper yield the same scaling laws behavior, but no further scaling law
gain can be achieved by using both coded caching and D2D spatial reuse.
