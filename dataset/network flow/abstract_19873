We have derived the full set of MHD equations for incompressible shear flow
of a magnetized fluid and considered their solution in the wave-vector space.
The linearized equations give the famous amplification of slow magnetosonic
waves and describe the magnetorotational instability. The nonlinear terms in
our analysis are responsible for the creation of turbulence and self-sustained
spectral density of the MHD (Alfven and pseudo-Alfven) waves. Perspectives for
numerical simulations of weak turbulence and calculation of the effective
viscosity of accretion disks are shortly discussed in k-space.
