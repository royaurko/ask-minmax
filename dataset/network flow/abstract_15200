Understanding the emergence of extreme opinions and in what kind of
environment they might become less extreme is a central theme in our modern
globalized society. A model combining continuous opinions and observed discrete
actions (CODA) capable of addressing the important issue of measuring how
extreme opinions might be has been recently proposed. In this paper I show
extreme opinions to arise in a ubiquitous manner in the CODA model for a
multitude of social network structures. Depending on network details reducing
extremism seems to be possible. However, a large number agents with extreme
opinions is always observed. A significant decrease in the number of extremists
can be observed by allowing agents to change their positions in the network.
