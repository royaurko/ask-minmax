In this paper we explore general conditions which guarantee that the geodesic
flow on a 2-dimensional manifold with indefinite signature is locally
separable. This is equivalent to showing that a 2-dimensional natural
Hamiltonian system on the hyperbolic plane possesses a second integral of
motion which is a quadratic polynomial in the momenta associated with a
2nd-rank Killing tensor. We examine the possibility that the integral is
preserved by the Hamiltonian flow on a given energy hypersurface only (weak
integrability) and derive the additional requirement necessary to have
conservation at arbitrary values of the Hamiltonian (strong integrability).
Using null coordinates, we show that the leading-order coefficients of the
invariant are arbitrary functions of one variable in the case of weak
integrability. These functions are quadratic polynomials in the coordinates in
the case of strong integrability. We show that for $(1+1)$-dimensional systems
there are three possible types of conformal Killing tensors, and therefore,
three distinct separability structures in contrast to the single standard
Hamilton-Jacobi type separation in the positive definite case. One of the new
separability structures is the complex/harmonic type which is characterized by
complex separation variables. The other new type is the linear/null separation
which occurs when the conformal Killing tensor has a null eigenvector.
