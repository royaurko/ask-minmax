We study Hamilton-Jacobi equations on networks in the case where Hamiltonians
are quasi-convex with respect to the gradient variable and can be discontinuous
with respect to the space variable at vertices. First, we prove that imposing a
general vertex condition is equivalent to imposing a specific one which only
depends on Hamiltonians and an additional free parameter, the flux limiter.
Second, a general method for proving comparison principles is introduced. This
method consists in constructing a vertex test function to be used in the
doubling variable approach. With such a theory and such a method in hand, we
present various applications, among which a very general existence and
uniqueness result for quasi-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equations on networks.
