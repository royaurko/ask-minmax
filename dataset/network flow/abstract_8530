Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regularly deployed in unattended and hostile
environments. The WSN is vulnerable to security threats and susceptible to
physical capture. Thus, it is necessary to use effective mechanisms to protect
the network. It is widely known, that the intrusion detection is one of the
most efficient security mechanisms to protect the network against malicious
attacks or uncontributorized access. In this paper, we propose a hybrid intrusion
detection system for clustered WSN. Our intrusion framework uses a combination
between the Anomaly Detection based on support vector machine (SVM) and the
Misuse Detection. Experiments results show that most of routing attacks can be
detected with low false alarm.
