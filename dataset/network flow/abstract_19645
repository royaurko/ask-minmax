We investigate fluctuations in the momentum flux across a surface
perpendicular to the velocity gradient in a stationary shear flow maintained by
either thermostated deterministic or by stochastic boundary conditions. In the
deterministic system the Gallavotti-Cohen (GC)relation for the probability of
large deviations, which holds for the phase space volume contraction giving the
Gibbs ensemble entropy production, never seems to hold for the flux which gives
the hydrodynamic entropy production. In the stochastic case the GC relation is
found to hold for the total flux, as predicted by extensions of the GC theorem
but not for the flux across part of the surface. The latter appear to satisfy a
modified GC relation. Similar results are obtained for the heat flux in a
steady state produced by stochastic boundaries at different temperatures.
