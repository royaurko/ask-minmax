We study network design with a cost structure motivated by redundancy in data
traffic. We are given a graph, g groups of terminals, and a universe of data
packets. Each group of terminals desires a subset of the packets from its
respective source. The cost of routing traffic on any edge in the network is
proportional to the total size of the distinct packets that the edge carries.
Our goal is to find a minimum cost routing. We focus on two settings. In the
first, the collection of packet sets desired by source-sink pairs is laminar.
For this setting, we present a primal-dual based 2-approximation, improving
upon a logarithmic approximation due to Barman and Chawla (2012). In the second
setting, packet sets can have non-trivial intersection. We focus on the case
where each packet is desired by either a single terminal group or by all of the
groups, and the graph is unweighted. For this setting we present an O(log
g)-approximation.
  Our approximation for the second setting is based on a novel spanner-type
construction in unweighted graphs that, given a collection of g vertex subsets,
finds a subgraph of cost only a constant factor more than the minimum spanning
tree of the graph, such that every subset in the collection has a Steiner tree
in the subgraph of cost at most O(log g) that of its minimum Steiner tree in
the original graph. We call such a subgraph a group spanner.
