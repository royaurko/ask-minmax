It is very common with molecular dynamics and other simulation techniques to
apply Lees-Edwards periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) for the simulation of
shear flow. However the behavior of a complex liquid can be quite different
under extensional flow. Simple deformation of a simulation cell and its
periodic images only allows for simulations of these flows with short duration.
For the simulation of planar extensional flow it was recognized that the PBCs
of Kraynik and Reinelt [Int. J. Multiphase Flow 18, 1045 (1992)] could be used
to perform simulations of this flow with arbitrary duration. However, a very
common extensional flow in industrial applications and experiment is uniaxial
extensional flow. Kraynik and Reinelt found that their method could not be
directly generalized to this flow because of the lack of a lattice which
reproduces itself during uniaxial extension. PBCs are presented in this article
which solve this problem, by finding a lattice which is compatible with the
flow, finding the reduced basis to the lattice at all times and using this
basis when calculating the position and separation of particles. Using these
new PBCs we perform nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a simple
liquid and show that the technique gives results which agree with those from
simulations using simply deforming PBCs.
