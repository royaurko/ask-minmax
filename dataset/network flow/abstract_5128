Disentangling the mechanisms underlying the social network evolution is one
of social science's unsolved puzzles. Preferential attachment is a powerful
mechanism explaining social network dynamics, yet not able to explain all
scaling-laws in social networks. Recent advances in understanding social
network dynamics demonstrate that several scaling-laws in social networks
follow as natural consequences of triadic closure. Macroscopic comparisons
between them are discussed empirically in many works. However the network
evolution drives not only the emergence of macroscopic scaling but also the
microscopic behaviors. Here we exploit two fundamental aspects of the network
microscopic evolution: the individual influence evolution and the process of
link formation. First we develop a novel framework for the microscopic
evolution, where the mechanisms of preferential attachment and triadic closure
are well balanced. Then on four real-world datasets we apply our approach for
two microscopic problems: node's prominence prediction and link prediction,
where our method yields significant predictive improvement over baseline
solutions. Finally to be rigorous and comprehensive, we further observe that
our framework has a stronger generalization capacity across different kinds of
social networks for two microscopic prediction problems. We unveil the
significant factors with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been
possible, and shed new light on networks evolution.
