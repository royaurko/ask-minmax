In the present work the zonal flow (ZF) growth rate in toroidal
ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) mode turbulence including the effects of
elongation is studied analytically. The scaling of the ZF growth with plasma
parameters is examined for typical tokamak parameter values. The physical model
used for the toroidal ITG driven mode is based on the ion continuity and ion
temperature equations whereas the ZF evolution is described by the vorticity
equation. The results indicate that a large ZF growth is found close to
marginal stability and for peaked density profiles and these effects may be
enhanced by elongation.
