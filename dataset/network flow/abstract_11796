In this paper, we analyze the behavior of the global clustering coefficient
in scale free graphs. We are especially interested in the case of degree
distribution with an infinite variance, since such degree distribution is
usually observed in real-world networks of diverse nature.
  There are two common definitions of the clustering coefficient of a graph:
global clustering and average local clustering. It is widely believed that in
real networks both clustering coefficients tend to some positive constant as
the networks grow. There are several models for which the average local
clustering coefficient tends to a positive constant. On the other hand, there
are no models of scale-free networks with an infinite variance of degree
distribution and with a constant global clustering.
  In this paper we prove that if the degree distribution obeys the power law
with an infinite variance, then the global clustering coefficient tends to zero
with high probability as the size of a graph grows.
