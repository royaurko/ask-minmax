We propose an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm for semi-blind
channel estimation of reciprocal channels in amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way
relay networks (TWRNs). By incorporating both data samples and pilots into the
estimation, the proposed algorithm provides substantially higher accuracy than
the conventional training-based approach. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm
has a linear computational complexity per iteration and converges after a small
number of iterations.
