We investigate cascade dynamics in threshold-controlled (multiplex)
propagation on random geometric networks. We find that such local dynamics can
serve as an efficient, robust, and reliable prototypical activation protocol in
sensor networks in responding to various alarm scenarios. We also consider the
same dynamics on a modified network by adding a few long-range communication
links, resulting in a small-world network. We find that such construction can
further enhance and optimize the speed of the network's response, while keeping
energy consumption at a manageable level.
