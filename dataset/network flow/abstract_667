We propose a percolation based M2M networking architecture and its data
transmission method. The proposed network architecture can be server-free and
router-free, which allows us to operate routing efficiently with percolations
based on six degrees of separation theory in small world network modeling. The
data transmission can be divided into two phases: routing and data transmission
phases. In the routing phase, probe packets will be transmitted and forwarded
in the network thus multiple paths are selected and performed based on the
constriction of the maximum hop number. In the second phase, the information
will be encoded, say, with the fountain codes, and transmitted using the paths
generated in the first phase. In such a way, an efficient routing and data
transmission mechanism can be built, which allow us to construct a low-cost,
flexible and ubiquitous network. Such a networking architecture and data
transmission can be used in many M2M communications, such as the stub network
of internet of things, and deep space networking, and so on.
