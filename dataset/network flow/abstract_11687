Design of control applications over wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a
challenging issue due to the bandwidth-limited communication medium, energy
constraints and real-time data delivery requirements. This paper introduces a
new information extraction method for WSN-based control applications, which
reduces the number of required data transmissions to save energy and avoid data
congestion. According to the proposed approach, control applications recognize
when new data readings have to be collected and determine sensor nodes that
have to be activated on the basis of uncertainty analysis. Processing of the
selectively collected input data is based on definition of information granules
that describe state of the controlled system as well as performance of
particular control decisions. This method was implemented for object tracking
in WSNs. The task is to control movement of a mobile sink, which has to reach a
target in the shortest possible time. Extensive simulation experiments were
performed to compare performance of the proposed approach against
state-of-the-art methods. Results of the experiments show that the presented
information extraction method allows for substantial reduction in the amount of
transmitted data with no significant negative effect on tracking performance.
