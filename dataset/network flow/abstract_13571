The three-dimensional compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) isentropic flow
with zero magnetic diffusivity is studied. The vanishing magnetic diffusivity
causes significant difficulties due to the loss of dissipation of the magnetic
field. The existence and uniqueness of local in time strong solution with large
initial data is established. The strong solution has weaker regularity than the
classical solution. A generalized Lax-Milgram theorem and a
Schauder-Tychonoff-type fixed point argument are applied with novel techniques
and estimates for the strong solution.
