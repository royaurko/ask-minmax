task for developers. In this paper I briefly discuss aero fighting war game
based on simple 2D gaming concepts and developed in C & C++ programming
languages, using old bitmapping concepts. Going into the details of the game
development, I discuss the designed strategies, flow of game and implemented
prototype version of game, especially for beginners of game programming.
