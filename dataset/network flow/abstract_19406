The light curves of type I X-ray bursts (XRBs) result from energy released
from the atmosphere of a neutron star when accreted hydrogen and helium ignite
and burn explosively via the rp-process. Since charged particle reaction rates
are both density and very temperature dependent, a simulation model must
provide accurate values of these variables to predict the reaction flow. This
paper uses a self-consistent one-dimensional model calculation with a constant
accretion rate of dM/dt=5e16g/s (0.045 Eddington) and reports on the detailed
rp-process reaction flow of a given burst.
