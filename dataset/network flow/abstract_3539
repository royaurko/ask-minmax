Community detection algorithms are fundamental tools that allow us to uncover
organizational principles in networks. When detecting communities, there are
two possible sources of information one can use: the network structure, and the
features and attributes of nodes. Even though communities form around nodes
that have common edges and common attributes, typically, algorithms have only
focused on one of these two data modalities: community detection algorithms
traditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms
mostly consider only node attributes. In this paper, we develop Communities
from Edge Structure and Node Attributes (CESNA), an accurate and scalable
algorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node
attributes. CESNA statistically models the interaction between the network
structure and the node attributes, which leads to more accurate community
detection as well as improved robustness in the presence of noise in the
network structure. CESNA has a linear runtime in the network size and is able
to process networks an order of magnitude larger than comparable approaches.
Last, CESNA also helps with the interpretation of detected communities by
finding relevant node attributes for each community.
