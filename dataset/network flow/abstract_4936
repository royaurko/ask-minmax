The compressible flow around a blunt object has diverse applications, but
present analytic treatments are inaccurate and limited to narrow parameter
regimes. We show that the flow in front of an axisymmetric body can be
accurately derived analytically by parameterizing the perpendicular gradients
in terms of the parallel velocity. This reproduces both subsonic and supersonic
flows measured and simulated around a sphere, including the transonic regime
and the bow shock properties.
