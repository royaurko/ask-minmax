We consider a phase field model for the flow of two partly miscible
incompressible, viscous fluids of Non-Newtonian (power law) type. In the model
it is assumed that the densities of the fluids are equal. We prove existence of
weak solutions for general initial data and arbitrarily large times with the
aid of a parabolic Lipschitz truncation method, which preserves solenoidal
velocity fields and was recently developed by Breit, Diening, and Schwarzacher.
