Major wireless operators are nowadays facing network capacity issues in
striving to meet the growing demands of mobile users. At the same time,
3G-enabled devices increasingly benefit from ad hoc radio connectivity (e.g.,
Wi-Fi). In this context of hybrid connectivity, we propose Push-and-track, a
content dissemination framework that harnesses ad hoc communication
opportunities to minimize the load on the wireless infrastructure while
guaranteeing tight delivery delays. It achieves this through a control loop
that collects user-sent acknowledgements to determine if new copies need to be
reinjected into the network through the 3G interface. Push-and-Track includes
multiple strategies to determine how many copies of the content should be
injected, when, and to whom. The short delay-tolerance of common content, such
as news or road traffic updates, make them suitable for such a system. Based on
a realistic large-scale vehicular dataset from the city of Bologna composed of
more than 10,000 vehicles, we demonstrate that Push-and-Track consistently
meets its delivery objectives while reducing the use of the 3G network by over
90%.
