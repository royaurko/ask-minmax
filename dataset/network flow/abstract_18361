Is it possible to link a set of nodes without using preexisting positional
information or any kind of long-range attraction of the nodes? Can the process
of generating positional information, i.e. the detection of ``unknown'' nodes
and the estabishment of chemical gradients, \emph{and} the process of network
formation, i.e. the establishment of links between nodes, occur in parallel, on
a comparable time scale, as a process of co-evolution?
  The paper discusses a model where the generation of relevant information for
establishing the links between nodes results from the interaction of many
\emph{agents}, i.e. subunits of the system that are capable of performing some
activities. Their collective interaction is based on (indirect) communication,
which also includes memory effects and the dissemination of information in the
system. The relevant (``pragmatic'') information that leads to the
establishment of the links then emerges from an evolutionary interplay of
selection and reamplification.
