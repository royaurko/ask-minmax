A modified lattice Boltzmann model with a stochastic relaxation mechanism
mimicking "virtual'' collisions between free-streaming particles and solid
walls is introduced. This modified scheme permits to compute plane channel
flows in satisfactory agreement with analytical results over a broad spectrum
of Knudsen numbers, ranging from the hydrodynamic regime, all the way to
quasi-free flow regimes up to Kn 30.
