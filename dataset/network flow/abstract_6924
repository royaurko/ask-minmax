It has long been conjectured that starting at a generic smooth closed
embedded surface in R^3, the mean curvature flow remains smooth until it
arrives at a singularity in a neighborhood of which the flow looks like
concentric spheres or cylinders. That is, the only singularities of a generic
flow are spherical or cylindrical. We will address this conjecture here and in
a sequel. The higher dimensional case will be addressed elsewhere.
  The key in showing this conjecture is to show that shrinking spheres,
cylinders and planes are the only stable self-shrinkers under the mean
curvature flow. We prove this here in all dimensions. An easy consequence of
this is that every other singularity than spheres and cylinders can be
perturbed away.
