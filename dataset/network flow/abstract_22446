After reviewing the evidence that QCD matter at ultrarelativistic energies
behaves as a very good fluid, we describe the connection of QCD fluidity to
heavy quark observables. We review the way in which heavy quark spectra can
place tighter limits on the viscosity of QCD matter. Finally, we show that
correlations between flow observables and the event-by-event charm quark
abundance ("flavoring") can shed light on the system's equation of state.
