We study definably amenable groups in NIP theories, and answer a question of
Newelski (and also of Chernikov-Simon), by giving an example in the o-minimal
context where weak generic types do not coincide with almost periodic types,
equivalently where the union of the minimal subflows of suitable type spaces is
not closed. We give other positive results in this o-minimal context.
