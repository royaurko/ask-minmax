What is the relationship between brain and behavior? The answer to this
question necessitates characterizing the mapping between structure and
function. The aim of this paper is to discuss broad issues surrounding the link
between structure and function in the brain that will motivate a network
perspective to understanding this question. As others in the past, I argue that
a network perspective should supplant the common strategy of understanding the
brain in terms of individual regions. Whereas this perspective is needed for a
fuller characterization of the mind-brain, it should not be viewed as panacea.
For one, the challenges posed by the many-to-many mapping between regions and
functions is not dissolved by the network perspective. Although the problem is
ameliorated, one should not anticipate a one-to-one mapping when the network
approach is adopted. Furthermore, decomposition of the brain network in terms
of meaningful clusters of regions, such as the ones generated by
community-finding algorithms, does not by itself reveal 'true' subnetworks.
Given the hierarchical and multi-relational relationship between regions,
multiple decompositions will offer different 'slices' of a broader landscape of
networks within the brain. Finally, I described how the function of brain
regions can be characterized in a multidimensional manner via the idea of
diversity profiles. The concept can also be used to describe the way different
brain regions participate in networks.
