Community detection is a very active field in complex networks analysis,
consisting in identifying groups of nodes more densely interconnected
relatively to the rest of the network. The existing algorithms are usually
tested and compared on real-world and artificial networks, their performance
being assessed through some partition similarity measure. However, artificial
networks realism can be questioned, and the appropriateness of those measures
is not obvious. In this study, we take advantage of recent advances concerning
the characterization of community structures to tackle these questions. We
first generate networks thanks to the most realistic model available to date.
Their analysis reveals they display only some of the properties observed in
real-world community structures. We then apply five community detection
algorithms on these networks and find out the performance assessed
quantitatively does not necessarily agree with a qualitative analysis of the
identified communities. It therefore seems both approaches should be applied to
perform a relevant comparison of the algorithms.
