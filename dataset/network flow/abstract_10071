We review recent dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations of
electrolyte flow in nanochannels. A method is presented by which the slip
length $delta_B$ at the channel boundaries can be tuned systematically from
negative to infinity by introducing suitably adjusted wall-fluid friction
forces. Using this method, we study electroosmotic flow (EOF) in nanochannels
for varying surface slip conditions and fluids of different ionic strength.
Analytic expressions for the flow profiles are derived from the Stokes
equation, which are in good agreement with the numerical results. Finally, we
investigate the influence of EOF on the effective mobility of polyelectrolytes
in nanochannels. The relevant quantity characterizing the effect of slippage is
found to be the dimensionless quantity $\kappa \delta_B$, where $1/\kappa$ is
an effective electrostatic screening length at the channel boundaries.
