A lot of research effort has been put into community detection from all
corners of academic interest such as physics, mathematics and computer science.
In this paper I have proposed a Bi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for community
detection which maximizes modularity and community score. Then the results
obtained for both benchmark and real life data sets are compared with other
algorithms using the modularity and MNI performance metrics. The results show
that the BOCD algorithm is capable of successfully detecting community
structure in both real life and synthetic datasets, as well as improving upon
the performance of previous techniques.
