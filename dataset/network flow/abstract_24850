With the growing use of biometric authentication systems in the past years,
spoof fingerprint detection has become increasingly important. In this work, we
implement and evaluate two different feature extraction techniques for
software-based fingerprint liveness detection: Convolutional Networks with
random weights and Local Binary Patterns. Both techniques were used in
conjunction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Dataset
Augmentation was used to increase classifier's performance and a variety of
preprocessing operations were tested, such as frequency filtering, contrast
equalization, and region of interest filtering. The experiments were made on
the datasets used in The Liveness Detection Competition of years 2009, 2011 and
2013, which comprise almost 50,000 real and fake fingerprints' images. Our best
method achieves an overall rate of 95.2% of correctly classified samples - an
improvement of 35% in test error when compared with the best previously
published results.
