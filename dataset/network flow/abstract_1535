While smartphone usage become more and more pervasive, people start also
asking to which extent such devices can be maliciously exploited as "tracking
devices". The concern is not only related to an adversary taking physical or
remote control of the device (e.g., via a malicious app), but also to what a
passive adversary (without the above capabilities) can observe from the device
communications. Work in this latter direction aimed, for example, at inferring
the apps a user has installed on his device, or identifying the presence of a
specific user within a network.
  In this paper, we move a step forward: we investigate to which extent it is
feasible to identify the specific actions that a user is doing on his mobile
device, by simply eavesdropping the device's network traffic. In particular, we
aim at identifying actions like browsing someone's profile on a social network,
posting a message on a friend's wall, or sending an email. We design a system
that achieves this goal starting from encrypted TCP/IP packets: it works
through identification of network flows and application of machine learning
techniques. We did a complete implementation of this system and run a thorough
set of experiments, which show that it can achieve accuracy and precision
higher than 95%, for most of the considered actions.
