Many epidemic models approximate social contact behavior by assuming random
mixing within mixing groups (e.g., homes, schools and workplaces). The effect
of more realistic social network structure on estimates of epidemic parameters
is an open area of exploration. We develop a detailed statistical model to
estimate the social contact network within a high school using friendship
network data and a survey of contact behavior. Our contact network model
includes classroom structure, longer durations of contacts to friends than
nonfriends and more frequent contacts with friends, based on reports in the
contact survey. We performed simulation studies to explore which network
structures are relevant to influenza transmission. These studies yield two key
findings. First, we found that the friendship network structure important to
the transmission process can be adequately represented by a dyad-independent
exponential random graph model (ERGM). This means that individual-level sampled
data is sufficient to characterize the entire friendship network. Second, we
found that contact behavior was adequately represented by a static rather than
dynamic contact network.
