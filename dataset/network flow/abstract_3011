We introduce a dynamical system which we call the AdaBoost flow. The flow is
defined by a system of ODEs with control. We show that three algorithms of the
AdaBoost family (i) the AdaBoost algorithm of Schapire and Freund (ii) the
arc-gv algorithm of Breiman (iii) the confidence rated prediction of Schapire
and Singer can be can be embedded in the AdaBoost flow.
  The nontrivial part of the AdaBoost flow equations coincides with the
equations of dynamics of nonperiodic Toda system written in terms of spectral
variables. We provide a novel invariant geometrical description of the AdaBoost
algorithm as a gradient flow on a foliation defined by level sets of the
potential function.
  We propose a new approach for constructing boosting algorithms as a
continuous time gradient flow on measures defined by various metrics and
potential functions. Finally we explain similarity of the AdaBoost algorithm
with the Perelman's construction for the Ricci flow.
