We study the spin-down of a neutron star atmosphere during the Type I X-ray
burst in low mass X-ray binaries. Using polar cap acceleration models, we show
that the resulting stellar ``wind'' torque on the burning shell due to the
flowing charged particles (electrons, protons and ions) from the star's polar
caps may change the shell's angular momentum during the burst. We conclude that
the net change in the angular momentum of the star's atmosphere can account for
rather large frequency drifts observed during Type I X-ray burst.
