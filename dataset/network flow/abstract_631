We study the structure of the network representing the interurban commuting
traffic of the Sardinia region, Italy, which amounts to 375 municipalities and
1,600,000 inhabitants. We use a weighted network representation where vertices
correspond to towns and the edges to the actual commuting flows among those. We
characterize quantitatively both the topological and weighted properties of the
resulting network. Interestingly, the statistical properties of commuting
traffic exhibit complex features and non-trivial relations with the underlying
topology. We characterize quantitatively the traffic backbone among large
cities and we give evidences for a very high heterogeneity of the commuter
flows around large cities. We also discuss the interplay between the
topological and dynamical properties of the network as well as their relation
with socio-demographic variables such as population and monthly income. This
analysis may be useful at various stages in environmental planning and provides
analytical tools for a wide spectrum of applications ranging from impact
evaluation to decision-making and planning support.
