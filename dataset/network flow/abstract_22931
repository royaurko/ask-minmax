We investigate a stationary pair production cascade in the outer
magnetosphere of a spinning neutron star. The charge depletion due to global
flows of charged particles, causes a large electric field along the magnetic
field lines. Migratory electrons and/or positrons are accelerated by this field
to radiate curvature gamma-rays, some of which collide with the X-rays to
materialize as pairs in the gap. The replenished charges partially screen the
electric field, which is self-consistently solved, together with the
distribution functions of particles and gamma-rays. By solving the Vlasov
equations describing this pair production cascade, we demonstrate the existence
of a stationary gap in the outer magnetosphere of PSR B1055-52 for a wide range
of current densities flowing in the accelerator: From sub to super
Goldreich-Julian values. However, we find that the expected GeV spectrum
becomes very soft if the current density exceeds the Goldreich-Julian value. We
also demonstrate that the GeV spectrum softens with decreasing magnetic
inclination and with increasing distance to this pulsar. We thus conclude that
a sub-Goldreich-Julian current, a large magnetic inclination, and a small
distance (500 pc, say) are plausible to account for EGRET observations.
Furthermore, it is found that the TeV flux due to inverse Compton scatterings
of infrared photons whose spectrum is inferred from the Rayleigh-Jeans side of
the soft blackbody spectrum is much less than the observational upper limit.
