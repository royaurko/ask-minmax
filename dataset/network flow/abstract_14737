Monotone frameworks is one of the most successful frameworks for
intraprocedural data flow analysis extending the traditional class of bitvector
frameworks (like live variables and available expressions). Weighted pushdown
systems is similarly one of the most general frameworks for interprocedural
analysis of programs. However, it makes use of idempotent semirings to
represent the sets of properties and unfortunately they do not admit analyses
whose transfer functions are not strict (e.g., classical bitvector frameworks).
This motivates the development of algorithms for backward and forward
reachability of pushdown systems using sets of properties forming so-called
flow algebras that weaken some of the assumptions of idempotent semirings. In
particular they do admit the bitvector frameworks, monotone frameworks, as well
as idempotent semirings. We show that the algorithms are sound under mild
assumptions on the flow algebras, mainly that the set of properties constitutes
a join semi-lattice, and complete provided that the transfer functions are
suitably distributive (but not necessarily strict).
