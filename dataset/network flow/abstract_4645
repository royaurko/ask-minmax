We introduce a set of correlations between energy flow and event shapes that
are sensitive to the flow of color at short distances in jet events. These
correlations are formulated for a general set of event shapes, which includes
jet broadening and thrust as special cases. We illustrate the method for
electron-positron annihilation dijet events, and calculate the correlation at
leading logarithm in the energy flow and at next-to-leading-logarithm in the
event shape.
