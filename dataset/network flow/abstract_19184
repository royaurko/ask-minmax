Social media and social networking sites have become a global pinboard for
exposition and discussion of news, topics, and ideas, where social media users
increasingly form their opinion about a particular topic by learning
information about it from her peers. In this context, whenever a user posts a
message about a topic, we observe a noisy estimate of her current opinion about
it but the influence the user may have on other users' opinions is hidden. In
this paper, we introduce a probabilistic modeling framework of opinion
dynamics, which allows the underlying opinion of a user to be modulated by
those expressed by her neighbors over time. We then identify a set of
conditions under which users' opinions converge to a steady state, find a
linear relation between the initial opinions and the opinions in the steady
state, and develop an efficient estimation method to fit the parameters of the
model from historical fine-grained opinion and information diffusion event
data. Experiments on data gathered from Twitter, Reddit and Amazon show that
our model provides a good fit to the data and more accurate predictions than
alternatives.
