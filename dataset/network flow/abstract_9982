We analyze a mixed ensemble of low charge D4-D2-D0 brane states on the
quintic and show that these can be successfully enumerated using attractor flow
tree techniques and Donaldson-Thomas invariants. In this low charge regime one
needs to take into account worldsheet instanton corrections to the central
charges, which is accomplished by making use of mirror symmetry. All the
charges considered can be realized as fluxed D6-D2-D0 and anti-D6-D2-D0 pairs
which we enumerate using DT invariants. Our procedure uses the low charge
counterpart of the picture developed Denef and Moore. By establishing the
existence of flow trees numerically and refining the index factorization
scheme, we reproduce and improve some results obtained by Gaiotto, Strominger
and Yin. Our results provide appealing evidence that the strong split flow tree
conjecture holds and allows to compute exact results for an important sector of
the theory. Our refined scheme for computing indices might shed some light on
how to improve index computations for systems with larger charges.
