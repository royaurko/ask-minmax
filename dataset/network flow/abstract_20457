We present a spatio-temporal analysis of a statistically stationary rotating
turbulence experiment, aiming to extract a signature of inertial waves, and to
determine the scales and frequencies at which they can be detected. The
analysis uses two-point spatial correlations of the temporal Fourier transform
of velocity fields obtained from time-resolved stereoscopic particle image
velocimetry measurements in the rotating frame. We quantify the degree of
anisotropy of turbulence as a function of frequency and spatial scale. We show
that this space-time-dependent anisotropy is well described by the dispersion
relation of linear inertial waves at large scale, while smaller scales are
dominated by the sweeping of the waves by fluid motion at larger scales. This
sweeping effect is mostly due to the low-frequency quasi-two-dimensional
component of the turbulent flow, a prominent feature of our experiment which is
not accounted for by wave turbulence theory. These results question the
relevance of this theory for rotating turbulence at the moderate Rossby numbers
accessible in laboratory experiments, which are relevant to most geophysical
and astrophysical flows.
