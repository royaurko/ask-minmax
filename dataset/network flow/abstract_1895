Conserved dynamical systems are generally considered to be critical. We study
a class of critical routing models, equivalent to random maps, which can be
solved rigorously in the thermodynamic limit. The information flow is conserved
for these routing models and governed by cyclic attractors. We consider two
classes of information flow, Markovian routing without memory and vertex
routing involving a one-step routing memory. Investigating the respective cycle
length distributions for complete graphs we find log corrections to power-law
scaling for the mean cycle length, as a function of the number of vertices, and
a sub-polynomial growth for the overall number of cycles.
  When observing experimentally a real-world dynamical system one normally
samples stochastically its phase space. The number and the length of the
attractors are then weighted by the size of their respective basins of
attraction. This situation is equivalent to `on the fly' generation of routing
tables for which we find power law scaling for the weighted average length of
attractors, for both conserved routing models. These results show that critical
dynamical systems are generically not scale-invariant, but may show power-law
scaling when sampled stochastically. It is hence important to distinguish
between intrinsic properties of a critical dynamical system and its behavior
that one would observe when randomly probing its phase space.
