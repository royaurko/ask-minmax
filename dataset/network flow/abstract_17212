The roles and interactions which nodes take part in has a significant impact
on the structure of a network. In order to estimate this underlying latent
structure, its numbers and composition from real data, flexible treatment of
the structural uncertainty and efficient use of available information becomes a
key issue. I take a Bayesian nonparametric approach, jointly modeling sparse
network, node textual information and potentially unbounded number of
components to handle the aforementioned task. I show using synthetic and real
datasets that my model successfully learns the underlying structure
utperforming previous method.
