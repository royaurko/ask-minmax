We numerically study the dynamics of run-and-tumble particles in two
confining vessels connected by thin channels. Two dominant dynamical behaviors
emerge: (i) an oscillatory pumping state, in which particles alternatively fill
the two vessels and (ii) a circulating flow state, dynamically maintaining a
near constant population level in the containers when connected by two
channels. The narrowness of channels and the out-of-equilibrium nature of the
system give rise to accumulation phenomena and long-lived spontaneous flows of
active particles.
