We report on large scale numerical simulations of fracture surfaces using
random fuse networks for two very different disorders. There are some
properties and exponents that are different for the two distributions, but
others, notably the roughness exponents, seem universal. For the universal
roughness exponent we found a value of zeta = 0.62 +/- 0.05. In contrast to
what is observed in two dimensions, this value is lower than that reported in
experimental studies of brittle fractures, and rules out the minimal energy
surface exponent, 0.41 +/- 0.01.
