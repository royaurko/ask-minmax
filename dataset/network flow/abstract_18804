The burst in the use of online social networks over the last decade has
provided evidence that current rumor spreading models miss some fundamental
ingredients in order to reproduce how information is disseminated. In
particular, recent literature has revealed that these models fail to reproduce
the fact that some nodes in a network have an influential role when it comes to
spread a piece of information. In this work, we introduce two mechanisms with
the aim of filling the gap between theoretical and experimental results. The
first model introduces the assumption that spreaders are not always active
whereas the second model considers the possibility that an ignorant is not
interested in spreading the rumor. In both cases, results from numerical
simulations show a higher adhesion to real data than classical rumor spreading
models. Our results shed some light on the mechanisms underlying the spreading
of information and ideas in large social systems and pave the way for more
realistic diffusion models.
