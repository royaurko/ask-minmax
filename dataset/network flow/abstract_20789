Codes in the projective space and codes in the Grassmannian over a finite
field - referred to as subspace codes and constant-dimension codes (CDCs),
respectively - have been proposed for error control in random linear network
coding. For subspace codes and CDCs, a subspace metric was introduced to
correct both errors and erasures, and an injection metric was proposed to
correct adversarial errors. In this paper, we investigate the packing and
covering properties of subspace codes with both metrics. We first determine
some fundamental geometric properties of the projective space with both
metrics. Using these properties, we then derive bounds on the cardinalities of
packing and covering subspace codes, and determine the asymptotic rates of
optimal packing and optimal covering subspace codes with both metrics. Our
results not only provide guiding principles for the code design for error
control in random linear network coding, but also illustrate the difference
between the two metrics from a geometric perspective. In particular, our
results show that optimal packing CDCs are optimal packing subspace codes up to
a scalar for both metrics if and only if their dimension is half of their
length (up to rounding). In this case, CDCs suffer from only limited rate loss
as opposed to subspace codes with the same minimum distance. We also show that
optimal covering CDCs can be used to construct asymptotically optimal covering
subspace codes with the injection metric only.
