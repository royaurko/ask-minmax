This paper studies the striking correlation between nanosized structural
patterns in YBCO films and macroscopic transport current. A nanosized network
of parallel Josephson junctions laced by insulating dislocations is almost
mimicking the grain boundary structural network. It contributes to the
macroscopic properties and accounts for the strong intergranular pinning across
the film in the intermediate temperature range. The correlation between the two
networks enables to find out an outstanding scaling law in the (Jc,B) plane and
to determine meaningful parameters concerning the matching between the vortex
lattice and the intergranular defect lattice. Two asymptotic behaviors of the
pinning force below the flux flow regime are checked: the corresponding vortex
phases are clearly individuated.
