We discuss the complex dynamics of a non-linear random networks model, as a
function of the connectivity k between the elements of the network. We show
that this class of networks exhibit an order-chaos phase transition for a
critical connectivity k = 2. Also, we show that both, pairwise correlation and
complexity measures are maximized in dynamically critical networks. These
results are in good agreement with the previously reported studies on random
Boolean networks and random threshold networks, and show once again that
critical networks provide an optimal coordination of diverse behavior.
