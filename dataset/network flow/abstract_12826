We report the discovery of a pair of large Herbig-Haro type structures
roughly 10 arcminutes (1.3 pc) north-east and south-west of the source driving
the well-known HH 46/47 Herbig-Haro jet in new deep emission-line images made
using the Wide Field Imager on the ESO/MPG La Silla 2.2-m telescope. These new
images suggest that the HH 46/47 outflow is much more extensive than previously
assumed, extending over a total of 2.6 pc on the sky, or over 3 pc in space,
when deprojected. HH 46/47 thus also belongs to the recently-discovered class
of giant Herbig-Haro flows.
