Hard photons emitted from energetic heavy ion collisions are very interesting
since they do not experience nuclear interaction, and therefore they are useful
to explore properties of nuclear matter. We investigated hard photon production
and its properties in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions with the help of
the Blotzmann-Uehling-Ulenbeck model. Two components of hard photons are
discussed: direct and thermal. The positive directed flow parameter and
negative elliptic flow parameter of direct photons are demonstrated and they
are anti-correlated to the flows of free protons. The dependencies of hard
photon production and anisotropic parameters on impact parameter, beam energy,
nuclear equation of state and symmetry energy are also discussed. Furthermore,
we investigated the two-photon momentum correlation function from which the
space-time structure information of the photon source could be extracted as
well as the two-photon azimuthal correlation which could provide another good
method to determine the elliptic flow parameter $v_{2}$ of direct hard photons.
