We present calculations of elliptic flow and azimuthal dependence of
correlation radii in the ellipsoidally symmetric generalization of the
Buda-Lund hydrodynamic model of hadron production in high-energy nuclear
collisions. We compare them to data from RHIC by simultaneous fits to
azimuthally integrated invariant spectra of pions, kaons and
protons-antiprotons measured by PHENIX in Au+Au reactions at center of mass
energy of 200 AGeV. STAR data were used for azimuthally sensitive two-particle
correlation function radii and for the transverse momentum dependence of the
elliptic flow parameter v2. We have found that the transverse flow is faster in
the reaction plane then out of plane, which results in a reaction zone that
gets slightly more elongated in-plane than out of plane. The model parameters
extracted from the fits are shown and discussed.
