We show that if on a compact Kahler threefold there is a solution of the
Kahler-Ricci flow which encounters a finite time collapsing singularity, then
the manifold admits a Fano fibration. Furthermore, if there is finite time
extinction then the manifold is Fano and the initial class is a positive
multiple of the first Chern class.
