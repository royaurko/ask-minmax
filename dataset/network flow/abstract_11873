Measure the similarity of the nodes in the complex networks have interested
many researchers to explore it. In this paper, a new method which is based on
the degree centrality and the Relative-entropy is proposed to measure the
similarity of the nodes in the complex networks. The results in this paper show
that, the nodes which have a common structure property always have a high
similarity to others nodes. The nodes which have a high influential to others
always have a small value of similarity to other nodes and the marginal nodes
also have a low similar to other nodes. The results in this paper show that the
proposed method is useful and reasonable to measure the similarity of the nodes
in the complex networks.
