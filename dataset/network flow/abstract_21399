We show that a cosmological negative spatial curvature can account for both a
recently identified phenomenological imprint of the global Hubble flow on
galactic rotation curves and for the recently detected cosmic repulsion and
cosmic acceleration. Even though such a negative curvature (a curvature which a
galactic rest frame observer recognizes as a universal linear potential which
gives rise to a universal acceleration) is only achievable in standard gravity
by extreme fine tuning, nonetheless, it is naturally realizable in conformal
gravity, a currently viable, fully covariant, candidate alternate gravitational
theory.
