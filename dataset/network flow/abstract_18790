Pushing data traffic from cellular to WiFi is an example of inter radio
access technology (RAT) offloading. While this clearly alleviates congestion on
the over-loaded cellular network, the ultimate potential of such offloading and
its effect on overall system performance is not well understood. To address
this, we develop a general and tractable model that consists of $M$ different
RATs, each deploying up to $K$ different tiers of access points (APs), where
each tier differs in transmit power, path loss exponent, deployment density and
bandwidth. Each class of APs is modeled as an independent Poisson point process
(PPP), with mobile user locations modeled as another independent PPP, all
channels further consisting of i.i.d. Rayleigh fading. The distribution of rate
over the entire network is then derived for a weighted association strategy,
where such weights can be tuned to optimize a particular objective. We show
that the optimum fraction of traffic offloaded to maximize $\SINR$ coverage is
not in general the same as the one that maximizes rate coverage, defined as the
fraction of users achieving a given rate.
