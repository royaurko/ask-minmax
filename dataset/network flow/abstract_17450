The effect of anisotropy on the statistics of a passive tracer transported by
a turbulent flow is investigated. We show that under broad conditions an
arbitrarily small amount of anisotropy propagates to the large scales where it
eventually dominates the structure of the concentration field. This result is
obtained analytically in the framework of an exactly solvable model and
confirmed by numerical simulations of scalar transport in two-dimensional
turbulence.
