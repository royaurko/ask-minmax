Bayesian networks are convenient graphical expressions for high dimensional
probability distributions representing complex relationships between a large
number of random variables. They have been employed extensively in areas such
as bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, diagnosis, and risk management. The
recovery of the structure of a network from data is of prime importance for the
purposes of modeling, analysis, and prediction. Most recovery algorithms in the
literature assume either discrete of continuous but Gaussian data. For general
continuous data, discretization is usually employed but often destroys the very
structure one is out to recover. Friedman and Goldszmidt suggest an approach
based on the minimum description length principle that chooses a discretization
which preserves the information in the original data set, however it is one
which is difficult, if not impossible, to implement for even moderately sized
networks. In this paper we provide an extremely efficient search strategy which
allows one to use the Friedman and Goldszmidt discretization in practice.
