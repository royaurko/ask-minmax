We will consider the resolution of the 3D non linear wave equation under the
assumption of spherical symmetry on the euclidian space. For this purpose, we
will build a non trivial measure on distributions such that there exists a set
of full measurement onto which the flow is globally defined. We will then
discuss different properties of the solutions.
