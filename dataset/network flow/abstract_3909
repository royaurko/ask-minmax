Evolutionary optimisation algorithm is employed to design networks of
phase-repulsive oscillators that achieve an anti-phase synchronised state. By
introducing the link frustration, the evolutionary process is implemented by
rewiring the links with probability proportional to their frustration, until
the final network displaying a unique non-frustrated dynamical state is
reached. Resulting networks are bipartite and with zero clustering. In
addition, the designed non-frustrated anti-phase synchronised networks display
a clear topological scale. This contrasts usually studied cases of networks
with phase-attractive dynamics, whose performance towards full synchronisation
is typically enhanced by the presence of a topological hierarchy.
