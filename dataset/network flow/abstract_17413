The main objective of the paper is to prove a geometric version of sharp
trace and product estimates on null hypersurfaces with finite curvature flux.
These estimates play a crucial role to control the geometry of such null
hypersurfaces. The paper is based on an invariant version of the classical
Littlewood -Paley theory, in a noncommutative setting, defined via heat flow on
surfaces.
