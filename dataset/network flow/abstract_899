Self-regulation of living tissue as an example of self-organization phenomena
in active fractal systems of biological, ecological, and social nature is under
consideration. The characteristic feature of these systems is the absence of
any governing center and, thereby, their self-regulation is based on a
cooperative interaction of all the elements. The paper develops a mathematical
theory of a vascular network response to local effects on scales of individual
units of peripheral circulation.
  First, it formulates a model for the self-processing of information about the
cellular tissue state and cooperative interaction of blood vessels governing
redistribution of blood flow over the vascular network. Mass conservation
(conservation of blood flow as well as transported biochemical compounds) plays
the key role in implementing these processes. The vascular network is
considered to be of the tree form and the blood vessels are assumed to respond
individually to an activator in blood flowing though them.
  Second, the constructed governing equations are analyzed numerically. It is
shown that at the first approximation the blood perfusion rate depends locally
on the activator concentration in the cellular tissue, which is due to the
hierarchical structure of the vascular network. Then the distinction between
the reaction threshold of individual vessels and that of the vascular network
as a whole is demonstrated. In addition, the nonlocal component of the
dependence of the blood perfusion rate on the activator concentration is found
to change its form as the activator concentration increases.
