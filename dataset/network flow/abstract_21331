In this letter, we present an implementation of a neural microcircuit for
image processing employing Hebbian-adaptive learning. The neuronal circuit
utilizes only excitatory synapses to correlate action potentials, extracting
the uncorrelated ones, which contain significant image information. This
circuit is capable of approximating Gabor-like image filtering and other image
processing functions
