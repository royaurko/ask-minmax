In the first part of this paper we give a short review of the hierarchy of
stochastic models, related to physical chemistry. In the basement of this
hierarchy there are two models --- stochastic chemical kinetics and the Kac
model for Boltzman equation. Classical chemical kinetics and chemical
thermodynamics are obtained as some scaling limits in the models, introduced
below. In the second part of this paper we specify some simple class of open
chemical reaction systems, where one can still prove the existence of
attracting fixed points. For example, Michaelis\tire Menten kinetics belongs to
this class. At the end we present a simplest possible model of the biological
network. It is a network of networks (of closed chemical reaction systems,
called compartments), so that the only source of nonreversibility is the matter
exchange (transport) with the environment and between the compartments.
