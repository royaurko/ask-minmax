The node set of a two-mode network consists of two disjoint subsets and all
its links are linking these two subsets. The links can be weighted. We
developed a new method for identifying important sub-networks in two-mode
networks. The method combines and extends the ideas from generalized cores in
one-mode networks and from (p, q)- cores for two-mode networks. In this paper
we introduce the notion of generalized two-mode cores and discuss some of their
properties. An efficient algorithm to determine generalized two-mode cores and
an analysis of its complexity are also presented. For illustration some results
obtained in analyses of real-life data are presented.
