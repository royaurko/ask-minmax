We have performed a direct numerical simulation of dilute turbulent
particulate flow in a vertical plane channel, fully resolving the phase
interfaces. The flow conditions are the same as those in the main case of
"Uhlmann, M., Phys. Fluids, vol. 20, 2008, 053305", with the exception of the
computational domain length which has been doubled in the present study. The
statistics of flow and particle motion are not significantly altered by the
elongation of the domain. The large-scale columnar-like structures which had
previously been identified do persist and they are still only marginally
decorrelated in the prolonged domain. Voronoi analysis of the spatial particle
distribution shows that the state of the dispersed phase can be characterized
as slightly more ordered than random tending towards a homogeneous spatial
distribution. It is also found that the p.d.f.'s of Lagrangian particle
accelerations for wall-normal and spanwise directions follow a lognormal
distribution as observed in previous experiments of homogeneous flows. The
streamwise component deviates from this law presenting significant skewness.
Finally, a statistical analysis of the flow in the near field around the
particles reveals that particle wakes present two regions, a near wake where
the velocity deficit decays as 1/x and a far wake with a decay of approximately
1/(x*x).
