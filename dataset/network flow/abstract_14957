In this paper we present a generalized model for network growth that links
the microscopical agent strategies with the large scale behavior. This model is
intended to reproduce the largest number of features of the Internet network at
the Autonomous System (AS) level. Our model of network grows by adding both new
vertices and new edges between old vertices. In the latter case a ``rewarding
attachment'' takes place mimicking the disassortative mixing between small
routers to larger ones. We find a good agreement between experimental data and
the model for the degree distribution, the betweenness distribution, the
clustering coefficient and the correlation functions for the degrees.
