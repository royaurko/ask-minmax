We prove that the leaves of an inverse mean curvature flow provide a
foliation of a future end of a cosmological spacetime $N$ under the necessary
and sufficent assumptions that $N$ satisfies a future mean curvature barrier
condition and a strong volume decay condition. Moreover, the flow parameter $t$
can be used to define a new physically important time function.
