We prove the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for a
compressible multifluid described by the barotropic Navier-Stokes equations in
dim = 1. The result holds when the diffusion coefficient depends on the
pressure. It relies on a global control in time of the L2 norm of the space
derivative of the density, via a new kind of entropy.
