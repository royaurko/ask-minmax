We study double-barrier interfaces separating regions of asymptotically
subsonic and supersonic flow of Bose condensed atoms. These setups contain at
least one black hole sonic horizon from which the analog of Hawking radiation
should be generated and emitted against the flow in the subsonic region.
Multiple coherent scattering by the double-barrier structure strongly modulates
the transmission probability of phonons, rendering it very sensitive to their
frequency. As a result, resonant tunneling occurs with high probability within
a few narrow frequency intervals. This gives rise to highly non-thermal spectra
with sharp peaks. We find that these peaks are mostly associated to decaying
resonances and only occasionally to dynamical instabilities. Even at achievable
nonzero temperatures, the radiation peaks can be dominated by the spontaneous
emission, i.e. enhanced zero-point fluctuations, and not, as often in analog
models, by stimulated emission.
