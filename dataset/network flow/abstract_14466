By using the NexSPheRIO code, we study the elliptic-flow fluctuations in
Au+Au collisions at 200A GeV. It is shown that, by fixing the parameters of the
model to correctly reproduce the charged pseudo-rapidity and the
transverse-momentum distributions, reasonable agreement of <v_2> with data is
obtained, both as function of pseudo-rapidity as well as of transverse
momentum, for charged particles. Our results on elliptic-flow fluctuations are
in good agreement with the recently measured data in experiments.
