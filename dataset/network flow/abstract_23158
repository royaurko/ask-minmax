We study complete noncompact long time solutions $(M, g(t))$ to the
K\"ahler-Ricci flow with uniformly bounded nonnegative holomorphic bisectional
curvature. We will show that when the Ricci curvature is positive and uniformly
pinched, i.e. $ R_\ijb \ge cRg_\ijb$ at $(p,t)$ for all $t$ for some $c>0$,
then there always exists a local gradient K\"ahler Ricci soliton limit around
$p$ after possibly rescaling $g(t)$ along some sequence $t_i \to \infty$. We
will show as an immediate corollary that the injectivity radius of $g(t)$ along
$t_i$ is uniformly bounded from below along $t_i$, and thus $M$ must in fact be
simply connected. Additional results concerning the uniformization of $M$ and
fixed points of the holomorphic isometry group will also be established. We
will then consider removing the condition of positive Ricci for $(M, g(t))$.
Combining our results with Cao's splitting for K\"ahler Ricci flow \cite{Cao04}
and techniques of Ni-Tam \cite{NiTam03}, we show that when the positive
eigenvalues of the Ricci curvature are uniformly pinched at some point $p \in
M$, then $M$ has a special holomorphic fiber bundle structure. We will treat a
special cases, complete K\"ahler manifolds with non-negative holomorphic
bisectional and average quadratic curvature decay as well as the case of steady
gradient K\"ahler Ricci solitons.
