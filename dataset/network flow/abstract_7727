The theory of linear wave structures generated in Bose-Einstein condensate
flow past an obstacle is developed. The shape of wave crests and dependence of
amplitude on coordinates far enough from the obstacle are calculated. The
results are in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations
obtained earlier. The theory gives a qualitative description of experiments
with Bose-Einstein condensate flow past an obstacle after condensate's release
from a trap.
