A model with non-uniform flow in the longitudinal direction is proposed for
the relativistic heavy-ion collisions and compared with the 14.6 A GeV/c Si-Al
and 10.8 A GeV/c Au-Au collision data. The stronger influence of transparency
on the distribution of heavier produced particles and the larger stopping in
the heavier collision system are accounted for by using a new geometrical
parameterization picture. The central dips in the proton and deuteron rapidity
distributions for Si-Al collision are reproduced.
