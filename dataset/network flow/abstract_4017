In this paper we consider flow-equations where we allow a normal ordering
which is adjusted to the one-particle energy of the Hamiltonian. We show that
this flow converges nearly always to the stable phase. Starting out from the
symmetric Hamiltonian and symmetry-broken normal ordering nearly always yields
symmetry breaking below the critical temperature.
