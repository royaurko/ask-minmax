A numerical model is developed for the simulation of debris flow in
landslides over a complex three dimensional topography. The model is based on a
lattice, in which debris can be transferred among nearest neighbors according
to established empirical relationships for granular flows. The model is then
validated by comparing a simulation with reported field data. Our model is in
fact a realistic elaboration of simpler ``sandpile automata'', which have in
recent years been studied as supposedly paradigmatic of ``self-organized
criticality''.
  Statistics and scaling properties of the simulation are examined, and show
that the model has an intermittent behavior.
