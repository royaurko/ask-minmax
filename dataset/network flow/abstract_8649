We show how appropriate rewiring with the aid of Metropolis Monte Carlo
computational experiments can be exploited to create network topologies
possessing prescribed values of the average path length (APL) while keeping the
same connectivity degree and clustering coefficient distributions. Using the
proposed rewiring rules we illustrate how the emergent dynamics of the
celebrated majority-rule model are shaped by the distinct impact of the APL
attesting the need for developing efficient algorithms for tuning such network
characteristics.
