We find the capacity region of linear finite-field deterministic networks
with many sources and one destination. Nodes in the network are subject to
interference and broadcast constraints, specified by the linear finite-field
deterministic model. Each node can inject its own information as well as relay
other nodes' information. We show that the capacity region coincides with the
cut-set region. Also, for a specific case of correlated sources we provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for the sources transmissibility. Given the
"deterministic model" approximation for the corresponding Gaussian network
model, our results may be relevant to wireless sensor networks where the
sensing nodes multiplex the relayed data from the other nodes with their own
data, and where the goal is to decode all data at a single "collector" node.
