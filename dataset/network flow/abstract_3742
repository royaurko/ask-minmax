We show that recently published assertions that advection dominated accretion
flows (ADAFs) require the presence of strong winds are unfounded because they
assume that low radiative efficiency in flows accreting at low rates onto black
holes implies vanishing radial energy and angular momentum fluxes through the
flow (which is also formulated in terms of the `Bernoulli function' being
positive). This, however, is a property only of self-similar solutions which
are an inadequate representation of global accretion flows. We recall general
properties of accretion flows onto black holes and show that such, necessarily
transonic, flows may have either positive or negative Bernoulli function
depending on the flow viscosity. Flows with low viscosities (alpha<0.1 in the
alpha-viscosity model) have a negative Bernoulli function. Without exception,
all 2-D and 1-D numerical models of low viscosity flows constructed to date
experience no significant outflows. At high viscosities the presence of
outflows depends on the assumed viscosity, the equation of state and on the
outer boundary condition. The positive sign of the Bernoulli function invoked
in this context is irrelevant to the presence of outflows. As an illustration,
we recall 2-D numerical models with moderate viscosity that have positive
values of the Bernoulli function and experience no outflows. ADAFs, therefore,
do not differ from this point of view from thin Keplerian discs: they may have,
but they do not have to have strong winds.
