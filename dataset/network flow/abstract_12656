Using Monte Carlo simulations we calculate $f_c$, the fraction of nodes which
are randomly removed before global connectivity is lost, for networks with
scale-free and bimodal degree distributions. Our results differ with the
results predicted by an equation for $f_c$ proposed by Cohen, et al. We discuss
the reasons for this disagreement and clarify the domain for which the proposed
equation is valid.
