We systematically derived hydrodynamic equations and transport coefficients
for a class of multi-speed lattice Boltzmann models in D dimensions, using the
multi-scale technique. The constitutive relation of physical fluid is recovered
by a modified equilibrium distribution in Maxwell-Boltzmann type. With the use
of the rest particles and the particle reservoir, we were able to add one
degree of freedom into the sound speed of the modeled fluid. When the sound
speed is tuned small enough, the compressible region of fluid flow can be
reached. An example 2-D model is presented, together with the numerical
verification for its transport coefficients.
