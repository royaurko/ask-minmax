We consider the approach describing glass formation in liquids as a
progressive trapping in an exponentially large number of metastable states. To
go beyond the mean-field setting, we provide a real-space renormalization group
(RG) analysis of the associated replica free-energy functional. The present
approximation yields in finite dimensions an ideal glass transition similar to
that found in mean field. However, we find that along the RG flow the
properties associated with metastable glassy states, such as the
configurational entropy, are only defined up to a characteristic length scale
that diverges as one approaches the ideal glass transition. The critical
exponents characterizing the vicinity of the transition are the usual ones
associated with a first-order discontinuity fixed point.
