We present an experimental study of the outflow of a hopper continuously
vibrated by a piezoelectric device. Outpouring of grains can be achieved for
apertures much below the usual jamming limit observed for non vibrated hoppers.
Granular flow persists down to the physical limit of one grain diameter, a
limit reached for a finite vibration amplitude. For the smaller orifices, we
observe an intermittent regime characterized by alternated periods of flow and
blockage. Vibrations do not significantly modify the flow rates both in the
continuous and the intermittent regime. The analysis of the statistical
features of the flowing regime shows that the flow time significantly increases
with the vibration amplitude. However, at low vibration amplitude and small
orifice sizes, the jamming time distribution displays an anomalous statistics.
