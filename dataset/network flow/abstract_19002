With densification of nodes in cellular networks, free space optic (FSO)
connections are becoming an appealing low cost and high rate alternative to
copper and fiber as the backhaul solution for wireless communication systems.
To ensure a reliable cellular backhaul, provisions for redundant, disjoint
paths between the nodes must be made in the design phase. This paper aims at
finding a cost-effective solution to upgrade the cellular backhaul with
pre-deployed optical fibers using FSO links and mirror components. Since the
quality of the FSO links depends on several factors, such as transmission
distance, power, and weather conditions, we adopt an elaborate formulation to
calculate link reliability. We present a novel integer linear programming model
to approach optimal FSO backhaul design, guaranteeing $K$-disjoint paths
connecting each node pair. Next, we derive a column generation method to a
path-oriented mathematical formulation. Applying the method in a sequential
manner enables high computational scalability. We use realistic scenarios to
demonstrate our approaches efficiently provide optimal or near-optimal
solutions, and thereby allow for accurately dealing with the trade-off between
cost and reliability.
