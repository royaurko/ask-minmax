The NF-{\kappa}B signaling network plays an important role in many different
compartments of the immune system during immune activation. Using a
computational model of the NF-{\kappa}B signaling network involving two
negative regulators, I{\kappa}B{\alpha} and A20, we performed sensitivity
analyses with three different sampling methods and present a ranking of the
kinetic rate variables by the strength of their influence on the NF-{\kappa}B
signaling response. We also present a classification of temporal response
profiles of nuclear NF-{\kappa}B concentration into six clusters, which can be
regrouped to three biologically relevant clusters. Lastly, based upon the
ranking, we constructed a reduced network of the
IKK-NF-{\kappa}B-I{\kappa}B{\alpha}-A20 signal transduction.
