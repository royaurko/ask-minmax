Boolean networks at the critical point have been a matter of debate for many
years as, e.g., scaling of number of attractor with system size. Recently it
was found that this number scales superpolynomially with system size, contrary
to a common earlier expectation of sublinear scaling. We here point to the fact
that these results are obtained using deterministic parallel update, where a
large fraction of attractors in fact are an artifact of the updating scheme.
This limits the significance of these results for biological systems where
noise is omnipresent. We here take a fresh look at attractors in Boolean
networks with the original motivation of simplified models for biological
systems in mind. We test stability of attractors w.r.t. infinitesimal
deviations from synchronous update and find that most attractors found under
parallel update are artifacts arising from the synchronous clocking mode. The
remaining fraction of attractors are stable against fluctuating response
delays. For this subset of stable attractors we observe sublinear scaling of
the number of attractors with system size.
