A multi-symplectic formulation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is
developed based on a Clebsch variable variational principle in which the
Lagrangian consists of the kinetic minus the potential energy of the MHD fluid
modified by constraints using Lagrange multipliers, that ensure mass
conservation, entropy advection with the flow, the Lin constraint and Faraday's
equation (i.e the magnetic flux is Lie dragged with the flow). The analysis is
also carried out using the magnetic vector potential $\tilde{\bf A}$ where
$\alpha=\tilde{\bf A}{\bf\cdot}d{\bf x}$ is Lie dragged with the flow, where
${\bf B}=\nabla\times\tilde{\bf A}$. The symplecticity conservation laws are
shown to give rise to the Eulerian momentum and energy conservation laws in
MHD. Noether's theorem for the multi-symplectic MHD system is derived,
including the case of non-Cartesian space coordinates, where the metric plays a
role in the equations.
