It is shown that bandwidth estimation in packet networks can be viewed in
terms of min-plus linear system theory. The available bandwidth of a link or
complete path is expressed in terms of a {\em service curve}, which is a
function that appears in the network calculus to express the service available
to a traffic flow. The service curve is estimated based on measurements of a
sequence of probing packets or passive measurements of a sample path of
arrivals. It is shown that existing bandwidth estimation methods can be derived
in the min-plus algebra of the network calculus, thus providing further
mathematical justification for these methods. Principal difficulties of
estimating available bandwidth from measurement of network probes are related
to potential non-linearities of the underlying network. When networks are
viewed as systems that operate either in a linear or in a non-linear regime, it
is argued that probing schemes extract the most information at a point when the
network crosses from a linear to a non-linear regime. Experiments on the Emulab
testbed at the University of Utah evaluate the robustness of the system
theoretic interpretation of networks in practice. Multi-node experiments
evaluate how well the convolution operation of the min-plus algebra provides
estimates for the available bandwidth of a path from estimates of individual
links.
