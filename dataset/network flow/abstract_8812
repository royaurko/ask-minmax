A previous stability condition (see Throumoulopoulos and Tasso, Physics of
Plasmas 14, 122104 (2007)) for incompressible plasmas with field aligned flows
is extended to gravitating plasmas including self-gravitation. It turns out
that the stability condition is affected by gravitation through the equilibrium
values only.
