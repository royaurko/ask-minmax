Zero-range processes, in which particles hop between sites on a lattice, are
closely related to equilibrium networks, in which rewiring of links take place.
Both systems exhibit a condensation transition for appropriate choices of the
dynamical rules. The transition results in a macroscopically occupied site for
zero-range processes and a macroscopically connected node for networks.
Criticality, characterized by a scale-free distribution, is obtained only at
the transition point. This is in contrast with the widespread scale-free
real-life networks. Here we propose a generalization of these models whereby
criticality is obtained throughout an entire phase, and the scale-free
distribution does not depend on any fine-tuned parameter.
