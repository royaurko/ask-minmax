Consider designing a transportation network on $n$ vertices in the plane,
with traffic demand uniform over all source-destination pairs. Suppose the cost
of a link of length $\ell$ and capacity $c$ scales as $\ell c^\beta$ for fixed
$0<\beta<1$. Under appropriate standardization, the cost of the minimum cost
Gilbert network grows essentially as $n^{\alpha(\beta)}$, where $\alpha(\beta)
= 1 - \frac{\beta}{2}$ on $0 < \beta \leq {1/2}$ and $\alpha(\beta) = {1/2} +
\frac{\beta}{2}$ on ${1/2} \leq \beta < 1$. This quantity is an upper bound in
the worst case (of vertex positions), and a lower bound under mild regularity
assumptions. Essentially the same bounds hold if we constrain the network to be
efficient in the sense that average route-length is only $1 + o(1)$ times
average straight line length. The transition at $\beta = {1/2}$ corresponds to
the dominant cost contribution changing from short links to long links. The
upper bounds arise in the following type of hierarchical networks, which are
therefore optimal in an order of magnitude sense. On the large scale, use a
sparse Poisson line process to provide long-range links. On the medium scale,
use hierachical routing on the square lattice. On the small scale, link
vertices directly to medium-grid points. We discuss one of many possible
variant models, in which links also have a designed maximum speed $s$ and the
cost becomes $\ell c^\beta s^\gamma$.
