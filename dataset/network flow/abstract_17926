In a multi-cell scenario, the inter-cell interference (ICI) is detrimental in
achieving the intended system performance, in particular for the edge users.
There is paucity of work available in literature on ICI coordination (ICIC) for
relay-assisted cellular networks (RACN). In this paper, we do a survey on the
ICIC schemes in cellular networks and RACN. We then propose a self-organized
resource allocation plan for RACN to improve the edge user's performance by
ICIC. We compare the performance of reuse-1, reuse-3, soft frequency reuse
(SFR) scheme, proposed plan with and without relays. The performance metrics
for comparison are edge user's spectral efficiency, their
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) and system's area spectral
efficiency. We show by the simulation results that our proposed plan performs
better than the existing resource allocation schemes in static allocation
scenario. Next, we propose to make our resource allocation plan dynamic and
self-organized. The distinct features of our proposed plan are: One, it
achieves a trade-off between the system's area spectral efficiency and the edge
user's spectral efficiency performance. Secondly, it introduces a novel concept
of interfering neighbor set to achieve ICIC by local interaction between the
entities.
