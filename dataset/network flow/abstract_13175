Elliptic flow systematics for different hadron species have been explained by
quark coalescence models. It has been argued that the elliptic asymmetry v_2
should scale with the number of quarks that comprise the hadron. We show how
these arguments are sensitive to the relative role of asymmetries in the phase
space density vs. asymmetries in the effective volume of emission. We also
discuss the degree to which coalescence arguments differ from thermal models.
Illustrative calculations based on solving the Boltzmann equation are presented
along with the results of blast-wave models. Although the issue is complicated,
ambiguities might be clarified by measurements of source-size parameters for
nucleons at higher transverse momenta.
