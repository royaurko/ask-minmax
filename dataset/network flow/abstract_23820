Interaction between consumers and companies can create conflict. When a
consensus is unreachable there are legal contributorities to resolve the case. This
letter is a study of data from the Brazilian Department of Justice from which
we build a bipartite network of categories of complaints linked to the
companies receiving those complaints. We find the complaint categories
organised in an hierarchical way where companies only get complaints of lower
degree if they already got complaints of higher degree. The fraction of
resolved complaints for a company appears to be nearly independent on the
equity of the company but is positively correlated with the total number of
complaints received. We construct feature vectors based on the edge-weight -
the weight of an edge represents the times complaints of a category have been
filed against that company - and use these vectors to study the similarity
between the categories of complaints. From this analysis, we obtain trees
mapping the hierarchical organisation of the complaints. We also apply
principal component analysis to the set of feature vectors concluding that a
reduction of the dimensionality of these from 8827 to 27 gives an optimal
hierarchical representation.
