A sign reversal of the directed flow parameter $v_1$ in the central rapidity
region in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt s =200$~AGeV is predicted. This anti-flow
is shown to be linked to the expansion of the hot matter created. In line with
this observation the predicted elliptic flow parameter $v_2$ of various
particle species is predicted and linked to the mean free path of these
particles.
