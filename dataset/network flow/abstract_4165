Finite directed graphs with no multiple edges give rise to semiflows on the
power set of their nodes and to flows on the set of their bi-infinite paths.
This paper studies the topological dynamics for both setups. For the flow we
use the standard concepts of Morse decompositions, attractor-repeller sequences
and chain recurrent components. For the semiflow, we adapt these concepts to
obtain an equivalent characterisation under weaker assumptions.
