We consider a macroscopic two-sate system based on persistent current states
of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of interacting neutral atoms confined in a
ring with a weak Josephson link. We demonstrate that macroscopic superpositions
of different BEC flows are energetically favorable in this system. Moreover, a
macroscopic two-state dynamics emerges in the low energy limit. We also
investigate fundamental limitations due to the noise inherent to the
interacting BEC of Josephson-ring geometry. We show that the coherent
macroscopic dynamics is readily measurable for an experimentally accessible
range of parameters.
