In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in community detection
algorithms for complex networks. A variety of computational heuristics, some
with a long history, have been proposed for the identification of communities
or, alternatively, of good graph partitions. In most cases, the algorithms
maximize a particular objective function, thereby finding the `right' split
into communities. Although a thorough comparison of algorithms is still
lacking, there has been an effort to design benchmarks, i.e., random graph
models with known community structure against which algorithms can be
evaluated. However, popular community detection methods and benchmarks normally
assume an implicit notion of community based on clique-like subgraphs, a form
of community structure that is not always characteristic of real networks.
Specifically, networks that emerge from geometric constraints can have natural
non clique-like substructures with large effective diameters, which can be
interpreted as long-range communities. In this work, we show that long-range
communities escape detection by popular methods, which are blinded by a
restricted `field-of-view' limit, an intrinsic upper scale on the communities
they can detect. The field-of-view limit means that long-range communities tend
to be overpartitioned. We show how by adopting a dynamical perspective towards
community detection (Delvenne et al. (2010) PNAS:107: 12755-12760; Lambiotte et
al. (2008) arXiv:0812.1770), in which the evolution of a Markov process on the
graph is used as a zooming lens over the structure of the network at all
scales, one can detect both clique- or non clique-like communities without
imposing an upper scale to the detection. Consequently, the performance of
algorithms on inherently low-diameter, clique-like benchmarks may not always be
indicative of equally good results in real networks with local, sparser
connectivity.
