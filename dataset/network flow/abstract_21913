We demonstrate detection of NMR signals using a non-cryogenic atomic
magnetometer and describe several novel applications of this technique. A water
free induction decay (FID) signal in a 0.5 $\mu$T field is detected using a
spin-exchange-relaxation-free K magnetometer and the possibility of using a
multi-channel magnetometer for 3-D MRI requiring only a single FID signal is
described. We also demonstrate detection of less than $10^{13}$ $^{129}$Xe
atoms whose NMR signal is enhanced by a factor of 540 due to Fermi-contact
interaction with K atoms. This technique allows detection of less than $10^{9}$
$^{129}$Xe spins in a flowing system suitable for remote NMR applications.
