Equipped with the L^2-distortion distance, the space "X" of all metric
measure spaces (X,d,m) is proven to have nonnegative curvature in the sense of
Alexandrov. Geodesics and tangent spaces are characterized in detail. Moreover,
classes of semiconvex functionals and their gradient flows on "X" are
presented.
