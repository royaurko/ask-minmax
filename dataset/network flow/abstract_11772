Homophily is a significant mechanism for link prediction in complex network,
of which principle describes that people with similar profiles or experiences
tend to tie with each other. In a multi-relationship network, friendship among
people has been utilized to reinforce similarity of taste for recommendation
system whose basic idea is similar to homophily, yet how the taste inversely
affects friendship prediction is little discussed. This paper contributes to
address the issue by analyzing two benchmark datasets both including user's
behavioral information of taste and friendship based on the principle of
homophily. It can be found that the creation of friendship tightly associates
with personal taste. Especially, the behavioral information of taste involving
with popular objects is much more effective to improve the performance of
friendship prediction. However, this result seems to be contradictory to the
finding in [Q.M. Zhang, et al., PLoS ONE 8(2013)e62624] that the behavior
information of taste involving with popular objects is redundant in
recommendation system. We thus discuss this inconformity to comprehensively
understand the correlation between them.
