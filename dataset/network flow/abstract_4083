Particle diffusion in a two dimensional curved surface embedded in $R_3$ is
considered. In addition to the usual diffusion flow, we find a new flow with an
explicit curvature dependence. New diffusion equation is obtained in $\epsilon$
(thickness of surface) expansion. As an example, the surface of elliptic
cylinder is considered, and curvature dependent diffusion coefficient is
calculated.
