Based on the (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic model, the space-time evolution
of hot and dense nuclear matter produced in non-central relativistic heavy-ion
collisions is discussed. The elliptic flow parameter v_2 is obtained by Fourier
analysis of the azimuthal distribution of pions and protons which are emitted
from the freeze-out hypersurface. As a function of rapidity, the pion and
proton elliptic flow parameters both have a peak at midrapidity.
