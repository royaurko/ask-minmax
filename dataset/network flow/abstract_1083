In this report we propose a MultiObjective (MO) performance evaluation
framework for wireless ad hoc networks where criteria such as capacity,
robustness, energy and delay are optimized concurrently. Within such a
framework, we can determine both the Pareto-optimal performance bounds and the
networking parameters that provide these bounds. The originality of this
approach is that it accounts for the inherent broadcast properties of the
transmission and finely models the interference distribution. In the proposed
model, the network performance can be optimized when several flows (source-
destination transmissions) exist. One benefit of our approach is that the
complexity does not grow with the number of flows. The other major contribution
of this paper is the new analytical formulation of the performance metrics. It
relies on a matrix representation of the constraints imposed by the
interference- limited and broadcast wireless channel. Because of the similarity
of this matrix with a Markovian transition matrix, we can exploit classical
results from Markov chains theory to derive steady state performance metrics
relative to capacity, robustness, energy and delay. Another very interesting
feature of these new metrics is that the Pareto-optimal solutions related to
them provide a tight bound on capacity, robustness, energy and delay.
