We study driven vortices lattices in superconducting thin films. Above the
critical force $F_c$ we find two dynamical phase transitions at $F_p$ and
$F_t$, which could be observed in simultaneous noise measurements of the
longitudinal and the Hall voltage. At $F_p$ there is a transition from plastic
flow to smectic flow where the voltage noise is isotropic (Hall noise =
longitudinal noise) and there is a peak in the differential resistance. At
$F_t$ there is a sharp transition to a frozen transverse solid where the Hall
noise falls down abruptly and vortex motion is localized in the transverse
direction.
