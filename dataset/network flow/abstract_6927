Elliptic flow is a hallmark of collectivity in hadronic collisions. Its
measurement relies on analysis techniques which require high event multiplicity
and could be applied so far to heavy ion collisions only. Here, we delineate
the conditions under which elliptic flow becomes measurable in the samples of
high-multiplicity ($dN_{\rm ch}/dy \geq 50$) p-p collisions, which will soon be
collected at the LHC. We observe that fluctuations in the p-p interaction
region can result in a sizable spatial eccentricity even for the most central
p-p collisions. Under relatively mild assumptions on the nature of such
fluctuations and on the eccentricity scaling of elliptic flow, we find that the
resulting elliptic flow signal in high-multiplicity p-p collisions at the LHC
becomes measurable with standard techniques.
