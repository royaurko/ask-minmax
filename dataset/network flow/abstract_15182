Peer-to-Peer Live streaming and Video on Demand is the most popular media
applications over the Internet in recent years. These systems reduce the load
on the server and provide a scalable content distribution. A new paradigm of
P2P network collaborates to build large distributed video applications on
existing networks .But, the problem of designing the system are at par with the
P2P media streaming, live and Video on demand systems. Hence a comprehensive
design comparison is needed to build such kind of system architecture.
Therefore, in this paper we elaborately studied the traditional approaches for
P2P streaming architectures, and its critical design issues, as well as
practicable challenges. Thus, our studies in this paper clearly point the
tangible design issues and its challenges, and other intangible issues for
providing P2P VoD services.
