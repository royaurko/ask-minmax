We study an M-theory solution for the holographic flow of AdS4 times
Sasaki-Einstein 7-manifolds with skew-whiffing, perturbed by a mass operator.
The infrared solution contains the 5 dimensional Schrodinger geometry after
considering the gravity dual of the standard non-relativistic limit of
relativistic field theories. The mass deformation of the field theory is
discussed in detail for the case with 7 manifold being a round sphere.
