We extend recent results on scalar-tensor theories to the case of an
O(N)-invariant multiplet. Some exact fixed point solutions of the RG flow
equations are discussed. We find that also in the functional context, on
employing a standard "type-I" cutoff, too many scalars destroy the
gravitational fixed point. For d=3 we show the existence of the gravitationally
dressed Wilson-Fisher fixed point also for N>1. We discuss also the results of
the analysis for a different, scalar-free, coarse-graining scheme.
