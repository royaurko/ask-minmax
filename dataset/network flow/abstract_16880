We propose and analyze a new on the fly strategy that discovers, repairs and
maintains routes in hierarchical and distributed fashion called Janitor Based
Routing (JBR). The main motivation behind our JBR protocol is to decrease
flooding and routing overhead and increase efficiencies in packet movement. An
analytical model for the proposed JBR is presented and detailed simulation is
used to observe the performance of JBR. This route discovery and maintenance
protocol clearly achieved improvement in terms of reduction of flooding,
routing overhead, and, hence, provides enhanced reliability.
