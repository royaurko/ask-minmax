In this paper we present a new kind of boundary layer flow produced by an
electromagnetic Lorentz force which acts parallel to the plate in an
electrically conductive fluid. The plate is motionless and the ambient fluid
stagnant. This flow is equivalent to the classical free convective flow along a
vertical plate. The boundary layer equations are transformed to non-dimensional
form and a new dimensionless number is introduced which is equivalent to the
Grashof number. The transformed boundary layer equations are solved with the
finite difference method and the presented results include values of the
friction coefficient and velocity profiles.
