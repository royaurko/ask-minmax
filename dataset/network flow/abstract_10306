ITO thin films were deposited on glass substrates by d.c. magnetron
sputtering with varied oxygen flow rates. It was found that the optical
absorption decreases and optical absorption edge has blue shifts with the
increasing oxygen flow rate. Oxygen vacancy concentration was characterized and
analyzed by XPS. It is shown that the oxygen vacancy concentration increases
with oxygen flow rates, which is a different observation from the current
understanding. The energy band structures associated with different vacancy
concentrations of ITO were calculated using the first-principle based on
density functional theory. The calculation results show that the increase of
oxygen vacancies induces the increase of bands below Fermi level as well as the
presence of a second band gap, which accounts for effects of the oxygen
vacancies on the blue shifts.
