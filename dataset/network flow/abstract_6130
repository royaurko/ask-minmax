Radio frequency (RF) energy transfer and harvesting techniques have recently
become alternative methods to power the next generation wireless networks. As
this emerging technology enables proactive energy replenishment of wireless
devices, it is advantageous in supporting applications with quality of service
(QoS) requirement. In this paper, we present an extensive literature review on
the research progresses in wireless networks with RF energy harvesting
capability, referred to as RF energy harvesting networks (RF-EHNs). First, we
present an overview of the RF-EHNs including system architecture, RF energy
harvesting techniques and existing applications. Then, we present the
background in circuit design as well as the state-of-the-art circuitry
implementations, and review the communication protocols specially designed for
RF-EHNs. We also explore various key design issues in the development of
RF-EHNs according to the network types, i.e., single-hop network, multi-antenna
network, relay network and cognitive radio network. Finally, we envision some
open research directions.
