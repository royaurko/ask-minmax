In order to keep up with the increasing demands for capacity, cellular
networks are becoming increasingly dense and heterogeneous. Dense deployments
are expected to provide a linear capacity scaling with the number of small
cells deployed due to spatial reuse gains. However in practice network capacity
is severely limited in dense networks due to interference. The primary reason
is that the current LTE control plane deployment model has very high latency
and is unable to cope with the demand of implementing interference management
techniques that require coordination on a millisecond timeframe.
  This paper presents SwiftC, a novel low-latency control plane design for LTE
networks. SwiftC's novel contribution is a design for efficiently sending and
receiving control plane messages over the LTE spectrum itself, thus creating a
direct and low-latency coordination signaling link between small cells and the
macrocell. SwiftC builds on recent work in full duplex radios and shows via
prototype implementations that a low latency control plane can be built over
the existing LTE network without wasting licensed spectrum. We also show the
benefits of SwiftC in implementing complex interference management techniques,
and show that with SwiftC small cell deployments can achieve almost a linear
capacity scaling with every small cell deployed.
