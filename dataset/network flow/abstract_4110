In this paper, we study the moduli spaces of noncollapsed Ricci flow
solutions with bounded energy and scalar curvature. We show a weak compactness
theorem for such moduli spaces and apply it to study isoperimetric constant
control, K\"ahler Ricci flow and moduli space of gradient shrinking solitons.
