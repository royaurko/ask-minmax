We report on magnetoresistance transport measurements performed on a
bipartite tiling of rhombus in the GaAs/GaAlAs system. We observe for the first
time large amplitude $h/e$ oscillations in this network as compared to the one
measured in square lattices of similar size. These oscillations are the
signature of a recently predicted localization phenomenon induced by
Aharonov-Bohm interferences in this peculiar network.
