General Axial Gauges within a perturbative approach to QCD are plagued by
'spurious' propagator singularities. Their regularisation has to face major
conceptual and technical problems. We show that this obstacle is naturally
absent within a Wilsonian or 'Exact' Renormalisation Group approach and explain
why this is so. The axial gauge turns out to be a fixed point under the flow,
and the universal 1-loop running of the gauge coupling is computed.
