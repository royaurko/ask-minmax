We investigate zero-lag synchronization (ZLS) between delay-coupled diode
lasers system with mutual optical injection in a face-to-face configuration. We
observed numerical evidence of such ZLS without using any relay element or
mediating laser. In addition, simulation also demonstrate that this kind of
robust ZLS occurs around the phase flip transition regimes where in-phase and
anti-phase oscillations coexist due to delayed coupling induced modulation of
the phase-amplitude coupling factor {\alpha}. Our finding could be implemented
in highly secured optical communication network as well as the understanding of
the occurrence of such ZLS in the neural network functionality.
