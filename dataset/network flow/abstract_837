The temporal component of social networks is often neglected in their
analysis, and statistical measures are typically performed on a "static"
representation of the network. As a result, measures of importance (like
betweenness centrality) cannot reveal any temporal role of the entities
involved. Our goal is to start filling this limitation by proposing a form of
temporal betweenness measure, and by using it to analyse a knowledge
mobilization network. We show that this measure, which takes time explicitly
into account, allows us to detect centrality roles that were completely hidden
in the classical statistical analysis. In particular, we uncover nodes whose
static centrality was considered negligible, but whose temporal role is instead
important to accelerate mobilization flow in the network. We also observe the
reverse behaviour by detecting nodes with high static centrality, whose role as
temporal bridges is instead very low. By revealing important temporal roles,
this study is a first step towards a better understanding of the impact of time
in social networks, and opens the road to further investigation.
