We present a generic model of cell motility generated by acto-myosin
contraction of the cell cortex. We identify analytically dynamical
instabilities of the cortex and show that they trigger spontaneous cortical
flows which in turn can induce cell migration in 3-dimensional (3D)
environments as well as bleb formation. This contractility--based mechanism,
widely independent of actin treadmilling, appears as an alternative to the
classical picture of lamellipodial motility on flat substrates. Theoretical
predictions are compared to experimental data of tumor cells migrating in 3D
matrigel and suggest that this mechanism could be a general mode of cell
migration in 3D environments.
