This report considers a fairly general model of constrained queuing networks
that allows us to represent both MMBP (Markov Modulated Bernoulli Processes)
arrivals and time-varying service constraints. We derive a set of sufficient
conditions for throughput optimality of scheduling policies that encompass and
generalize all the previously obtained results in the field. This leads to the
definition of new classes of (non diagonal) throughput optimal scheduling
policies. We prove the stability of queues by extending the traditional
Lyapunov drift criteria methodology.
