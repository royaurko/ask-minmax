Fine grained 1Hz Carbon Monoxide pollution data were collected on a busy road
in Hyderabad, India. In this paper we report the findings from analysing the
experimental data, in which it was found that the data were log-normally
distributed and nonlinear. The dominant frequencies at peak hours were caused
by the pattern of traffic flow.
