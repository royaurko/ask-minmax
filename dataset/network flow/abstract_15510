The associative memory model is a typical neural network model, which can
store discretely distributed fixed-point attractors as memory patterns. When
the network stores the memory patterns extensively, however, the model has
other attractors besides the memory patterns. These attractors are called
spurious memories. Both spurious states and memory states are equilibrium, so
there is little difference between their dynamics. Recent physiological
experiments have shown that short-term dynamic synapse called synaptic
depression decreases its transmission efficacy to postsynaptic neurons
according to the activities of presynaptic neurons. Previous studies have shown
that synaptic depression induces oscillation in the network and decreases the
storage capacity at finite temperature. How synaptic depression affects
spurious states, however, is still unclear. We investigate the effect of
synaptic depression on spurious states through Monte Carlo simulation. The
results demonstrate that synaptic depression does not affect the memory states
but mainly destabilizes the spurious states and induces the periodic
oscillations.
