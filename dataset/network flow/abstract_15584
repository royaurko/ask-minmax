We investigate the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on closed and
directed random regular networks, which is a simple model of active transport
in the one-dimensional segments coupled by junctions. By a pair mean-field
theory and detailed numerical analyses, it is found that the correlations at
junctions induce two notable deviations from the simple mean-field theory which
neglects these correlations: (1) the narrower range of particle density for
phase coexistence and (2) the algebraic decay of density profile with exponent
$1/2$ even outside the maximal-current phase. We show that these anomalies are
attributable to the effective slow bonds formed by the network junctions.
