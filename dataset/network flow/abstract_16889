Different routing strategies may result in different behaviors of traffic on
internet. We analyze the correlation of traffic data for three typical routing
strategies by the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and find that the degree
of correlation of the data can be divided into three regions, i.e., weak,
medium, and strong correlation. The DFA scalings are constants in both the
regions of weak and strong correlation but monotonously increase in the region
of medium correlation. We suggest that it is better to consider the traffic on
complex network as three phases, i.e., the free, buffer, and congestion phase,
than just as two phases believed before, i.e., the free and congestion phase.
