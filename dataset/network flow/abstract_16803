We introduce models of generic rigidity percolation in two dimensions on
hierarchical networks, and solve them exactly by means of a renormalization
transformation. We then study how the possibility for the network to self
organize in order to avoid stressed bonds may change the phase diagram. In
contrast to what happens on random graphs and in some recent numerical studies
at zero temperature, we do not find a true intermediate phase separating the
usual rigid and floppy ones.
