Social groups are fundamental building blocks of human societies. While our
social interactions have always been constrained by geography, it has been
impossible, due to practical difficulties, to evaluate the nature of this
restriction on social group structure. We construct a social network of
individuals whose most frequent geographical locations are also known. We also
classify the individuals into groups according to a community detection
algorithm. We study the variation of geographical span for social groups of
varying sizes, and explore the relationship between topological positions and
geographic positions of their members. We find that small social groups are
geographically very tight, but become much more clumped when the group size
exceeds about 30 members. Also, we find no correlation between the topological
positions and geographic positions of individuals within network communities.
These results suggest that spreading processes face distinct structural and
spatial constraints.
