In this paper we present an algorithmic framework for solving a class of
combinatorial optimization problems on graphs with bounded pathwidth. The
problems are NP-hard in general, but solvable in linear time on this type of
graphs. The problems are relevant for assessing network reliability and
improving the network's performance and fault tolerance. The main technique
considered in this paper is dynamic programming.
