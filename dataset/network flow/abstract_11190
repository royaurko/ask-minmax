Significant research has been carried out in the recent years for generating
systems exhibiting intelligence for realizing optimized routing in networks. In
this paper, a grade based twolevel based node selection method along with
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is proposed. It assumes that the
nodes are intelligent and there exist a knowledge base about the environment in
their local memory. There are two levels for approaching the effective route
selection process through grading. At the first level, grade based selection is
applied and at the second level, the optimum path is explored using PSO. The
simulation has been carried out on different topological structures and it is
observed that a graded network produces a significant reduction in number of
iteration to arrive at the optimal path selection.
