While pressure balance can predict how far the magnetopause will move in
response to an upstream pressure change, it cannot determine how fast the
transient reponse will be. Using Time History of Events and Macroscale
Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), we present multipoint observations
revealing, for the first time, strong (thermal + magnetic) pressure gradients
in the magnetosheath due to a foreshock transient, most likely a Hot Flow
Anomaly (HFA), which decreased the total pressure upstream of the bow shock. By
converting the spacecraft time series into a spatial picture, we quantitatively
show that these pressure gradients caused the observed acceleration of the
plasma, resulting in fast sunward magnetosheath flows ahead of a localised
outward distortion of the magnetopause. The acceleratation of the magnetosheath
plasma was fast enough to keep the peak of the magnetopause bulge at
approximately the equilibrium position i.e. in pressure balance. Therefore, we
show that pressure gradients in the magnetosheath due to transient changes in
the total pressure upstream can directly drive anomalous flows and in turn are
important in transmitting information from the bow shock to the magnetopause.
