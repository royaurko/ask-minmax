We compute the finite size effects in the ground state energy, equivalently
the effective central charge c_{eff}, based on S-matrix theories recently
conjectured to describe a cyclic regime of the Kosterlitz-Thouless
renormalization group flows. The effective central charge has periodic
properties consistent with renormalization group predictions. Whereas c_{eff}
for the massive case has a singularity in the very deep ultra-violet, we argue
that the massless version is non-singular and periodic on all length scales.
