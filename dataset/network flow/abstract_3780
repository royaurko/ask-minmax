A recent joint XMM-Newton/Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR)
observation of the accreting neutron star Cen X-4 ($L_{\rm
X}\sim10^{33}{\rm~erg~s}^{-1}$) revealed a hard power-law component
($\Gamma\sim1$-$1.5$) with a relatively low cut-off energy (~10 keV),
suggesting bremsstrahlung emission. The physical requirements for
bremsstrahlung combined with other observed properties of Cen X-4 suggest the
emission comes from a boundary layer rather than the accretion flow. The
accretion flow itself is thus undetected (with an upper limit of $L_{\rm
flow}\lesssim0.3 L_{\rm X}$). A deep search for coherent pulsations (which
would indicate a strong magnetic field) places a 6 per cent upper limit on the
fractional amplitude of pulsations, suggesting the flow is not magnetically
regulated. Considering the expected energy balance between the accretion flow
and the boundary layer for different values of the neutron star parameters
(size, magnetic field, and spin) we use the upper limit on $L_{\rm flow}$ to
set an upper limit of $\varepsilon\lesssim0.3$ for the intrinsic radiative
efficiency of the accretion flow for the most likely model of a fast-spinning,
non-magnetic neutron star. The non-detection of the accretion flow provides the
first direct evidence that this flow is indeed 'radiatively inefficient', i.e.
most of the gravitational potential energy lost by the flow before it hits the
star is not emitted as radiation.
