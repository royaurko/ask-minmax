We find conditions under which measures belong to . Next we show that
measures generated by Prandtl, Kaden as well as Pullin spirals, objects
considered by physicists as incompressible flows generating vorticity, satisfy
assumptions of our theorem, thus they are (locally) elements of . Moreover, as
a by-product, we prove an embedding of the space of Morrey type measures in .
