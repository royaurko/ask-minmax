New experimental results, and a plausible theoretical understanding thereof,
are presented for the flow-induced currents and voltages observed in
single-walled carbon nanotube samples. In our experiments, the electrical
response was found to be strongly sublinear -- nearly logarithmic -- in the
flow speed over a wide range, and its direction could be controlled by an
electrochemical biasing of the nanotubes. These experimental findings are
inconsistent with the conventional idea of a streaming potential as the
efficient cause. Here we present a new, physically appealing, Langevin-equation
based treatment of the nanotube charge carriers, assumed to be moving under
coulombic forcing by the correlated ionic fluctuations, advected by the liquid
in flow. The resulting 'Doppler-shifted' force-force correlation, as seen by
the charge carriers drifting in the nanotube, is shown to give a strongly
sublinear response, broadly in agreement with experiments.
