Wireless sensor networks are normally characterized by resource challenged
nodes. Since communication costs the most in terms of energy in these networks,
minimizing this overhead is important. We consider minimum length node
scheduling in regular multi-hop wireless sensor networks. We present
collision-free decentralized scheduling algorithms based on TDMA with spatial
reuse that do not use message passing, this saving communication overhead. We
develop the algorithms using graph-based k-hop interference model and show that
the schedule complexity in regular networks is independent of the number of
nodes and varies quadratically with k which is typically a very small number.
We follow it by characterizing feasibility regions in the SINR parameter space
where the constant complexity continues to hold while simultaneously satisfying
the SINR criteria. Using simulation, we evaluate the efficiency of our solution
on random network deployments.
