The thermally activated vortex bundle flow over the directional-dependent
energy barrier in type-II superconductors is investigated. The coherent
oscillation frequency and the mean direction of the random collective pinning
force of the vortex bundles are evaluated by applying the random walk theorem.
The thermally activated vortex bundle flow velocity is obtained.The
temperature- and field-dependent Hall and longitudinal resistivities induced by
the bundle flow for type-II superconducting bulk materials and thin films are
calculated. All the results are in agreement with the experiments.
