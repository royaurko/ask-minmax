The transverse momentum anisotropy of the particles produced in heavy ion
collisions is one of the most important experimental observable to investigate
the collective behavior of the systems created in such collisions. Recent
studies show that the complex nature of the system evolution, such as initial
condition fluctuations and jets, may lead to important effects in the flow
coefficients and, therefore, to misinterpretation of the results obtained. In
this study, we used simulated events produced with a hydrodynamic model which
allows inhomogeneous initial condition combined with proton-proton collisions
produced with the Pythia event generator to create a final set of particles to
be analyzed with the usual experimental flow calculation techniques. Although
this simplified approach is somehow unrealistic, since it does not include the
interaction of the jet with the medium, our results have shown a good agreement
of the behavior of the elliptic flow coefficient as a function of the
transverse momentum up to 6 GeV/c for Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. Although
each model alone is not able to describe the full range, the combination of
both sets of particles as seen by the flow calculation techniques may be the
key to explain the behavior observed in experimental data.
