We present the first measurement of directed flow ($v_1$) at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). $v_1$ is found to be consistent with zero at
pseudorapidities $\eta$ from -1.2 to 1.2, then rises to the level of a couple
of percent over the range $2.4 < |\eta| < 4$. The latter observation is similar
to that from NA49 if the SPS rapidities are shifted by the difference in beam
rapidity between RHIC and SPS. We studied the evolution of elliptic flow from
p+p collisions through d+Au collision, and onto Au+Au collisions. Measurements
of higher harmonics are presented and discussed.
