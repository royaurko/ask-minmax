The method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is developped
appropriately for the study of relativistic heavy ion collision processes. In
order to describe the flow of a high energy but low baryon number density
fluid, the entropy is taken as the SPH base. We formulate the method in terms
of the variational principle. Several examples show that the method is very
promising for the study of hadronic flow in RHIC physics.
