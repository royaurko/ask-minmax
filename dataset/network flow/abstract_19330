Astronomers have discovered many potential black holes in X-ray binaries and
galactic nuclei. These black holes are usually identified by the fact that they
are too massive to be neutron stars. Until recently, however, there was no
convincing evidence that the objects identified as black hole candidates
actually have event horizons. This has changed with extensive applications of a
class of accretion models for describing the flow of gas onto compact objects;
for these solutions, called advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs), the
black hole nature of the accreting star, specifically its event horizon, plays
an important role. We review the evidence that, at low luminosities, accreting
black holes in both X-ray binaries and galactic nuclei contain ADAFs rather
than the standard thin accretion disk.
