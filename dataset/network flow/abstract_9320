We present a model, in which some nodes (called interconnecting nodes) in two
networks merge and play the roles in both the networks. The model analytic and
simulation discussions show a monotonically increasing dependence of
interconnecting node topological position difference and a monotonically
decreasing dependence of the interconnecting node number on function difference
of both networks. The dependence function details do not influence the
qualitative relationship. This online manuscript presents the details of the
model simulation and analytic discussion, as well as the empirical
investigations performed in eight real world bilayer networks. The analytic and
simulation results with different dependence function forms show rather good
agreement with the empirical conclusions.
