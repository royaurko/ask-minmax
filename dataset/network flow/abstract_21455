The possible ``phase diagrams'' for shear-induced phase transitions between
two phases are collected. We consider shear-thickening and shear-thinning
fluids, under conditions of both common strain rate and common stress in the
two phases, and present the four fundamental shear stress vs. strain-rate
curves and discuss their concentration dependence. We outline how to construct
more complicated phase diagrams, discuss in which class various experimental
systems fall, and sketch how to reconstruct the phase diagrams from rheological
measurements.
