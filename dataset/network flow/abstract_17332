We discuss the reversibility of Brownian heat engine.
We perform asymptotic analysis of Kramers equation on B\"uttiker-Landauer
system and show quantitatively that Carnot efficiency is inattainable even in a
fully overdamping limit.
The inattainability is attributed to the inevitable irreversible heat flow
over the temperature boundary.
