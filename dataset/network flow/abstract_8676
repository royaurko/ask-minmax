We add strong negation $N$ to classical logic and interpret the attack
relation of "$x$ attacks $y$" in argumentation as $(x\to Ny)$. We write a
corresponding object level (using $N$ only) classical theory for each
argumentation network and show that the classical models of this theory
correspond exactly to the complete extensions of the argumentation network. We
show by example how this approach simplifies the study of abstract
argumentation networks. We compare with other translations of abstract
argumentation networks into logic, such as classical predicate logic or modal
logics, or logic programming, and we also compare with Abstract Dialectical
Frameworks.
