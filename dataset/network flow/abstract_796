Power-law correlations have been observed in packet flow over the Internet.
The possible origin of these correlations includes demand for Internet
services. We observe the demand for e-mail services in an organization, and
analyze correlations in the flow and the sequence of send requests using a
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). The correlation in the flow is found to
be weaker than that in the send requests. Four types of artificial flow are
constructed to investigate the effects of fluctuations in e-mail sizes. As a
result, we find that the correlation in the flow originates from that in the
sequence of send requests. The strength of the power-law correlation decreases
as a function of the ratio of the standard deviation of e-mail sizes to their
average.
