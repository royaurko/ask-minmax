There are several centrality measures that have been introduced and studied
for real world networks. They account for the different vertex characteristics
that permit them to be ranked in order of importance in the network.
Betweenness centrality is a measure of the influence of a vertex over the flow
of information between every pair of vertices under the assumption that
information primarily flows over the shortest path between them. In this paper
we present betweenness centrality of some important classes of graphs.
