In astrophysics and meteorology there exist numerous situations where flows
exhibit small velocities compared to the sound speed. To overcome the stringent
timestep restrictions posed by the predominantly used explicit methods for
integration in time the Euler (or Navier-Stokes) equations are usually replaced
by modified versions. In astrophysics this is nearly exclusively the anelastic
approximation. Kwatra et al. have proposed a method with favourable time-step
properties integrating the original equations (and thus allowing, for example,
also the treatment of shocks). We describe the extension of the method to the
Navier-Stokes and two-component equations. - However, when applying the
extended method to problems in convection and double diffusive convection
(semiconvection) we ran into numerical difficulties. We describe our procedure
for stabilizing the method. We also investigate the behaviour of Kwatra et
al.'s method for very low Mach numbers (down to Ma = 0.001) and point out its
very favourable properties in this realm for situations where the explicit
counterpart of this method returns absolutely unusable results. Furthermore, we
show that the method strongly scales over 3 orders of magnitude of processor
cores and is limited only by the specific network structure of the high
performance computer we use.
