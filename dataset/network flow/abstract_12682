In this paper, without assuming symmetry, irreducibility, or linearity of the
couplings, we prove that a single controller can pin a coupled complex network
to a homogenous solution. Sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the
convergence of the pinning process locally and globally. An effective approach
to adapt the coupling strength is proposed. Several numerical simulations are
given to verify our theoretical analysis.
