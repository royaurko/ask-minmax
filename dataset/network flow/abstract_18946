Online Social Network (OSN) is one of the hottest innovations in the past
years, and the active users are more than a billion. For OSN, users' behavior
is one of the important factors to study. This demonstration proposal presents
Harbinger, an analyzing and predicting system for OSN users' behavior. In
Harbinger, we focus on tweets' timestamps (when users post or share messages),
visualize users' post behavior as well as message retweet number and build
adjustable models to predict users' behavior. Predictions of users' behavior
can be performed with the discovered behavior models and the results can be
applied to many applications such as tweet crawler and advertisement.
