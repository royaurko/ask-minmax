Date: 18 June 1998 The Pseudoflow Algorithm and the Pseudoflow-Based Simplex for the Maximum Flow Problem Dorit S. Hochbaum Affiliated with Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, and Walter A. Haas School of Business, University of California We introduce an algorithm that solves the maximum flow problem without generating flows explicitly. The algorithm solves di- rectly a problem we call the maximum s -excess problem. That problem is equivalent to the minimum cut problem, and is a direct extension of the maximum closure problem. The concepts used also lead to a new parametric analysis algorithm generating all breakpoints in the amount of time of a single run. The insights derived from the analysis of the new algorithm lead to a new simplex algorithm for the maximum flow problem — a pseudoflow-based simplex. We show that this simplex algorithm can perform a parametric analysis in the same amount of time as a single run. This is the first known simplex algorithm for maximum flow that generates all possible breakpoints of parameter values in the same complexity as required to solve a single maximum flow instance and the fastest one. The complexities of our pseudoflow algorithm, the new simplex algo- rithm, and the parametric analysis for both algorithms are O ( mn log n ) on a graph with n nodes and m arcs.
