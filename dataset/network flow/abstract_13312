We define horizontal diffusion in $C^1$ path space over a Riemannian manifold
and prove its existence. If the metric on the manifold is developing under the
forward Ricci flow, horizontal diffusion along Brownian motion turns out to be
length preserving. As application, we prove contraction properties in the
Monge-Kantorovich minimization problem for probability measures evolving along
the heat flow. For constant rank diffusions, differentiating a family of
coupled diffusions gives a derivative process with a covariant derivative of
finite variation. This construction provides an alternative method to filtering
out redundant noise.
