Direct numerical simulations have proven of inestimable help to our
understanding of the transition to turbulence in wall-bounded flows. While the
dynamics of the transition from laminar flow to turbulence via localised spots
can be investigated with reasonable computing resources in domains of limited
extent, the study of the decay of turbulence in conditions approaching those in
the laboratory requires consideration of domains so wide as to exclude the
recourse to fully resolved simulations. Using Gibson's C++ code ChannelFlow, we
scrutinize the effects of a controlled lowering of the numerical resolution on
the decay of turbulence in plane Couette flow at a quantitative level. We show
that the number of Chebyshev polynomials describing the cross-stream dependence
can be drastically decreased while preserving all the qualitative features of
the solution. In particular, the oblique turbulent band regime experimentally
observed in the upper part of the transitional range is extremely robust. In
terms of Reynolds numbers, the resolution lowering is seen to yield a regular
downward shift of the upper and lower thresholds Rt and Rg where the bands
appear and break down. The study is illustrated with the results of two
preliminary experiments.
