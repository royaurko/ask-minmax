We analyse the influence of a surface viscosity on the orientational dynamics
of a nematic liquid crystal subjected to an oscillatory Couette flow.
Approximate analytical solutions of nematohydrodynamic equations for small flow
amplitudes are calculated and compared with the results of full numerical
simulations. The range of flow frequencies where the surface viscosity has
strong influence on the optical response is determined.
