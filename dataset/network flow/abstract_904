We consider the optimal transmission of distributed correlated discrete
memoryless sources across a network with capacity constraints. We present
several previously undiscussed structural properties of the set of feasible
rates and transmission schemes. We extend previous results concerning the
intersection of polymatroids and contrapolymatroids to characterize when all of
the vertices of the Slepian-Wolf rate region are feasible for the capacity
constrained network. An explicit relationship between the conditional
independence relationships of the distributed sources and the number of
vertices for the Slepian-Wolf rate region are given. These properties are then
applied to characterize the optimal transmission rate and scheme and its
connection to the corner points of the Slepian-Wolf rate region. In particular,
we demonstrate that when the per-source compression costs are in tension with
the per-link flow costs the optimal flow/rate point need not coincide with a
vertex of the Slepian-Wolf rate region. Finally, we connect results for the
single-sink problem to the multi-sink problem by extending structural insights
and developing upper and lower bounds on the optimal cost of the multi-sink
problem.
