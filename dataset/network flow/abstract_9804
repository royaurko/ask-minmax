Internal haemorrhage, often leading to cardio-vascular arrest happens to be
one of the prime sources of high fatality rates in mammals. We propose a
simplistic model of fluid flow to specify the location of the haemorrhagic
spots, which, if located accurately, could be operated upon leading to a
possible cure. The model we employ for the purpose is inspired by fluid
mechanics and consists of a viscous fluid, pumped by a periodic force and
flowing through an elastic tube. The analogy is with that of blood, pumped from
the heart and flowing through an arte ry or vein. Our results, aided by
graphical illustrations, match reasonably well with experimental observations.
