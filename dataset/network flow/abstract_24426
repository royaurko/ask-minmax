We propose magnetic threshold-logic (MTL) design based on non-volatile
spin-torque switches. A threshold logic gate (TLG) performs summation of
multiple inputs multiplied by a fixed set of weights and compares the sum with
a threshold. MTL employs resistive states of magnetic tunnel junctions as
programmable input weights, while, a low-voltage domain-wall shift based
spin-torque switch is used for thresholding operation. The resulting MTL gate
acts as a low-power, configurable logic unit and can be used to build fully
pipelined, high-performance programmable computing blocks. Multiple stages in
such a MTL design can be connected using energy-efficient ultralow swing
programmable interconnect networks based on resistive switches. Owing to
memory-based compact logic and interconnect design and low-voltage, high-speed
spintorque based threshold operation, MTL can achieve more than two orders of
magnitude improvement in energy-delay product as compared to look-up table
based CMOS FPGA.
