A cut tree (or Gomory-Hu tree) of an undirected weighted graph G=(V,E)
encodes a minimum s-t-cut for each vertex pair {s,t} \subseteq V and can be
iteratively constructed by n-1 maximum flow computations. They solve the
multiterminal network flow problem, which asks for the all-pairs maximum flow
values in a network and at the same time they represent n-1 non-crossing,
linearly independent cuts that constitute a minimum cut basis of G. Hence, cut
trees are resident in at least two fundamental fields of network analysis and
graph theory, which emphasizes their importance for many applications. In this
work we present a fully-dynamic algorithm that efficiently maintains a cut tree
for a changing graph. The algorithm is easy to implement and has a high
potential for saving cut computations under the assumption that a local change
in the underlying graph does rarely affect the global cut structure. We
document the good practicability of our approach in a brief experiment on real
world data.
