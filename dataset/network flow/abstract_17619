We study the finiteness of uniform sinks for flow. Precisely, we prove that,
for $\alpha>0$ $T>0$, if a vector field $X$ has only hyperbolic singularities
or sectionally dissipative singularities, then $X$ can have only finitely many
$(\alpha,T)$-uniform sinks. This is a generalized version of a theorem of Liao
