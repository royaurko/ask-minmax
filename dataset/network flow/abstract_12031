The consensus model of Deffuant et al is simplified by allowing for many
discrete instead of infinitely many continuous opinions, on a directed
Barabasi-Albert network. A simple scaling law is observed. We then introduce
noise and also use a more realistic network and compare the results. Finally,
we look at a multi-layer model representing various age levels, and we include
advertising effects.
