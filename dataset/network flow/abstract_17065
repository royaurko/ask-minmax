We discuss the implementation and optimization challenges for a Wilson-Dirac
solver with Clover term on QPACE, a parallel machine based on Cell processors
and a torus network. We choose the mixed-precision Schwarz preconditioned FGCR
algorithm in order to circumvent network bandwidth and latency constraints, to
make efficient use of the multicore parallelism and on-chip memory, and to
achieve flexibility in the choice of lattice sizes. We present benchmarks on up
to 256 QPACE nodes showing an aggregate sustained performance of about 10
TFlops for the complete solver and very good scaling.
