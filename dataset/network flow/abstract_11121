Many models have been proposed to analyze the evolution of opinion structure
due to the interaction of individuals in their social environment. Such models
analyze the spreading of ideas both in completely interacting backgrounds and
on social networks, where each person has a finite set of
interlocutors.Moreover, the investigation on the topological structure of
social networks has been the object of several analyses, both from the
theoretical and the empirical point of view. In this framework a particularly
important area of study involves the community structure inside social
networks.In this paper we analyze the reciprocal feedback between the opinions
of the individuals and the structure of the interpersonal relationships at the
level of community structures. For this purpose we define a group based random
network and we study how this structure co-evolves with opinion dynamics
processes. We observe that the adaptive network structure affects the opinion
dynamics process helping the consensus formation. The results also show
interesting behaviors also in regards to the size distribution of the groups
and their correlation with opinion structure.
