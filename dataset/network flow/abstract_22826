For the Euler equations of isentropic gas dynamics in one space dimension,
also knowns as p-system in Lagrangian coordinate, it is known that the density
can be arbitrarily close to zero as time goes to infinity, even when initial
density is uniformly away from zero. In this paper, for uniform positive
initial density, we prove the density in any Lipschitz continuous solutions for
Cauchy problem has a sharp positive lower bound in the order of O(1/(1+t)),
which is identified by explicit examples in [9](Courant and Friedrichs,
Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves, 1948.).
