Considering the dynamics of a polymer with finite extensibility placed in a
chaotic flow with large mean shear, we explain how the statistics of polymer
extension changes with Weissenberg number, ${\it Wi}$, defined as the product
of the polymer relaxation time and the Lyapunov exponent of the flow. Four
regimes, of the ${\it Wi}$ number, are identified. One below the coil-stretched
transition and three above the coil-stretched transition. Specific emphasis is
given to explaining these regimes in terms of the polymer dynamics.
