We offer a revised exposition of the three types of heat-propagation theories
proposed by Green and Naghdi, in the form they were given in 1992-3. Those
theories, which make use of the notion of thermal displacement and allow for
heat waves, are at variance with the standard Fourier theory; they have
attracted considerable interest, and have been applied in a number of disparate
physical circumstances, where heat propagation is coupled with elasticity,
viscous flows, etc. However, their derivation is not exempt from criticisms,
that we here detail, in hopes of opening the way to reconsideration of old
applications and proposition of new ones.
