Observations of solar prominences reveal a complex, dynamic flow field within
them. The flow field within quiescent prominences is characterized by long
``threads'' and dark ``bubbles'' that fall and rise (respectively) in a thin
sheet. The flow field in active prominences display more helical motions that
travel along the axis of the prominence. We explore the possible dynamics of
both of these with the aid of 2.5D MHD simulations. Our model, compressible
plasma possesses density and temperature gradients and resides in magnetic
field configurations that mimc those of a solar prominence. We present results
of various configurations and discuss the nonlinear behavior of the resulting
dynamics.
