We investigate the possibility of developing physical layer network coding
(PNC) schemes with embedded strong secrecy based on standard QAM modulators.
The proposed scheme employs a triple binning approach at the QAM front-end of
the wireless PNC encoders. A constructive example of a strong secrecy encoder
is presented when a BPSK and an 8-PAM modulator are employed at the wireless
transmitters and generalized to arbitrary M-QAM modulators, assuming channel
inversion is attainable at the first cycle of the transmission. Our preliminary
investigations demonstrate the potential of using such techniques to increase
the throughput while in parallel not compromise the confidentiality of the
exchanged data.
