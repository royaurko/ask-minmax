This paper introduces how human languages can be studied in light of recent
development of network theories. There are two directions of exploration. One
is to study networks existing in the language system. Various lexical networks
can be built based on different relationships between words, being semantic or
syntactic. Recent studies have shown that these lexical networks exhibit
small-world and scale-free features. The other direction of exploration is to
study networks of language users (i.e. social networks of people in the
linguistic community), and their role in language evolution. Social networks
also show small-world and scale-free features, which cannot be captured by
random or regular network models. In the past, computational models of language
change and language emergence often assume a population to have a random or
regular structure, and there has been little discussion how network structures
may affect the dynamics. In the second part of the paper, a series of
simulation models of diffusion of linguistic innovation are used to illustrate
the importance of choosing realistic conditions of population structure for
modeling language change. Four types of social networks are compared, which
exhibit two categories of diffusion dynamics. While the questions about which
type of networks are more appropriate for modeling still remains, we give some
preliminary suggestions for choosing the type of social networks for modeling.
