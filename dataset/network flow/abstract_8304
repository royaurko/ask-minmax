We analyze a model that interpolates between scale-free and Erdos-Renyi
networks. The model introduced generates a one-parameter family of networks and
allows to analyze the role of structural heterogeneity. Analytical calculations
are compared with extensive numerical simulations in order to describe the
transition between these two important classes of networks. Finally, an
application of the proposed model to the study of the percolation transition is
presented.
