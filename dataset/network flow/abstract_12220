This work proposes a new distributed and self-organized authentication scheme
for Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs). Apart from describing all its components,
special emphasis is placed on proving that the proposal fulfils most
requirements derived from the special characteristics of MANETs, including
limited physical protection of broadcast medium, frequent route changes caused
by mobility, and lack of structured hierarchy. Interesting conclusions are
obtained from an analysis of simulation experiments in different scenarios.
