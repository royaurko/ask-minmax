We have studied the Cu core level photoemission spectra in the Anderson
impurity model for cuprates with different Cu-O networks, dimensionalities
(zero, one, two and three) and Cu valencies (two and three). We focus on the
shape of the leading peak and obtain very good agreement with the experimental
data. We show how the shape of the spectrum is related to the valence
electronic structure and the Cu-O network but also that other atoms can play a
role.
