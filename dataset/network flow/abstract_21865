A Fourier inversion problem lies at the heart of determining spatio-temporal
characteristica of the final stage of a heavy ion collision: From the measured
two-particle momentum correlations C(p_1,p_2) of identical particles, pions
say, a Hanbury-Brown /Twiss (HBT) interferometric analysis aims at extracting
as much information as possible about the Wigner phase space density S(x,p) of
pion emitting sources in the collision region. Here, we discuss how this
analysis allows to separate the effects of temperature and transverse flow
which cannot be disentangled completely on the basis of single-particle
spectra.
