We present a model for the dynamics of fluid vesicles in linear flow which
consistently includes thermal fluctuations and nonlinear coupling between
different modes. At the transition between tank-treading and tumbling, we
predict a trembling motion which is at odds with the known deterministic
motions and for which thermal noise is strongly amplified. In particular,
highly asymmetric shapes are observed even though the deterministic flow only
allows for axisymmetric ones. Our results explain quantitatively recent
experimental observations [Levant and Steinberg, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 268103
(2012)].
