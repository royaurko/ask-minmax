The Fano factor, an observable quantifying fluctuations of product generation
by a single enzyme, can reveal information about the underlying reaction
scheme. A lower bound on this Fano factor that depends on the thermodynamic
affinity driving the transformation from substrate to product constrains the
number of intermediate states of an enzymatic cycle. So far, this bound has
been proven only for a unicyclic network of states. We show that the bound can
be extended to arbitrary multicyclic networks, with the Fano factor
constraining the largest value of the effective length, which is the ratio
between the number of states and the number of products, among all cycles.
