Earlier researchers have studied the set of orientations of a connected
finite graph $G$, and have shown that any two such orientations having the same
flow-difference around all closed loops can be obtained from one another by a
succession of local moves of a simple type. Here I show that the set of
orientations of $G$ having the same flow-differences around all closed loops
can be given the structure of a distributive lattice. The construction
generalizes partial orderings that arise in the study of alternating sign
matrices. It also gives rise to lattices for the set of degree-constrained
factors of a bipartite planar graph; as special cases, one obtains lattices
that arise in the study of plane partitions and domino tilings. Lastly, the
theory gives a lattice structure to the set of spanning trees of a planar
graph.
