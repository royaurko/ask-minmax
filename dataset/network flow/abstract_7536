We construct a cofibrantly generated model structure on the category of flows
such that any flow is fibrant and such that two cofibrant flows are homotopy
equivalent for this model structure if and only if they are S-homotopy
equivalent. This result provides an interpretation of the notion of S-homotopy
equivalence in the framework of model categories.
