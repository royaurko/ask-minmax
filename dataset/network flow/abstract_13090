We discuss some classification results for Ricci solitons, that is, self
similar solutions of the Ricci Flow. Some simple proofs of known results will
be presented. In detail, we will take the equation point of view, trying to
avoid the tools provided by considering the dynamic properties of the Ricci
flow.
