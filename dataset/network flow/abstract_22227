We consider three-dimensional models for rate-independent processes
describing materials undergoing phase transformations with heat transfer. The
problem is formulated within the framework of generalized standard solids by
the coupling of the momentum equilibrium equation and the flow rule with the
heat transfer equation. Under appropriate regularity assumptions on the initial
data, we prove the existence a global solution for this thermodynamically
consistent system, by using a fixed-point argument combined with global energy
estimates.
