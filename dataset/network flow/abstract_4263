An affiliation network is a particular type of two-mode social network that
consists of a set of `actors' and a set of `events' where ties indicate an
actor's participation in an event. Although networks describe a variety of
consequential social structures, statistical methods for studying affiliation
networks are less well developed than methods for studying one-mode, or
actor-actor, networks. One way to analyze affiliation networks is to consider
one-mode network matrices that are derived from an affiliation network, but
this approach may lead to the loss of important structural features of the
data. The most comprehensive approach is to study both actors and events
simultaneously. In this paper, we extend the bilinear mixed-effects model, a
type of latent space model developed for one-mode networks, to the affiliation
network setting by considering the dependence patterns in the interactions
between actors and events and describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for
Bayesian inference. We use our model to explore patterns in extracurricular
activity membership of students in a racially-diverse high school in a
Midwestern metropolitan area. Using techniques from spatial point pattern
analysis, we show how our model can provide insight into patterns of racial
segregation in the voluntary extracurricular activity participation profiles of
adolescents.
