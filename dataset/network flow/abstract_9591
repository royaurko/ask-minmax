Voronoi tessellations of Poisson point processes are widely used for modeling
many types of physical and biological systems. In this paper, we analyze
simulated Poisson-Voronoi structures containing a total of 250,000,000 cells to
provide topological and geometrical statistics of this important class of
networks. We also report correlations between some of these topological and
geometrical measures. Using these results, we are able to corroborate several
conjectures regarding the properties of three-dimensional Poisson-Voronoi
networks and refute others. In many cases, we provide accurate fits to these
data to aid further analysis. We also demonstrate that topological measures
represent powerful tools for describing cellular networks and for
distinguishing among different types of networks.
