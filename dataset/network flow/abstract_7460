We study the effects of externally applied shear flow on a model of
suspensions of motors and filaments, via the equations of active hydrodynamics
[PRL {\bf 89} (2002) 058101; {\bf 92} (2004) 118101]. In the absence of shear,
the orientationally ordered phase of {\it both} polar and apolar active
particles is always unstable at zero-wavenumber. An imposed steady shear large
enough to overcome the active stresses stabilises both apolar and moving polar
phases. Our work is relevant to {\it in vitro} studies of active filaments, the
reorientation of endothelial cells subject to shear flow and shear-induced
motility of attached cells.
