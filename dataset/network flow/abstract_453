In this paper we study information flow paths in a data network, where
traffic generated by servers (or sources) takes a multi-hop path in order to
reach its clients (destinations). Each node in the middle of this multi-hop
path should route the incoming traffic and the traffic generated by itself to
the next hop in such a way that the traffic reaches its destination while
avoiding congestion in the links. For simplicity, we will assume the network
only carries single commodity traffic, i.e., all of the traffic should be
routed to a single destination.
