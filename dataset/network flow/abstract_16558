The continuous random network (CRN) model is an idealized model for perfectly
coordinated amorphous semiconductors. The quality of a CRN can be assessed in
terms of topological and configurational properties, including coordination,
bond-angle distributions and deformation energy. Using a variation on the
sillium approach proposed 14 years ago by Wooten, Winer and Weaire, we present
1000-atom and 4096-atom configurations with a degree of strain significantly
less than the best CRN available at the moment and, for the first time,
comparable to experimental results.
