The Stockholm Educational Air Shower Array (SEASA) project has established a
network of GPS time-synchronised scintillator detector stations at high-schools
in the Stockholm region. The primary aim of this project is outreach. A part of
the network comprises a dense cluster of detector stations located at AlbaNova
University Centre. This cluster is being used to study the cosmic ray
anisotropy around the knee. Each station consists of three scintillator
detectors in a triangular geometry which allows multiple timing measurements as
the shower front sweeps over the station. The timing resolution of the system
has been determined and the angular resolution has been studied using Monte
Carlo simulations and is compared to data. The potential of this system to
study small and large scale cosmic ray anisotropies is discussed.
