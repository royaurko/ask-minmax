We examine the effects of a hydrodynamical wind on advection dominated
accretion flows with thermal conduction in the presence of a toroidal magnetic
field under a self-similar treatment. The disk gas is assumed to be isothermal.
For a steady state structure of such accretion flows a set of self similar
solutions are presented. The mass-accretion rate $\dot{M}$ decreases with
radius $r$ as $\dot{M}\propto r^{s+1/2}$, where $s$ is an arbitrary constant.
We show that existence of wind will lead to enhance the accretion velocity.
Cooling effects of outflows or winds are noticeable and should be taken into
account for calculating luminosity and effective temperature of optically thin
and thick ADAFs. Increasing the effect of wind, decreases the disk's
temperature, because of energy flux which is taken away by winds. We will see
that for a given set of input parameters, the solution reaches to a
non-rotating limit at a specific value of $\phi_s$. The values of this
limitation on $\phi_s$ will increase by adding $s$, wind parameter. In fact,
the higher values of $s$ will allow the disk to have physical rotating solution
for larger $\phi_s$.
