We study diffusion (random walks) on recursive scale-free graphs, and
contrast the results to similar studies in other analytically soluble media.
This allows us to identify ways in which diffusion in scale-free graphs is
special. Most notably, scale-free architecture results in a faster transit time
between existing nodes, when the network grows in size; and walks emanating
from the most connected nodes are recurrent, despite the network's infinite
dimension. We also find that other attributes of the graph, besides its
scale-free distribution, have a strong influence on the nature of diffusion.
