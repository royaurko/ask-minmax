We propose in this paper a new propagation vector for malicious software by
abusing the Tor network. Tor is particularly relevant, since operating a Tor
exit node is easy and involves low costs compared to attack institutional or
ISP networks. After presenting the Tor network from an attacker perspective, we
describe an automated exploitation malware which is operated on a Tor exit node
targeting to infect web browsers. Our experiments show that the current
deployed Tor network, provides a large amount of potential victims.
