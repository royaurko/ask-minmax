A compilation of recently measured STAR data for elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of
$\phi$ mesons in RHIC Beam Energy Scan program and comparison with a multiphase
transport model (AMPT) has been presented. The experimental data at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $\geq$ 19.6 GeV agrees well with string melting version of the
AMPT model. The model includes partonic interactions and quark coalescence as a
mechanism of hadronization. This indicates that there is a substantial
contribution to collectivity from partonic interactions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$
$\geq$ 19.6 GeV. The measured $\phi$-meson $v_{2}$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 and
11.5 GeV are found to be smaller than those obtained from AMPT model without
partonic interactions. This indicates negligible contribution of partonic
collectivity to the observed $\phi$-meson $v_{2}$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $\leq$
11.5 GeV.
