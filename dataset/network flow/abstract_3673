The separation of micron-sized bacterial spores (Bacillus cereus) from a
steady flow of water through the use of ultrasonic standing waves is
demonstrated. An ultrasonic resonator with cross-section of 0.0254 m x 0.0254 m
has been designed with a flow inlet and outlet for a water stream that ensures
laminar flow conditions into and out of the resonator section of the flow tube.
A 0.01905-m diameter PZT-4, nominal 2-MHz transducer is used to generate
ultrasonic standing waves in the resonator. The acoustic resonator is 0.0356 m
from transducer face to the opposite reflector wall with the acoustic field in
a direction orthogonal to the water flow direction. At fixed frequency
excitation, spores are concentrated at the stable locations of the acoustic
radiation force and trapped in the resonator region. The effect of the
transducer voltage and frequency on the efficiency of spore capture in the
resonator has been investigated. Successful separation of B. cereus spores from
water with typical volume flow rates of 40-250 ml/min has been achieved with
15% efficiency in a single pass at 40 ml/min.
