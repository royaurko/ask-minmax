A new family of simple analytic solutions of hydrodynamics is found for
non-relativistic, rotationally symmetric fireballs assuming an ideal gas
equation of state. The solution features linear flow profile and a non-trivial
transverse temperature profile. The radial temperature gradient vanishes only
in the collisionless gas limit. The Zimanyi-Bondorf-Garpman solution and the
Buda-Lund parameterization of expanding hydrodynamical sources are recovered as
special cases. The results are applied to predict new features of proton-proton
correlations and spectra data at 1.93 AGeV Ni + Ni reactions.
