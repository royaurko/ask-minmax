We give a formula for the topological pressure of the geodesic flow of a
compact rank 1 manifold in terms of the growth of the number of closed
hyperbolic (rank 1) geodesics. We derive an equidistribution result for these
geodesics with respect to equilibrium states. This generalize partially a
result of G. Knieper \cite{kni} to non constant potentiels.
