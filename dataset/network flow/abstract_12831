We calculate the radiation spectra from advection-dominated accretion flows
(ADAFs), taking into account the effects of a global magnetic field.
Calculation is based on the analytic model for magnetized ADAFs proposed by
Kaburaki, where a large-scale magnetic field controls the accretion process.
Adjusting a few parameters, we find that our model can well reproduce the
observed spectrum of Sagittarius A$^{*}$. The result is discussed in comparison
with those of well-known ADAF models, where the turbulent viscosity controls
the accretion process.
