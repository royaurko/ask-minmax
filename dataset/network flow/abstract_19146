How would a cellular network designed for maximal energy efficiency look
like? To answer this fundamental question, we model future cellular networks
using stochastic geometry and obtain a new lower bound on the average uplink
spectral efficiency. This enables us to formulate a tractable energy efficiency
(EE) maximization problem and solve it analytically with respect to the density
of base stations (BSs), the transmit power levels, the number of BS antennas
and users per cell, and the pilot reuse factor. The closed-form expressions
obtained from this general EE maximization framework provide valuable insights
on the interplay between the optimization variables, hardware characteristics,
and propagation environment. Small cells are proved to give high EE, but the EE
improvement saturates quickly with the BS density. Interestingly, the maximal
EE is obtained by also equipping the BSs with multiple antennas and operate in
a "massive MIMO" fashion, where the array gain from coherent detection
mitigates interference and the multiplexing of many users reduces the energy
cost per user.
