Measurements performed on superconductive networks shaped in the form of
planar graphs display anomalously large currents when specific branches are
biased. The temperature dependencies of these currents evidence that their
origin is due to Cooper pair hopping through the Josephson junctions connecting
the superconductive islands of the array. The experimental data are discussed
in terms of a theoretical model which predicts, for the system under
consideration, an inhomogeneous Cooper pair distribution on the superconductive
islands of the network.
