This paper is about spectral properties of transfer operators for contact
Anosov flows. The main result gives the essential spectral radius of the
transfer operators acting on the so-called anisotropic Sobolev space exactly in
terms of dynamical exponents. Also we provide a simplified proof by using the
FBI transform.
