The development of mobile devices (CPU, memory, and storage) and the
introduction of mobile networks (Ad-Hoc, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and 3.5G) have opened
new opportunities for next generation of mobile services. It becomes more
convenience and desirable for mobile internet users to be connected everywhere.
However, ubiquitous mobile access connectivity faces interoperation issues
between wireless network providers and wireless network technologies. Although
mobile users would like to get as many services as possible while they travel,
there is a lack of technology to identify visited users in current foreign
network authentication systems. This challenge lies in the fact that a foreign
network provider does not initially have the authentication credentials of a
mobile user. Existing approaches use roaming agreement to exchange
authentication information between home network and foreign network. This paper
proposes a roaming agreement-less approach designed based on our ubiquitous
mobile access model. Our approach consist of two tokens, Passport
(identification token) and Visa (contributorisation token) to provide the mobile
user with a flexible authentication method to access foreign network services.
The security analysis indicates that our proposal is more suitable for
ubiquitous mobile communication especially in roaming agreement-less
environment.
