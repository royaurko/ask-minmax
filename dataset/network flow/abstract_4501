A completeness result for d-separation applied to discrete Bayesian networks
is presented and it is shown that in a strong measure-theoretic sense almost
all discrete distributions for a given network structure are faithful; i.e. the
independence facts true of the distribution are all and only those entailed by
the network structure.
