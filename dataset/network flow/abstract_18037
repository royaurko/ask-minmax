In Wireless Ad hoc networks (WANETs), nodes separated by considerable
distance communicate with each other by relaying their messages through other
nodes. However, it might not be in the best interests of a node to forward the
message of another node due to power constraints. In addition, all nodes being
rational, some nodes may be selfish, i.e. they might not relay data from other
nodes so as to increase their lifetime. In this paper, we present a fair and
incentivized approach for participation in Ad hoc networks. Given the power
required for each transmission, we are able to determine the power saving
contributed by each intermediate hop. We propose the FAir Share incenTivizEd Ad
hoc paRticipation protocol (FASTER), which takes a selected route from a
routing protocol as input, to calculate the worth of each node using the
cooperative game theory concept of 'Shapley Value' applied on the power saved
by each node. This value can be used for allocation of Virtual Currency to the
nodes, which can be spent on subsequent message transmissions.
