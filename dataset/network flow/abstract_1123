It is shown that a variety of deterministic cellular automaton models of
highway traffic flow obey a variational principle which states that, for a
given car density, the average car flow is a non-decreasing function of time.
This result is established for systems whose configurations exhibits local jams
of a given structure. If local jams have a different structure, it is shown
that either the variational principle may still apply to systems evolving
according to some particular rules, or it could apply under a weaker form to
systems whose asymptotic average car flow is a well-defined function of car
density. To establish these results it has been necessary to characterize among
all number-conserving cellular automaton rules which ones may reasonably be
considered as acceptable traffic rules. Various notions such as free-moving
phase, perfect and defective tiles, and local jam play an important role in the
discussion. Many illustrative examples are given.
