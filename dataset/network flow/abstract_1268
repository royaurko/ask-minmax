With the wide spread of Internet services, developers and users need a
greater understanding of the technology of networking. Acquiring a clear
understanding of communication protocols is an important step in understanding
how a network functions; however, many protocols are complicated, and
explaining them can be demanding. In addition, protocols are often explained in
terms of traffic analysis and oriented toward technical staff and those already
familiar with network protocols. This paper aims at proposing a diagrammatic
methodology to represent protocols in general, with a focus on the Transmission
Control Protocol and Secure Sockets Layer in particular. The purpose is to
facilitate understanding of protocols for learning and communication purposes.
The methodology is based on the notion of flow of primitive things in a system
with six stages: creation, release, transfer, arrival, acceptance, and
processing. Though the method presents a basic description of protocols without
in-depth analysis of all aspects and mechanisms, the resultant conceptual
description is a systematic specification that utilizes a few basic notions
that assist in illustrating functionality and support comprehension.
