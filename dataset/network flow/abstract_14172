We present the results of several numerical simulations of two dimensional
axi-symmetric accretion flows around black holes using Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) in the presence of cooling effects. We consider both
stellar black holes and super-massive black holes. We observe that due to {\it
both radial and vertical oscillation} of shock waves in the accretion flow, the
luminosity and average thermal energy content of the inner disk exhibit very
interesting behaviour. When power density spectra are taken, quasi-periodic
variabilities are seen at a few Hz and also occasionally at hundreds of Hz for
stellar black holes. For super-massive black holes, the time scale of the
oscillations ranges from hours to weeks. The power density spectra have a flat
top behavior with average {\it rms} amplitude of a few percent and a broken
power-law behavior. The break frequency is generally found to be close to the
frequency where the shock oscillates.
