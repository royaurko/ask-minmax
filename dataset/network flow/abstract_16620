We present a program package which generates homogeneous random graphs with
probabilities prescribed by the user. The statistical weight of a labeled graph
$\alpha$ is given in the form $W(\alpha)=\prod_{i=1}^N p(q_i)$, where $p(q)$ is
an arbitrary user function and $q_i$ are the degrees of the graph nodes. The
program can be used to generate two types of graphs (simple graphs and
pseudo-graphs) from three types of ensembles (micro-canonical, canonical and
grand-canonical).
