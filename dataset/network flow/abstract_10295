A lattice Boltzmann method for axisymmetric multiphase flows is presented and
validated. The method is capable of accurately modeling flows with variable
density. We develop the classic Shan-Chen multiphase model [ Phys. Rev. E 47
1815 (1993)] for axisymmetric flows. The model can be used to efficiently
simulate single and multiphase flows. The convergence to the axisymmetric
Navier-Stokes equations is demonstrated analytically by means of a
Chapmann-Enskog expansion and numerically through several test cases. In
particular, the model is benchmarked for its accuracy in reproducing the
dynamics of the oscillations of an axially symmetric droplet and on the
capillary breakup of a viscous liquid thread. Very good quantitative agreement
between the numerical solutions and the analytical results is observed.
