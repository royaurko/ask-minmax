Molecular chirality, and the chiral symmetry breaking of resulting
macroscopic phases, can be topologically imprinted and manipulated by
crosslinking and swelling of polymer networks. We present a new experimental
approach to stereo-specific separation of chiral isomers by using a cholesteric
elastomer in which a helical director distribution has been topological
imprinted by crosslinking. This makes the material unusual in that is has a
strong phase chirality, but no molecular chirality at all; we study the nature
and parameters controlling the twist-untwist transition. Adding a racemic
mixture to the imprinted network results in selective swelling by only the
component of ``correct'' handedness. We investigate the capacity of demixing in
a racemic environment, which depends on network parameters and the underlying
nematic order.
