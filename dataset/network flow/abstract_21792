For a vector field F on the Euclidean plane we construct, under certain
assumptions on F, an ordered model-theoretic structure associated to the flow
of F. We do this in such a way that the set of all limit cycles of F is
represented by a definable set. This allows us to give two restatements of
Dulac's Problem for F--that is, the question whether F has finitely many limit
cycles--in model-theoretic terms, one involving the recently developed notion
of thorn-rank and the other involving the notion of o-minimality.
