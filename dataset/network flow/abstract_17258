Planar Maximally Filtered Graphs (PMFG) are an important tool for filtering
the most relevant information from correlation based networks such as stock
market networks. One of the main characteristics of a PMFG is the number of its
3- and 4-cliques. Recently in a few high impact papers it was stated that,
based on heuristic evidence, the maximum number of 3- and 4-cliques that can
exist in a PMFG with n vertices is 3n - 8 and n - 4 respectively. In this
paper, we prove that this is indeed the case.
