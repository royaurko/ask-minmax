We study the duality cascade of softly broken supersymmetric theories. We
investigate the renormalization group (RG) flow of SUSY breaking terms as well
as supersymmetric couplings. It is found that the magnitudes of SUSY breaking
terms are suppressed in most regimes of the RG flow through the duality
cascade. At one stage of cascading, the gaugino mass of the strongly coupled
sector and scalar masses converge to certain values, which are determined by
the gauge coupling and the gaugino mass of the weakly coupled sector. At the
next stage, the strongly and weakly coupled sectors are interchanged with each
other. We also show the possibility that cascading would be terminated by the
gauge symmetry breaking, which is induced by the so-called B-term.
