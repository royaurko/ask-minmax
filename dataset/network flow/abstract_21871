The effect of scattering with non-zero impact parameters between consituents
in relativistic heavy ion collisions is investigated. In solving the
relativistic Boltzmann equation, the characteristic range of the collision
kernel is varied from approximately one fm to zero while leaving the mean-free
path unchanged. Modifying this range is shown to significantly affect spectra
and flow observables. The finite range is shown to provide effective
viscosities, shear, bulk viscosity and heat conductivity, with the viscous
coefficients being proportional to the square of the interaction range.
