We present an experimental study of a turbulent von K\'arm\'an flow produced
in a cylindrical container using two propellers. The mean flow is stationary up
to $Re = 10^4$, where a bifurcation takes place. The new regime breaks some
symmetries of the problem, and is time-dependent. The axisymmetry is broken by
the presence of equatorial vortices with a precession movement, being the
velocity of the vortices proportional to the Reynolds number. The reflection
symmetry through the equatorial plane is broken, and the shear layer of the
mean flow appears displaced from the equator. These two facts appear
simultaneously. In the exact counterrotating case, a bistable regime appears
between both mirrored solutions and spontaneous reversals of the azimuthal
velocity are registered. This evolution can be explained using a three-well
potential model with additive noise. A regime of forced periodic response is
observed when a very weak input signal is applied.
