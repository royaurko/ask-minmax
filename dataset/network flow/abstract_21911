The electrophoretic motion of a conducting particle, driven by an induced
charge mechanism, is analyzed. The dependence of the motion upon particle shape
is embodied in four tensorial coefficients that relate the particle velocities
to the externally-applied electric field. Several families of particle shapes,
whose members are unaffected by the applied field, are identified via use of
symmetry arguments. Other particles translate and/or rotate in response to the
imposed field, even if their net electric charge vanishes. The coefficients are
represented as surface integrals of the electric potential over the particle
boundary, thereby eliminating the need to solve the flow field.
