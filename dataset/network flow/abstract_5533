Traditional approach of providing network security has been to borrow tools
and mechanisms from cryptography. However, the conventional view of security
based on cryptography alone is not sufficient for the defending against unique
and novel types of misbehavior exhibited by nodes encountered in wireless
communication networks. Reputation-based frameworks where nodes maintain
reputation of other nodes and use it to evaluate their trustworthiness are
deployed to provide scalable, diverse and a generalized approach for countering
different types of misbehavior resulting form malicious and selfish nodes in
these networks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive discussion on
reputation and trust-based systems for wireless communication networks.
Different classes of reputation system are described along with their unique
characteristics and working principles. A number of currently used reputation
systems are critically reviewed and compared with respect to their
effectiveness and efficiency of performance. Some open problems in the area of
reputation and trust-based system within the domain of wireless communication
networks are also discussed.
