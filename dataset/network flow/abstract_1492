We consider power networks in which it is not possible to satisfy all loads
at the demand nodes, due to some attack or disturbance to the network. We
formulate a model, based on AC power flow equations, to restore the network to
feasibility by shedding load at demand nodes, but doing so in a way that
minimizes a weighted measure of the total load shed, and affects as few demand
nodes as possible. Besides suggesting an optimal response to a given attack,
our approach can be used to quantify disruption, thereby enabling "stress
testing" to be performed and vulnerabilities to be identified. Optimization
techniques including nonsmooth penalty functions, sequential linear
programming, and active-set heuristics are used to solve this model. We
describe an algorithmic framework and present convergence results, including a
quadratic convergence result for the case in which the solution is fully
determined by its constraints, a situation that arises frequently in the power
systems application.
