This paper is devoted to the simulation of the flow around and inside a rigid
axisymmetric net. We describe first how experimental data have been obtained.
We show in detail the modelization. The model is based on a Reynolds Averaged
Navier-Stokes turbulence model penalized by a term based on the Brinkman law.
At the out-boundary of the computational box, we have used a "ghost" boundary
condition. We show that the corresponding variational problem has a solution.
Then the numerical scheme is given and the paper finishes with numerical
simulations compared with the experimental data.
