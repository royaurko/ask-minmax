A new kind of dynamo utilizing flowing laboratory plasmas has been
identified. Conversion of plasma kinetic energy to magnetic energy is verified
numerically by kinematic dynamo simulations for magnetic Reynolds numbers above
210. As opposed to intrinsically-turbulent liquid-sodium dynamos, the proposed
plasma dynamos correspond to laminar flow topology. Modest plasma parameters,
1-20 eV temperatures, 10^{19}-10^{20} m^{-3} densities in 0.3-1.0 m
scale-lengths driven by velocities on the order of the Alfven Critical
Ionization Velocity (CIV), self-consistently satisfy the conditions needed for
the magnetic field amplication. Growth rates for the plasma dynamos are
obtained numerically with different geometry and magnetic Reynolds numbers.
Magnetic-field-free coaxial plasma guns can be used to sustain the plasma flow
and the dynamo.
