This paper considers the problem of inferring the structure of a network from
indirect observations. Each observation (a "trace") is the unordered set of
nodes which are activated along a path through the network. Since a trace does
not convey information about the order of nodes within the path, there are many
feasible orders for each trace observed, and thus the problem of inferring the
network from traces is, in general, illposed. We propose and analyze an
algorithm which inserts edges by ordering each trace into a path according to
which pairs of nodes in the path co-occur most frequently in the observations.
When all traces involve exactly 3 nodes, we derive necessary and sufficient
conditions for the reconstruction algorithm to exactly recover the graph.
Finally, for a family of random graphs, we present expressions for
reconstruction error probabilities (false discoveries and missed detections).
