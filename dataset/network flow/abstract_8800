This paper addresses an open problem recently posed by V. Kozlov: a rigorous
proof of the non-integrability of the geodesic flow on the cubic surface $x y
z=1$. We prove this is the case using the Morales-Ramis theorem and Kovacic
algorithm. We also consider some consequences and extensions of this result.
