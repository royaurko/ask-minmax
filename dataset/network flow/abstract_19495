A non-slip boundary condition at a wall for the lattice Boltzmann method is
presented. In the present method unknown distribution functions at the wall are
assumed to be an equilibrium distribution function with a counter slip velocity
which is determined so that fluid velocity at the wall is equal to the wall
velocity. Poiseuille flow and Couette flow are calculated with the
nine-velocity model to demonstrate the accuracy of the present boundary
condition.
