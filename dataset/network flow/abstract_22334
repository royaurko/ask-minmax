Tarang is a general-purpose pseudospectral parallel code for simulating flows
involving fluids, magnetohydrodynamics, and Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection in
turbulence and instability regimes. In this paper we present code validation
and benchmarking results of Tarang. We performed our simulations on $1024^3$,
$2048^3$, and $4096^3$ grids using the {\em HPC system} of IIT Kanpur and {\em
Shaheen} of KAUST. We observe good "weak" and "strong" scaling for Tarang on
these systems.
