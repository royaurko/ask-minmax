The Discrete Particle Method (DPM) is used to model granular flows down an
inclined chute. We observe three major regimes: static piles, steady uniform
flows and accelerating flows. For flows over a smooth base, other
(quasi-steady) regimes are observed where the flow is either highly energetic
and strongly layered in depth for small inclinations, or non-uniform and
oscillating for larger inclinations.
  For steady uniform flows, depth profiles of density, velocity and stress have
been obtained using an improved coarse-graining method, which allows accurate
statistics even at the base of the flow. A shallow-layer model for granular
flows is completed with macro-scale closure relations obtained from micro-scale
DPM simulations of steady flows. We thus obtain relations for the effective
basal friction, shape factor, mean density, and the normal stress anisotropy as
functions of layer thickness, flow velocity and basal roughness. For
collisional flows, the functional dependencies are well determined and have
been obtained.
