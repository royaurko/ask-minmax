Stability of dark solitons generated by a supersonic flow of Bose-Einstein
condensate past an obstacle is investigated. It is shown that in the reference
frame attached to the obstacle a transition occurs at some critical value of
the flow velocity from absolute instability of dark solitons to their
convective instability. This leads to decay of disturbances of solitons at
fixed distance from the obstacle and formation of effectively stable dark
solitons. This phenomenon explains surprising stability of the flow picture
that has been observed in numerical simulations.
