Marine heat flow data, obtained with a Lister-type probe, consists of two
temperature decay curves, frictional and heat pulse decay. Both follow the same
physical model of a cooling cylinder. The mathematical model describing the
decays is non-linear as to the thermal sediment parameters thus a direct
inversion is not possible. To overcome this difficulty, the model equations are
expanded using a first-orderTaylor series. The linearised model equations are
used in an iterative scheme to invert the temperature decay for undisturbed
temperature and thermal conductivity of the sediment. The inversion scheme is
tested first for its theoretical limitations using synthetic data. Inversion of
heat flow measurements obtained during a cruise of R/V SONNE in 1996 and needle
probe measurements in material of known thermal conductivity show that the
algorithm is robust and gives reliable results. The programme can be obtained
