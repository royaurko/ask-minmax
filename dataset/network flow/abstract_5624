This article presents a distributed solution to autonomous quality of service
provision in cognitive radio networks. Specifically, cognitive STDMA and CDMA
communication networks are studied. Based on asynchronous weak commitment
search the task of QoS provision is distributed among different network nodes.
Simulation results verify this scheme converges very fast to optimal solution,
which makes it suitable for practical real time systems. This application of
artificial intelligence in wireless and mobile communications can be used in
home automation and networking, and vehicular technology. The generalizations
and extensions of this approach can be used in Long Term Evolution Self
Organizing Networks (LTE-SONs). In addition, it can pave the way for
decentralized and autonomous QoS provision in capillary networks that reach end
nodes at Internet of Things, where central management is either unavailable or
not efficient.
