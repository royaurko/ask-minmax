Research on transport, self-assembly and defect dynamics within confined,
flowing liquid crystals requires versatile and computationally efficient
mesoscopic algorithms to account for fluctuating nematohydrodynamic
interactions. We present a multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD) based
algorithm to simulate liquid-crystal hydrodynamic and director fields in two
and three dimensions. The nematic-MPCD method is shown to successfully
reproduce the features of a nematic liquid crystal, including a
nematic-isotropic phase transition with hysteresis in 3D, defect dynamics,
isotropic Frank elastic coefficients, tumbling and shear alignment regimes and
boundary condition dependent order parameter fields.
