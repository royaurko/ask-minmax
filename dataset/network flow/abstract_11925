A simple but efficient spectral approach for analyzing the community
structure of complex networks is introduced. It works the same way for all
types of networks by spectrally splitting the adjacency matrix into a
"unipartite" and a "multipartite" component whose entries provide measures of
the affinity or antagonism between the nodes in a manner that clearly reveals
the communities and also provides additional information, including a ranking
of the links and nodes and the highlighting of the "gateway" links that are
important in connecting the communities together. Two algorithms are then
proposed to achieve the actual partition into communities. These algorithms can
be tuned to discard the overlaps and produce the most meaningful
non-overlapping community structure.
