A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a self-configure network of sensor nodes
communicate among themselves using radio signals and deployed in quantity to
sense, monitor and to understand the physical world. A jammer is an entity
which interferes with the physical transmission and reception of wireless
communications. Reactive jamming attack is a major security problem in the
wireless sensor network. The reactive jammer stays quiet when the channel is
idle. The jammer starts transmitting a radio signal as soon as it senses
activity on the channel. The reactive jammer nodes will be deactivated by
identifying all the trigger nodes, at the same time a jammer node is localized
by exploiting the changes in the neighbor nodes. The affected node can be
identified, by analyzing the changes in its communication range, compared to
its neighbors. The paper proposes a survey on trigger node identification and a
detailed survey on techniques to identify trigger nodes and highly concentrated
on the reactive jammer.
