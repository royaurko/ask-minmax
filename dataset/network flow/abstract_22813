We investigate the effect of nucleon-nucleon correlations on the initial
condition of ultra-central heavy ion collisions at LHC energies. We calculate
the eccentricities of the MC-Glauber and IP-Glasma models in the 0--1%
centrality class and show that they are considerably affected by the inclusion
of such type of correlations. For an IP-Glasma initial condition, we further
demonstrate that this effect survives the fluid-dynamical evolution of the
system and can be observed in its final state azimuthal momentum anisotropy.
