In this paper, an approach to the problem of automatic facial feature
extraction from a still frontal posed image and classification and recognition
of facial expression and hence emotion and mood of a person is presented. Feed
forward back propagation neural network is used as a classifier for classifying
the expressions of supplied face into seven basic categories like surprise,
neutral, sad, disgust, fear, happy and angry. For face portion segmentation and
localization, morphological image processing operations are used. Permanent
facial features like eyebrows, eyes, mouth and nose are extracted using SUSAN
edge detection operator, facial geometry, edge projection analysis. Experiments
are carried out on JAFFE facial expression database and gives better
performance in terms of 100% accuracy for training set and 95.26% accuracy for
test set.
