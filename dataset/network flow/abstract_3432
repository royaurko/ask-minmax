We study in this work the properties of the $Q_{mf}$ network which is
constructed from an anisotropic partition of the square, the multifractal
tiling. This tiling is build using a single parameter $\rho$, in the limit of
$\rho \to 1$ the tiling degenerates into the square lattice that is associated
with a regular network.
  The $Q_{mf}$ network is a space-filling network with the following
characteristics: it shows a power-law distribution of connectivity for $k>7$
and it has an high clustering coefficient when compared with a random network
associated. In addition the $Q_{mf}$ network satisfy the relation $N \propto
\ell^{d_f}$ where $\ell$ is a typical length of the network (the average
minimal distance) and $N$ the network size. We call $d_f$ the fractal dimension
of the network. In tne limit case $\rho \to 1$ we have $d_{f} \to 2$.
