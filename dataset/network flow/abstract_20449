We prove that uniform accuracy of almost second order can be achieved with a
finite difference method applied to Navier-Stokes flow at low Reynolds number
with a moving boundary, or interface, creating jumps in the velocity gradient
and pressure. Difference operators are corrected to $O(h)$ near the interface
using the immersed interface method, adding terms related to the jumps, on a
regular grid with spacing $h$ and periodic boundary conditions. The force at
the interface is assumed known within an error tolerance; errors in the
interface location are not taken into account. The error in velocity is shown
to be uniformly $O(h^2|\log{h}|^2)$, even at grid points near the interface,
and, up to a constant, the pressure has error $O(h^2|\log{h}|^3)$. The proof
uses estimates for finite difference versions of Poisson and diffusion
equations which exhibit a gain in regularity in maximum norm.
