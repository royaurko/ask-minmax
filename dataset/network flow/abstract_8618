The view of a node in a port-labeled network is an infinite tree encoding all
walks in the network originating from this node. We prove that for any integers
$n\geq D\geq 1$, there exists a port-labeled network with at most $n$ nodes and
diameter at most $D$ which contains a pair of nodes whose (infinite) views are
different, but whose views truncated to depth $\Omega(D\log (n/D))$ are
identical.
