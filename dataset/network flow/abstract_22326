We study the electrophoretic flow of suspensions of charged colloids with a
mesoscopic method that allows to model generic experimental conditions. We show
that for highly charged colloids their electrophoretic mobility increases
significantly and displays a mobility maximum on increasing the colloidal
charge for all salt concentrations. The electrophoretic mobility of highly
charged colloids is also enhanced significantly when ion advection is dominant,
leading to a strong heterogeneity in the local electrophoretic response
especially at low salt concentration, when ion diffuse layers overlap.
