The rapidly growing wave of wireless data service is pushing against the
boundary of our communication network's processing power. The pervasive and
exponentially increasing data traffic present imminent challenges to all the
aspects of the wireless system design, such as spectrum efficiency, computing
capabilities and fronthaul/backhaul link capacity. In this article, we discuss
the challenges and opportunities in the design of scalable wireless systems to
embrace such a "bigdata" era. On one hand, we review the state-of-the-art
networking architectures and signal processing techniques adaptable for
managing the bigdata traffic in wireless networks. On the other hand, instead
of viewing mobile bigdata as a unwanted burden, we introduce methods to
capitalize from the vast data traffic, for building a bigdata-aware wireless
network with better wireless service quality and new mobile applications. We
highlight several promising future research directions for wireless
communications in the mobile bigdata era.
