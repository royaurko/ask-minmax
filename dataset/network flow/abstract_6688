In this work we performed a numerical study of an epidemic model that mimics
the endemic state of whooping cough in the pre-vaccine era. We considered a
stochastic SIR model on dynamical networks that involve local and global
contacts among individuals and analyzed the influence of the network properties
on the characterization of the quasi-stationary state. We computed probability
density functions (PDF) for infected fraction of individuals and found that
they are well fitted by gamma functions, excepted the tails of the
distributions that are q-exponentials. We also computed the fluctuation power
spectra of infective time series for different networks. We found that network
effects can be partially absorbed by rescaling the rate of infective contacts
of the model. An explicit relation between the effective transmission rate of
the disease and the correlation of susceptible individuals with their infective
nearest neighbours was obtained. This relation quantifies the known screening
of infective individuals observed in these networks. We finally discuss the
goodness and limitations of the SIR model with homogeneous mixing and
parameters taken from epidemiological data to describe the dynamic behaviour
observed in the networks studied.
