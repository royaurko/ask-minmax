In full flux-surface computer studies of tokamak edge turbulence, a spectrum
of shear flows is found to control the turbulence level and not just the
conventional (0,0)-mode flows. Flux tube domains too small for the large
poloidal scale lengths of the continuous spectrum tend to overestimate the
flows, and thus underestimate the transport. It is shown analytically and
numerically that under certain conditions dominant (0,0)-mode flows independent
of the domain size develop, essentially through Bose-Einstein condensation of
the shear flows.
