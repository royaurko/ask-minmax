The considered continuous-and-discrete hybrid system is a cyclic relay of
smooth flows on an $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, where the discrete process of
switching from each flow to the next takes place on the boundaries of the
corresponding $n$-dimensional submanifolds of $M$. The main result is the
existence of at least one periodic cyclic trajectory under a certain
topological condition concerning one of the submanifold boundaries.
