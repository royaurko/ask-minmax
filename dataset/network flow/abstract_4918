To study the variation problem related to the incompressible fluid mechanics,
Brenier brings the concept of generalized flow and shows that the generalized
incompressible flow (GIF) is deeply related to the classical solution of the
incompressible Euler equations. In this paper, we will study the ergodic theory
of the GIF which may help us understand the dynamic property of the classical
solution of the incompressible Euler equations. First, we show that the GIF has
the weak recurrent property rather than the classical one. Then, we define the
ergodicity of the GIF and discuss its relation with the classical ergodic flow.
Next, we prove some ergodic theorems of the GIF. Finally, we give a theorem
about the structure of the set of all GIFs.
