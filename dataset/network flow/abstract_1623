We examine a dynamic model for the disruption of information flow in
hierarchical social networks by considering the vertex-pursuit game Seepage
played in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In Seepage, agents attempt to block
the movement of an intruder who moves downward from the source node to a sink.
The minimum number of such agents required to block the intruder is called the
green number. We propose a generalized stochastic model for DAGs with given
expected total degree sequence. Seepage and the green number is analyzed in
stochastic DAGs in both the cases of a regular and power law degree sequence.
For each such sequence, we give asymptotic bounds (and in certain instances,
precise values) for the green number.
