Experiments on dry granular matter flowing down an inclined plane are
performed in order to study the dynamics of dense pyroclastic flows. The plane
is rough, and always wider than the flow, focusing this study on the case of
laterally unconfined (free boundary) flows.We found that several flow regimes
exist depending on the input fluxand on the inclination of the plane. Each flow
regime corresponds to a particular morphology of the associated deposit. In one
of these regimes, the flow reaches a steady state, and the deposit exhibits a
levee/channel morphology similar to those observed on small pyroclastic flow
deposits. The levees result from the combination between lateral static zones
on each border of the flow and the drainage of the central part of the flow
after the supply stops. Particle segregation featuresare created during the
flow, corresponding to those observed on the deposits of pyroclastic flows.
Moreover, the measurements of the deposit morphology (thickness of the channel,
height of the levees, width of the deposit) are quantitatively related to
parameters of the dynamics of the flow (flux, velocity, height of the flow),
leading to a way of studying the flow dynamics from only measurements of the
deposit. Some attempts to make extensions to natural cases are discussed
through experiments introducing the polydispersity of the particle sizes and
the particle segregation process.
