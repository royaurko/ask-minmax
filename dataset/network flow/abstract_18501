This paper investigates the use of different Artificial Intelligence methods
to predict the values of several continuous variables from a Steam Generator.
The objective was to determine how the different artificial intelligence
methods performed in making predictions on the given dataset. The artificial
intelligence methods evaluated were Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines,
and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems. The types of neural networks
investigated were Multi-Layer Perceptions, and Radial Basis Function. Bayesian
and committee techniques were applied to these neural networks. Each of the AI
methods considered was simulated in Matlab. The results of the simulations
showed that all the AI methods were capable of predicting the Steam Generator
data reasonably accurately. However, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference system
out performed the other methods in terms of accuracy and ease of
implementation, while still achieving a fast execution time as well as a
reasonable training time.
