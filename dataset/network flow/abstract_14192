Molecular outflows in the form of wide-angle winds and/or well-collimated
jets are associated with young stellar objects of all luminosities. Independent
studies have established that the mass outflow rate is proportional to
L_bol^0.6 for L_bol = 0.3 to 10^5 L_sun, suggesting that there is a strong link
between accretion and outflow for a wide range of source luminosity and there
is reasonable evidence that accretion-related processes are responsible for
generating massive molecular flows from protostars up to spectral type B0.
Beyond L_bol ~ 10^4 L_sun, O stars generate powerful wide-angle, ionized winds
that can dramatically affect outflow morphology and even call into question the
relationship between outflow and accretion.
  Recently Beuther & Shepherd (2005) proposed an evolutionary scenario in which
massive protostellar flows (up to early B spectral type) begin collimated. Once
the star reaches the Main Sequence, ionizing radiation may affect the balance
between magnetic and plasma pressure, inducing changes in the flow morphology
and energetics. Here I review the properties of outflows from young OB stars,
discuss implications and observational tests of this proposed evolutionary
scenario, and examine differences between low-mass and massive star formation.
