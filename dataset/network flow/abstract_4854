The stability of two-dimensional diverging and converging flows in an annulus
between two permeable cylinders is examined. The basic flow is irrotational and
has both the radial and azimuthal components. It is shown that for a wide range
of the parameters of the problem, the basic flow is unstable to small
two-dimensional perturbations. The instability is inviscid and oscillatory and
persists if the viscosity of the fluid is taken into consideration.
