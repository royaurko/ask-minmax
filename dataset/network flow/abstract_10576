This paper investigates the relay selection (RS) problem in networks with
multiple users and multiple common amplify-and-forward (AF) relays. Considering
the overall quality-of-service of the network, we first specify our definition
of optimal RS for multiple-user relay networks. Then an optimal RS (ORS)
algorithm is provided, which is a straightforward extension of an RS scheme in
the literature that maximizes the minimum end-to-end receive signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of all users. The complexity of the ORS is quadratic in both the
number of users and the number of relays. Then a suboptimal RS (SRS) scheme is
proposed, which has linear complexity in the number of relays and quadratic
complexity in the number of users. Furthermore, diversity orders of both the
ORS and the proposed SRS are theoretically derived and compared with those of a
naive RS scheme and the single-user RS network. It is shown that the ORS
achieves full diversity; while the diversity order of the SRS decreases with
the the number of users. For two-user networks, the outage probabilities and
array gains corresponding to the minimum SNR of the RS schemes are derived in
closed forms. It is proved that the advantage of the SRS over the naive RS
scheme increases as the number of relays in the network increases. Simulation
results are provided to corroborate the analytical results.
