The geometry of accretion flow in the Be/X-ray transient A0535+26 is
explored. It is shown that neither moderate nor giant X-ray flaring events
observed in the system can be interpreted within the spherically symmetrical
accretion model and hence the formation of an accretion disk around the neutron
star magnetosphere during the both types of flares is required. The accretion
disk can be formed at the periastron if (i) the expansion velocity of the Be
star envelope in the equatorial plane is V_wr < 150 km/s and (ii) the parameter
accounting for the accretion flow inhomogeneities, xi, satisfies the following
condition: xi > 0.16 (Mdot_17)^-1/7, where (Mdot_17)^-1/7 is the rate of mass
capture by the neutron star expressed in units of 1017 g/s. We suggest that the
`missing' outburst phenomenon can be associated with the spherically
symmetrical accretion onto the interchange-stable magnetosphere of the neutron
star. The average spin up rate of the neutron star during moderate flares < 3.5
x 10^-12 Hz/s is predicted.
