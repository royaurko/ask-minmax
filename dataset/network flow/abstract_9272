We investigate in depth the synchronization of coupled oscillators on top of
complex networks with different degrees of heterogeneity within the context of
the Kuramoto model. In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 034101 (2007)],
we unveiled how for fixed coupling strengths local patterns of synchronization
emerge differently in homogeneous and heterogeneous complex networks. Here, we
provide more evidence on this phenomenon extending the previous work to
networks that interpolate between homogeneous and heterogeneous topologies. We
also present new details on the path towards synchronization for the evolution
of clustering in the synchronized patterns. Finally, we investigate the
synchronization of networks with modular structure and conclude that, in these
cases, local synchronization is first attained at the most internal level of
organization of modules, progressively evolving to the outer levels as the
coupling constant is increased. The present work introduces new parameters that
are proved to be useful for the characterization of synchronization phenomena
in complex networks.
