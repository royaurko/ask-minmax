We find a Lax pair equation corresponding to the Connes-Kreimer Birkhoff
factorization of the character group of a Hopf algebra. This flow preserves the
locality of counterterms. In particular, we obtain a flow for the character
given by Feynman rules, and relate this flow to the Renormalization Group Flow.
