We investigate the dependence of elliptic flows $v_2$ on transverse momentum
$P_T$ for charged hadrons produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions at high energy
by using a multi-source ideal gas model which includes the interaction
contribution of the emission sources. Our calculated results are approximately
in agreement with the experimental data over a wider $P_T$ range from the STAR
and ALICE Collaborations. It is found that the expansion factor increases
linearly with the impact parameter from most central (0-5%) to mid-peripheral
(35-40%) collisions.
