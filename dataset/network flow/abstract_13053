We study stability of non-compact gradient Kaehler-Ricci flow solitons with
positive holomorphic bisectional curvature. Our main result is that any
compactly supported perturbation and appropriately decaying perturbations of
the Kaehler potential of the soliton will converge to the original soliton
under Kaehler-Ricci flow as time tends to infinity. To obtain this result, we
construct appropriate barriers and introduce an L^p-norm that decays for these
barriers with non-negative Ricci curvature.
