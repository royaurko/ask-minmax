Based on signaling process on complex networks, a method for identification
community structure is proposed. For a network with $n$ nodes, every node is
assumed to be a system which can send, receive, and record signals. Each node
is taken as the initial signal source once to inspire the whole network by
exciting its neighbors and then the source node is endowed a $n$d vector which
recording the effects of signaling process. So by this process, the topological
relationship of nodes on networks could be transferred into the geometrical
structure of vectors in $n$d Euclidian space. Then the best partition of groups
is determined by $F$-statistic and the final community structure is given by
Fuzzy $C$-means clustering method (FCM). This method can detect community
structure both in unweighted and weighted networks without any extra
parameters. It has been applied to ad hoc networks and some real networks
including Zachary Karate Club network and football team network. The results
are compared with that of other approaches and the evidence indicates that the
algorithm based on signaling process is effective.
