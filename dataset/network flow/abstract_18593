We present general methods to exactly calculate mean-first passage quantities
on self-similar networks defined recursively. In particular, we calculate the
mean first-passage time and the splitting probabilities associated to a source
and one or several targets; averaged quantities over a given set of sources
(e.g., same-connectivity nodes) are also derived. The exact estimate of such
quantities highlights the dependency of first-passage processes with respect to
the source-target distance, which has recently revealed to be a key parameter
to characterize transport in complex media. We explicitly perform calculations
for different classes of recursive networks (finitely ramified fractals,
scale-free (trans)fractals, non-fractals, mixtures between fractals and
non-fractals, non-decimable hierarchical graphs) of arbitrary size. Our
approach unifies and significantly extends the available results in the field.
