Social media provides a rich source of networked data. This data is
represented by a set of nodes and a set of relations (edges). It is often
possible to obtain or infer multiple types of relations from the same set of
nodes, such as observed friend connections, inferred links via semantic
comparison, or relations based off of geographic proximity. These edge sets can
be represented by one multi-layer network. In this paper we review a method to
perform community detection of multilayer networks, and illustrate its use as a
visualization tool for analyzing different community partitions. The algorithm
is illustrated on a dataset from Twitter, specifically regarding the National
Football League (NFL).
