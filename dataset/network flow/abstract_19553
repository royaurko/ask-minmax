We describe a formal procedure to obtain and specify the general form of a
marginal distribution for the Lagrangian acceleration of fluid particle in
developed turbulent flow using Langevin type equation and the assumption that
velocity fluctuation $u$ follows a normal distribution with zero mean, in
accord to the Heisenberg-Yaglom picture. For a particular representation,
$\beta=\exp[u]$, of the fluctuating parameter $\beta$, we reproduce the
underlying log-normal distribution and the associated marginal distribution,
which was found to be in a very good agreement with the new experimental data
by Crawford, Mordant, and Bodenschatz on the acceleration statistics. We
discuss on arising possibilities to make refinements of the log-normal model.
