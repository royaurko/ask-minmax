Mobile phone communication as digital service generates ever-increasing
datasets of human communication actions, which in turn allow us to investigate
the structure and evolution of social interactions and their networks. These
datasets can be used to study the structuring of such egocentric networks with
respect to the strength of the relationships by assuming direct dependence of
the communication intensity on the strength of the social tie. Recently we have
discovered that there are significant differences between the first and further
"best friends" from the point of view of age and gender preferences. Here we
introduce a control parameter $p_{\rm max}$ based on the statistics of
communication with the first and second "best friend" and use it to filter the
data. We find that when $p_{\rm max}$ is decreased the identification of the
"best friend" becomes less ambiguous and the earlier observed effects get
stronger, thus corroborating them.
