We study the evolution of public cooperation on two interdependent networks
that are connected by means of a utility function, which determines to what
extent payoffs in one network influence the success of players in the other
network. We find that the stronger the bias in the utility function, the higher
the level of public cooperation. Yet the benefits of enhanced public
cooperation on the two networks are just as biased as the utility functions
themselves. While cooperation may thrive on one network, the other may still be
plagued by defectors. Nevertheless, the aggregate level of cooperation on both
networks is higher than the one attainable on an isolated network. This
positive effect of biased utility functions is due to the suppressed feedback
of individual success, which leads to a spontaneous separation of
characteristic time scales of the evolutionary process on the two
interdependent networks. As a result, cooperation is promoted because the
aggressive invasion of defectors is more sensitive to the slowing down than the
build-up of collective efforts in sizable groups.
