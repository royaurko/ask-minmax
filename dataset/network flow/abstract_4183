This brief note addresses the free boundary problem arising from the steady
two-dimensional seepage flow through a rectangular dam. The flow problem
consists in finding the free boundary location, and the velocity and pressure
fields. The problem solution is obtained by using an approximate model which
provides the analytical expression for the free boundary profile. Within the
range of validity of the model assumptions, the computational results show
agreement with data in literature.
