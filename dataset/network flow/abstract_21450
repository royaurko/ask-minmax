We present two numerical simulations of an accretion flow from a rotating
torus onto a compact object with and without a solid surface -- representing a
neutron star and a black hole -- and investigate its influence on the process
of jet formation. We report the emergence of an additional ejection component,
launched by thermal pressure inside a boundary layer (BL) around the neutron
star and examine its structure. Finally, we suggest improvements for future
models.
