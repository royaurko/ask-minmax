We present empirical evidence that land values are scale-free and introduce a
network model that reproduces the observations. The network approach to urban
modelling is based on the assumption that the market dynamics that generates
land values can be represented as a growing scale-free network. Our results
suggest that the network properties of trade between specialized activities
causes land values, and likely also other observables such as population, to be
power law distributed. In addition to being an attractive avenue for further
analytical inquiry, the network representation is also applicable to empirical
data and is thereby attractive for predictive modelling.
