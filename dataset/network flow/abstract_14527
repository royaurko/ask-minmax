Differential elliptic flow $v_2(p_{T})$ for identified hadrons has been
investigated in the FAIR energy regime, employing a hadronic-string transport
model (UrQMD) as well as a partonic transport model (AMPT). It has been
observed that both the models show a mass ordering of $v_2$ at low $p_{T}$ and
a switch over resulting a baryon-meson crossing at intermediate $p_{T}$. AMPT
generates higher $v_2$ values compared to UrQMD. In addition, constituent quark
number scaling behavior of elliptic flow has also been addressed. Scaling
behavior in terms of the transverse momentum $p_T$ is found to absent for both
the partonic as well as the hadronic model. However UrQMD and AMPT with string
melting scenario do exhibit a NCQ scaling of $v_2$ at varying degree, with
respect to transverse kinetic energy $KE_T$. But default AMPT, where partonic
scatterings are not included, does not show any considerable scaling behavior.
A variable $\alpha$ is defined to quantify the degree of $KE_T$ scaling. We
found that UrQMD gives better scaling than AMPT at FAIR.
