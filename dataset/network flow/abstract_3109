By the use of extensive numerical simulations we show that the
nearest-neighbor energy level spacing distribution $P(s)$ and the entropic
eigenfunction localization length of the adjacency matrices of
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) {\it fully} random networks are universal for fixed
average degree $\xi\equiv \alpha N$ ($\alpha$ and $N$ being the average network
connectivity and the network size, respectively). We also demonstrate that
Brody distribution characterizes well $P(s)$ in the transition from $\alpha=0$,
when the vertices in the network are isolated, to $\alpha=1$, when the network
is fully connected. Moreover, we explore the validity of our findings when
relaxing the randomness of our network model and show that, in contrast to
standard ER networks, ER networks with {\it diagonal disorder} also show
universality. Finally, we also discuss the spectral and eigenfunction
properties of small-world networks.
