This paper studies a combinatorial optimization problem which is obtained by
combining the flow shop scheduling problem and the shortest path problem. The
objective of the obtained problem is to select a subset of jobs that
constitutes a feasible solution to the shortest path problem, and to execute
the selected jobs on the flow shop machines to minimize the makespan. We argue
that this problem is NP-hard even if the number of machines is two, and is
NP-hard in the strong sense for the general case. We propose an intuitive
approximation algorithm for the case where the number of machines is an input,
and an improved approximation algorithm for fixed number of machines.
