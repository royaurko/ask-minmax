Air transportation has been becoming a major part of transportation
infrastructure worldwide. Hence the study of the Airports Networks, the
backbone of air transportation, is becoming increasingly important. In complex
systems domain, airport networks are modeled as graphs (networks) comprising of
airports (vertices or nodes) that are linked by flight connectivities among the
airports. A complex network analysis of such a model offers holistic insight
about the performance and risks in such a network. We review the performance
and risks of networks with the help of studies that have been done on some of
the airport networks. We present various network parameters those could be
potentially used as a measure of performance and risks on airport networks. We
will also see how various risks, such as break down of airports, spread of
diseases across the airport network could be assessed based on the network
parameters. Further we review how these insights could possibly be used to
shape more efficient and safer airport networks.
