The equations governing a collisionless obliquely-flowing plasma around an
ion-absorbing object in a strong magnetic field are shown to have an exact
analytic solution even for arbitrary (two-dimensional) object-shape, when
temperature is uniform, and diffusive transport can be ignored. The solution
has an extremely simple geometric embodiment. It shows that the ion collection
flux density to a convex body's surface depends only upon the orientation of
the surface, and provides the theoretical justification and calibration of
oblique `Mach-probes'. The exponential form of this exact solution helps
explain the approximate fit of this function to previous numerical solutions.
