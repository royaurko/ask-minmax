We present results from numerical simulations of nonlinear MHD dynamo action
produced by three-dimensional flows that become turbulent for high values of
the fluid Reynolds number. The magnitude of the forcing function driving the
flow is allowed to evolve with time in such way as to maintain an approximately
constant velocity amplitude (and average kinetic energy) when the flow becomes
hydrodynamically unstable. It is found that the saturation level of the dynamo
increases with the fluid Reynolds number (at constant magnetic Prandtl number),
and that the average growth rate approaches an asymptotic value for high fluid
Reynolds number. The generation and destruction of magnetic field is examined
during the laminar and turbulent phase of the flow and it is found that in the
neighborhood of strong magnetic "flux cigars" Joule dissipation is balanced by
the work done against the Lorentz force, while the steady increase of magnetic
energy occurs mainly through work done in the weak part of the magnetic field.
