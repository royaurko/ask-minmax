We investigate the structure of the Marvel Universe collaboration network,
where two Marvel characters are considered linked if they jointly appear in the
same Marvel comic book. We show that this network is clearly not a random
network, and that it has most, but not all, characteristics of "real-life"
collaboration networks, such as movie actors or scientific collaboration
networks. The study of this artificial universe that tries to look like a real
one, helps to understand that there are underlying principles that make
real-life networks have definite characteristics.
