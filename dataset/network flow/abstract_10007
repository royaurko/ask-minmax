We study the global dynamics of advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs)
with magnetically driven outflows. A fraction of gases in the accretion flow is
accelerated into the outflows, which leads to decreasing of the mass accretion
rate in the accretion flow towards the black hole. We find that the r-dependent
mass accretion rate is close to a power-law one, m_dot r^s, as assumed in the
advection-dominated inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS), in the outer region of the
ADAF, while it deviates significantly from the power-law r-dependent accretion
rate in the inner region of the ADAF. It is found that the structure of the
ADAF is significantly changed in the presence of the outflows. The temperatures
of the ions and electrons in the ADAF decreases in the presence of outflows, as
a fraction of gravitational power released in the ADAF is tapped to accelerate
the outflows.
