Spin-polarized electrical transport is investigated in $
Al_{2}O_{3}/Ni_{80}Fe_{20}/Al_{2}O_{3}$ thin films for permalloy thickness
between 6 and 20nm. The degree of spin-polarization of the current flowing in
the plane of the film is measured through the current induced spin wave Doppler
shift. We find that it decreases as the film thickness decreases, from 0.72 at
20nm to 0.46 at 6nm. This decrease is attributed to a spin depolarization
induced by the film surfaces. A model is proposed which takes into account the
contributions of the different sources of electron scattering (alloy disorder,
phonons, thermal magnons, grain boundaries, film surfaces) to the measured
spin-dependent resistivities.
