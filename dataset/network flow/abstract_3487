Driven by the need for better models that allow one to shed light into the
question how life's diversity has evolved, phylogenetic networks have now
joined phylogenetic trees in the center of phylogenetics research. Like
phylogenetic trees, such networks canonically induce collections of
phylogenetic trees, clusters, and triplets, respectively. Thus it is not
surprising that many network approaches aim to reconstruct a phylogenetic
network from such collections. Related to the well-studied perfect phylogeny
problem, the following question is of fundamental importance in this context:
When does one of the above collections encode (i.e. uniquely describe) the
network that induces it? In this note, we present a complete answer to this
question for the special case of a level-1 (phylogenetic) network by
characterizing those level-1 networks for which an encoding in terms of one (or
equivalently all) of the above collections exists. Given that this type of
network forms the first layer of the rich hierarchy of level-k networks, k a
non-negative integer, it is natural to wonder whether our arguments could be
extended to members of that hierarchy for higher values for k. By giving
examples, we show that this is not the case.
