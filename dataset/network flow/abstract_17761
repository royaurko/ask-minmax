In this work, we establish the so-called backward uniqiueness property for a
coupled system of partial di?fferential equations (PDEs) which governs a
certain fluid-structure interaction. In particular, a three-dimensional Stokes
flow interacts across a boundary interface with a two-dimensional mechanical
plate equation. By way of attaining this result, a certain estimate is obtained
for the associated semigroup generator resolvent.
