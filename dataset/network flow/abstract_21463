In this article we apply a recently invented analytical real-space
renormalization group formulation which is based on numerical concepts of the
density matrix renormalization group. Within a rigorous mathematical framework
we construct non-perturbative renormalization group transformations for the
spin-1/2 XXX Heisenberg model in the finite temperature regime. The developed
renormalization group scheme allows for calculating the renormalization group
flow behaviour in the temperature dependent coupling constant. The constructed
renormalization group transformations are applied within the ferromagnetic and
the anti-ferromagnetic regime of the Heisenberg chain. The ferromagnetic fixed
point is computed and compared to results derived by other techniques.
