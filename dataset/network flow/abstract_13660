We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a closed connected
co-orientable contact $3$-manifold $(M,\xi)$ to be a standard lens space based
on assumptions on the Reeb flow associated to a defining contact form. Our
methods also provide rational global surfaces of section for nondegenerate Reeb
flows on $(L(p,q),\xi_{\rm std})$ with prescribed binding orbits.
