The rheology of a granular shear flow is studied in a quasi-2d rotating
cylinder. Measurements are carried out near the midpoint along the length of
the surface flowing layer where the flow is steady and non-accelerating.
Streakline photography and image analysis are used to obtain particle
velocities and positions. Different particle sizes and rotational speeds are
considered. We find a sharp transition in the apparent viscosity ($\eta$)
variation with rms velocity ($u$). In the fluid-like region above the depth
corresponding to the transition point (higher rms velocities) there is a rapid
increase in viscosity with decreasing rms velocity. Below the transition depth
we find $\eta \propto u^{-1.5}$ for all the different cases studied and the
material approaches an amorphous solid-like state deep in the layer. The
velocity distribution is Maxwellian above the transition point and a Poisson
velocity distribution is obtained deep in the layer. The observed transition
appears to be analogous to a glass transition.
