We investigate experimentally granular piles exhibiting steady surface flow.
Below the surface flow, it has been believed exisitence of a `frozen' bulk
region, but our results show absence of such a frozen bulk. We report here that
even the particles in deep layers in the bulk exhibit very slow flow and that
such motion can be detected at an arbitrary depth. The mean velocity of the
creep motion decays exponentially with depth, and the characteristic decay
length is approximately equal to the particle-size and independent of the flow
rate. It is expected that the creep motion we have seeen is observable in all
sheared granular systems.
