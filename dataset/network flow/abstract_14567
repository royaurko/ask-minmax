We prove a comparison theorem for the isoperimetric profiles of simple closed
curves evolving by the normalized curve shortening flow: If the isoperimetric
profile of the region enclosed by the initial curve is greater than that of
some `model' convex region with exactly four vertices and with reflection
symmetry in both axes, then the inequality remains true for the isoperimetric
profiles of the evolved regions. We apply this using the Angenent solution as
the model region to deduce sharp time-dependent upper bounds on curvature for
arbitrary embedded closed curves evolving by the normalized curve shortening
flow. A slightly different comparison also gives lower bounds on curvature, and
the result is a simple and direct proof of Grayson's theorem without use of any
blowup or compactness arguments, Harnack estimates, or classification of
self-similar solutions.
