Within the program of holographic renormalization, we discuss the computation
of three-point correlation functions along RG flows. We illustrate the
procedure in two simple cases. In an RG flow to the Coulomb branch of N=4 SYM
theory we derive a compact and finite expression for the three-point function
of lowest CPO's dual to inert scalars. In the GPPZ flow, that captures some
features of N=1 SYM theory, we compute the three-point function with insertion
of two inert scalars and one active scalar that mixes with the stress tensor.
By amputating the external legs at the mass poles we extract the trilinear
coupling of the corresponding superglueballs. Finally we outline the procedure
for computing three-point functions with insertions of the stress tensor as
well as of (broken) R-symmetry currents.
