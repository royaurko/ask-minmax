A new two layer hierarchical routing protocol called Cluster Based
Hierarchical Routing Protocol (CBHRP) is proposed in this paper. It is an
extension of LEACH routing protocol. We introduce cluster head-set idea for
cluster-based routing where several clusters are formed with the deployed
sensors to collect information from target field. On rotation basis, a head-set
member receives data from the neighbor nodes and transmits the aggregated
results to the distance base station. This protocol reduces energy consumption
quite significantly and prolongs the life time of sensor network. It is found
that CBHRP performs better than other well accepted hierarchical routing
protocols like LEACH in term of energy consumption and time requirement.
