Enhancing the current services or deploying new services operating in RF
spectrum requires more licensed spectrum which may not be provided by the
regulatory bodies because of spectrum scarcity. On the contrary, recent studies
suggest that many portions of the licensed spectrum remains unused or underused
for significant period of time raising the issue of spectrum access without
license in an opportunistic manner. Among all the spectrum accessing
techniques, sensing based methods are considered optimal for their simplicity
and cost effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce a new cooperative spectrum
sensing technique which considers the spatial variation of secondary
(unlicensed) users and each user's contribution is weighted by a factor that
depends on received power and path loss. Compared to existing techniques, the
proposed one increases the sensing ability and spectrum utilization, and offers
greater robustness to noise uncertainty. Moreover, this cooperative technique
uses very simple energy detector as its building block thereby reduces the cost
and operational complexity.
