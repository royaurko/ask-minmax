A type of overlapping grid in spherical coordinates called the Yin-Yang grid
is successfully implemented into a 3D version of the explicit Eulerian
grid-based code PROMETHEUS including self-gravity. The modified code
successfully passed several standard hydrodynamic tests producing results which
are in very good agreement with analytic solutions. Moreover, the solutions
obtained with the Yin-Yang grid exhibit no peculiar behaviour at the boundary
between the two grid patches. The code has also been successfully used to model
astrophysically relevant situations, namely equilibrium polytropes, a
Taylor-Sedov explosion, and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. According to our
results, the usage of the Yin-Yang grid greatly enhances the suitability and
efficiency of 3D explicit Eulerian codes based on spherical polar coordinates
for astrophysical flows.
