We consider the spin torque induced by a current flowing ballistically
through a magnetic domain wall. In addition to a global pressure in the
direction of the electronic flow, the torque has an internal structure of
comparable magnitude due to the precession of the electrons' spins at the
"Larmor" frequency. As a result, the profile of the domain wall is expected to
get distorted by the current and acquires a periodic sur-structure.
