In The Clash of Civilizations, Samuel Huntington argued that the primary axis
of global conflict was no longer ideological or economic but cultural and
religious, and that this division would characterize the "battle lines of the
future." In contrast to the "top down" approach in previous research focused on
the relations among nation states, we focused on the flows of interpersonal
communication as a bottom-up view of international alignments. To that end, we
mapped the locations of the world's countries in global email networks to see
if we could detect cultural fault lines. Using IP-geolocation on a worldwide
anonymized dataset obtained from a large Internet company, we constructed a
global email network. In computing email flows we employ a novel rescaling
procedure to account for differences due to uneven adoption of a particular
Internet service across the world. Our analysis shows that email flows are
consistent with Huntington's thesis. In addition to location in Huntington's
"civilizations," our results also attest to the importance of both cultural and
economic factors in the patterning of inter-country communication ties.
