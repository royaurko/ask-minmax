When the classical Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) system is rotated about its
vertical axis roughly three regimes can be identified. In regime I (weak
rotation) the large scale circulation (LSC) is the dominant feature of the
flow. In regime II (moderate rotation) the LSC is replaced by vertically
aligned vortices. Regime III (strong rotation) is characterized by suppression
of the vertical velocity fluctuations. Using results from experiments and
direct numerical simulations of RB convection for a cell with a
diameter-to-height aspect ratio equal to one at $Ra \sim 10^8-10^9$ ($Pr=4-6$)
and $0 \lesssim 1/Ro \lesssim 25$ we identified the characteristics of the
azimuthal temperature profiles at the sidewall in the different regimes. In
regime I the azimuthal wall temperature profile shows a cosine shape and a
vertical temperature gradient due to plumes that travel with the LSC close to
the sidewall. In regime II and III this cosine profile disappears, but the
vertical wall temperature gradient is still observed. It turns out that the
vertical wall temperature gradient in regimes II and III has a different origin
than that observed in regime I. It is caused by boundary layer dynamics
characteristic for rotating flows, which drives a secondary flow that
transports hot fluid up the sidewall in the lower part of the container and
cold fluid downwards along the sidewall in the top part.
