The traffic behavior of University of Louisville network with the
interconnected backbone routers and the number of Virtual Local Area Network
(VLAN) subnets is investigated using the Random Matrix Theory (RMT) approach.
We employ the system of equal interval time series of traffic counts at all
router to router and router to subnet connections as a representation of the
inter-VLAN traffic. The cross-correlation matrix C of the traffic rate changes
between different traffic time series is calculated and tested against
null-hypothesis of random interactions.
  The majority of the eigenvalues \lambda_{i} of matrix C fall within the
bounds predicted by the RMT for the eigenvalues of random correlation matrices.
The distribution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors outside of the RMT bounds
displays prominent and systematic deviations from the RMT predictions.
Moreover, these deviations are stable in time.
  The method we use provides a unique possibility to accomplish three
concurrent tasks of traffic analysis. The method verifies the uncongested state
of the network, by establishing the profile of random interactions. It
recognizes the system-specific large-scale interactions, by establishing the
profile of stable in time non-random interactions. Finally, by looking into the
eigenstatistics we are able to detect and allocate anomalies of network traffic
interactions.
