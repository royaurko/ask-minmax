We use a continuous wavelet transform to analyze more than two decades of
data for the BL~Lac object OJ~287 acquired as part of the UMRAO variability
program. We find clear evidence for a persistent modulation of the total flux
and polarization with period $\sim 1.66$ years, and for another signal that
dominates activity in the 1980s with period $\sim 1.12$ years. The relationship
between these two variations can be understood in terms of a `shock-in-jet'
model, in which the longer time scale periodicity is associated with an
otherwise quiescent jet, and the shorter time scale activity is associated with
the passage of a shock; the different periodicities of these two components may
reflect different internal conditions of the two flow domains, leading to
different wave speeds, or different contractions of a single underlying
periodicity, due to the different Doppler factors of the two flow components.
We suggest that the modulation arises from a wave driven by some asymmetric
disturbance close to the central engine. The periodic behavior in polarization
exhibits excursions in $U$ which correspond to a direction $\sim 45^{\circ}$
from the VLBI jet axis. This behavior is not explained by the random walk in
the $Q$-$U$ plane which is expected from models in which a pattern of randomly
aligned magnetic field elements propagate across the visible portion of the
flow, and suggests a small amplitude, cyclic variation in the flow direction in
that part of the flow that dominates cm-wavelength emission.
