We performed a comparative dynamical investigation of chaotic test data using
the global flow reconstruction method. We demonstrate that large-amplitude,
long-term variations may have a disturbing effect in the analysis. The
Empirical Mode Decomposition method (EMD) and the Fourier filtering were tested
to remove the additional variations. Test results show that the elimination of
these variations significantly increased the robustness of the reconstructions.
