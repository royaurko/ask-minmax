The result of this paper is the elucidation of the consequences for the
chemical reaction network theory under the assumption of feasibility with
respect to thermodynamic constraints. Thermodynamic feasible reaction networks
limit the amount of "allowed" reaction patterns to the set of loopless reaction
fluxes. Combined with the chemical reaction network theory (CRN) reversible and
weakly reversible CRN's are injective. Furthermore, injectivity is reduced to
the injectivity of the stoichiometric space into the reactant space.
  We will therefore assume that all reactions are reversible unless we
explicitely mention where we can neglect full reversibility.
