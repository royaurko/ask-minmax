We study the problem of analyzing influence of various factors affecting
individual messages posted in social media. The problem is challenging because
of various types of influences propagating through the social media network
that act simultaneously on any user. Additionally, the topic composition of the
influencing factors and the susceptibility of users to these influences evolve
over time. This problem has not studied before, and off-the-shelf models are
unsuitable for this purpose. To capture the complex interplay of these various
factors, we propose a new non-parametric model called the Dynamic
Multi-Relational Chinese Restaurant Process. This accounts for the user network
for data generation and also allows the parameters to evolve over time.
Designing inference algorithms for this model suited for large scale
social-media data is another challenge. To this end, we propose a scalable and
multi-threaded inference algorithm based on online Gibbs Sampling. Extensive
evaluations on large-scale Twitter and Facebook data show that the extracted
topics when applied to contributorship and commenting prediction outperform
state-of-the-art baselines. More importantly, our model produces valuable
insights on topic trends and user personality trends, beyond the capability of
existing approaches.
