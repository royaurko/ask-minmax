Inference of online social network users' attributes and interests has been
an active research topic. Accurate identification of users' attributes and
interests is crucial for improving the performance of personalization and
recommender systems. Most of the existing works have focused on textual content
generated by the users and have successfully used it for predicting users'
interests and other identifying attributes. However, little attention has been
paid to user generated visual content (images) that is becoming increasingly
popular and pervasive in recent times. We posit that images posted by users on
online social networks are a reflection of topics they are interested in and
propose an approach to infer user attributes from images posted by them. We
analyze the content of individual images and then aggregate the image-level
knowledge to infer user-level interest distribution. We employ image-level
similarity to propagate the label information between images, as well as
utilize the image category information derived from the user created
organization structure to further propagate the category-level knowledge for
all images. A real life social network dataset created from Pinterest is used
for evaluation and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed approach.
