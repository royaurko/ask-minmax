Multilayer relationships among entities and information about entities must
be accompanied by the means to analyze, visualize, and obtain insights from
such data. We present open-source software (muxViz) that contains a collection
of algorithms for the analysis of multilayer networks, which are an important
way to represent a large variety of complex systems throughout science and
engineering. We demonstrate the ability of muxViz to analyze and interactively
visualize multilayer data using empirical genetic, neuronal, and transportation
networks. Our software is available at https://github.com/manlius/muxViz.
