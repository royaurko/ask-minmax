Visually induced neuronal activity in V1 displays a marked gamma-band
component which is modulated by stimulus properties. It has been argued that
synchronized oscillations contribute to these gamma-band activity [...
however,] even when oscillations are observed, they undergo temporal
decorrelation over very few cycles. This is not easily accounted for in
previous network modeling of gamma oscillations. We argue here that
interactions between cortical layers can be responsible for this fast
decorrelation. We study a model of a V1 hypercolumn, embedding a simplified
description of the multi-layered structure of the cortex. When the stimulus
contrast is low, the induced activity is only weakly synchronous and the
network resonates transiently without developing collective oscillations. When
the contrast is high, on the other hand, the induced activity undergoes
synchronous oscillations with an irregular spatiotemporal structure expressing
a synchronous chaotic state. As a consequence the population activity undergoes
fast temporal decorrelation, with concomitant rapid damping of the oscillations
in LFPs autocorrelograms and peak broadening in LFPs power spectra. [...]
Finally, we argue that the mechanism underlying the emergence of synchronous
chaos in our model is in fact very general. It stems from the fact that gamma
oscillations induced by local delayed inhibition tend to develop chaos when
coupled by sufficiently strong excitation.
