Signaling pathways and networks determine the ability to communicate in
systems ranging from living cells to human society. We investigate how the
network structure constrains communication in social-, man-made and biological
networks. We find that human networks of governance and collaboration are
predictable on teat-a-teat level, reflecting well defined pathways, but
globally inefficient. In contrast, the Internet tends to have better overall
communication abilities, more alternative pathways, and is therefore more
robust. Between these extremes the molecular network of Saccharomyces cerevisea
is more similar to the simpler social systems, whereas the pattern of
interactions in the more complex Drosophilia melanogaster, resembles the robust
Internet.
