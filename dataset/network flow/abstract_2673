We establish experimentally the flow patterns of induced-charge
electro-osmosis (ICEO) around immobilized metallic spheres in aqueous
electrolyte. The AC field modifies local electrolyte concentration and causes
quadrupolar flows with inward velocities being smaller than the outward ones.
At high fields, the flow becomes irregular, with vortices smaller than the size
of the sphere. Janus metallo-dielectric spheres create dipolar flows and pump
the fluid from the dielectric toward the metallic part. The experimentally
determined far-field flows decay with the distance as r-3.
