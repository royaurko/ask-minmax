We present a method for learning the parameters of a Bayesian network with
prior knowledge about the signs of influences between variables. Our method
accommodates not just the standard signs, but provides for context-specific
signs as well. We show how the various signs translate into order constraints
on the network parameters and how isotonic regression can be used to compute
order-constrained estimates from the available data. Our experimental results
show that taking prior knowledge about the signs of influences into account
leads to an improved fit of the true distribution, especially when only a small
sample of data is available. Moreover, the computed estimates are guaranteed to
be consistent with the specified signs, thereby resulting in a network that is
more likely to be accepted by experts in its domain of application.
