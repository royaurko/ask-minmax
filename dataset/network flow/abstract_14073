Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of particle-laden turbulent flow in
straight, mildly curved and strongly bent pipes are performed in which the
solid phase is modelled as small heavy spherical particles. The objective is to
examine the effect of the curvature on particle transport and accumulation, in
particular how the turbophoretic drift of the particles is affected by weak and
strong secondary motions of the carrier phase and geometry-induced centrifugal
forces. A total of seven populations of dilute particles with different Stokes
numbers, one-way coupled with their carrier phase, are simulated. Even a slight
non-zero curvature in the flow configuration shows a strong impact on the
particle dynamics. Near-wall helicoidal particle streaks are observed in the
curved configurations with their inclination varying with the strength of the
secondary motion of the carrier phase. A reflection layer, as previously
observed in particle laden turbulent S-shaped channels, is also apparent in the
strongly curved pipe with heavy particles. In addition, depending on the
curvature, the central regions of the mean Dean vortices appear to be
completely depleted of particles, as observed also in the largely
re-laminarised region at the inner bend. The current data-set will be useful
for modelling particles advected in wall-bounded turbulent flows where the
effects of the curvature are not negligible.
