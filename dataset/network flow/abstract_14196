The linear stability theory of Taylor-Couette flows (unbounded in_z_) is
described including magnetic fields, Hall effect or a density stratification in
order to prepare laboratory experiments to probe the stability of differential
rotation in astrophysics. If an axial field is present then the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) is investigated also for small magnetic
Prandtl numbers. For rotating outer cylinder beyond the Rayleigh line
characteristic minima are found for magnetic Reynolds number of the order of 10
and for Lundquist numbers of order 1. The inclusion of extra toroidal
current-free fields leads to new oscillating solutions with rather low Reynolds
numbers and Hartmann numbers. The Hall effect establishes an unexpected
`shear-Hall instability' (SHI) where shear and magnetic field have opposite
signs. In this case even rotation laws increasing outwards may become unstable.
Recently global solutions have been found for the Taylor-Couette flows with
density stratified in axial directions (`stratorotational instability', SRI).
They exist beyond the Rayleigh line for Froude numbers of moderate order but
also not for too flat rotation laws with \hat\eta^2 < \hat\mu <\hat \eta.
