We are interested in an anisotropic singular diffusion equation in the plane
and in its regularization. We establish existence, uniqueness and basic
regularity of solutions to both equations. We construct explicit solutions
showing the creation of facets, i.e. flat regions of solutions. By using the
formula for solutions, we rigorously prove that both equations create ruled
surfaces out of convex initial conditions as well as do not admit point (local)
extrema. We present numerical experiments suggesting that the two flows seem
not differ much. Possible applications to image reconstruction is pointed out,
too.
