We investigate properties of evolving linguistic networks defined by the
word-adjacency relation. Such networks belong to the category of networks with
accelerated growth but their shortest path length appears to reveal the network
size dependence of different functional form than the ones known so far. We
thus compare the networks created from literary texts with their artificial
substitutes based on different variants of the Dorogovtsev-Mendes model and
observe that none of them is able to properly simulate the novel asymptotics of
the shortest path length. Then, we identify the local chain-like linear growth
induced by grammar and style as a missing element in this model and extend it
by incorporating such effects. It is in this way that a satisfactory agreement
with the empirical result is obtained.
