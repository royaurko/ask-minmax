Systems that are not smooth can undergo bifurcations that are forbidden in
smooth systems. We review some of the phenomena that can occur for
piecewise-smooth, continuous maps and flows when a fixed point or an
equilibrium collides with a surface on which the system is not smooth. Much of
our understanding of these cases relies on a reduction to piecewise linearity
near the border-collision. We also review a number of codimension-two
bifurcations in which nonlinearity is important.
