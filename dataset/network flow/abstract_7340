In this paper, results of an experimental study of a deep convolution neural
network architecture which can classify different handwritten digits using
EBLearn library are reported. The purpose of this neural network is to classify
input images into 10 different classes or digits (0-9) and to explore new
findings. The input dataset used consists of digits images of size 32X32 in
grayscale (MNIST dataset).
