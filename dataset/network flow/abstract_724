We study the curvature flow of planar nonconvex lens-shaped domains,
considered as special symmetric networks with two triple junctions. We show
that the evolving domain becomes convex in finite time; then it shrinks
homothetically to a point. Our theorem is the analog of the result of Grayson
for curvature flow of closed planar embedded curves.
