We study the structure and dynamics of a transient network composed of
droplets of microemulsion connected by telechelic polymers. The polymer induces
a bridging attraction between droplets without changing their shape. A
viscoelastic behaviour is induced in the initially liquid solution,
characterised in the linear regime by a stretched exponential stress
relaxation. We analyse this relaxation in the light of classical theories of
transient networks. The role of the elastic reorganisations in the deformed
network is emphasized. In the non linear regime, a fast relaxation dynamics is
followed by a second one having the same rate as in the linear regime. This
behaviour, under step strain experiments, should induce a non monotonic
behaviour in the elastic component of the stress under constant shear rate.
However, we obtain in this case a singularity in the flow curve very different
from the one observed in other systems, that we interpret in terms of fracture
behaviour.
