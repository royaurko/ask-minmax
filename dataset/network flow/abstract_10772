We investigate the transition of a radiatively inefficient phase of a viscous
two temperature accreting flow to a cooling dominated phase and vice versa
around black holes. Based on a global sub-Keplerian accretion disc model in
steady state, including explicit cooling processes self-consistently, we show
that general advective accretion flow passes through various phases during its
infall towards a black hole. Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and inverse
Comptonization of soft photons are considered as possible cooling mechanisms.
Hence the flow governs a much lower electron temperature ~10^8 - 10^{9.5}K
compared to the hot protons of temperature ~10^{10.2} - 10^{11.8}K in the range
of the accretion rate in Eddington units 0.01 - 100. Therefore, the solutions
may potentially explain the hard X-rays and the gamma-rays emitted from AGNs
and X-ray binaries. We finally compare the solutions for two different regimes
of viscosity and conclude that a weakly viscous flow is expected to be cooling
dominated compared to its highly viscous counterpart which is radiatively
inefficient. The flow is successfully able to reproduce the observed
luminosities of the under-fed AGNs and quasars (e.g. Sgr A*), ultra-luminous
X-ray sources (e.g. SS433), as well as the highly luminous AGNs and
ultra-luminous quasars (e.g. PKS 0743-67) at different combinations of the mass
accretion rate and ratio of specific heats.
