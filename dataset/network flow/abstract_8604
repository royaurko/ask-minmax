This paper examines the problem of rate allocation for multicasting over slow
Rayleigh fading channels using network coding. In the proposed model, the
network is treated as a collection of Rayleigh fading multiple access channels.
In this model, rate allocation scheme that is based solely on the statistics of
the channels is presented. The rate allocation scheme is aimed at minimizing
the outage probability. An upper bound is presented for the probability of
outage in the fading multiple access channel. A suboptimal solution based on
this bound is given. A distributed primal-dual gradient algorithm is derived to
solve the rate allocation problem.
