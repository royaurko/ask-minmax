Patterns formed by the flow of an inhomogeneous fluid (suspension) over a
smooth inclined surface were studied. It was observed that for inclination
angle larger than a threshold, global fractal patterns are formed. The fractal
dimensions of these patterns were measured df=1.35-1.45 which corresponds to
that observed for the flow of water over an inhomogeneous surface, implying
that this system is within the same universality class. Except that here the
disorder is present in the fluid and is transferred to the surface. This
observation is in agreement with the result of the theories of nonlinear flow
of fluid in disordered media.
