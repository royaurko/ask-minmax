Creep experiments on polycrystalline surfactant hexagonal columnar phases
show a power law regime, followed by a drastic fluidization before reaching a
final stationary flow. The scaling of the fluidization time with the shear
modulus of the sample and stress applied suggests that the onset of flow
involves a bulk reorganization of the material. This is confirmed by X-ray
scattering under stress coupled to \textit{in situ} rheology experiments, which
show a collective reorientation of all crystallites at the onset of flow. The
analogy with the fracture of heterogeneous materials is discussed.
