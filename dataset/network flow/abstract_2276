This paper studies the combinatorial Yamabe flow on hyperbolic surfaces with
boundary. It is proved by applying a variational principle that the length of
boundary components is uniquely determined by the combinatorial conformal
factor. The combinatorial Yamabe flow is a gradient flow of a concave function.
The long time behavior of the flow and the geometric meaning is investigated.
