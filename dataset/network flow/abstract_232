We consider combustion problems in the presence of complex chemistry and
nonlinear diffusion laws leading to fully nonlinear multispecies
reaction-diffusion equations. We establish results of existence of solution and
maximum principle, i.e. positivity of the mass fractions, which rely on
specific properties of the models. The nonlinear diffusion coefficients are
obtained by resolution of the so-called Stefan-Maxwell equations.
