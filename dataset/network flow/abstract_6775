We study steady, homogeneous and subsonic cooling flows in poor clusters of
galaxies in light of the recent proposal that radiative cooling of the
intracluster gas can explain the observations of the `entropy floor' and other
related X-ray observations. We study a family of cooling flow solutions
parameterized by the mass flux rate, and then determine the resulting entropy
and the X-ray luminosity. We find that cooling flows with mass flux rates in
excess of 1000 M_{solar} per yr are required to explain the observations of
entropy and X-ray luminosity. In view of the observed lack of such large flows
in rich clusters, our calculations suggest that heating sources are needed, in
addition to the effect of radiative cooling, to explain the observations.
