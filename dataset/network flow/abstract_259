In this paper we consider the Cauchy problem for the 3D Navier-Stokes
equations for incompressible flows. The initial data are assumed to be smooth
and rapidly decaying at infinity. A famous open problem is whether classical
solutions can develop singularities in finite time. Assuming the maximum
interval of existence to be finite, we give a unified discussion of various
known solution properties as time approaches the blow-up time.
