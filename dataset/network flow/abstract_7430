The dynamics of a system quenched into a state with lamellar order and
subject to an uniform shear flow is solved in the large-N limit. The
description is based on the Brazovskii free-energy and the evolution follows a
convection-diffusion equation. Lamellae order preferentially with the normal
along the vorticity direction. Typical lengths grow as $\gamma t^{5/4}$ (with
logarithmic corrections) in the flow direction and logarithmically in the shear
direction. Dynamical scaling holds in the two-dimensional case while it is
violated in D=3.
