An exact solution of the transient dynamics for a sequential associative
memory model is discussed through both the path-integral method and the
statistical neurodynamics. Although the path-integral method has the ability to
give an exact solution of the transient dynamics, only stationary properties
have been discussed for the sequential associative memory. We have succeeded in
deriving an exact macroscopic description of the transient dynamics by
analyzing the correlation of crosstalk noise. Surprisingly, the order parameter
equations of this exact solution are completely equivalent to those of the
statistical neurodynamics, which is an approximation theory that assumes
crosstalk noise to obey the Gaussian distribution. In order to examine our
theoretical findings, we numerically obtain cumulants of the crosstalk noise.
We verify that the third- and fourth-order cumulants are equal to zero, and
that the crosstalk noise is normally distributed even in the non-retrieval
case. We show that the results obtained by our theory agree with those obtained
by computer simulations. We have also found that the macroscopic unstable state
completely coincides with the separatrix.
