A model for growing networks is introduced, having as a main ingredient that
new nodes are attached to the network through one existing node and then
explore the network through the links of the visited nodes. From exact
calculations of two limiting cases and numerical simulations the phase diagram
of the model is obtained. In the stationary limit, large network sizes, a phase
transition from a network with finite average connectivity to a network with a
power law distribution of connectivities, with no finite average, is found.
Results are compared with measurements on real networks.
