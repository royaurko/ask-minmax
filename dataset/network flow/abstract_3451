The structure of complex networks in previous research has been widely
described as scale-free networks generated by the preferential attachment
model. However, the preferential attachment model does not take into account
the detailed topological property observed in real networks. Here we propose
the models of scale-free networks which can reproduce the topological
assortativity of real networks. With an identical degree distribution and
network size, we study the structural robustness and fragility as well as the
dynamic change of load intensity when nodes are successively removed under
random and various intentional attack strategies. We find that disassortative
networks are structurally robust against random attacks and highly
load-tolerant, while assortative networks are most resistant to intentional
attacks yet significantly fragile against random attacks.
