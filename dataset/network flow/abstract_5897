Vehicular sensor networks (VSNs) are built on top of vehicular ad-hoc
networks (VANETs) by equipping vehicles with sensing devices. These new
technologies create a huge opportunity to extend the sensing capabilities of
the existing road traffic control systems and improve their performance.
Efficient utilisation of wireless communication channel is one of the basic
issues in the vehicular networks development. This paper presents and evaluates
data collection algorithms that use uncertainty estimates to reduce data
transmission in a VSN-based road traffic control system.
