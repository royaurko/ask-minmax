We investigate the thermal stability of the outer layers of accretion discs
in which the local viscous energy dissipation rate scales with the pressure as
for standard Shakura-Sunyaev discs. By solving for the accretion disc vertical
structure using the grey two-stream approximation, we show that the thermal
structure of the optically thin outer layers is in first approximation
independent from radiative transfer effects. We then calculate this thermal
structure using the detailed photoionisation code MAPPINGS, including the
effects of an external radiation field from the centre of the accretion flow.
We apply our method to cataclysmic variable (CV), and stellar mass black hole
discs. We find that in the case of CV's, the mass evaporation rate from the
disc due to the thermal instability is not likely to be significant compared to
the mass flow through the disc. In the case of black hole discs, the very
strong irradiation can drive significant evaporation if the mas accretion rate
is low, less than 10^16 g/sec.
