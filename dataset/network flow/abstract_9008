We introduce and define the concept of a stochastic pooling network (SPN), as
a model for sensor systems where redundancy and two forms of 'noise' -- lossy
compression and randomness -- interact in surprising ways. Our approach to
analyzing SPNs is information theoretic. We define an SPN as a network with
multiple nodes that each produce noisy and compressed measurements of the same
information. An SPN must combine all these measurements into a single further
compressed network output, in a way dictated solely by naturally occurring
physical properties -- i.e. pooling -- and yet causes no (or negligible)
reduction in mutual information. This means SPNs exhibit redundancy reduction
as an emergent property of pooling. The SPN concept is applicable to examples
in biological neural coding, nano-electronics, distributed sensor networks,
digital beamforming arrays, image processing, multiaccess communication
networks and social networks. In most cases the randomness is assumed to be
unavoidably present rather than deliberately introduced. We illustrate the
central properties of SPNs for several case studies, where pooling occurs by
summation, including nodes that are noisy scalar quantizers, and nodes with
conditionally Poisson statistics. Other emergent properties of SPNs and some
unsolved problems are also briefly discussed.
