The `no-slip' is a fundamental assumption and generally-accepted boundary
condition in rheology, tribology and fluid mechanics with strong experimental
support. The violations of this condition, however, are widely recognized in
many situations, especially in the flow of non-Newtonian fluids. Wall slip
could lead to large errors and flow instabilities, such as sharkskin formation
and spurt flow, and hence complicates the analysis of fluid systems and
introduces serious practical difficulties. In this article, we discuss slip at
fluid-solid interface in an attempt to highlight the main issues related to
this diverse complex phenomenon and its implications.
