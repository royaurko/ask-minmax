The equivalence of two optimality principles leading to Murray's law has been
discussed. The first approach is based on minimization of biological work
needed for maintaining the blood flow through the vessels at required level.
The second one is the principle of minimal drag and lumen volume.
Characteristic features of these principles are considered. An alternative
approach leading to Murray's law has been proposed. For that we model the
microcirculatory bed in terms of delivering vascular network with symmetrical
bifurcation nodes, embedded uniformly into the cellular tissue. It was shown
that Murray's law can be regarded as a direct consequence of the organism
capacity for controlling the blood flow redistribution over the
microcirculatory beds.
