We present an Asymptotic-Preserving 'all-speed' scheme for the simulation of
compressible flows valid at all Mach-numbers ranging from very small to order
unity. The scheme is based on a semi-implicit discretization which treats the
acoustic part implicitly and the convective and diffusive parts explicitly.
This discretization, which is the key to the Asymptotic-Preserving property,
provides a consistent approximation of both the hyperbolic compressible regime
and the elliptic incompressible regime. The divergence-free condition on the
velocity in the incompressible regime is respected, and an the pressure is
computed via an elliptic equation resulting from a suitable combination of the
momentum and energy equations. The implicit treatment of the acoustic part
allows the time-step to be independent of the Mach number. The scheme is
conservative and applies to steady or unsteady flows and to general equations
of state. One and Two-dimensional numerical results provide a validation of the
Asymptotic-Preserving 'all-speed' properties.
