Todays mobile networks contain an increasing variety of proprietary hardware
stifling innovation and leading to longer time-to-market for introduction of
new services. We propose to replace the mobile core network nodes and
interfaces with an Open Source SW implementation running on general purpose
commodity hardware. The proposed open source approach referred to as software
defined access (SoDA) is expected to reduce cost, increase flexibility, improve
innovation speed and accelerate time-to-market for introduction of new features
and functionalities. A common Open Source SW framework will also enable
automatic discovery and selection, seamless data mobility as well as unified
charging and billing across cellular, Wi-Fi, UAV and satellite access networks.
