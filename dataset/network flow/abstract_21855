The rather complete data set of hadron yields from central Si + A collisions
at the Brookhaven AGS is used to test whether the system at freeze-out is in
thermal and hadro-chemical equilibrium. Rapidity and transverse momentum
distributions are discussed with regards to the information they provide on
hydrodynamic flow.
