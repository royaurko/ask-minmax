We investigate the properties of Josephson junction networks with
inhomogeneous architecture. The networks are shaped as "quare comb" planar
lattices on which Josephson junctions link superconducting islands arranged in
the plane to generate the pertinent topology. Compared to the behavior of
reference linear arrays, the temperature dependencies of the Josephson currents
of the branches of the network exhibit relevant differences. The observed
phenomena evidence new and surprising behavior of superconducting Josephson
arrays as well as remarkable similarities with bosonic junction arrays.
