We analyze the performance of TCP and TCP with network coding (TCP/NC) in
lossy wireless networks. We build upon the simple framework introduced by
Padhye et al. and characterize the throughput behavior of classical TCP as well
as TCP/NC as a function of erasure rate, round-trip time, maximum window size,
and duration of the connection. Our analytical results show that network coding
masks erasures and losses from TCP, thus preventing TCP's performance
degradation in lossy networks, such as wireless networks. It is further seen
that TCP/NC has significant throughput gains over TCP. In addition, we simulate
TCP and TCP/NC to verify our analysis of the average throughput and the window
evolution. Our analysis and simulation results show very close concordance and
support that TCP/NC is robust against erasures. TCP/NC is not only able to
increase its window size faster but also to maintain a large window size
despite losses within the network, whereas TCP experiences window closing
essentially because losses are mistakenly attributed to congestion.
