We study a network model of two conductance-based pacemaker neurons of
differing natural frequency, coupled with either mutual excitation or
inhibition, and receiving shared random inhibitory synaptic input. The networks
may phase-lock spike-to-spike for strong mutual coupling. But the shared input
can desynchronize the locked spike-pairs by selectively eliminating the lagging
spike or modulating its timing with respect to the leading spike depending on
their separation time window. Such loss of synchrony is also found in a large
network of sparsely coupled heterogeneous spiking neurons receiving shared
input.
