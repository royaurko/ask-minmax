Using a multiphase transport model that includes both initial partonic and
final hadronic scatterings, we have studied higher-order anisotropic flows as
well as dihadron correlations as functions of pseudorapidity and azimuthal
angular differences between trigger and associated particles in Pb-Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. With parameters in the model determined
previously from fitting the measured multiplicity density of mid-pseudorapidity
charged particles in central collisions and their elliptic flow in mid-central
collisions, the calculated higher-order anisotropic flows from the two-particle
cumulant method reproduce approximately those measured by the ALICE
Collaboration, except at small centralities where they are slightly
overestimated. Similar to experimental results, the two-dimensional dihadron
correlations at most central collisions show a ridge structure at the near side
and a broad structure at the away side. The short- and long-range dihadron
azimuthal correlations, corresponding to small and large pseudorapidity
differences, respectively, are studied for triggering particles with different
transverse momenta and are found to be qualitatively consistent with
experimental results from the CMS Collaboration. The relation between the
short-range and long-range dihadron correlations with that induced by
back-to-back jet pairs produced from initial hard collisions is also discussed.
