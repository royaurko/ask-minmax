Accretion flows may produce profuse winds when they have positive specific
energy. Winds deplete matter from the inner region of the disk and makes the
inner region thinner, optically. Since there are fewer electrons in this
region, it becomes easier to Comptonize this part by the soft photons which are
intercepted from the Keplerian disk farther out. We present a self-consistent
picture of winds from an accretion disk and show how the spectra of the disk is
softened due to the outflowing wind.
