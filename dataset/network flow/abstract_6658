Heterogeneous networks have a key role in the design of future mobile
communication networks, since the employment of small cells around a macrocell
enhances the network's efficiency and decreases complexity and power demand.
Moreover, research on Blind Interference Alignment (BIA) has shown that optimal
Degrees of Freedom (DoF) can be achieved in certain network architectures, with
no requirement of Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitters. Our
contribution is a generalised model of BIA in a heterogeneous network with one
macrocell with K users and K femtocells each with one user, by using Kronecker
(Tensor) Product representation. We introduce a solution on how to vary
beamforming vectors under power constraints to maximize the sum rate of the
network and how optimal DoF can be achieved over K+1 time slots.
