The separation of the source created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion
collisions into a thermalized dense core and an outer mantle consisting of
independent nucleon-nucleon collisions is discussed. Evidence for such a two
component picture is found in transverse mass spectra of kaon, protons and
antiprotons produced in Au-Au collisions at 200GeV. Estimates of the sizes of
the thermal and direct sources are compared to models separating the
interaction zone into a core and a corona, according to the density of
participants or to the number of collisions. Consequences for the modeling of
the dynamics of the small size, thermalized core are described. New initial
conditions corresponding to the dense core lead to a stronger azimuthal
asymmetry of the hydrodynamically expanding fireball, pressure gradients also
increase. 2+1-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations are presented starting from
all the matter in the interaction region or from the dense, thermal part of the
source. We find faster transverse expansion and stronger elliptic flow for
dense core initial conditions. For different impact parameters we find very
similar spectra of the thermal part of the source and only adding particles
emitted directly from nucleon-nucleon collisions in the corona the
experimentally observed softening of the spectra with increasing impact
parameter is reproduced. The elliptic flow is stronger for particles emitted
from a source separated into a core and a corona.
