We obtain hydrodynamic equations describing a fluid consisting of chiral
molecules or a suspension of chiral particles in a Newtonian fluid. The
stresses arising in a flowing chiral liquid have a component forbidden by
symmetry in a Newtonian liquid. For example, a chiral liquid in a Poiseuille
flow between parallel plates exerts forces on the plates, which are
perpendicular to the flow. A generic flow results in spatial separation of
particles of different chirality. Thus even a racemic suspension will exhibit
chiral properties in a generic flow. A suspension of particles of random shape
in a Newtonian liquid is described by equations which are similar to those
describing a racemic mixture of chiral particles in a liquid.
