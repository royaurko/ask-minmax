We investigate the consequences of fluid flowing on a continuous surface upon
the geometric and statistical distribution of the flow. We find that the
ability of a surface to collect water by its mere geometrical shape is
proportional to the curvature of the contour line divided by the local slope.
Consequently, rivers tend to lie in locations of high curvature and flat
slopes. Gaussian surfaces are introduced as a model of random topography. For
Gaussian surfaces the relation between convergence and slope is obtained
analytically. The convergence of flow lines correlates positively with drainage
area, so that lower slopes are associated with larger basins. As a consequence,
we explain the observed relation between the local slope of a landscape and the
area of the drainage basin geometrically. To some extent, the slope-area
relation comes about not because of fluvial erosion of the landscape, but
because of the way rivers choose their path. Our results are supported by
numerically generated surfaces as well as by real landscapes.
