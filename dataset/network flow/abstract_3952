This paper describes a mechanism for content distribution through
opportunistic contacts between subscribers. A subset of subscribers in the
network are seeded with the content. The remaining subscribers obtain the
information through opportunistic contact with a user carrying the updated
content. We study how the rate of content retrieval by subscribers is affected
by the number of initial seeders in the network. We also study the rate of
content retrieval by the subscribers under coding strategies (Network Coding,
Erasure Coding) and under Flooding, Epidemic Routing.
