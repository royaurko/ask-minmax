We consider methods for quantifying the similarity of vertices in networks.
We propose a measure of similarity based on the concept that two vertices are
similar if their immediate neighbors in the network are themselves similar.
This leads to a self-consistent matrix formulation of similarity that can be
evaluated iteratively using only a knowledge of the adjacency matrix of the
network. We test our similarity measure on computer-generated networks for
which the expected results are known, and on a number of real-world networks.
