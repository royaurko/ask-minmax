We present observations of the quiet solar photosphere in the \ion{Fe}{1}
lines at 6302 \AA where at least four different spatial locations exhibit
upwards-directed supersonic flows. These upflows can only be detected in the
circular polarization profiles as a double-peaked structure in the blue lobe of
both \ion{Fe}{1} lines. We have detected cases of either magnetic polarity in
the data. The polarization signals associated with the upflows are very weak,
which is probably why they had not been seen before in this type of
observations. We propose that the observed flows are the signature of aborted
convective collapse, similar to the case reported by \citeN{BRRHC+01}. Our data
indicates that this phenomenon occurs frequently in the quiet Sun, which means
that many magnetic elements (although the fraction is still unknown) are
destroyed even before they are formed completely. The spectral signatures of
supersonic upflows reported here are probably present in most
spectro-polarimetric observations of sufficient signal-to-noise and spatial
resolution.
