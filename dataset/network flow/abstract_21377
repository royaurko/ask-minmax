We study a cosmological scenario for gamma ray bursts (GRBs) where
relativistic flows interact with dense radiation fields. It is shown that this
scenario is plausible in very dense stellar regions which are known to exist in
collapsed cores of globular clusters or dense nuclei of galaxies. It yields a
correct quantitative description of the temporal behavior of GRBs. Several
other properties of GRBs are easily explained.
