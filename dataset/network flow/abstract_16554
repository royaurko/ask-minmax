We investigate the structure and dynamics of sodium disilicate by means of
molecular dynamics computer simulation. We show that the structure is described
by a partially destroyed tetrahedral SiO_4 network and a spherical super
structure formed by the silicon and sodium atoms. The static structure factor
of our simulation is in very good agreement with one from a neutron scattering
experiment. For 1008 particles we find strong finite size effects in the
dynamics which are due to the missing of modes contributing to the boson peak.
