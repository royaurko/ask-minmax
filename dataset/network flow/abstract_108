A theory to predict the steady state position of a dissipative,
flow-controlled system, as defined by a control volume, is developed based on
the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principle of Jaynes, involving minimisation of a
generalised free energy-like potential. The analysis provides a theoretical
justification of a local, conditional form of the Maximum Entropy Production
(MEP) principle, which successfully predicts the observable properties of many
such systems. The analysis reveals a very different manifestation of the second
law of thermodynamics in steady state flow systems, which {provides a driving
force for} the formation of complex systems, including life.
