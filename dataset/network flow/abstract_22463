We consider the relation between the \Omega -deformed N=2 SQCD with the
single deformation parameter and integrable models of the BCS-like
superconductivity. It is argued that the vortex string worldsheet theory is
related to the Russian Doll(RD) model of the truncated BCS superconductivity.
We argue that the \Omega -deformed gauge theory manifests the interesting
cyclic RG behavior with the period of the RG cycle proportional to
\epsilon^{-1}. The deformed gauge theory can develop several non-perturbative
scales. We conjecture on the monopole bound state interpretation of the Efimov
tower.
