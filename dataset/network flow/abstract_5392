We generalize the degree-organizational view of real-world networks with
broad degree-distributions in a landscape analogue with mountains (high-degree
nodes) and valleys (low-degree nodes). For example, correlated degrees between
adjacent nodes corresponds to smooth landscapes (social networks), hierarchical
networks to one-mountain landscapes (the Internet), and degree-disassortative
networks without hierarchical features to rough landscapes with several
mountains. We also generate ridge landscapes to model networks organized under
constraints imposed by the space the networks are embedded in, associated to
spatial or, in molecular networks, to functional localization. To quantify the
topology, we here measure the widths of the mountains and the separation
between different mountains.
