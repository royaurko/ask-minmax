Graph-based algorithms for point-to-point link scheduling in Spatial reuse
Time Division Multiple Access (STDMA) wireless ad hoc networks often result in
a significant number of transmissions having low Signal to Interference and
Noise density Ratio (SINR) at intended receivers, leading to low throughput. To
overcome this problem, we propose a new algorithm for STDMA link scheduling
based on a graph model of the network as well as SINR computations. The
performance of our algorithm is evaluated in terms of spatial reuse and
computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm
achieves better performance than existing algorithms.
