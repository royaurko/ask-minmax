We consider a setting in which a sender wishes to broadcast a block of K data
packets to a set of wireless receivers, where each of the receivers has a
subset of the data packets already available to it (e.g., from prior
transmissions) and wants the rest of the packets. Our goal is to find a linear
network coding scheme that yields the minimum average packet decoding delay
(APDD), i.e., the average time it takes for a receiver to decode a data packet.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we prove that this
problem is NP-hard by presenting a reduction from the hypergraph coloring
problem. Next, we show that %\alexn{an MDS-based solution or} a random linear
network coding (RLNC) provides an approximate solution to this problem with
approximation ratio $2$ with high probability. Next, we present a methodology
for designing specialized approximation algorithms for this problem that
outperform RLNC solutions while maintaining the same throughput. In a special
case of practical interest with a small number of wanted packets our solution
can achieve an approximation ratio (4-2/K)/3. Finally, we conduct an
experimental study that demonstrates the advantages of the presented
methodology.
