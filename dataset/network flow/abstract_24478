In wireless local area networks (WLANs), a media access protocol arbitrates
access to the channel. In current IEEE 802.11 WLANs, carrier sense multiple
access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is used. Carrier sense multiple
access with enhanced collision avoidance (CSMA/ECA) is a subtle variant of the
well-known CSMA/CA algorithm that offers substantial performance benefits.
CSMA/ECA significantly reduces the collision probability and, under certain
conditions, leads to a completely collision-free schedule. The only difference
between CSMA/CA and CSMA/ECA is that the latter uses a deterministic backoff
after successful transmissions. This deterministic backoff is a constant and is
the same for all the stations.
  The first part of the paper is of tutorial nature, offering an introduction
to the basic operation of CSMA/ECA and describing the benefits of this approach
in a qualitative manner. The second part of the paper surveys related
contributions, briefly summarizing the main challenges and potential solutions,
and also introducing variants and derivatives of CSMA/ECA.
