The visual cue of optical flow plays a major role in the navigation of flying
insects, and is increasingly studied for use by small flying robots as well. A
major problem is that successful optical flow control seems to require distance
estimates, while optical flow is known to provide only the ratio of velocity to
distance. In this article, a novel, stability-based strategy is proposed to
estimate distances with monocular optical flow and knowledge of the control
inputs (efference copies). It is shown analytically that given a fixed control
gain, the stability of a constant divergence control loop only depends on the
distance to the approached surface. At close distances, the control loop first
starts to exhibit self-induced oscillations, eventually leading to instability.
The proposed stability-based strategy for estimating distances has two major
attractive characteristics. First, self-induced oscillations are easy for the
robot to detect and are hardly influenced by wind. Second, the distance can be
estimated during a zero divergence maneuver, i.e., around hover. The
stability-based strategy is implemented and tested both in simulation and with
a Parrot AR drone 2.0. It is shown that it can be used to: (1) trigger a final
approach response during a constant divergence landing with fixed gain, (2)
estimate the distance in hover, and (3) estimate distances during an entire
landing if the robot uses adaptive gain control to continuously stay on the
'edge of oscillation'.
