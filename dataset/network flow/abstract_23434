We have employed feedforward neural networks trained on synthetic spectra in
the range 3800 to 5600 AA with resolutions of 2-3 AA to determine metallicities
from spectra of about 1000 main-sequence turn-off, subgiant and red giant stars
in the globular clusters M55 and omega Cen. The overall metallicity accuracies
are of the order of 0.15 to 0.2 dex. In addition, we tested how well the
stellar parameters logg and Teff can be retrieved from such data without
additional colour or photometric information. We find overall uncertainties of
0.3 to 0.4 dex for logg and 140 to 190 K for Teff. In order to obtain some
measure of uncertainty for the determined values of [Fe/H], logg and Teff, we
applied the bootstrap method for the first time to neural networks for this
kind of parametrization problem. The distribution of metallicities for stars in
omega Cen clearly shows a large spread in agreement with the well known
multiple stellar populations in this cluster.
