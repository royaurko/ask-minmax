Mixing fluid in a container at low Reynolds number - in an inertialess
environment - is not a trivial task. Reciprocating motions merely lead to
cycles of mixing and unmixing, so continuous rotation, as used in many
technological applications, would appear to be necessary. However, there is
another solution: movement of the walls in a cyclical fashion to introduce a
geometric phase that avoids unmixing. We show using journal-bearing flow as a
model that such geometric mixing is a general tool for using deformable
boundaries that return to the same position to mix fluid at low Reynolds
number.
