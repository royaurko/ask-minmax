In this paper we continue our studies of the one dimensional conformal metric
flows, which were introduced in [8]. In this part we mainly focus on evolution
equations involving fourth order derivatives. The global existence and
exponential convergence of metrics for the 1-Q and 4-Q flows are obtained.
