The jet in 3C273 is a high-power quasar jet with radio, optical and X-ray
emission whose size and brightness allow a detailed study of the emission
processes acting in it. We present deep Chandra observations of this jet and
analyse the spectral properties of the jet emission from radio through X-rays.
We find that the X-ray spectra are significantly softer than the radio spectra
in all regions of the bright part of the jet except for the first bright "knot
A", ruling out a model in which the X-ray emission from the entire jet arises
from beamed inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons
in a single-zone jet flow. Within two-zone jet models, we find that a
synchrotron origin for the jet's X-rays requires fewer additional assumptions
than an inverse-Compton model, especially if velocity shear leads to efficient
particle acceleration in jet flows.
