We present the first results of simulations of giant polar plumes and coronal
flows. We use a 2.5D axisymmetric MHD numerical model of an isothermal corona
and slow solar wind. A plume is generated just above asmall magnetic bipole
embedded in an unipolar flux region which is perturbed by Alfv\'en waves
injected from the coronal base. The boundary conditions are transparent. The
results are compared to those obtained previously with a 1D wind model in which
plumes are generated as a consequence of variations of the heating and
flux-tube expansion parameters.
