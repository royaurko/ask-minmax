This paper presents combinatorial spectral clustering, a simple spectral
algorithm designed to identify overlapping communities in networks. The
algorithm is based on geometric properties of the spectrum of the expected
adjacency matrix in a random graph model that we call stochastic blockmodel
with overlap (SBMO). An adaptive version of the algorithm, that does not
require the knowledge of the number of hidden communities, is proved to be
consistent under the SBMO when the degrees in the graph are (slightly more
than) logarithmic. The algorithm is shown to perform well on simulated data and
on real-world graphs with known overlapping communities.
