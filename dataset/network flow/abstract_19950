In this review, we report recent developments on the shear-induced
transitions and instabilities found in surfactant wormlike micelles. The survey
focuses on the non-linear shear rheology and covers a broad range of surfactant
concentrations, from the dilute to the liquid-crystalline states and including
the semi-dilute and concentrated regimes. Based on a systematic analysis of
many surfactant systems, the present approach aims to identify the essential
features of the transitions. It is suggested that these features define classes
of behaviors. The review describes three types of transitions and/or
instabilities : the shear-thickening found in the dilute regime, the
shear-banding which is linked in some systems to the isotropic-to-nematic
transition, and the flow-aligning and tumbling instabilities characteristic of
nematic structures. In these three classes of behaviors, the shear-induced
transitions are the result of a coupling between the internal structure of the
fluid and the flow, resulting in a new mesoscopic organization under shear.
This survey finally highlights the potential use of wormlike micelles as model
systems for complex fluids and for applications.
