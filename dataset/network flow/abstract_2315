From covariant transport theory, a significant ~10% light quark elliptic flow
at RHIC implies an elliptic flow of similar magnitude for charm quarks, at
moderately large pT > 2.5 - 3 GeV. At lower transverse momenta, charm quark
elliptic flow reduces progressively, reminiscent of the mass ordering pattern
in ideal hydrodynamics. From the quark flows we predict the elliptic flow of D
mesons at RHIC via quark coalescence. The large parton opacities needed to
generate the light quark flow also lead to substantial ~40-50% secondary charm
production.
