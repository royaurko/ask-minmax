We study the random walk problem on a class of deterministic Scale-Free
networks displaying a degree sequence for hubs scaling as a power law with an
exponent $\gamma=\log 3/\log2$. We find exact results concerning different
first-passage phenomena and, in particular, we calculate the probability of
first return to the main hub. These results allow to derive the exact analytic
expression for the mean time to first reach the main hub, whose leading
behavior is given by $\tau \sim V^{1-1/\gamma}$, where $V$ denotes the size of
the structure, and the mean is over a set of starting points distributed
uniformly over all the other sites of the graph. Interestingly, the process
turns out to be particularly efficient. We also discuss the thermodynamic limit
of the structure and some local topological properties.
