Optimization based spectrum sharing strategies have been widely studied.
However, these strategies usually require a great amount of real-time
computation and significant signaling delay, and thus are hard to be fulfilled
in practical scenarios. This paper investigates optimal real-time spectrum
sharing between a cooperative relay network (CRN) and a nearby ad-hoc network.
Specifically, we optimize the spectrum access and resource allocation
strategies of the CRN so that the average traffic collision time between the
two networks can be minimized while maintaining a required throughput for the
CRN. The development is first for a frame-level setting, and then is extended
to an ergodic setting. For the latter setting, we propose an appealing optimal
real-time spectrum sharing strategy via Lagrangian dual optimization. The
proposed method only involves a small amount of real-time computation and
negligible control delay, and thus is suitable for practical implementations.
Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
strategies.
