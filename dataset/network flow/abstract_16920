Iterative rounding and relaxation have arguably become the method of choice
in dealing with unconstrained and constrained network design problems. In this
paper we extend the scope of the iterative relaxation method in two directions:
(1) by handling more complex degree constraints in the minimum spanning tree
problem (namely, laminar crossing spanning tree), and (2) by incorporating
`degree bounds' in other combinatorial optimization problems such as matroid
intersection and lattice polyhedra. We give new or improved approximation
algorithms, hardness results, and integrality gaps for these problems.
