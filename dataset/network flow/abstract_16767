Research studies have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of
Network-on-Chip (NoC) over traditional bus-based architectures but have not
focused on compatibility communication standards. This paper describes a number
of issues faced when designing a VC-neutral NoC, i.e. compatible with standards
such as AHB 2.0, AXI, VCI, OCP, and various other proprietary protocols, and
how a layered approach to communication helps solve these issues.
