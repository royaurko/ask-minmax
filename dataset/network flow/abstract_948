We analyze TCP-controlled bulk file transfers in a single station (STA) WLAN
with nonzero propagation delay between the file server and the WLAN. Our
approach is to model the flow of packets as a closed queueing network (BCMP
network) with 3 service centres, one each for the Access Point (AP) and the
STA, and the third for the propagation delay. The service rates of the first
two are obtained by analyzing the WLAN MAC. Simulations show a very close match
with the theory.
