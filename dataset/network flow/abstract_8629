Randomized experiments on social networks are a trending research topic. Such
experiments pose statistical challenges due to the possibility of interference
between units. We propose a new method for estimating attributable treatment
effects under interference. The method does not require partial interference,
but instead uses an identifying assumption that is similar to requiring
nonnegative treatment effects. Observed pre-treatment social network
information can be used to customize the test statistic, so as to increase
power without making assumptions on the data generating process. The inversion
of the test statistic is a combinatorial optimization problem which has a
tractable relaxation, yielding conservative estimates of the attributable
effect.
