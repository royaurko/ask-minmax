The additional symmetries of the constrained CKP (cCKP) and BKP (cBKP)
hierarchies are given by their actions on the Lax operators, and their actions
on the eigenfunction and adjoint eigenfunction $\{\Phi_i,\Psi_i \}$ are
presented explicitly. Furthermore, we show that acting on the space of the wave
operator, $\partial_k^*$ forms new centerless $W^{cC}_{1+\infty}$ and
$W^{cB}_{1+\infty}$-subalgebra of centerless $W_{1+\infty}$ respectively. In
order to define above symmetry flows $\partial_k^*$ of the cCKP and cBKP
hierarchies, two vital operators $Y_k$ are introduced to revise the additional
symmetry flows of the CKP and BKP hierarchies.
