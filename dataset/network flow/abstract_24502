Conventional block-based multicast authentication schemes overlook the
heterogeneity of receivers by letting the sender choose the block size, divide
a multicast stream into blocks, associate each block with a signature, and
spread the e?ect of the signature across all the packets in the block through
hash graphs or coding algorithms. The correlation among packets makes them
vulnerable to packet loss, which is inherent in the Internet and wireless
networks. Moreover, the lack of Denial of Service (DoS) resilience renders most
of them vulnerable to packet injection in hostile environments. In this paper,
we propose a novel multicast authentication protocol, namely MABS, including
two schemes. The basic scheme (MABS-B) eliminates the correlation among packets
and thus provides the perfect resilience to packet loss, and it is also e?cient
in terms of latency, computation, and communication overhead due to an e?cient
cryptographic primitive called batch signature, which supports the
authentication of any number of packets simultaneously.so we discuss their
comparisons and performance evaluation of Packet Loss, Comparisons over Lossy
Channels, Comparisons of Signature Schemes, computationational overheads etc.
