Real-world social and economic networks typically display a number of
particular topological properties, such as a giant connected component, a broad
degree distribution, the small-world property and the presence of communities
of densely interconnected nodes. Several models, including ensembles of
networks also known in social science as Exponential Random Graphs, have been
proposed with the aim of reproducing each of these properties in isolation.
Here we define a generalized ensemble of graphs by introducing the concept of
graph temperature, controlling the degree of topological optimization of a
network. We consider the temperature-dependent version of both existing and
novel models and show that all the aforementioned topological properties can be
simultaneously understood as the natural outcomes of an optimized,
low-temperature topology. We also show that seemingly different graph models,
as well as techniques used to extract information from real networks, are all
found to be particular low-temperature cases of the same generalized formalism.
One such technique allows us to extend our approach to real weighted networks.
Our results suggest that a low graph temperature might be an ubiquitous
property of real socio-economic networks, placing conditions on the diffusion
of information across these systems.
