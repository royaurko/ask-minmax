Through a complex shift of the time coordinate, a modification of Bjorken
flow is introduced which interpolates between a glasma-like stress tensor at
forward rapidities and Bjorken-like hydrodynamics around mid-rapidity. A
Landau-like full-stopping regime is found at early times and rapidities not too
large. Approximate agreement with BRAHMS data on the rapidity distribution of
produced particles at top RHIC energies can be achieved if the complex shift of
the time coordinate is comparable to the inverse of the saturation scale. The
form of the stress tensor follows essentially from symmetry considerations, and
it can be expressed in closed form.
