We report new results on $v_2(p_T)$ for Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV for charged hadrons, pions, kaons, (anti)protons,
$K^0_s$, and $\Lambda$. The analysis is extended to $p_T=12$ GeV/c for charged
hadrons and $p_T=4$ GeV/c for identified particles. A comparison of the
azimuthal anisotropy of charged hadrons measured at \sqrtsNN=130 and 200 GeV is
presented. The $p_T$-dependence of baryon versus meson elliptic flow is
discussed.
