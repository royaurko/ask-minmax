We report results of a three dimensional, high resolution (up to 512^3)
numerical investigation of supersonic compressible magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence. We consider both forced and decaying turbulence. The model
parameters are appropriate to conditions found in Galactic molecular clouds. We
find that the dissipation time of turbulence is of order the flow crossing time
or smaller, even in the presence of strong magnetic fields. About half the
dissipation occurs in shocks. Weak magnetic fields are amplified and tangled by
the turbulence, while strong fields remain well ordered.
