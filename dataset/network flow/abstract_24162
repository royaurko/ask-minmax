An efficient scheme for initial ranging has recently been proposed by X. Fu
et al. in the context of orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA)
networks based on the IEEE 802.16e-2005 standard. The proposed solution aims at
estimating the power levels and timing offsets of the ranging subscriber
stations (RSSs) without taking into account the effect of possible carrier
frequency offsets (CFOs) between the received signals and the base station
local reference. Motivated by the above problem, in the present work we design
a novel ranging scheme for OFDMA in which the ranging signals are assumed to be
misaligned both in time and frequency. Our goal is to estimate the timing
errors and CFOs of each active RSS. Specifically, CFO estimation is
accomplished by resorting to subspacebased methods while a least-squares
approach is employed for timing recovery. Computer simulations are used to
assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution and to make comparisons with
existing alternatives.
