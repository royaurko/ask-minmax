The Clair library is intended to simplify a number of generic tasks in
Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Network
Analysis. Its architecture also allows for external software to be plugged in
with very little effort. Functionality native to Clairlib includes
Tokenization, Summarization, LexRank, Biased LexRank, Document Clustering,
Document Indexing, PageRank, Biased PageRank, Web Graph Analysis, Network
Generation, Power Law Distribution Analysis, Network Analysis (clustering
coefficient, degree distribution plotting, average shortest path, diameter,
triangles, shortest path matrices, connected components), Cosine Similarity,
Random Walks on Graphs, Statistics (distributions, tests), Tf, Idf, Community
Finding.
