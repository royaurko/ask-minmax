We study strong solutions of the simplified Ericksen-Leslie system modeling
compressible nematic liquid crystal flows in a domain $\Omega \subset\mathbb
R^3$. We ?first prove the local existence of unique strong solutions provided
that the initial data $\rho_0, u_0, d_0$are sufficiently regular and satisfy a
natural compatibility condition. The initial density function $\rho_0$ may
vanish on an open subset (i.e., an initial vacuum may exist). We then prove a
criterion for possible breakdown of such a local strong solution at ?finite
time in terms of blow up of the quantities $\|\rho\|_{L^\infty_tL^\infty_x}$
and $\|\nabla d\|_{L^3_tL^\infty_x}$.
