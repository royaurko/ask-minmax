The spectral properties of the adjacency matrix provide a trove of
information about the structure and function of complex networks. In
particular, the largest eigenvalue and its associated principal eigenvector are
crucial in the understanding of node's centrality and the unfolding of
dynamical processes. Here we show that two distinct types of localization of
the principal eigenvector may occur in heterogeneous networks. For synthetic
networks with degree distribution $P(q) \sim q^{-\gamma}$, localization occurs
on the largest hub if $\gamma>5/2$; for $\gamma<5/2$ a new type of localization
arises on a mesoscopic subgraph associated to the shell with the largest index
in the $K$-core decomposition. Similar evidence for the existence of distinct
localization modes is found in the analysis of real-world networks. Our results
open a new perspective on dynamical processes on networks and on a recently
proposed alternative measure of node centrality based on the non-backtracking
matrix.
