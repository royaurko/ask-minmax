For a normal variety X defined over an algebraically closed field with an
action of the multiplicative group G_m, we consider the ``hyperbolic
localization'' functor from D^b(X) to D^b(X^T), which localizes using closed
supports in the directions flowing into the fixed points, and compact supports
in the directions flowing out. We show that the hyperbolic localization of the
intersection cohomology sheaf is a direct sum of intersection cohomology
sheaves.
