Each market has its singular characteristic. Its inner structure is directly
responsible for the observed distributions of returns though this fact is
widely overlooked. Big orders lead to doubling the tails. The behavior of a
market maker with many or few ``friends'' who can reliably loan money or stock
to him is quite different from the one without. After representing the inner
market ``case'' we suggest how to analyze its structure.
