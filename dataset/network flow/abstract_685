The dynamics of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic over Ethernet between
two computers are analyzed using nonlinear dynamics which shows that there are
two clear regimes in the data flow: free flow and saturated. The two most
important variables affecting this are the packet size and packet flow rate.
However, this transition is due to a transcritical bifurcation rather than
phase transition in models such as in vehicle traffic or theorized large-scale
computer network congestion. It is hoped this model will help lay the
groundwork for further research on the dynamics of networks, especially
computer networks.
