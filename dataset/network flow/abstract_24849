Using synchrotron powder diffraction the structure of a co-crystal between
benzene and ethane has been determined. The structure is remarkable, a lattice
of benzene molecules playing host to ethane molecules. This is demonstrated by
the similarity between the interactions found in the co-crystal structure and
those in the pure structure, showing that the C-H...{\pi} network of benzene is
maintained as a 'host' but expands to allow the ethane 'guest' to situate
within the channels that result from this network. The co-crystal is determined
to be a 3:1 benzene:ethane co-crystal and its structure is described by the
trigonal space group $R\bar{3}$ with a = 15.977(1) {\AA} and c = 5.581(1) {\AA}
at 90 K, resulting in a density of 1.067 g$\cdot$cm$^{-3}$. Conditions under
which this co-crystal forms indicate that it could readily be present on the
surface of Saturn's moon Titan as an evaporite deposit following the
evaporation of hydrocarbon fluids.
