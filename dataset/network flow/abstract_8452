The statistical tools of Complex Network Analysis are of great use to
understand salient properties of complex systems, may these be natural or
pertaining human engineered infrastructures. One of these that is receiving
growing attention for its societal relevance is that of electricity
distribution. In this paper, we present a survey of the most important
scientific studies investigating the properties of different Power Grids
infrastructures using Complex Network Analysis techniques and methodologies. We
categorize and explore the most relevant literature works considering general
topological properties, differences between the various graph-related
indicators and reliability aspects.
