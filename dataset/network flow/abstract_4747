This article deals with the flow of Newtonian fluids through
axially-symmetric corrugated tubes. An analytical method to derive the relation
between volumetric flow rate and pressure drop in laminar flow regimes is
presented and applied to a number of simple tube geometries of
converging-diverging nature. The method is general in terms of fluid and tube
shape within the previous restrictions. Moreover, it can be used as a basis for
numerical integration where analytical relations cannot be obtained due to
mathematical difficulties.
