Single-vehicle data of freeway traffic as well as selected Floating-Car (FC)
data are analyzed in great detail. Traffic states are distinguished by means of
aggregated data. We propose a method for a quantitative classification of these
states. The data of individual vehicles allows for insights into the
interaction of vehicles. The time-headway distribution reveals a characteristic
structure dominated by peaks and controlled by the underlying traffic states.
The tendency to reach a pleasant level of ``driving comfort'' gives rise to new
$v(\Delta x)$-diagrams, known as Optimal-Velocity (OV) curves. The insights
found at locally fixed detectors can be confirmed by FC data. In fundamental
diagrams derived from local measurements interesting high-flow states can be
observed.
