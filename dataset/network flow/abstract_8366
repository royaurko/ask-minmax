We model self-assembly of information in networks to investigate necessary
conditions for building a global perception of a system by local communication.
Our approach is to let agents chat in a model system to self-organize distant
communication-pathways. We demonstrate that simple local rules allow agents to
build a perception of the system, that is robust to dynamical changes and
mistakes. We find that messages are most effectively forwarded in the presence
of hubs, while transmission in hub-free networks is more robust against
misinformation and failures.
