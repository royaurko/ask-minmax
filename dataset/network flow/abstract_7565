A family of multi-value cellular automaton (CA) associated with traffic flow
is presented in this paper. The family is obtained by extending the rule-184
CA, which is an ultradiscrete analogue to the Burgers equation. CA models in
the family show both metastable states and stop-and-go waves, which are often
observed in real traffic flow. Metastable states in the models exist not only
on a prominent part of a free phase but also in a congested phase.
