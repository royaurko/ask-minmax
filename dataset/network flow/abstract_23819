I examine the consequences of modelling contagious influence in a social
network with incomplete edge information, namely in the situation where each
individual may name a limited number of friends, so that extra outbound ties
are censored. In particular, I consider a prototypical time series
configuration where a property of the "ego" is affected in a causal fashion by
the properties of their "alters" at a previous time point, both in the total
number of alters as well as the deviation from a central value. This is
considered with three potential methods for naming one's friends: a strict
upper limit on the number of declarations, a flexible limit, and an instruction
where a person names a prespecified fraction of their friends. I find that one
of two effects is present in the estimation of these effects: either that the
size of the effect is inflated in magnitude, or that the estimators instead are
centered about zero rather than related to the true effect. The degree of
heterogeneity in friend count is one of the major factors into whether such an
analysis can be salvaged by post-hoc adjustments.
