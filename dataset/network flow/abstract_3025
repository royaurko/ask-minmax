In this paper we report experiments where we shear granular rods in
split-bottom geometries, and find that a significant heap of height of least
40% of the filling height can form at the particle surface. We show that
heaping is caused by a significant secondary flow, absent for spherical
particles. Flow reversal transiently reverses the secondary flow, leading to a
quick collapse and slower regeneration of the heap. We present a symmetry
argument and experimental data that show that the generation of the secondary
flow is driven by a misalignment of the mean particle orientation with the
streamlines of the flow. This general mechanism is expected to be important in
all flows of sufficiently anisometric grains.
