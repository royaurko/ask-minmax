We propose a model coupling the classical opinion dynamics of the bounded
confidence model, proposed by Deffuant et al., with an adaptive network forming
a community or group structure. At each step, an individual can decide if it
changes groups or interact on its opinion with one of its internal or external
neighbour. If it decides to look at the group level, it changes groups if its
opinion is far from the average of its group from more than a threshold. If it
is the case, it joins the group which has proportionally the closest average
opinion from its. If it decides to interact with one of its neighbour, it
becomes closer in opinion to it when its opinion and the one of the
selected-to-interact neighbour are less distant from the threshold. From the
study of this coupled model, we discover some surprising behaviours compared to
the known behaviour of the Deffuant bounded confidence model(BC): The coupled
model exhibits a total consensus for an threshold value lower than the BC
model; the distribution of sizes of the groups changes: some groups become
larger while other decrease in size, sometimes until containing only one
individual; from the point of view of the groups, the consensus remains for a
large set of threshold values while, looking at the population level, there are
a lot of opinion clusters.
