We analyse a multiplex of networks between OECD countries during the decade
2002-2010, which consists of five financial layers, given by foreign direct
investment, equity securities, short-term, long-term and total debt securities,
and five environmental layers, given by emissions of N O x, P M 10 SO 2, CO 2
equivalent and the water footprint associated with international trade. We
present a new measure of cross-layer correlations between flows in different
layers based on reciprocity. For the assessment of results, we implement a null
model for this measure based on the exponential random graph theory. We find
that short-term financial flows are more correlated with environmental flows
than long-term investments. Moreover, the correlations between reverse
financial and environmental flows (i.e. flows of different layers going in
opposite directions) are generally stronger than correlations between synergic
flows (flows going in the same direction). This suggests a trade-off between
financial and environmental layers, where, more financialised countries display
higher correlations between outgoing financial flows and incoming environmental
flows from lower financialised countries, which could have important policy
implications. Five countries are identified as hubs in this finance-environment
multiplex: The United States, France, Germany, Belgium-Luxembourg and the
United Kingdom.
