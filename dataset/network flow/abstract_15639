In this paper we establish fundamental limits on the performance of knowledge
sharing in opportunistic social net- works. In particular, we introduce a novel
information-theoretic model to characterize the performance limits of knowledge
sharing policies. Towards this objective, we first introduce the notions of
knowledge gain and its upper bound, knowledge gain limit, per user. Second, we
characterize these quantities for a number of network topologies and sharing
policies. This work constitutes a first step towards defining and
characterizing the performance limits and trade-offs associated with knowledge
sharing in opportunistic social networks. Finally, we present nu- merical
results characterizing the cumulative knowledge gain over time and its upper
bound, using publicly available smartphone data. The results confirm the key
role of the proposed model to motivate future research in this ripe area of
research as well as new knowledge sharing policies.
