We imitate the spectrum character of one-dimensional disorder system with our
new rain model. It has been shown that the transmission spectrum can be
approximately characterized by the model, which include some coupled lorentzian
transmission peaks on the spectrum and embody the coupling of the local modes
in the disorder system.
