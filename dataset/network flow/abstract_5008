Strong gradients in plasma flows play a major role in space and astrophysical
plasmas. A typical situation is that a static plasma equilibrium is surrounded
by a plasma flow, which can lead to strong plasma flow gradients at the
separatrices between field lines with different magnetic topologies, e.g.,
planetary magnetospheres, helmet streamers in the solar corona, or at the
boundary between the heliosphere and interstellar medium. Within this work we
make a first step to understand the influence of these flows towards the
occurrence of current sheets in a stationary state situation. We concentrate
here on incompressible plasma flows and 2D equilibria, which allow us to find
analytic solutions of the stationary magnetohydrodynamics equations (SMHD).
First we solve the magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equations with the help of a
Grad-Shafranov equation and then we transform these static equilibria into a
stationary state with plasma flow. We are in particular interested to study
SMHD-equilibria with strong plasma flow gradients perpendicular to
separatrices. We find that induced thin current sheets occur naturally in such
situations. The strength of the induced currents depend on the Alfv\'en Mach
number and its gradient, and on the magnetic field.
