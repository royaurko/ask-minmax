In this paper, a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model with identical
infectivity, where each node is assigned with the same capability of active
contacts, $A$, at each time step, is presented. We found that on scale-free
networks, the density of the infected nodes shows the existence of threshold,
whose value equals 1/A, both demonstrated by analysis and numerical simulation.
The infected population grows in an exponential form and follows hierarchical
dynamics, indicating that once the highly connected hubs are reached, the
infection pervades almost the whole network in a progressive cascade. In
addition, the effects of random, proportional, and targeted immunization for
this model are investigated. Based on the current model and for heterogenous
networks, the targeted strategy performs best, while the random strategy is
much more efficient than in the standard SIS model. The present results could
be of practical importance in the setup of dynamic control strategies.
