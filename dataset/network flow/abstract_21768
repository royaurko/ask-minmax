For decades, the sphere eversion has been a classic subject for mathematical
visualization. The 1998 video "The Optiverse" shows geometrically optimal
eversions created by minimizing elastic bending energy. We contrast these
minimax eversions with earlier ones, including those by Morin, Phillips, Max,
and Thurston. The minimax eversions were automatically generated by flowing
downhill in energy using Brakke's Evolver.
