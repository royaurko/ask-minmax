Multiple accesses are common for most mobile devices today. This
technological advance opens up a new design space for improving the
communication performance of mobile devices. Multipath TCP is a TCP extension
that enables using multiple network paths between two end systems for a single
TCP connection, increasing performance and reliability. Meanwhile, when
operating multiple active interfaces, multipath-TCP also consumes substantial
more power and drains out bettery faster than using one interface. Thus,
enabling Multipath TCP on mobile devices brings in new challenges. In this
paper, we theoretically analyze the underlying design choices given by the
Multipath TCP. In particular, we theoretically formulate the rela- tion between
performance (throughput) and energy consumption for Multipath TCP. We find that
sometime the throughput and energy consumption can be concurrently improved.
