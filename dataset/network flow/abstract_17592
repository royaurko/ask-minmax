We prove that the beta function of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model including a
magnetic field vanishes at all order of perturbations. We compute the
renormalization group flow of the relevant dynamic parameters and find a
non-Gaussian infrared fixed point. Some consequences of these results are
discussed.
