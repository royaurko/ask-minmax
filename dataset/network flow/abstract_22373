We present a time-local existence theorem of the initial value problem for a
third-order dispersive evolution equation for open curves on compact almost
Hermitian manifolds arising in the geometric analysis of vortex filaments. This
equation causes the so-called loss of one-derivative since the target manifold
is not supposed to be a K\"ahler manifold. We overcome this difficulty by using
a gauge transformation of a multiplier on the pull-back bundle to eliminate the
bad first order terms essentially.
