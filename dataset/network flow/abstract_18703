We introduce the concept of natural connectivity as a robustness measure of
complex networks. The natural connectivity has a clear physical meaning and a
simple mathematical formulation. It characterizes the redundancy of alternative
paths by quantifying the weighted number of closed walks of all lengths. We
show that the natural connectivity can be derived mathematically from the graph
spectrum as an average eigenvalue and that it increases strictly monotonically
with the addition of edges. We test the natural connectivity and compare it
with other robustness measures within a scenario of edge elimination. We
demonstrate that the natural connectivity has an acute discrimination which
agrees with our intuition.
