Infinitesimal and finite amplitude error propagation in spatially extended
systems are numerically and theoretically investigated. The information
transport in these systems can be characterized in terms of the propagation
velocity of perturbations $V_p$. A linear stability analysis is sufficient to
capture all the relevant aspects associated to propagation of infinitesimal
disturbances. In particular, this analysis gives the propagation velocity $V_L$
of infinitesimal errors. If linear mechanisms prevail on the nonlinear ones
$V_p = V_L$. On the contrary, if nonlinear effects are predominant finite
amplitude disturbances can eventually propagate faster than infinitesimal ones
(i.e. $V_p > V_L$). The finite size Lyapunov exponent can be successfully
employed to discriminate the linear or nonlinear origin of information flow. A
generalization of finite size Lyapunov exponent to a comoving reference frame
allows to state a marginal stability criterion able to provide $V_p$ both in
the linear and in the nonlinear case. Strong analogies are found between
information spreading and propagation of fronts connecting steady states in
reaction-diffusion systems. The analysis of the common characteristics of these
two phenomena leads to a better understanding of the role played by linear and
nonlinear mechanisms for the flow of information in spatially extended systems.
