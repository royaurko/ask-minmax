We study numerically the development of chimera states in networks of
nonlocally coupled oscillators whose limit cycles emerge from a Hopf
bifurcation. This dynamical system is inspired from population dynamics and
consists of three interacting species in cyclic reactions. The complexity of
the dynamics arises from the presence of a limit cycle and four fixed points.
When the bifurcation parameter increases away from the Hopf bifurcation the
trajectory approaches the heteroclinic invariant manifolds of the fixed points
producing spikes, followed by long resting periods. We observe chimera states
in this spiking regime as a coexistence of coherence (synchronization) and
incoherence (desynchronization) in a one-dimensional ring with nonlocal
coupling, and demonstrate that their multiplicity depends both on the system
and the coupling parameters. We also show that hierarchical (fractal) coupling
topologies induce traveling multichimera states. The speed of motion of the
coherent and incoherent parts along the ring is computed through the Fourier
spectra of the corresponding dynamics.
