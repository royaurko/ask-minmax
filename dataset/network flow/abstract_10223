Helical symmetry is invariance under a one-dimensional group of rigid motions
generated by a simultaneous rotation around a fixed axis and translation along
the same axis. The key parameter in helical symmetry is the step or pitch, the
magnitude of the translation after rotating one full turn around the symmetry
axis. In this article we study the limits of three-dimensional helical viscous
and inviscid incompressible flows in an infinite circular pipe, with
respectively no-slip and no-penetration boundary conditions, as the step
approaches infinity. We show that, as the step becomes large, the
three-dimensional helical flow approaches a planar flow, which is governed by
the so-called two-and-half Navier-Stokes and Euler equations, respectively.
