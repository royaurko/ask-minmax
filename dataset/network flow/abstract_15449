Modularity maximization has been one of the most widely used approaches in
the last decade for discovering community structure in networks of practical
interest in biology, computing, social science, statistical mechanics, and
more. Modularity is a quality function that measures the difference between the
number of edges found within clusters minus the number of edges one would
statistically expect to find based on random chance. We present a natural
generalization of modularity based on the difference between the actual and
expected number of walks within clusters, which we call walk-modularity.
Walk-modularity can be expressed in matrix form, and community detection can be
performed by finding leading eigenvectors of the walk-modularity matrix. We
demonstrate community detection on both synthetic and real-world networks and
find that walk-modularity maximization returns significantly improved results
compared to traditional modularity maximization.
