We consider the problem of soft decision fusion in a bandwidth-constrained
wireless sensor network (WSN). The WSN is tasked with the detection of an
intruder transmitting an unknown signal over a fading channel. A binary
hypothesis testing is performed using the soft decision of the sensor nodes
(SNs). Using the likelihood ratio test, the optimal soft fusion rule at the
fusion center (FC) has been shown to be the weighted distance from the soft
decision mean under the null hypothesis. But as the optimal rule requires
a-priori knowledge that is difficult to attain in practice, suboptimal fusion
rules are proposed that are realizable in practice. We show how the effect of
quantizing the test statistic can be mitigated by increasing the number of SN
samples, i.e., bandwidth can be traded off against increased latency. The
optimal power and bit allocation for the WSN is also derived. Simulation
results show that SNs with good channels are allocated more bits, while SNs
with poor channels are censored.
