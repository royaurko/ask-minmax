In this paper a novel family of codes for modified spectral-amplitude-coding
optical code division multiple access (SAC-OCDMA) is introduced. The proposed
codes exist for more number of processing gains comparing to the previously
reported codes. In the network using these codes, the number of users can be
extended without any essential changes in the previous transmitters. In this
study, we propose a construction method for these codes and compare their
performance with previously reported codes.
