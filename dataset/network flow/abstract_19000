We report our initial investigations into reliability and path-finding based
models and propose future areas of interest. Inspired by broken sidewalks
during on-campus construction projects, we develop two models for navigating
this "unreliable network." These are based on a concept of "accumulating risk"
backward from the destination, and both operate on directed acyclic graphs with
a probability of failure associated with each edge. The first serves to
introduce and has faults addressed by the second, more conservative model.
Next, we show a paradox when these models are used to construct polynomials on
conceptual networks, such as design processes and software development life
cycles. When the risk of a network increases uniformly, the most reliable path
changes from wider and longer to shorter and narrower. If we let professional
inexperience--such as with entry level cooks and software developers--represent
probability of edge failure, does this change in path imply that the novice
should follow instructions with fewer "back-up" plans, yet those with
alternative routes should be followed by the expert?
