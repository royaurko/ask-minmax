Groups - social communities are important components of entire societies,
analysed by means of the social network concept. Their immanent feature is
continuous evolution over time. If we know how groups in the social network has
evolved we can use this information and try to predict the next step in the
given group evolution. In the paper, a new aproach for group evolution
prediction is presented and examined. Experimental studies on four evolving
social networks revealed that (i) the prediction based on the simple input
features may be very accurate, (ii) some classifiers are more precise than the
others and (iii) parameters of the group evolution extracion method
significantly influence the prediction quality.
