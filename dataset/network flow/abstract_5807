We present a simple method for determining the exact noise power spectra in
linear chemical reaction networks. We apply the method to networks which are
representative of biochemical processes such as gene expression and signal
detection. Our results clarify how noise is transmitted by signal detection
motifs, and indicate how to coarse-grain networks by the elimination of fast
reactions.
