The elliptic flow parameter ($v_2$) for $K_S^0$ and $\Lambda+\bar{\Lambda}$
has been measured at mid-rapidity in Au + Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV by the STAR collaboration. The $v_2$ values for both
$K_S^{0}$ and $\Lambda+\bar{\Lambda}$ saturate at moderate $p_T$, deviating
from the hydrodynamic behavior observed in the lower $p_T$ region. The
saturated $v_2$ values and the $p_T$ scales where the deviation begins are
particle dependent. The particle-type dependence of $v_2$ shows features
expected from the hadronization of a partonic ellipsoid by coalescence of
co-moving quarks. These results will be discussed in relation to the nuclear
modification factor ($R_{CP}$) which has also been measured for $K_S^0$ and
$\Lambda+\bar{\Lambda}$ by the STAR collaboration.
