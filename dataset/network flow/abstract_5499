Turing instability in activator-inhibitor systems provides a paradigm of
nonequilibrium pattern formation; it has been extensively investigated for
biological and chemical processes. Turing pattern formation should furthermore
be possible in network-organized systems, such as cellular networks in
morphogenesis and ecological metapopulations with dispersal connections between
habitats, but investigations have so far been restricted to regular lattices
and small networks. Here we report the first systematic investigation of Turing
patterns in large random networks, which reveals their striking difference from
the known classical behavior. In such networks, Turing instability leads to
spontaneous differentiation of the network nodes into activator-rich and
activator-low groups, but ordered periodic structures never develop. Only a
subset of nodes having close degrees (numbers of links) undergoes
differentiation, with its characteristic degree obeying a simple general law.
Strong nonlinear restructuring process leads to multiple coexisting states and
hysteresis effects. The final stationary patterns can be well understood in the
framework of the mean-field approximation for network dynamics.
