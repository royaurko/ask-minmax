It has been found that many networks display community structure -- groups of
vertices within which connections are dense but between which they are sparser
-- and highly sensitive computer algorithms have in recent years been developed
for detecting such structure. These algorithms however are computationally
demanding, which limits their application to small networks. Here we describe a
new algorithm which gives excellent results when tested on both
computer-generated and real-world networks and is much faster, typically
thousands of times faster than previous algorithms. We give several example
applications, including one to a collaboration network of more than 50000
physicists.
