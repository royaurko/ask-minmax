In the last decade, a new computational paradigm was introduced in the field
of Machine Learning, under the name of Reservoir Computing (RC). RC models are
neural networks which a recurrent part (the reservoir) that does not
participate in the learning process, and the rest of the system where no
recurrence (no neural circuit) occurs. This approach has grown rapidly due to
its success in solving learning tasks and other computational applications.
Some success was also observed with another recently proposed neural network
designed using Queueing Theory, the Random Neural Network (RandNN). Both
approaches have good properties and identified drawbacks. In this paper, we
propose a new RC model called Echo State Queueing Network (ESQN), where we use
ideas coming from RandNNs for the design of the reservoir. ESQNs consist in
ESNs where the reservoir has a new dynamics inspired by recurrent RandNNs. The
paper positions ESQNs in the global Machine Learning area, and provides
examples of their use and performances. We show on largely used benchmarks that
ESQNs are very accurate tools, and we illustrate how they compare with standard
ESNs.
