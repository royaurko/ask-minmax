Understanding the stochastic dynamics of tracer particles in active fluids is
important for identifying the physical properties of flow generating objects
such as colloids, bacteria or algae. Here, we study both analytically and
numerically the scattering of a tracer particle in different types of
time-dependent, hydrodynamic flow fields. Specifically, we compare the tracer
motion induced by an externally driven colloid with the one generated by
various self-motile, multi-sphere swimmers. Our results suggest that force-free
swimmers generically induce loop-shaped tracer trajectories. The specific
topological structure of these loops is determined by the hydrodynamic
properties of the microswimmer. Quantitative estimates for typical experimental
conditions imply that the loops survive on average even if Brownian motion
effects are taken into account.
