Finding a good clustering of vertices in a network, where vertices in the
same cluster are more tightly connected than those in different clusters, is a
useful, important, and well-studied task. Many clustering algorithms scale
well, however they are not designed to operate upon internet-scale networks
with billions of nodes or more. We study one of the fastest and most memory
efficient algorithms possible - clustering based on the connected components in
a random edge-induced subgraph. When defining the cost of a clustering to be
its distance from such a random clustering, we show that this surprisingly
simple algorithm gives a solution that is within an expected factor of two or
three of optimal with either of two natural distance functions. In fact, this
approximation guarantee works for any problem where there is a probability
distribution on clusterings. We then examine the behavior of this algorithm in
the context of social network trust inference.
