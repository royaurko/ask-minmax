Navigation process is studied on a variant of the Watts-Strogatz small world
network model embedded on a square lattice. With probability $p$, each vertex
sends out a long range link, and the probability of the other end of this link
falling on a vertex at lattice distance $r$ away decays as $ r^{-\alpha}$.
Vertices on the network have knowledge of only their nearest neighbors. In a
navigation process, messages are forwarded to a designated target. For $\alpha
<3$ and $\alpha \neq 2$, a scaling relation is found between the average actual
path length and $pL$, where $L$ is the average length of the additional long
range links. Given $pL>1$, dynamic small world effect is observed, and the
behavior of the scaling function at large enough $pL$ is obtained. At $\alpha
=2$ and 3, this kind of scaling breaks down, and different functions of the
average actual path length are obtained. For $\alpha >3$, the average actual
path length is nearly linear with network size.
