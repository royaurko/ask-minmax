Modeling and topological analysis of networks in biological and other complex
systems, must venture beyond the limited consideration of very few network
metrics like degree, betweenness or assortativity. A proper identification of
informative and redundant entities from many different metrics, using recently
demonstrated techniques, is essential. A holistic comparison of networks and
growth models is best achieved only with the use of such methods.
