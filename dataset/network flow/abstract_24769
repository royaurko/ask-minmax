The emerging field of signal processing on graph plays a more and more
important role in processing signals and information related to networks.
Existing works have shown that under certain conditions a smooth graph signal
can be uniquely reconstructed from its decimation, i.e., data associated with a
subset of vertices. However, in some potential applications (e.g., sensor
networks with clustering structure), the obtained data may be a combination of
signals associated with several vertices, rather than the decimation. In this
paper, we propose a new concept of local measurement, which is a generalization
of decimation. Using the local measurements, a local-set-based method named
iterative local measurement reconstruction (ILMR) is proposed to reconstruct
bandlimited graph signals. It is proved that ILMR can reconstruct the original
signal perfectly under certain conditions. The performance of ILMR against
noise is theoretically analyzed. The optimal choice of local weights and a
greedy algorithm of local set partition are given in the sense of minimizing
the expected reconstruction error. Compared with decimation, the proposed local
measurement sampling and reconstruction scheme is more robust in noise existing
scenarios.
