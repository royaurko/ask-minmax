In this paper, a new methodology for stability assessment of a smart power
system is proposed. The key to this assessment is an index called betweenness
index which is based on ideas from complex network theory. The proposed
betweenness index is an improvement of previous works since it considers the
actual real power flow through the transmission lines along the network.
Furthermore, this work initiates a new area for complex system research to
assess the stability of the power system.
