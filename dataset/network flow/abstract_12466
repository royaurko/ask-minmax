This paper considers rateless network error correction codes for reliable
multicast in the presence of adversarial errors. Most existing network error
correction codes are designed for a given network capacity and maximum number
of errors known a priori to the encoder and decoder. However, in certain
practical settings it may be necessary to operate without such a priori
knowledge. We present rateless coding schemes for two adversarial models, where
the source sends more redundancy over time, until decoding succeeds. The first
model assumes there is a secret channel between the source and the destination
that the adversaries cannot overhear. The rate of the channel is negligible
compared to the main network. In the second model, instead of a secret channel,
the source and destination share random secrets independent of the input
information. The amount of secret information required is negligible compared
to the amount of information sent. Both schemes are optimal in that decoding
succeeds with high probability when the total amount of information received by
the sink satisfies the cut set bound with respect to the amount of message and
error information. The schemes are distributed, polynomial-time and end-to-end
in that other than the source and destination nodes, other intermediate nodes
carry out classical random linear network coding.
