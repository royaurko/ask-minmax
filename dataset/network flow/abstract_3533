Today, Voice over Wireless Local Area Network (VOWLAN) is the most accepted
Internet application. There are a large number of literatures regarding the
performance of various WLAN networks. Most of them focus on simulations and
modeling, but there are also some experiments with real networks. This paper
explains the comparison of performance of two different VOIP (Voice over
Internet Protocol) applications over the same IEEE 802.11a wireless network.
Radio link standard 802.11a have maximum transmission rate of 54Mbps. First
protocol is session initiation protocol (SIP) and second is H.323 protocol.
First one has an agent called SIP proxy. Second have a gateway reflects the
characteristics of a Switched Circuit Network (SCN). With this comparison we
have required to obtain a better understanding of wireless network suitability
for voice communication in IP network.
