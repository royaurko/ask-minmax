In this paper we consider a heterogeneous network of Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB)
nonlinear oscillators coupled through both linear and nonlinear interaction
protocols. While some work exists on a system made up of only two nonlinearly
coupled HKB oscillators as a model of human dynamics during interpersonal
coordination tasks, the problem of considering a network of three or more HKBs
has not been fully investigated. The aim of our work is to study convergence
and synchronization in networks of HKB oscillators as a paradigm of
coordination in multiplayer games. Convergence results are obtained under the
assumption that the network is connected, simple and undirected. Analytical
results are obtained to prove convergence when the oscillators are coupled
diffusively. All theoretical results are illustrated via numerical examples.
Finally, the effects of adding an external entrainment signal to all the agents
in the network are analyzed and a model to account for them is proposed.
