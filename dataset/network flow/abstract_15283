We investigate a variety of statistical properties associated with the number
of distinct degrees that exist in a typical network for various classes of
networks. For a single realization of a network with N nodes that is drawn from
an ensemble in which the number of nodes of degree k has an algebraic tail, N_k
~ N/k^nu for k>>1, the number of distinct degrees grows as N^{1/nu}. Such an
algebraic growth is also observed in scientific citation data. We also
determine the N dependence of statistical quantities associated with the
sparse, large-k range of the degree distribution, such as the location of the
first hole (where N_k=0), the last doublet (two consecutive occupied degrees),
triplet, dimer (N_k=2), trimer, etc.
