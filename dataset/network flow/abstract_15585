The complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence is considered to be the magic biometric
technique for personal identification. In this paper, we present a new method
for cDNA recognition based on the artificial neural network (ANN). Microarray
imaging is used for the concurrent identification of thousands of genes. We
have segmented the location of the spots in a cDNA microarray. Thus, a precise
localization and segmenting of a spot are essential to obtain a more accurate
intensity measurement, leading to a more precise expression measurement of a
gene. The segmented cDNA microarray image is resized and it is used as an input
for the proposed artificial neural network. For matching and recognition, we
have trained the artificial neural network. Recognition results are given for
the galleries of cDNA sequences . The numerical results show that, the proposed
matching technique is an effective in the cDNA sequences process. We also
compare our results with previous results and find out that, the proposed
technique is an effective matching performance.
