We address scaling in inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulent flows by
decomposing structure functions into their irreducible representation of the
SO(3) symmetry group which are designated by $j,m$ indices. Employing
simulations of channel flows with Re$_\lambda\approx 70$ we demonstrate that
different components characterized by different $j$ display different scaling
exponents, but for a given $j$ these remain the same at different distances
from the wall. The $j=0$ exponent agrees extremely well with high Re
measurements of the scaling exponents, demonstrating the vitality of the SO(3)
decomposition.
