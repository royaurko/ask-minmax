In this paper we estimate lifetime bounds of a network of motes which
communicate with each other using IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Different frame
structures of IEEE 802.15.4 along with CSMA/CA medium access mechanism are
investigated to discover the overhead of channel acquisition, header and footer
of data frame, and transfer reliability during packet transmission. This
overhead makes the fixed component, and the data payload makes the incremental
component of a linear equation to estimate the power consumed during every
packet transmission. Finally we input this per-packet power consumption in a
mathematical model which estimates the lower and upper bounds of routings in
the network. We also implemented a series of measurements on CC2420 radio used
in a wide range of sensor motes to find the fixed and incremental components,
and finally the lifetime of a network composed of the motes using this radio.
