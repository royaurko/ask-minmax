One of the main tasks of post-genomic informatics is to systematically
investigate all molecules and their interactions within a living cell so as to
understand how these molecules and the interactions between them relate to the
function of the organism, while networks are appropriate abstract description
of all kinds of interactions. In the past few years, great achievement has been
made in developing theory of complex networks for revealing the organizing
principles that govern the formation and evolution of various complex
biological, technological and social networks. This paper reviews the
accomplishments in constructing genome-based metabolic networks and describes
how the theory of complex networks is applied to analyze metabolic networks.
