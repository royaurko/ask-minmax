It is shown that if the flow vector is a coordinate basis vector, then
perfect dynamo action is not possible, regardless of whether the steady flow is
compressible. Criteria determining the basis vector property are found to be
expressible in terms of Lie derivatives, and construction of basis vector sets
is straightforward.
