We find a class of exact solutions of differentially rotating dust in the
framework of General Relativity. There exist asymptotically flat space-times of
the flow with positive mass function that for radii sufficiently large is
monotonic and tends to zero at infinity. Some of the space-times may have
non-vanishing total angular momentum. The flow is essentially different from
another exactly solvable flow described by van Stockum line element.
