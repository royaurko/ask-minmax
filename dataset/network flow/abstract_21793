We study the semi-classical trace formula at a critical energy level for a
$h$-pseudo-differential operator whose principal symbol has a unique
non-degenerate critical point for that energy. This leads to the study of
Hamiltonian systems near equilibrium and near the non-zero periods of the
linearized flow. The contributions of these periods to the trace formula are
expressed in terms of degenerate oscillatory integrals. The new results
obtained are formulated in terms of the geometry of the energy surface and the
classical dynamics on this surface.
