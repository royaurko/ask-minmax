We describe the behaviour of the Dirichlet eta function in the critical
strip, in terms of the potential flow of an ideal fluid. Using well-known
results from complex potential theory and number theory, we show that the
Dirichlet eta function has no zeros in the critical strip off the critical
line, consistent with the Riemann hypothesis.
