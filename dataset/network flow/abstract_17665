A very simple model for cell swelling by osmosis is introduced, resulting in
a parabolic free boundary problem. In case of radially symmetric initial
conditions, it is shown that the model can be viewed as a gradient flow
involving entropy, surface area and the Wasserstein metric. This observation is
used to construct solutions and explain the presence and nature of osmosis.
