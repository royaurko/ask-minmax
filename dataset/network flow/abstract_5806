The evolutionary origin of universal statistics in biochemical reaction
network is studied, to explain the power-law distribution of reaction links and
the power-law distributions of chemical abundances. Using cell models with
catalytic reaction network, we find evidence that the power-law distribution in
abundances of chemicals emerges by the selection of cells with higher growth
speeds. Through the further evolution, this inhomogeneity in chemical
abundances is shown to be embedded in the distribution of links, leading to the
power-law distribution. These findings provide novel insights into the nature
of network evolution in living cells.
