Molecular motors perform active movements along cytoskeletal filaments and
drive the traffic of organelles and other cargo particles in cells. In contrast
to the macroscopic traffic of cars, however, the traffic of molecular motors is
characterized by a finite walking distance (or run length) after which a motor
unbinds from the filament along which it moves. Unbound motors perform Brownian
motion in the surrounding aqueous solution until they rebind to a filament. We
use variants of driven lattice gas models to describe the interplay of their
active movements, the unbound diffusion, and the binding/unbinding dynamics. If
the motor concentration is large, motor-motor interactions become important and
lead to a variety of cooperative traffic phenomena such as traffic jams on the
filaments, boundary-induced phase transitions, and spontaneous symmetry
breaking in systems with two species of motors. If the filament is surrounded
by a large reservoir of motors, the jam length, i.e., the extension of the
traffic jams is of the order of the walking distance. Much longer jams can be
found in confined geometries such as tube-like compartments.
