A linear accelerator, called RAON, has been being developed as a part of Rare
Isotope Science Project (RISP) by Institute for Basic Science (IBS) [1]. The
linear accelerator utilizes an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source
for providing intense highly charged ion beams to the linear accelerator. 28GHz
ECR ion source can extract heavy ion beams from proton to uranium. A
superconducting magnet system for 28GHz ECR ion source is composed of hexapole
coils and four solenoid coils made with low Tc superconducting wires of NbTi
[2]. The electromagnetic force acts on the superconducting magnets due to the
magnetic field and flowing current in case of not only normal state but also
quench state [3]. In case of quench on hexapole coils, unbalanced flowing
current among the hexapole coils is generated and it causes unbalanced
electromagnetic force. Coil motions and coil strains in quench state are larger
than those in normal state due to unbalanced electromagnetic force among
hexapole coils. Therefore, analysis on electromagnetic characteristics of
superconducting magnet for 28GHz ECR ion source according to the series
resistance of protection circuit in case of quench should be conducted. In this
paper, analysis on electromagnetic characteristics of superconducting hexapole
coils for 28GHz ECR ion source according to the series resistance of protection
circuit in case of quench is performed by using finite elements method (FEM)
simulation.
