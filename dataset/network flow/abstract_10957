To study transport properties of complex networks, we analyze the equivalent
conductance $G$ between two arbitrarily chosen nodes of random scale-free
networks with degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\lambda}$ in which each link
has the same unit resistance. We predict a broad range of values of $G$, with a
power-law tail distribution $\Phi_{\rm SF}(G)\sim G^{-g_G}$, where
$g_G=2\lambda -1$, and confirm our predictions by simulations. The power-law
tail in $\Phi_{\rm SF}(G)$ leads to large values of $G$, thereby significantly
improving the transport in scale-free networks, compared to Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
random graphs where the tail of the conductivity distribution decays
exponentially. Based on a simple physical ``transport backbone'' picture we
show that the conductances are well approximated by $ck_Ak_B/(k_A+k_B)$ for any
pair of nodes $A$ and $B$ with degrees $k_A$ and $k_B$. Thus, a single
parameter $c$ characterizes transport on scale-free networks.
