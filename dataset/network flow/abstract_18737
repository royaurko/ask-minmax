Minimizing the number of dropped User Datagram Protocol (UDP) messages in a
network is regarded as a challenge by researchers. This issue represents
serious problems for many protocols particularly those that depend on sending
messages as part of their strategy, such us service discovery protocols. This
paper proposes and evaluates an algorithm to predict the minimum period of time
required between two or more consecutive messages and suggests the minimum
queue sizes for the routers, to manage the traffic and minimise the number of
dropped messages that has been caused by either congestion or queue overflow or
both together. The algorithm has been applied to the Universal Plug and Play
(UPnP) protocol using ns2 simulator. It was tested when the routers were
connected in two configurations; as a centralized and de centralized. The
message length and bandwidth of the links among the routers were taken in the
consideration. The result shows Better improvement in number of dropped
messages `among the routers.
