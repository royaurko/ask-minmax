In a previous paper we have written down equations describing steady-state,
optically thin, advection-dominated accretion onto a Kerr black hole (Gammie
and Popham 1997, hereafter Paper I). In this paper we survey the numerical
solutions to these equations. We find that the temperature and density of the
gas in the inner part of the accretion flow depend strongly on the black hole
spin parameter $a$. The rate of angular momentum accretion is also shown to
depend on $a$; for $a$ greater than an equilibrium spin parameter $a_{eq}$ the
black hole is de-spun by the accretion flow. We also investigate the dependence
of the flow on the angular momentum transport efficiency $\alpha$, the advected
fraction of the dissipated energy $f$, and the adiabatic index $\gamma$. We
find solutions for $-1 < a < 1$, $10^{-4} \le \alpha \le 0.44$, $0.01 \le f \le
1$, and $4/3 < \gamma < 5/3$. For low values of $\alpha$ and $f$ the inner part
of the flow exhibits a pressure maximum and appears similar to equilibrium
thick disk solutions.
