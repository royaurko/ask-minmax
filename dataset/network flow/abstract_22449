Casimir energy is calculated for 5D scalar theory in the {\it warped}
geometry. A new regularization, called {\it sphere lattice regularization}, is
taken. The regularized configuration is {\it closed-string like}. We
numerically evaluate $\La$(4D UV-cutoff), $\om$(5D bulk curvature, extra space
UV-boundary parameter) and $T$(extra space IR-boundary parameter) dependence of
Casimir energy. 5D Casimir energy is {\it finitely} obtained after the {\it
proper renormalization procedure.} The {\it warp parameter} $\om$ suffers from
the {\it renormalization effect}. Regarding Casimir energy as the main
contribution to the cosmological term, we examine the dark energy problem.
