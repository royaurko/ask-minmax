An autocatalytic pattern matching polymer system is studied as an abstract
model for chemical ecosystem evolution. Highly ordered populations with
particular sequence patterns appear spontaneously out of a vast number of
possible states. The interplay between the selected microscopic sequence
patterns and the macroscopic cooperative structures is examined. Stability,
fluctuations, and evolutionary selection mechanisms are investigated for the
involved self-organizing processes.
