We study the averaged mean curvature flow, also called the volume preserving
mean curvature flow, in the particular setting of axisymmetric surfaces
embedded in R^3 satisfying periodic boundary conditions. We establish analytic
well--posedness of the flow within the space of little-H\"older continuous
surfaces, given rough initial data. We also establish dynamic properties of
equilibria, including stability, instability, and bifurcation behavior of
cylinders, where the radius acts as a bifurcation parameter.
