In this paper, we prove the maximal $L_p$-$L_q$ regularity of the
compressible and incompressible two phase flow with phase transition in the
model problem case with the help of ${\mathcal R}$-bounded solution operators
corresponding to generalized resolvent problem. The problem arises from the
mathematical study of the motion of two-phase flows having gaseous phase and
liquid phase separated by a sharp interface with phase transition. Using the
result obtained in this paper, in \cite{S0} we proved the local well-posedness
of free boundary problem for the compressible and incompressible two phase flow
separated by sharp interface with phase transition.
