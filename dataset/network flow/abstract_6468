In this paper we investigate the performance of mobile user connectivity in
femtocell/macrocell networks. The femto user equipment (FUE) can connect to
femto access point (FAP) with low communication range rather than higher
communication range to macro base station (MBS). Furthermore, in such emerging
networks, the spatial reuse of resources is permissible and the transmission
range can be decreased, then the probability of connectivity is high. Thereby
in this study, we propose a tractable analytical model for the connectivity
probability based on communication range and the mobility of mobile users in
femtocell/macrocell networks. Further, we study the interplays between outage
probability and spectral efficiency in such networks. Numerical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of computing the connectivity probability in
femtocell/macrocell networks.
