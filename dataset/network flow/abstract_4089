We investigate the gradient flow of the $L^2$ norm of the Riemannian
curvature on surfaces. We show long time existence with arbitrary initial data,
and exponential convergence of the volume normalized flow to a constant scalar
curvature metric when the initial energy is below a constant determined by the
Euler characteristic of the underlying surface.
