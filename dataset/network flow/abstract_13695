We observe electro-hydrodynamically driven turbulent flows at low Reynolds
numbers in a two-fluid emulsion consisting of micron-scale droplets. In the
presence of electric fields, the droplets produce interacting hydrodynamic
flows which result in a dynamical organization at a spatial scale much larger
than the size of the individual droplets. We characterize the dynamics
associated with these structures by both video imaging and a simultaneous, in
situ, measurement of the time variation of the bulk Reynolds stress with a
rheometer. The results display scale invariance in the energy spectra in both
space and time.
