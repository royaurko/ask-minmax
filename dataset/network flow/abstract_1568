This paper presents an overview of the statistical properties arising from
the broadness of the distribution of tunnel currents in metal-insulator-metal
tunnel junctions. Experimental current inhomogeneities can be modelled by a
lognormal distribution and the size dependence of the tunnel current is
modified at small sizes by the effect of broad distributions.
