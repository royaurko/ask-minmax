We show that interferometry can be applied to study irregular, rapidly
rotating structures, as are expected in the turbulent accretion flow near a
black hole. Specifically, we analyze the lagged covariance between
interferometric baselines of similar lengths but slightly different
orientations. We demonstrate that the peak in the lagged covariance indicates
the direction and angular velocity of the flow. Importantly, measuring the
direction of the flow as clockwise or counterclockwise on the sky breaks a
degeneracy in accretion disk inclinations when analyzing time-averaged images
alone. We explore the potential efficacy using three-dimensional, general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, and we highlight several
baseline pairs for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) that are well-suited to
this application. These results indicate that the EHT is capable of determining
the direction and angular velocity of the emitting material near Sgr A*, even
for highly-inclined flows, and they suggest that a rotating flow may even be
utilized to improve imaging capabilities.
