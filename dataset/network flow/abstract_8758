We establish moment estimates for the invariant measure of a stochastic
partial differential equation describing motion by mean curvature flow in (1+1)
dimension, leading to polynomial stability of the associated Markov semigroup.
We also prove maximal dissipativity for the related Kolmogorov operator.
