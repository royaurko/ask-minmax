We study the problem of interference management in large-scale small cell
networks, where each user equipment (UE) needs to determine in a distributed
manner when and at what power level it should transmit to its serving small
cell base station (SBS) such that a given network performance criterion is
maximized subject to minimum quality of service (QoS) requirements by the UEs.
We first propose a distributed algorithm for the UE-SBS pairs to find a subset
of weakly interfering UE-SBS pairs, namely the maximal independent sets (MISs)
of the interference graph in logarithmic time (with respect to the number of
UEs). Then we propose a novel problem formulation which enables UE-SBS pairs to
determine the optimal fractions of time occupied by each MIS in a distributed
manner. We analytically bound the performance of our distributed policy in
terms of the competitive ratio with respect to the optimal network performance,
which is obtained in a centralized manner with NP (non-deterministic polynomial
time) complexity. Remarkably, the competitive ratio is independent of the
network size, which guarantees scalability in terms of performance for
arbitrarily large networks. Through simulations, we show that our proposed
policies achieve significant performance improvements (from 150% to 700%) over
the existing policies.
