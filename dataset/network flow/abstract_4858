Crumpled paper or drapery patterns are everyday examples of how elastic
sheets can respond to external forcing. In this Letter, we study experimentally
a novel sort of forcing. We consider a circular flexible plate clamped at its
center and subject to a uniform flow normal to its initial surface. As the flow
velocity is gradually increased, the plate exhibits a rich variety of bending
deformations: from a cylindrical taco-like shape, to isometric developable
cones with azimuthal periodicity two or three, to eventually a rolled-up
period-three cone. We show that this sequence of flow-induced deformations can
be qualitatively predicted by a linear analysis based on the balance between
elastic energy and pressure force work.
