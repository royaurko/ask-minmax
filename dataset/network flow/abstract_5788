We consider a dynamic social network model in which agents play repeated
games in pairings determined by a stochastically evolving social network.
Individual agents begin to interact at random, with the interactions modeled as
games. The game payoffs determine which interactions are reinforced, and the
network structure emerges as a consequence of the dynamics of the agents'
learning behavior. We study this in a variety of game-theoretic conditions and
show that the behavior is complex and sometimes dissimilar to behavior in the
absence of structural dynamics. We argue that modeling network structure as
dynamic increases realism without rendering the problem of analysis
intractable.
