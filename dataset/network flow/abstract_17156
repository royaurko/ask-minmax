This paper presents the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)
experimental results of the Max-Min signal to noise ratio (SNR) Signal Energy
based Spectrum Sensing Algorithms for Cognitive Radio Networks which is
recently proposed in \cite{BogaMaxMinSNRJournal2013}. Extensive experiments are
performed for different set of parameters. In particular, the effects of SNR,
number of samples and roll-off factor on the detection performances of the
latter algorithms are examined briefly. We have observed that the experimental
results fit well with those of the theory. We also confirm that these
algorithms are indeed robust against carrier frequency offset, symbol timing
offset and noise variance uncertainty.
