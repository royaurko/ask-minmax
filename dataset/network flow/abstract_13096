In this note we classify some integrable invariant Sobolev metrics on the
Abelian extension of the diffeomorphism group of the circle. We also derive a
new two-component generalization of the Camassa-Holm equation. The system
obtained appears to be unique bi-Hamiltonian flow on the coadiont obrit of
$\Diff_+(S^1)\ltimes C^\infty(S^1)$ generalizes the Camassa-Holm flow on
$\Vect(S^1)^*$.
