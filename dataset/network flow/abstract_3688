Radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) are common feature of
low-luminosity accretion flows, including quiescent states of X-ray binaries
and low-lunimosity active galactic nuclei. Thermally driven winds are expected
from such hot accretion flows. By assuming that the flow has self-similarity
structure in the radial direction, we solve the vertical structure of the wind
and accretion flows simultaneously and evaluate the mass loss rates by wind. We
find that the ratio of the outflow rate to the accretion rate is approximately
unity for a viscosity parameter, alpha lesssim 0.1, despite some uncertainties
in the angular momentum and temperature distributions. That is, the accretion
rate in the RIAFs is roughly proportional to the radius. Moreover, we elucidate
the effect of cooling by wind on the underneath accretion flow, finding that
this effect could be important for calculating energy spectrum of the RIAF.
Observational implications are briefly discussed in the context of Sgr A*.
