In state-of-the-art Pervasive Computing, it is envisioned that unlimited
access to information will be facilitated for anyone and anything. Wireless
sensor networks will play a pivotal role in the stated vision. This reflects
the phenomena where any situation can be sensed and analyzed anywhere. It makes
heterogeneous context ubiquitous. Clustering context is one of the techniques
to manage ubiquitous context information efficiently to maximize its potential.
Logical-clustering is useful to share real-time context where sensors are
physically distributed but logically clustered. This paper investigates the
network performance of logical-clustering based on ns-3 simulations. In
particular reliability, scalability, and reachability in terms of delay,
jitter, and packet loss for the logically clustered network have been
investigated. The performance study shows that jitter demonstrates 40 % and 44
% fluctuation for 200 % increase in the node per cluster and 100 % increase in
the cluster size respectively. Packet loss exhibits only 18 % increase for 83 %
increase in the packet flow-rate.
