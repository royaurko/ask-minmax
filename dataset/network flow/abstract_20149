The influence of a stationary shear flow on the crystallization in a glassy
system is studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations and subsequent
cluster analysis. The results reveal two opposite effects of the shear flow on
the processes of topological ordering in the system. Shear promotes the
formation of separated crystallites and suppresses the appearance of the large
clusters. The shear-induced ordering proceeds in two stages, where the first
stage is related mainly with the growth of crystallites, whereas the second
stage is due to an adjustment of the created clusters and a progressive
alignment of their lattice directions. The influence of strain and shear rate
on the crystallization is also investigated. In particular, we find two
plausible phenomenological relations between the shear rate and the
characteristic time scale needed for ordering of the amorphous system under
shear.
