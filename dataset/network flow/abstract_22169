We establish normal forms for conformal vector fields on pseudo-Riemannian
manifolds in the neighborhood of a singularity. For real-analytic Lorentzian
manifolds, we show that the vector field is analytically linearizable or the
manifold is conformally flat. In either case, the vector field is locally
conjugate to a normal form on a model space. For smooth metrics of general
signature, we obtain the analogous result under the additional assumption that
the differential of the flow at the fixed point is bounded.
