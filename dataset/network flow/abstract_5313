Experiments with pedestrians could depend strongly on initial conditions.
Comparisons of the results of such experiments require to distinguish carefully
between transient state and steady state. In this work, a feasible algorithm -
Cumulative Sum Control Chart - is proposed and improved to automatically detect
steady states from density and speed time series of bottleneck experiments. The
threshold of the detection parameter in the algorithm is calibrated using an
autoregressive model. Comparing the detected steady states with previous
manually selected ones, the modified algorithm gives more reproducible results.
For the applications, three groups of bottleneck experiments are analysed and
the steady states are detected. The study about pedestrian flow shows that the
difference between the flows in all states and in steady state mainly depends
on the ratio of pedestrian number to bottleneck width. When the ratio is higher
than a critical value (approximately 115 persons/m), the flow in all states is
almost identical with the flow in steady state. Thus we have more possibilities
to compare the flows from different experiments, especially when the detection
of steady states is difficult.
