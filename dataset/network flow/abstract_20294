We revise the SU(3)-invariant sector of $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity with
dyonic SO(8) gaugings. By using the embedding tensor formalism, analytic
expressions for the scalar potential, superpotential(s) and fermion mass terms
are obtained as a function of the electromagnetic phase $\omega$ and the
scalars in the theory. Equipped with these results, we explore
non-supersymmetric AdS critical points at $\omega \neq 0$ for which
perturbative stability could not be analysed before. The $\omega$-dependent
superpotential is then used to derive first-order flow equations and obtain new
BPS domain-wall solutions at $\omega \neq 0$. We numerically look at
steepest-descent paths motivated by the (conjectured) RG flows.
