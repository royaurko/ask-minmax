It is well-known that the LIE(Locally Induction Equation) admit soliton-type
solutions and same soliton solutions arise from different and apparently
irrelevant physical models. By comparing the solitons of LIE and Killing
magnetic geodesics, we observe that these solitons are essentially decided by
two families of isometries of the domain and the target space respectively.
With this insight, we propose the new concept of geometric solitons of
Hamiltonian flows on manifolds, such as geometric Schr\"odinger flows and KdV
flows for maps. Moreover, we give several examples of geometric solitons of the
Schr\"odinger flow and geometric KdV flow, including magnetic curves as
geometric Schr\"odinger solitons and explicit geometric KdV solitons on
surfaces of revolution.
