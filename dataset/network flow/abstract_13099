This paper is concerned with a numerical simulation of shape optimization in
a two-dimensional viscous incompressible flow governed by Navier--Stokes
equations with mixed boundary conditions containing the pressure. The
minimization problem of total dissipated energy was established in the fluid
domain. We derive the structures of shape gradient of the cost functional by
using the differentiability of a minimax formulation involving a Lagrange
functional with a function space parametrization technique. Finally a gradient
type algorithm is effectively used for our problem.
