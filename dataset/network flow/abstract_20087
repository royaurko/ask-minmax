The $\beta$-decay half-lives of neutron-rich nuclei with $20 \leqslant Z
\leqslant 50$ are systematically investigated using the newly developed fully
self-consistent proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA),
based on the spherical relativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (RHFB) framework.
Available data are reproduced by including an isospin-dependent proton-neutron
pairing interaction in the isoscalar channel of the RHFB+QRPA model. With the
calculated $\beta$-decay half-lives of neutron-rich nuclei a remarkable
speeding up of $r$-matter flow is predicted. This leads to enhanced $r$-process
abundances of elements with $A \gtrsim 140$, an important result for the
understanding of the origin of heavy elements in the universe.
