Financial markets are well known examples of multi-fractal complex systems
that have garnered much interest in their characterization through complex
network theory. The recent studies have used correlation based distance metrics
for defining and analyzing financial networks. In this work the singularity
strength is employed to define a distance metric and the existence of
hierarchical structure in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is investigated. The
multi-fractal nature of the financial market, which is otherwise hidden in the
correlation coefficient based prescriptions, is analyzed through the use of the
singularity strength based method. The presence of a super cluster is exhibited
in the network which accounts for half of the network size and is homogeneous
in the sectoral composition of the South African market.
