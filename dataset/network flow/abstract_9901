Energy dependence of quark transverse flow carries information about
dynamical properties (equation of state, initial conditions) of deconfined
matter produced in heavy ion collisions. We assume quark-antiquark matter
formation in Pb+Pb collisions at CERN SPS and Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies
and determine quark transverse flow at the critical temperature of the
quark-hadron phase transition. Coalescence of massive quarks is calculated in
the MICOR hadronization model and hadronic final state effects are considered
using the GROMIT cascade program. Comparing theoretical results to data,
transverse flow values are determined and energy dependence is discussed.
