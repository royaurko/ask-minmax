Most real-world complex systems can be modelled by coupled networks with
multiple layers. How and to what extent the pattern of couplings between
network layers may influence the interlaced structure and function of coupled
networks are not clearly understood. Here we study the impact of correlated
inter-layer couplings on the network robustness of coupled networks using
percolation concept. We found that the positive correlated inter-layer coupling
enhaces network robustness in the sense that it lowers the percolation
threshold of the interlaced network than the negative correlated coupling case.
At the same time, however, positive inter-layer correlation leads to smaller
giant component size in the well-connected region, suggesting potential
disadvantage for network connectivity, as demonstrated also with some
real-world coupled network structures.
