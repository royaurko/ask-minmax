The flow structure of strongly turbulent Taylor-Couette flow with Reynolds
numbers up to Re_i = 2*10^6 of the inner cylinder is experimentally examined
with high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV). The wind Reynolds numbers
Re_w of the turbulent Taylor-vortex flow is found to scale as Re_w ~ Ta^(1/2),
exactly as predicted for the ultimate turbulence regime, in which the boundary
layers are turbulent. The dimensionless angular velocity flux has an effective
scaling of Nu_{\omega} ~ Ta^0.38, also in correspondence with turbulence in the
ultimate regime. The scaling of Nu_{\omega} is confirmed by local angular
velocity flux measurements extracted from high-speed PIV measurements: though
the flux shows huge fluctuations, its spatial and temporal average nicely
agrees with the result from the global torque measurements.
