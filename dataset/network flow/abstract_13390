We show that the stochastic flow generated by the Stochastic Navier-Stokes
equations in a 2-dimensional Poincar\'e domain has a unique random attractor.
This result complements a recent result by Brze\'zniak and Li [10] who showed
that the flow is asymptotically compact and generalizes a recent result by
Caraballo et al. [12] who proved existence of a unique pullback attractor for
the time-dependent deterministic Navier-Stokes equations in a 2-dimensional
Poincar\'e domain.
