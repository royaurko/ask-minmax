In a network, a node is said to incur a delay if its encoding of each
transmitted symbol involves only its received symbols obtained before the time
slot in which the transmitted symbol is sent (hence the transmitted symbol sent
in a time slot cannot depend on the received symbol obtained in the same time
slot). A node is said to incur no delay if its received symbol obtained in a
time slot is available for encoding its transmitted symbol sent in the same
time slot. Under the classical model, the discrete memoryless multimessage
multicast network (MMN) is characterized by one channel and every node in the
network incurs a delay. On the other hand, under the generalized model, the MMN
can be characterized by multiple channels and some nodes in the network may
incur no delay. In this paper, we obtain the capacity regions for three classes
of MMN under the generalized model, namely the deterministic network dominated
by product distribution, the MMN consisting of independent DMCs and the
wireless erasure network. In addition, we show that for any MMN belonging to
one of the above three classes, the set of achievable rate tuples under the
generalized model and under the classical model are the same, which implies
that the set of achievable rate tuples for the MMN does not depend on the
amount of delay incurred by each node in the network.
