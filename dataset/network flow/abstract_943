Recent research has shown the link between congestion control in
communication networks and feedback control system. In this paper, the design
of an active queue management (AQM) which can be viewed as a controller, is
considered. Based on a state space representation of a linearized fluid flow
model of TCP, the AQM design is converted to a state feedback synthesis problem
for time delay systems. Finally, an example extracted from the literature and
simulations via a network simulator NS (under cross traffic conditions) support
our study.
