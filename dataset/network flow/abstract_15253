This paper presents a performance analysis for the bandwidth allocation in
IEEE 802.16 broadband wireless access (BWA) networks considering the
packet-level quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Adaptive Modulation and
Coding (AMC) rate based on IEEE 802.16 standard is used to adjust the
transmission rate adaptively in each frame time according to channel quality in
order to obtain multiuser diversity gain. To model the arrival process and the
traffic source we use the Batch Markov Arrival Process (BMAP), which enables
more realistic and more accurate traffic modelling. We determine analytically
different performance parameters, such as average queue length, packet dropping
probability, queue throughput and average packet delay. Finally, the analytical
results are validated numerically.
