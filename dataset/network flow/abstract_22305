In this contribution we review recent efforts on investigations of the effect
of (apparent) boundary slip by utilizing lattice Boltzmann simulations. We
demonstrate the applicability of the method to treat fundamental questions in
microfluidics by investigating fluid flow in hydrophobic and rough
microchannels as well as over surfaces covered by nano- or microscale gas
bubbles.
