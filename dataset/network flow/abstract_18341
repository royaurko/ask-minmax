We develop a new framework for the study of complex continuous time dynamical
systems based on viewing them as collections of interacting control modules.
This framework is inspired by and builds upon the groupoid formalism of
Golubitsky, Stewart and their collaborators. Our approach uses the tools and
--- more importantly ---the stance of category theory. This enables us to put
the groupoid formalism in a coordinate-free setting and to extend it from
ordinary differential equations to vector fields on manifolds. In particular,
we construct combinatorial models for categories of modular continuous time
dynamical systems. Each such model, as a category, is a fibration over an
appropriate category of labeled directed graphs. This makes precise the
relation between dynamical systems living on networks and the combinatorial
structure of the underlying directed graphs, allowing us to exploit the
relation in new and interesting ways.
