Centrifugal barrier supported boundary layer (CENBOL) of a black hole affects
the spectrum exactly in the same way the boundary layer of a neutron star does.
The CENBOL is produced due to standing or oscillating shock waves and these
shocks accelerate electrons very efficiently and produce a power-law
distribution. The accelerated particles in turn emit synchrotron radiation in
presence of the magnetic field. We study the spectral properties of an
accretion disk as a function of the shock strength, compression ratio, flow
accretion rate and flow geometry. In the absence of a satisfactory description
of magnetic fields inside the advective disk, we consider the presence of only
stochastic fields and use the ratio of the field energy density to the
gravitational energy density to be a parameter. Not surprisingly, stronger
fields produce stronger humps due to synchrotron radiation. We not only include
`conventional' synchrotron emission and Comptonization due to Maxwell-Bolzmann
electrons in the gas, we also compute these effects due to power-law electrons.
For strong shocks, a bump is produced at a frequency just above the synchrotron
self-absorption frequency at $\nu_{bump} \sim \nu_{inj} [1+{4/3}\frac{R-1}
{R}\frac{1}{x_s^{1/2}}]^{x_s^{1/2}}$, where, $\nu_{inj}$ is the frequency of
the dominant photons from the pre-shock flow, $R$ is the compression ratio of
the shock located at $x_s$. For strong shocks, a bump at a higher frequency
appears predominantly due to the power-law electrons formed at the shock front.
