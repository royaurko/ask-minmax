We present a linear stability analysis of a flow undergoing
conductively-driven mass-loading from embedded clouds. We find that
mass-loading damps isobaric and isentropic perturbations, and in this regard is
similar to the effect of thermal conduction, but is much more pronounced where
many embedded clumps exist. The stabilizing influence of mass-loading is
wavelength independent against isobaric (condensing) perturbations, but
wavelength dependent against isentropic (wave-like) perturbations. We derive
equations for the degree of mass-loading needed to stabilize such
perturbations. We have also made 1D numerical simulations of a mass-loaded
radiative shock and demonstrated the damping of the overstability when
mass-loading is rapid enough.
