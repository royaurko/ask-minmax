We report erosion of synchronization in networks of coupled phase
oscillators, a phenomenon where perfect phase synchronization is unattainable
in steady-state, even in the limit of infinite coupling. An analysis reveals
that the total erosion is separable into the product of terms characterizing
coupling frustration and structural heterogeneity, both of which amplify
erosion. The latter, however, can differ significantly from degree
heterogeneity. Finally, we show that erosion is marked by the reorganization of
oscillators according to their node degrees rather than their natural
frequencies.
