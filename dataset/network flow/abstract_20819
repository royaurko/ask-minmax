The increasing popularity of web-based applications has led to several
critical services being provided over the Internet. This has made it imperative
to monitor the network traffic so as to prevent malicious attackers from
depleting the resources of the network and denying services to legitimate
users. This paper has presented a mechanism for protecting a web-server against
a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Incoming traffic to the server
is continuously monitored and any abnormal rise in the inbound traffic is
immediately detected. The detection algorithm is based on a statistical
analysis of the inbound traffic on the server and a robust hypothesis testing
framework. While the detection process is on, the sessions from the legitimate
sources are not disrupted and the load on the server is restored to the normal
level by blocking the traffic from the attacking sources. To cater to different
scenarios, the detection algorithm has various modules with varying level of
computational and memory overheads for their execution. While the approximate
modules are fast in detection and involve less overhead, they have lower
detection accuracy. The accurate modules involve complex detection logic and
hence involve more overhead for their execution, but they have very high
detection accuracy. Simulations carried out on the proposed mechanism have
produced results that demonstrate effectiveness of the scheme.
