Despite the robustness of complex networks has been extensively studied in
the last decade, there still lacks a unifying framework able to embrace all the
proposed metrics. In the literature there are two open issues related to this
gap: (a) how to dimension several metrics to allow their summation and (b) how
to weight each of the metrics. In this work we propose a solution for the two
aforementioned problems by defining the $R^*$-value and introducing the concept
of \emph{robustness surface} ($\Omega$). The rationale of our proposal is to
make use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We firstly adjust to 1 the
initial robustness of a network. Secondly, we find the most informative
robustness metric under a specific failure scenario. Then, we repeat the
process for several percentage of failures and different realizations of the
failure process. Lastly, we join these values to form the robustness surface,
which allows the visual assessment of network robustness variability. Results
show that a network presents different robustness surfaces (i.e., dissimilar
shapes) depending on the failure scenario and the set of metrics. In addition,
the robustness surface allows the robustness of different networks to be
compared.
