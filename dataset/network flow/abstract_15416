In this paper we quantify the total economic impact of an epidemic over a
complex network using tools from random matrix theory. Incorporating the direct
and indirect costs of infection, we calculate the disease cost in the large
graph limit for an SIS (Susceptible - Infected - Susceptible) infection
process. We also give an upper bound on this cost for arbitrary finite graphs
and illustrate both calculated costs using extensive simulations on random and
real-world networks. We extend these calculations by considering the total
social cost of an epidemic, accounting for both the immunization and disease
costs for various immunization strategies and determining the optimal
immunization. Our work focuses on the transient behavior of the epidemic, in
contrast to previous research, which typically focuses on determining the
steady-state system equilibrium.
