Recently, we introduced dynamic networks with preferred degrees, showing that
interesting properties are present in a single, homogeneous system as well as
one with two interacting networks. While simulations are readily performed,
analytic studies are challenging, due mainly to the lack of detailed balance in
the dynamics. Here, we consider the two-community case in a special limit: a
system of extreme introverts and extroverts - the XIE model. Surprising
phenomena appear, even in this minimal model, where the only control parameters
are the numbers of each subgroup: $N_{I,E}$. Specifically, an extraordinary
transition emerges when $N_I$ crosses $N_E$. For example, the fraction of total
number of I-E links jumps from $\thicksim 0$ to $\thicksim 1$. In a $N_I=N_E$
system, this fraction performs a pure random walk so that its distribution
displays a flat plateau across most of $[0,1]$, with the edges vanishing as
$(N_{I,E})^{-0.38}$ for large systems. Thus, we believe the XIE model exhibits
an extreme Thouless effect. For this limiting model, we show that detailed
balance is restored and explicitly find the microscopic steady-state
distribution. We then use a mean-field approach to find analytic expressions
for the degree distributions that are in reasonably good agreement with
simulations, provided $N_I$ is not too close to $N_{E}$.
