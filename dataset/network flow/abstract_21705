This is an elementary introduction to Wilson renormalization group and
continuum effective field theories. We first review the idea of Wilsonian
effective theory and derive the flow equation in a form that allows multiple
insertion of operators in Green functions. Then, based on this formalism, we
prove decoupling and heavy-mass factorization theorems, and discuss how the
continuum effective field theory is formulated in this approach.
