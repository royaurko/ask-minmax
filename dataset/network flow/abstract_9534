We examine a node centrality measure based on the notion of total
communicability, defined in terms of the row sums of the exponential of the
adjacency matrix of the network. We argue that this is a natural metric for
ranking nodes in a network, and we point out that it can be computed very
rapidly even in the case of large networks. Furthermore, we propose the total
sum of node communicabilities as a useful measure of network connectivity.
Extensive numerical studies are conducted in order to compare this centrality
measure with the closely related ones of subgraph centrality [E. Estrada and J.
A. Rodriguez-Velazquez, Phys. Rev. E, 71 (2005), 056103] and Katz centrality
[L. Katz, Psychometrica, 18 (1953), pp. 39-43]. Both synthetic and real-world
networks are used in the computations.
