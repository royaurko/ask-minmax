We explore the possibility to interpret as a 'gas' the dynamical
self-organized scale-free network recently introduced by Kim et al (2005). The
role of 'momentum' of individual nodes is played by the degree of the node, the
'configuration space' (metric defining distance between nodes) being determined
by the dynamically evolving adjacency matrix. In a constant-size network
process, 'inelastic' interactions occur between pairs of nodes, which are
realized by the merger of a pair of two nodes into one. The resulting node
possesses the union of all links of the previously separate nodes. We consider
chemostat conditions, i.e., for each merger there will be a newly created node
which is then linked to the existing network randomly. We also introduce an
interaction 'potential' (node-merging probability) which decays with distance
d_ij as 1/d_ij^alpha; alpha >= 0). We numerically exhibit that this system
exhibits nonextensive statistics in the degree distribution, and calculate how
the entropic index q depends on alpha. The particular cases alpha=0 and alpha
to infinity recover the two models introduced by Kim et al.
