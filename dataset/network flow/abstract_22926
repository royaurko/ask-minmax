The problem of damping a system of linear oscillators is considered. The
problem is solved by using a control in the form of dry friction. The motion of
the system under the control is governed by a system of differential equations
with a discontinuous right-hand side. A uniqueness and continuity theorem is
proved for the phase flow of this system. Thus, the control in the form of
generalized dry friction defines the motion of the system of oscillators
uniquely.
