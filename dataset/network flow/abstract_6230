Recent studies show that many types of human social activities, from
scientific collaborations to sexual contacts, can be understood in terms of
complex network of interactions. Such networking paradigm allows to model many
aspects of social behaviour with relatively simple computer models. The present
work investigates the influence of single leaders on opinion formation within
simulations of agent based artificial networked societies. Several types of
network systems (among them random networks, highly clustered, small world and
scale-free) are studied. The strength of the social influence of individuals is
assumed to be dictated by distance from an agent to another, as well as
individual strengths of the agents. We study the effect of different topologies
on the conditions of general acceptance of leader's opinion by the society.
