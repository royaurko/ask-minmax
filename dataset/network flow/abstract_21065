A new ac calorimeter, utilizing the Peltier effect of a thermocouple junction
as an ac power source, is described. This Peltier ac calorimeter allows to
measure the absolute value of heat capacity of small solid samples with
sub-milligrams of mass. The calorimeter can also be used as a dynamic one with
a dynamic range of several decades at low frequencies.
