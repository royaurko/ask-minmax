The asymptotic behaviour of dynamical processes in networks can be expressed
as a function of spectral properties of the Adjacency and Laplacian matrices.
Although many theoretical results are known for the spectra of traditional
configuration models, networks generated through these models fail to describe
many topological features of real-world networks, in particular non-null values
for the clustering coefficient. Here we study the effects of cycles or order
three (triangles) in network spectra. By using recent advances in random matrix
theory, we determine the spectrum distribution of the network Adjacency matrix
as a function of the average number of triangles attached to each node for
networks without modular structure and degree-degree correlations. Furthermore
we show that cycles of order three have a weak influence on the Laplacian
eigenvalues, fact that explains the recent controversy on the dynamics of
clustered networks. Our findings can shed light in the study of how particular
kinds of subgraphs influence network dynamics.
