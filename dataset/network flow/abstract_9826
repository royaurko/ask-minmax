The gravity water wave black (GWBH) hole analog discovered by Schutzhold and
Unruh (SU) is extended to allow for the presence of turbulent shear flow. The
Riemannian geometry of turbulent black holes (BH) analogs in water waves is
computed in the case of laminar tirbulent shear flow. The Riemann curvature is
constant and the geodesic deviation equation shows that the curvature acts
locally as a diverging lens and the stream lines on opposite sides of the
analog black hole flow apart from each other. In this case it is shown that the
curvature quantities can be expressed in terms of the Newtonian gravitational
constant in the ergoregion. The dispersion relation is obtained for the case of
constant flow injection.
