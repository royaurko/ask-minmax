Phylogenetic networks are rooted acyclic directed graphs in which the leaves
are identified with members of a set X of species. The cluster of a vertex is
the set of leaves that are descendants of the vertex. A network is
"distinct-cluster" if distinct vertices have distinct clusters. This paper
focuses on the set DC(X) of distinct-cluster networks whose leaves are
identified with the members of X. For a fixed X, a metric on DC(X) is defined.
There is a "cluster-preserving" simplification process by which vertices or
certain arcs may be removed without changing the clusters of any remaining
vertices. Many of the resulting networks may be uniquely determined without
regard to the order of the simplifying operations.
