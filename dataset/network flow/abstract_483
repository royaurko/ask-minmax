A cross-layer design along with an optimal resource allocation framework is
formulated for wireless fading networks, where the nodes are allowed to perform
network coding. The aim is to jointly optimize end-to-end transport layer
rates, network code design variables, broadcast link flows, link capacities,
average power consumption, and short-term power allocation policies. As in the
routing paradigm where nodes simply forward packets, the cross-layer
optimization problem with network coding is non-convex in general. It is proved
however, that with network coding, dual decomposition for multicast is optimal
so long as the fading at each wireless link is a continuous random variable.
This lends itself to provably convergent subgradient algorithms, which not only
admit a layered-architecture interpretation but also optimally integrate
network coding in the protocol stack. The dual algorithm is also paired with a
scheme that yields near-optimal network design variables, namely multicast
end-to-end rates, network code design quantities, flows over the broadcast
links, link capacities, and average power consumption. Finally, an asynchronous
subgradient method is developed, whereby the dual updates at the physical layer
can be affordably performed with a certain delay with respect to the resource
allocation tasks in upper layers. This attractive feature is motivated by the
complexity of the physical layer subproblem, and is an adaptation of the
subgradient method suitable for network control.
