Chaotic functions are characterized by sensitivity to initial conditions,
transitivity, and regularity. Providing new functions with such properties is a
real challenge. This work shows that one can associate with any Boolean network
a continuous function, whose discrete-time iterations are chaotic if and only
if the iteration graph of the Boolean network is strongly connected. Then,
sufficient conditions for this strong connectivity are expressed on the
interaction graph of this network, leading to a constructive method of chaotic
function computation. The whole approach is evaluated in the chaos-based
pseudo-random number generation context.
