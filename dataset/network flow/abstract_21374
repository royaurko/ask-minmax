This is a pedagogical introduction to the basics of the cosmic string theory
and also a review of the recent progress made with respect to the macrophysical
predictions of the theory. Topics covered include, string formation and
evolution, large scale structure formation, generation of peculiar velocity
flows, cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations, lensing, gravitational
waves and constraints from the msec pulsar. Particular emphasis is placed on
the signatures predicted on the CMB and the corresponding non-gaussian
features.
