Leaky waveguide has been adopted in communication based train control (CBTC)
systems, as it can significantly enhance railway network efficiency, safety and
capacity. Since CBTC systems have high requirements for the train ground
communications, modeling the leaky waveguide channels is very important to
design the wireless networks and evaluate the performance of CBTC systems. In
the letter, we develop a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) model for leaky
waveguide channels in CBTC systems based on real field channel measurements
obtained from a business operating subway line. The proposed FSMC channel model
takes train locations into account to have a more accurate channel model. The
overall leaky waveguide is divided into intervals, and an FSMC model is applied
in each interval. The accuracy of the proposed FSMC model is illustrated by the
simulation results generated from the model and the real field measurement
results.
