The present paper proposes a stochastic model of the traffic flow. This model
has a discrete set of states and the continuous time. The model is a
generalization of the discrete stochastis model that has been considered in a
previous paper of this contributors collective, for the case of a mixed traffic flow
which consists of "fast" and "slow" vehicles. Moreover the continuous time
model allows to developed the manner for estimation of characteristics of the
traffic flow.
