This paper introduces a novel algorithm, the Active Virtual Network
Management Protocol (AVNMP), for predictive network management. It explains how
the AVNMP facilitates the management of an active network by allowing future
predicted state information within an active network to be available to network
management algorithms. This is accomplished by coupling ideas from optimistic
discrete event simulation with active networking. The optimistic discrete event
simulation method used is a form of self-adjusting Time Warp. It is
self-adjusting because the system adjusts for predictions which are inaccurate
beyond a given tolerance. The concept of a streptichron and autoanaplasis are
introduced as mechanisms which take advantage of the enhanced flexibility and
intelligence of active packets. Finally, it is demonstrated that the AVNMP is a
feasible concept.
