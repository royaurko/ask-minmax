We study the dynamics of Josephson junction arrays with positional disorder
and driven by an external current. We consider weak magnetic fields,
corresponding to a frustration $f=n+1/25$ with $n$ integer. We find that above
the critical current $i_c$ there is a plastic flow of vortices, where most of
the vortices are pinned and only a few vortices flow through channels. This
dynamical regime is characterized by strong fluctuations of the total
vorticity. The number of the flow channels grow with increasing bias current.
At larger currents there is a dynamical regime characterized by the homogeneous
motion of all the vortices, i.e. a flux flow regime. We find a dynamical phase
transition between the plastic flow and the flux flow regimes when analyzing
voltage-voltage correlation functions.
