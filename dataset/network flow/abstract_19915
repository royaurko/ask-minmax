The High Level Trigger (HLT) system of the ALICE experiment is an online
event filter and trigger system designed for input bandwidths of up to 25 GB/s
at event rates of up to 1 kHz. The system is designed as a scalable PC cluster,
implementing several hundred nodes. The transport of data in the system is
handled by an object-oriented data flow framework operating on the basis of the
publisher-subscriber principle, being designed fully pipelined with lowest
processing overhead and communication latency in the cluster. In this paper, we
report the latest measurements where this framework has been operated on five
different sites over a global north-south link extending more than 10,000 km,
processing a ``real-time'' data flow.
