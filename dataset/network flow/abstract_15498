These days MANET is an amazing remarkably altering or rising technology, for
the reason that of its elite nature of scattered mobile devices and self
motivated network topology. The mobile adhoc routing protocol follows several
principles in wireless MANETs. The up to date and novel applications based on
wireless technology are being produced in the private as well as commercial
sectors. A lot of challenges which are facing wireless MANETs like network
stability, security, energy efficiency and performance analysis etc. At present
wireless adhoc network get much more attention because of its accessibility
everywhere. As a result researchers produce several routing protocols. In this
paper first of all we analyzed the performance investigation of wireless
routing protocols on the basis of ROH, throughput, end to end delay and PDR.
After that we proposed an Mixed Routing Protocol framework which improve
performance.
