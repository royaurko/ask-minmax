For creation of a noisy non-stationary spectrometer working in the subTHz
frequency range the power and spectral characteristics of a flux flow
oscillator (FFO), based on a long Josephson junction are studied. The effect of
various bias current profiles on the spectral linewidth of long overlap
Josephson junction are investigated and comparison with the inline junction
geometry is outlined. It has been demonstrated that the spectral linewidth can
be increased by a factor of three with the moderate reduction of emitted power.
