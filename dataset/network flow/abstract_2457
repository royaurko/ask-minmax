This paper proposes a variational approach to describe the evolution of
organization of complex systems from first principles, as increased efficiency
of physical action. Most simply stated, physical action is the product of the
energy and time necessary for motion. When complex systems are modeled as flow
networks, this efficiency is defined as a decrease of action for one element to
cross between two nodes, or endpoints of motion - a principle of least unit
action. We find a connection with another principle that of most total action,
or a tendency for increase of the total action of a system. This increase
provides more energy and time for minimization of the constraints to motion in
order to decrease unit action, and therefore to increase organization. Also,
with the decrease of unit action in a system, its capacity for total amount of
action increases. We present a model of positive feedback between action
efficiency and the total amount of action in a complex system, based on a
system of ordinary differential equations, which leads to an exponential growth
with time of each and a power law relation between the two. We present an
agreement of our model with data for core processing units of computers. This
approach can help to describe, measure, manage, design and predict future
behavior of complex systems to achieve the highest rates of self-organization
and robustness.
