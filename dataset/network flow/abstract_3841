Admission control can be employed to avoid congestion in queueing networks
subject to overload. In distributed networks the admission decisions are often
based on imperfect measurements on the network state. This paper studies how
the lack of complete state information affects the system performance by
considering a simple network model for distributed admission control. The
stability region of the network is characterized and it is shown how feedback
signaling makes the system very sensitive to its parameters.
