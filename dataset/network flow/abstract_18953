Source-specific routing (not to be confused with source routing) is a routing
technique where routing decisions depend on both the source and the destination
address of a packet. Source-specific routing solves some difficult problems
related to multihoming, notably in edge networks, and is therefore a useful
addition to the multihoming toolbox. In this paper, we describe the semantics
of source-specific packet forwarding, and describe the design and
implementation of a source-specific extension to the Babel routing protocol as
well as its implementation - to our knowledge, the first complete
implementation of a source-specific dynamic routing protocol, including a
disambiguation algorithm that makes our implementation work over widely
available networking APIs. We further discuss interoperability between ordinary
next-hop and source-specific dynamic routing protocols. Our implementation has
seen a moderate amount of deployment, notably as a testbed for the IETF Homenet
working group.
