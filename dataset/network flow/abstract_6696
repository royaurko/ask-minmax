Mobility is one of the basic features that define an ad hoc network, an asset
that leaves the field free for the nodes to move. The most important aspect of
this kind of network turns into a great disadvantage when it comes to
commercial applications, take as an example: the automotive networks that allow
communication between a groups of vehicles. The ad hoc on-demand distance
vector (AODV) routing protocol, designed for mobile ad hoc networks, has two
main functions. First, it enables route establishment between a source and a
destination node by initiating a route discovery process. Second, it maintains
the active routes, which means finding alternative routes in a case of a link
failure and deleting routes when they are no longer desired. In a highly mobile
network those are demanding tasks to be performed efficiently and accurately.
In this paper, we focused in the first point to enhance the local decision of
each node in the network by the quantification of the mobility of their
neighbours. Quantification is made around RSSI algorithm a well known distance
estimation method.
