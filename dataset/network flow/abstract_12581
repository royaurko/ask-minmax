Most theoretical tools available for the analysis of spreading processes over
networks assume exponentially distributed transmission and recovery times. In
practice, the empirical distribution of transmission times for many real
spreading processes, such as the spread of web content through the Internet,
are far from exponential. In particular, the inter-arrival time of Twitter
messages or the propagation time of news stories on a social media site can be
explained using lognormal distributions. To bridge this gap between theory and
practice, we propose a methodology to model and analyze spreading processes
with arbitrary transmission times using phase-type distributions. Phase-type
distributions are a family of distributions that is dense in the set of
positive-valued distributions and can be used to approximate any given
distributions. To illustrate our methodology, we focus on a popular model of
spreading over networks: the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) networked
model. In the standard version of this model, individuals informed about a
piece of information transmit this piece to its neighbors at an exponential
rate. In this paper, we extend this model to the case of transmission rates
following a phase-type distribution. Using this extended model, we analyze the
dynamics of the spread based on a vectorial representations of phase-type
distributions. We illustrate our results by analyzing spreading processes over
networks with transmission and recovery rates following a Weibull distribution.
