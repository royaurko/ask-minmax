In the consensus model with bounded confidence, studied by Deffuant et al.
(2000), two randomly selected people who differ not too much in their opinion
both shift their opinions towards each other. Now we restrict this exchange of
information to people connected by a scale-free network. As a result, the
number of different final opinions (when no complete consensus is formed) is
proportional to the number of people.
