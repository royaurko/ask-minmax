Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a revolutionary network architecture
that separates out network control functions from the underlying equipment and
is an increasingly trend to help enterprises build more manageable data centers
where big data processing emerges as an important part of applications. To
concurrently process large-scale data, MapReduce with an open source
implementation named Hadoop is proposed. In practical Hadoop systems one kind
of issue that vitally impacts the overall performance is know as the
NP-complete minimum make span problem. One main solution is to assign tasks on
data local nodes to avoid link occupation since network bandwidth is a scarce
resource. Many methodologies for enhancing data locality are proposed such as
the HDS and state-of-the-art scheduler BAR. However, all of them either ignore
allocating tasks in a global view or disregard available bandwidth as the basis
for scheduling. In this paper we propose a heuristic bandwidth-aware task
scheduler BASS to combine Hadoop with SDN. It is not only able to guarantee
data locality in a global view but also can efficiently assign tasks in an
optimized way. Both examples and experiments demonstrate that BASS has the best
performance in terms of job completion time. To our knowledge, BASS is the
first to exploit talent of SDN for big data processing and we believe it points
out a new trend for large-scale data processing.
