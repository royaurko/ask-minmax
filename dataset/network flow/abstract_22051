The depinning current Ic versus applied magnetic field B close to the
transition temperature Tc of Nb thin films with randomly diluted triangular
arrays of antidots is investigated. % Our experiments confirm essential
features in Ic(B) as predicted by Reichhardt and Olson Reichhardt [Phys.Rev. B
76, 094512 (2007)]. % We show that, by introducing disorder into periodic
pinning arrays, Ic can be enhanced. % In particular, for arrays with fixed
density n_p of antidots, an increase in dilution Pd induces an increase in Ic
and decrease of the flux-flow voltage for B>Bp=n_p Phi_0.
