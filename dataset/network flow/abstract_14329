We determine the exact beta function and a RG flow Lyapunov function for N=2
SYM with gauge group SU(n). It turns out that the classical discriminants
of the Seiberg-Witten curves determine the RG potential. The radial
irreversibility of the RG flow in the SU(2) case and the non-perturbative
identity relating the $u$-modulus and the superconformal anomaly, indicate the
existence of a four dimensional analogue of the c-theorem for N=2 SYM which we
formulate for the full SU(n) theory. Our investigation provides further
evidence of the essentially topological nature of the theory.
