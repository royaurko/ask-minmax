Three-dimensional miscible Rayleigh--Taylor (RT) turbulence at small Atwood
number and at Prandtl number one is investigated by means of high resolution
direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations. RT turbulence is a
paradigmatic time-dependent turbulent system in which the integral scale grows
in time following the evolution of the mixing region. In order to fully
characterize the statistical properties of the flow, both temporal and spatial
behavior of relevant statistical indicators have been analyzed.
  Scaling of both global quantities ({\it e.g.}, Rayleigh, Nusselt and Reynolds
numbers) and scale dependent observables built in terms of velocity and
temperature fluctuations are considered. We extend the mean-field analysis for
velocity and temperature fluctuations to take into account intermittency, both
in time and space domains. We show that the resulting scaling exponents are
compatible with those of classical Navier--Stokes turbulence advecting a
passive scalar at comparable Reynolds number. Our results support the scenario
of universality of turbulence with respect to both the injection mechanism and
the geometry of the flow.
