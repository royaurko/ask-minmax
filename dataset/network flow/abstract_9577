Many social networks in our daily life are bipartite networks built on
reciprocity. How can we recommend users/friends to a user, so that the user is
interested in and attractive to recommended users? In this research, we propose
a new collaborative filtering model to improve user recommendations in
reciprocal and bipartite social networks. The model considers a user's "taste"
in picking others and "attractiveness" in being picked by others. A case study
of an online dating network shows that the new model has good performance in
recommending both initial and reciprocal contacts.
