We consider 2D Dirac fermions in the presence of three types of disorder:
random scalar potential, random gauge potential and random mass with long-range
correlations decaying as a power law. Using various methods such as the
self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA), renormalization group (RG), the
matrix Green function formalism and bosonisation we calculate the density of
states and study the full counting statistics of fermionic transport at lower
energy. The SCBA and RG show that the random correlated scalar potentials
generate an algebraically small energy scale below which the density of states
saturates to a constant value. For correlated random gauge potential, RG and
bosonisation calculations provide consistent behavior of the density of states
which diverges at zero energy in an integrable way. In the case of correlated
random mass disorder the RG flow has a nontrivial infrared stable fixed point
leading to a universal power-law behavior of the density of states and also to
universal transport properties. In contrast to uncorrelated case the correlated
scalar potential and random mass disorders give rise to deviation from the
pseudodiffusive transport already to lowest order in disorder strength.
