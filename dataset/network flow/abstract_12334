We investigate the use of distributed PID actions to achieve consensus in
networks of homogeneous and heterogeneous linear systems. Convergence of the
strategy is proved for both cases using appropriate state transformations and
Lyapunov functions. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated
via its application to a representative power grid model recently presented in
the literature.
