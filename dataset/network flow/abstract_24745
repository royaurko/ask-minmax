This paper presents the Deep Convolution Inverse Graphics Network (DC-IGN), a
model that learns an interpretable representation of images. This
representation is disentangled with respect to transformations such as
out-of-plane rotations and lighting variations. The DC-IGN model is composed of
multiple layers of convolution and de-convolution operators and is trained
using the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) algorithm. We propose a
training procedure to encourage neurons in the graphics code layer to represent
a specific transformation (e.g. pose or light). Given a single input image, our
model can generate new images of the same object with variations in pose and
lighting. We present qualitative and quantitative results of the model's
efficacy at learning a 3D rendering engine.
