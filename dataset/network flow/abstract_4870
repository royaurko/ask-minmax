This paper analyses the effects of small injection/suction Reynolds number,
Hartmann number, permeability parameter and wave number on a viscous
incompressilbe electrically conduction fluid flow in a parallel porous channel.
The plates of the channel with small constant injection/suction, have constant
temperature. The upper plate is allowed to mouve in flow direction and the
lower plate is kept at rest. A magnetic field of uniform strength is also
applied normally to the plates what are parallel. The originality of the paper
is to study the effect of the above parameter in temporal linear stabilty
analysis of the flow throught the modified Orr-Sommerfeld equation.
