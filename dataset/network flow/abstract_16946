We study the properties of junctions created by crossing of N identical
branches of linear discrete networks. We reveal that for N>2 such a junction
creates a topological defect and supports two types of spatially localized
modes. We analyze the wave scattering by the junction defect and demonstrate
nonzero reflection for any set of parameters. If the junction is nonlinear, it
is possible to achieve the maximum transmission for any frequency by tuning the
intensity of the scattering wave. In addition, near the maximum transmission
the system shows the bistable behaviour.
