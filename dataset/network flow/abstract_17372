It is shown that time-harmonic hypersurface motions in various, conformally
flat, N-dimensional manifolds admit a multilinear description, dL/dt={ L, M_1,
... , M_{N-2} }, automatically generating infinitely many conserved quantities,
as well as leading to new (integrable) matrix equations. Interestingly, the
conformal factor can be changed without changing L.
