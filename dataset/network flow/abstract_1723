By using real space renormalisation group (RG) methods we show that
spin-glasses in a field display a new kind of transition in high dimensions.
The corresponding critical properties and the spin-glass phase are governed by
two non-perturbative zero temperature fixed points of the RG flow. We compute
the critical exponents, discuss the RG flow and its relevance for three
dimensional systems. The new spin-glass phase we discovered has unusual
properties, which are intermediate between the ones conjectured by droplet and
full replica symmetry breaking theories. These results provide a new
perspective on the long-standing debate about the behaviour of spin-glasses in
a field.
