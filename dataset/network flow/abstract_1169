We analyze the effect of blood flow through large arteries of peripheral
circulation on heat transfer in living tissue. Blood flow in such arteries
gives rise to fast heat propagation over large scales, which is described in
terms of heat superdiffusion. The corresponding bioheat heat equation is
derived. In particular, we show that under local strong heating of a small
tissue domain the temperature distribution inside the surrounding tissue is
affected substantially by heat superdiffusion.
