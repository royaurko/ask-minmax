Network updates such as policy and routing changes occur frequently in
Software Defined Networks (SDN). Updates should be performed consistently,
preventing temporary disruptions, and should require as little overhead as
possible. Scalability is increasingly becoming an essential requirement in SDN.
In this paper we propose to use time-triggered network updates to achieve
consistent updates. Our proposed solution requires lower overhead than existing
update approaches, without compromising the consistency during the update. We
demonstrate that accurate time enables far more scalable consistent updates in
SDN than previously available. In addition, it provides the SDN programmer with
fine-grained control over the tradeoff between consistency and scalability.
