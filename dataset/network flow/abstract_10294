We study the existence of left invariant closed $G_2$-structures defining a
Ricci soliton metric on simply connected nonabelian nilpotent Lie groups.
  For each one of these $G_2$-structures, we show long time existence and
uniqueness of solution for the Laplacian flow on the noncompact manifold.
Moreover, considering the Laplacian flow on the associated Lie algebra as a
bracket flow on $\R^7$ in a similar way as in [23] we prove that the underlying
metrics $g(t)$ of the solution converge smoothly, up to pull-back by
time-dependent diffeomorphisms, to a flat metric, uniformly on compact sets in
the nilpotent Lie group, as $t$ goes to infinity.
