Lattice Boltzmann simulations are used to explore the behavior of liquid
crystals subject to Poiseuille flow. In the nematic regime at low shear rates
we find two possible steady state configurations of the director field. The
selected state depends on both the shear rate and the history of the sample.
For both director configurations there is clear evidence of shear-thinning, a
decrease in the viscosity with increasing shear rate. Moreover, at very high
shear rates or when the order parameter is large, the system transforms to a
log-rolling state with boundary layers that may exhibit oscillatory behavior.
