Chaos control in some of the one- and two-dimensional traffic flow dynamical
models in the mean field theory is studied.One dimensional model is
investigated taking into account the effect of random delay. Two dimensional
model takes into account the effects of overpasses, symmetric distribution of
cars and blockages of cars moving in the same direction. Chaos synchronization
is performed within both replica and nonreplica approaches, and using parameter
perturbation method.
