Confidentiality, integrity and authentication are more relevant issues in Ad
hoc networks than in wired fixed networks. One way to address these issues is
the use of symmetric key cryptography, relying on a secret key shared by all
members of the network. But establishing and maintaining such a key (also
called the session key) is a non-trivial problem. We show that Group Key
Agreement (GKA) protocols are suitable for establishing and maintaining such a
session key in these dynamic networks. We take an existing GKA protocol, which
is robust to connectivity losses and discuss all the issues for good
functioning of this protocol in Ad hoc networks. We give implementation details
and network parameters, which significantly reduce the computational burden of
using public key cryptography in such networks.
