We develop a formalism to study linearized perturbations around the
equilibria of a pure exchange economy. With the use of mean field theory
techniques, we derive equations for the flow of products in an economy driven
by heterogeneous preferences and probabilistic interaction between agents. We
are able to show that if the economic agents have static preferences, which are
also homogeneous in any of the steady states, the final wealth distribution is
independent of the dynamics of the non-equilibrium theory. In particular, it is
completely determined in terms of the initial conditions, and it is independent
of the probability, and the network of interaction between agents. We show that
the main effect of the network is to determine the relaxation time via the
usual eigenvalue gap as in random walks on graphs.
