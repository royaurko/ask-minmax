Security metrics serve as a powerful tool for organizations to understand the
effectiveness of protecting computer networks. However majority of these
measurement techniques don't adequately help corporations to make informed risk
management decisions. In this paper we present a stochastic security framework
for obtaining quantitative measures of security by taking into account the
dynamic attributes associated with vulnerabilities that can change over time.
Our model is novel as existing research in attack graph analysis do not
consider the temporal aspects associated with the vulnerabilities, such as the
availability of exploits and patches which can affect the overall network
security based on how the vulnerabilities are interconnected and leveraged to
compromise the system. In order to have a more realistic representation of how
the security state of the network would vary over time, a nonhomogeneous model
is developed which incorporates a time dependent covariate, namely the
vulnerability age. The daily transition-probability matrices are estimated
using Frei's Vulnerability Lifecycle model. We also leverage the trusted CVSS
metric domain to analyze how the total exploitability and impact measures
evolve over a time period for a given network.
