In this paper we give sufficient conditions for existence of a solution of
cohomological equation for suspension flows over automorphisms of Markov
compacta, which were introduced by Vershik and Ito. The main result (Theorem 1)
can be regarded as a symbolic analogue of results due to Forni and Marmi,
Moussa and Yoccoz for translation flows and interval exchange transformations.
