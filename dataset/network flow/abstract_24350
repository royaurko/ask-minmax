We can perform inference in Bayesian belief networks by enumerating
instantiations with high probability thus approximating the marginals. In this
paper, we present a method for determining the fraction of instantiations that
has to be considered such that the absolute error in the marginals does not
exceed a predefined value. The method is based on extreme value theory.
Essentially, the proposed method uses the reversed generalized Pareto
distribution to model probabilities of instantiations below a given threshold.
Based on this distribution, an estimate of the maximal absolute error if
instantiations with probability smaller than u are disregarded can be made.
