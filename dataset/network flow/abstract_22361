We propose a fluidic continuum model of vacuum and a sink flow model of
microscopic particles. The movements of a microscopic particle driven by a
stochastic force was studied based on stochastic mechanics. We show that there
exists a generalized Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the microscopic particle.
