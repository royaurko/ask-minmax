Plane Couette flow, the flow between two parallel planes moving in opposite
directions, is an example of wall-bounded flow experiencing a transition to
turbulence with an ordered coexistence of turbulent and laminar domains in some
range of Reynolds numbers [R_g,R_t]. When the aspect-ratio is sufficiently
large, this coexistence occurs in the form of alternately turbulent and laminar
oblique bands. As R goes up trough the upper threshold R_t, the bands disappear
progressively to leave room to a uniform regime of featureless turbulence. This
continuous transition is studied here by means of under-resolved numerical
simulations understood as a modelling approach adapted to the long time, large
aspect-ratio limit. The state of the system is quantitatively characterised
using standard observables (turbulent fraction and turbulence intensity inside
the bands). A pair of complex order parameters is defined for the pattern which
is further analysed within a standard Ginzburg--Landau formalism. Coefficients
of the model turn out to be comparable to those experimentally determined for
cylindrical Couette flow.
