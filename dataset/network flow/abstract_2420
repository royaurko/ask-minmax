The ability to control the speed and polarisation of light pulses will allow
for faster data flow in optical networks of the future. Optical delay and
switching have been achieved using slow-light techniques in various media,
including atomic vapour. Most of these vapour schemes utilise resonant
narrowband techniques for optical switching, but suffer the drawback of having
a limited frequency range or high loss. In contrast, the Faraday effect in a
Doppler-broadened slow-light medium allows polarisation switching over tens of
GHz with high transmission. This large frequency range opens up the possibility
of switching telecommunication bandwidth pulses and probing of dynamics on a
nanosecond timescale. Here we demonstrate the slow-light Faraday effect for
light detuned far from resonance. We show that the polarisation dependent group
index can split a linearly polarised nanosecond pulse into left and right
circularly polarised components. The group index also enhances the spectral
sensitivity of the polarisation rotation, and large rotations of up to 15 pi
rad are observed for continuous-wave light. Finally, we demonstrate dynamic
broadband pulse switching, by rotating a linearly polarised nanosecond pulse
from vertical to horizontal with no distortion and transmission close to unity.
