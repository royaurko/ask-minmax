Community structure identification has been one of the most popular research
areas in recent years due to its applicability to the wide scale of
disciplines. To detect communities in varied topics, there have been many
algorithms proposed so far. However, most of them still have some drawbacks to
be addressed. In this paper, we present an agent-based based community
detection algorithm. The algorithm that is a stochastic one makes use of agents
by forcing them to perform biased moves in a smart way. Using the information
collected by the traverses of these agents in the network, the network
structure is revealed. Also, the network modularity is used for determining the
number of communities. Our algorithm removes the need for prior knowledge about
the network such as number of the communities or any threshold values.
Furthermore, the definite community structure is provided as a result instead
of giving some structures requiring further processes. Besides, the
computational and time costs are optimized because of using thread like working
agents. The algorithm is tested on three network data of different types and
sizes named Zachary karate club, college football and political books. For all
three networks, the real network structures are identified in almost every run.
