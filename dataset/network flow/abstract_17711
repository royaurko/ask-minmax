We establish the renormalization property for essentially bounded solutions
of the continuity equation associated to $BV$ fields in Wiener spaces, with
values in the associated Cameron-Martin space; thus obtaining, by standard
arguments, new uniqueness and stability results for correspondent Lagrangian
$L^\infty$-flows. An example related to Neumann elliptic problems is also
discussed.
