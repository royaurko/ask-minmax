The objective of this paper is to implement the Trie based Tuple Space
Search(TTSS) packet classification algorithm for Network Processor(NP) based
router to enhance multimedia applications. The performance is evaluated using
Intel IXP2400 NP Simulator. The results demonstrate that, TTSS has better
performance than Tuple Space Search algorithm and is well suited to achieve
high speed packet classification to support multimedia applications.
