We present Hubble Space Telescope/WFPC2 images of sixteen dwarf galaxies as
part of our snapshot survey of nearby galaxy candidates. We derive their
distances from the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch stars with a
typical accuracy of ~12%. The resulting distances are 4.26 Mpc (KKH 5), 4.74
Mpc (KK 16), 4.72 Mpc (KK 17), 4.66 Mpc (ESO 115-021), 4.43 Mpc (KKH 18), 3.98
Mpc (KK 27), 4.61 Mpc (KKH 34), 4.99 Mpc (KK 54), 4.23 Mpc (ESO 490-017), 4.90
Mpc (FG 202), 5.22 Mpc (UGC 3755), 5.18 Mpc (UGC 3974), 4.51 Mpc (KK 65), 5.49
Mpc (UGC 4115), 3.78 Mpc (NGC 2915), and 5.27 Mpc (NGC 6503). Based on
distances and radial velocities of 156 nearby galaxies, we plot the local
velocity-distance relation, which has a slope of H_0 = 73 km/(c * Mpc) and a
radial velocity dispersion of 85 km/s. When members of the M81 and CenA groups
are removed, and distance errors are taken into account, the radial velocity
dispersion drops to sigma_v=41 km/s. The local Hubble flow within 5 Mpc exibits
a significant anisotropy, with two infall peculiar velocity regions directed
towards the Supergalactic poles. However, two observed regions of outflow
peculiar velocity, situated on the Supergalactic equator, are far away (~50
degr.) from the Virgo/anti-Virgo direction, which disagrees with a spherically
symmetric Virgo-centric flow. About 63% of galaxies within 5 Mpc belong to
known compact and loose groups. Apart from them, we found six new probable
groups, consisting entirely of dwarf galaxies.
