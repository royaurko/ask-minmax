Nuclear stopping in heavy ion collisions (HIC) has been studied by means of
rapidity distribution and asymmetry of nucleon momentum distribution. It is an
important quantity in determining the outcome of a reaction. Fen Fu {\it et
al.,} \cite{2} calculate both the radial flow and the degree of nuclear
stopping in Pb + Pb and Ni + Ni at 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 GeV/neucleon. They found
that the expansion velocity as well as the degree of nuclear stopping are
higher in the heavier system at all energies.
