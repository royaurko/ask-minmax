We have developed a modified Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automata model for
describing a conflicting vehicular traffic flow at the intersection of two
streets. No traffic lights control the traffic flow. The approaching cars to
the intersection yield to each other to avoid collision. Closed boundary
condition is applied to the streets. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations is taken
into account to find the model characteristics. In particular, we obtain the
fundamental diagrams and show that the effect of interaction of two streets can
be regarded as a dynamic impurity located at the intersection point. Our
results suggest that yielding mechanism gives rise to a high total flow
throughout the intersection especially in the low density regime. In some
ranges of densities, yielding mechanism even improves and regulates the flow in
comparison to the absence of perpendicular flow.
