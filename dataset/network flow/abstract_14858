In the above paper the contributors treat the boundary layer flow along a
stationary, vertical, permeable, flat plate within a vertical free stream.
Fluid is sucked or injected through the vertical plate. The fluid species
concentration at the plate is constant and different from that of the ambient
fluid. It is also assumed that the plate is heated by convection from another
fluid with constant temperature with a constant heat transfer coefficient. The
temperature and species concentration difference between the plate and the
ambient fluid creates buoyancy forces and the flow is characterized as mixed
convection. The partial differential equations of the boundary layer flow (Eqs.
1-4 in their paper) are transformed and subsequently are solved numerically
using an implicit finite difference scheme in combination with a
quasi-linearization technique. The quasi-linearization technique is a
Newton-Raphson method. The results are presented in 12 figures.
