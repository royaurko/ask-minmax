During the last decade of network research focusing on structural and
dynamical properties of networks, the role of network users has been more or
less underestimated from the bird's-eye view of global perspective. In this era
of global positioning system equipped smartphones, however, a user's ability to
access local geometric information and find efficient pathways on networks
plays a crucial role, rather than the globally optimal pathways. We present a
simple greedy spatial navigation strategy as a probe to explore spatial
networks. These greedy navigators use directional information in every move
they take, without being trapped in a dead end based on their memory about
previous routes. We suggest that the centralities measures have to be modified
to incorporate the navigators' behavior, and present the intriguing effect of
navigators' greediness where removing some edges may actually enhance the
routing efficiency, which is reminiscent of Braess's paradox. In addition,
using samples of road structures in large cities around the world, it is shown
that the navigability measure we define reflects unique structural properties,
which are not easy to predict from other topological characteristics. In this
respect, we believe that our routing scheme significantly moves the routing
problem on networks one step closer to reality, incorporating the inevitable
incompleteness of navigators' information.
