We consider correlation functions for string theory on AdS_3. We analyze
their singularities and we provide a physical interpretation for them. We
explain which worldsheet correlation functions have a sensible physical
interpretation in terms of the boundary theory. We consider the operator
product expansion of the four point function and we find that it factorizes
only if a certain condition is obeyed. We explain that this is the correct
physical result. We compute correlation functions involving spectral flowed
operators and we derive a constraint on the amount of winding violation.
