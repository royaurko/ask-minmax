In order to survive, reproduce and (in multicellular organisms)
differentiate, cells must control the concentrations of the myriad different
proteins that are encoded in the genome. The precision of this control is
limited by the inevitable randomness of individual molecular events. Here we
explore how cells can maximize their control power in the presence of these
physical limits; formally, we solve the theoretical problem of maximizing the
information transferred from inputs to outputs when the number of available
molecules is held fixed. We start with the simplest version of the problem, in
which a single transcription factor protein controls the readout of one or more
genes by binding to DNA. We further simplify by assuming that this regulatory
network operates in steady state, that the noise is small relative to the
available dynamic range, and that the target genes do not interact. Even in
this simple limit, we find a surprisingly rich set of optimal solutions.
Importantly, for each locally optimal regulatory network, all parameters are
determined once the physical constraints on the number of available molecules
are specified. Although we are solving an over--simplified version of the
problem facing real cells, we see parallels between the structure of these
optimal solutions and the behavior of actual genetic regulatory networks.
Subsequent papers will discuss more complete versions of the problem.
