We study the influence of a temperature-dependent shear viscosity over
entropy density ratio $\eta/s$, different shear relaxation times $\tau_\pi$, as
well as different initial conditions on the transverse momentum spectra of
charged hadrons and identified particles. We investigate the azimuthal flow
asymmetries as a function of both collision energy and centrality. The elliptic
flow coefficient turns out to be dominated by the hadronic viscosity at RHIC
energies. Only at higher collision energies the impact of the viscosity in the
QGP phase is visible in the flow asymmetries. Nevertheless, the shear viscosity
near the QCD transition region has the largest impact on the collective flow of
the system. We also find that the centrality dependence of the elliptic flow is
sensitive to the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$.
