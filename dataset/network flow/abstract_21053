We propose a scaling theory of 2D metal insulator transition discovered by
Kravchenko and coworkers. In this theory conductance/resistance duality is an
exact relation. The exponent of the stretched exponential in $\sigma(T)$ is
determined by the temperature dependence of the coherence length. The
quantum-chaotic nature of the transition is manifested in the square form of
the phenomenological scaling function.
