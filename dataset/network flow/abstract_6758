We revisit Bondi flows on black holes, naked singularities and neutron stars
keeping in mind recent progress in understanding of the flow behaviour near
compact objects. In an adiabatic spherical accretion on black holes and naked
singularities, standing shock waves do not form, but shocks on neutron stars
may or may not form depending on the boundary conditions. For low accretion
rates (hard state), these objects may behave similarly. However, for high
accretion rates (soft state), the converging flow on a black hole will produce
a weak hard tail of energy spectral slope of $\sim 1.5$ (apart from the soft
bump) while the flow on a neutron star or a naked singularity will have no hard
tail. The soft bumps of neutron star candidates may generally be at higher
energies than those of naked singularities.
