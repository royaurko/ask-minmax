The problem of searching for experts in a given academic field is hugely
important in both industry and academia. We study exactly this issue with
respect to a database of contributors and their publications. The idea is to use
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to perform
topic modelling in order to find contributors who have worked in a query field. We
then construct a cocontributorship graph and motivate the use of influence
maximisation and a variety of graph centrality measures to obtain a ranked list
of experts. The ranked lists are further improved using a Markov Chain-based
rank aggregation approach. The complete method is readily scalable to large
datasets. To demonstrate the efficacy of the approach we report on an extensive
set of computational simulations using the Arnetminer dataset. An improvement
in mean average precision is demonstrated over the baseline case of simply
using the order of contributors found by the topic models.
