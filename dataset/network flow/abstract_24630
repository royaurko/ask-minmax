In this paper, we are concerned with the weighted backup 2-center problem on
a tree. The backup 2-center problem is a kind of center facility location
problem, in which one is asked to deploy two facilities, with a given
probability to fail, in a network. Given that the two facilities do not fail
simultaneously, the goal is to find two locations, possibly on edges, that
minimize the expected value of the maximum distance over all vertices to their
closest functioning facility. In the weighted setting, each vertex in the
network is associated with a nonnegative weight, and the distance from vertex
$u$ to $v$ is weighted by the weight of $u$. With the strategy of
prune-and-search, we propose a linear time algorithm, which is asymptotically
optimal, to solve the weighted backup 2-center problem on a tree.
