A simple scheme for incompressible, constant density flows is presented,
which avoids odd-even decoupling for the Laplacian on a collocated grids.
Energy stability is implied by maintaining strict energy conservation. Momentum
is conserved. Arbitrary order in space and time can easily be obtained. The
conservation properties hold on transformed grids.
