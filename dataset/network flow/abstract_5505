Solutions for mobility management in wireless networks have been investigated
and proposed in various research projects and standardization bodies. With the
continuing deployment of different access networks, the wider range of
applications tailored for a mobile environment, and a larger diversity of
wireless end systems, it emerged that a single mobility protocol (such as
Mobile IP) is not sufficient to handle the different requirements adequately.
Thus a solution is needed to manage multiple mobility protocols in end systems
and network nodes, to detect and select the required protocols, versions and
optional features, and enable control on running daemons. For this purpose a
mobility toolbox has been developed as part of the EU funded Ambient Networks
project. This paper describes this modular management approach and illustrates
the additional benefits a mobility protocol can gain by using state transfer as
an example.
