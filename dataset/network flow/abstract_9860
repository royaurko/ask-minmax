We first give a precise statement on the short time existence of the Calabi
flow and prove a stability result: any metric near a constant scalar curvature
metric will flow to this cscK metric exponentially fast. Secondly, we prove
that a compactness theorem in space of the kahler metrics given unifrom Ricci
bound and potential bound. As an application, we prove the Calabi flow can be
extended once Ricci curvature stays uniformly bounded. Lastly, we prove a
removing-sigularity result about a weak constant scalar curveture metric in a
punctured ball. One of the main difficulties is that the metric is not assumed
to be smooth outside of the singular point.
