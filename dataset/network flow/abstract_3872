We propose a geometric growth model for weighted scale-free networks, which
is controlled by two tunable parameters. We derive exactly the main
characteristics of the networks, which are partially determined by the
parameters. Analytical results indicate that the resulting networks have
power-law distributions of degree, strength, weight and betweenness, a
scale-free behavior for degree correlations, logarithmic small average path
length and diameter with network size. The obtained properties are in agreement
with empirical data observed in many real-life networks, which shows that the
presented model may provide valuable insight into the real systems.
