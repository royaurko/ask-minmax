We consider the Stokes-Boussinesq (and the stationary
Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq) equations in a slanted, i.e. not aligned with the
gravity's direction, 3d channel and with an arbitrary Rayleigh number. For the
front-like initial data and under the no-slip boundary condition for the flow
and no-flux boundary condition for the reactant temperature, we derive uniform
estimates on the burning rate and the flow velocity, which can be interpreted
as stability results for the laminar front.
