The mechanism of preferential attachment underpins most recent social network
formation models. Yet few contributors attempt to check or quantify assumptions on
this mechanism. We call generalized preferential attachment any kind of
preference to interact with other agents with respect to any node property. We
then introduce tools for measuring empirically and characterizing
comprehensively such phenomena, and apply these tools to a socio-semantic
network of scientific collaborations, investigating in particular homophilic
behavior. This opens the way to a whole class of realistic and credible social
network morphogenesis models.
