A new simple Lagrangian method with favorable stability and efficiency
properties for computing general plane curve evolutions is presented. The
method is based on the flowing finite volume discretization of the intrinsic
partial differential equation for updating the position vector of evolving
family of plane curves. A curve can be evolved in the normal direction by a
combination of fourth order terms related to the intrinsic Laplacian of the
curvature, second order terms related to the curvature, first order terms
related to anisotropy and by a given external velocity field. The evolution is
numerically stabilized by an asymptotically uniform tangential redistribution
of grid points yielding the first order intrinsic advective terms in the
governing system of equations. By using a semi-implicit in time discretization
it can be numerically approximated by a solution to linear penta-diagonal
systems of equations (in presence of the fourth order terms) or tri-diagonal
systems (in the case of the second order terms). Various numerical experiments
of plane curve evolutions, including, in particular, nonlinear, anisotropic and
regularized backward curvature flows, surface diffusion and Willmore flows, are
presented and discussed.
