Nowadays computer networks use different kind of memory whose speeds and
capacities vary widely. There exist methods of a so-called caching which are
intended to use the different kinds of memory in such a way that the frequently
used data are stored in the faster memory, wheres the infrequent ones are
stored in the slower memory. We address the problems of estimating the caching
efficiency and its capacity. We define the efficiency and capacity of the
caching and suggest a method for their estimation based on the analysis of
kinds of the accessible memory.
