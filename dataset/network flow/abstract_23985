The bacterium E.Coli swims in a zig-zag manner, in a series of straight runs
and tumbles occurring alternately, with the run-durations dependent on the
local spatial gradient of chemo-attractants/repellants. This enables the
organism to move towards nutrient sources and move away from toxins. The signal
transduction network of E.Coli has been well-characterized, and theoretical
modeling has been used, with some success, in understanding its many remarkable
features, including the near-perfect adaptation to spatially uniform stimulus.
We study a reduced form of this network, with 3 methylation states for the
receptor instead of 5. We derive an analytical form of the response function of
the tumbling rate and use it to compute the drift velocity of the bacterium in
the presence of a weak spatial attractant gradient.
