The proposed semiclassical theory predicts two types of oscillations in the
flow of current injected from a point source near a ballistic p-n junction in
graphene in a strong magnetic field. One originates from the classical effect
of bunching of cyclotron orbits of electrons passing back and forth across the
p-n interface, which displays a pronounced dependence on the commensurability
between the cyclotron radii in the n- and p-regions. The other effect is caused
by the interference of monochromatic electron waves in p-n junctions with equal
carrier densities on the two sides and it consists in magneto-oscillations in
the current transmission through the interface with periodicity similar to
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations.
