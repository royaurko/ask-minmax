On-line social networks have grown quickly over the last few years and

smartphones allows to access these networks any time from any physical
location. Among the social networks, Twitter offers a particularly large set of

store it in distributed databases using Python scripts. We also illustrate how
geolocated tweets can be used to study the mobility of people in urban areas.
