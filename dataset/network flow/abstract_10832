We study accretion flow dynamics of Galactic transient black hole candidate
(BHC) H 1743-322 during its 2010 outburst by analyzing spectral data using Two
Component (Keplerian and sub-Keplerian) Advective Flow (TCAF) solution, after
its inclusion in XSPEC as a local model. We compare our TCAF solution fitted
results with combined disk black body and power-law model fitted results and
find a similar smooth variation of thermal (Keplerian or disk black body) and
non-thermal (power-law or sub-Keplerian) fluxes/rates in two types of model
fits. For a spectral analysis, 2.5-25 keV spectral data from RXTE PCA
instrument are used. From the TCAF solution fit, accretion flow parameters,
such as Keplerian rate, sub-Keplerian rate, location of centrifugal pressure
supported shock and strength of the shock are extracted, thus providing a
deeper understanding of accretion process and properties of accretion disks
around BHC H 1743-322 during its X-ray outburst. Based on the halo to disk
accretion rate ratio (ARR), shock properties, accretion rates and nature of
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs, if observed) entire outburst is classified
into four different spectral states, such as, hard, hard-intermediate,
soft-intermediate, and soft. From time variation of intrinsic flow parameters
it appears that their evolutions in decline phase do not retrace path of rising
phase. Since our current model does not include magnetic fields, spectral
turnover at energies beyond 500-600 keV cannot be explained.
