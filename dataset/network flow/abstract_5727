We investigate simplified models of computer data networks and examine how
the introduction of additional random links influences the performance of these
net works. In general, the impact of additional random links on the performance
of the network strongly depends on the routing algorithm used in the network.
Significant performance gains can be achieved if the routing is based on
"geometrical distance" or shortest path reduced table routing. With shortest
path full table routing degradation of performance is observed.
