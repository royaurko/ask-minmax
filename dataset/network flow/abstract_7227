In this paper, we consider the problem of exploring structural regularities
of networks by dividing the nodes of a network into groups such that the
members of each group have similar patterns of connections to other groups.
Specifically, we propose a general statistical model to describe network
structure. In this model, group is viewed as hidden or unobserved quantity and
it is learned by fitting the observed network data using the
expectation-maximization algorithm. Compared with existing models, the most
prominent strength of our model is the high flexibility. This strength enables
it to possess the advantages of existing models and overcomes their
shortcomings in a unified way. As a result, not only broad types of structure
can be detected without prior knowledge of what type of intrinsic regularities
exist in the network, but also the type of identified structure can be directly
learned from data. Moreover, by differentiating outgoing edges from incoming
edges, our model can detect several types of structural regularities beyond
competing models. Tests on a number of real world and artificial networks
demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art model at shedding
light on the structural features of networks, including the overlapping
community structure, multipartite structure and several other types of
structure which are beyond the capability of existing models.
