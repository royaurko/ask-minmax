This issue discusses the fault-trajectory approach suitability for fault
diagnosis on analog networks. Recent works have shown promising results
concerning a method based on this concept for ATPG for diagnosing faults on
analog networks. Such method relies on evolutionary techniques, where a generic
algorithm (GA) is coded to generate a set of optimum frequencies capable to
disclose faults.
