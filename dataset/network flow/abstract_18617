This paper provides some new guidance in the construction of region graphs
for Generalized Belief Propagation (GBP). We connect the problem of choosing
the outer regions of a LoopStructured Region Graph (SRG) to that of finding a
fundamental cycle basis of the corresponding Markov network. We also define a
new class of tree-robust Loop-SRG for which GBP on any induced (spanning) tree
of the Markov network, obtained by setting to zero the off-tree interactions,
is exact. This class of SRG is then mapped to an equivalent class of
tree-robust cycle bases on the Markov network. We show that a treerobust cycle
basis can be identified by proving that for every subset of cycles, the graph
obtained from the edges that participate in a single cycle only, is multiply
connected. Using this we identify two classes of tree-robust cycle bases:
planar cycle bases and "star" cycle bases. In experiments we show that
tree-robustness can be successfully exploited as a design principle to improve
the accuracy and convergence of GBP.
