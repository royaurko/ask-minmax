We study the phenomenon of entrainment in processor sharing networks,
whereby, while individual network resources have sufficient capacity to met
demand, the requirement for simultaneous availability of resources means that a
network may nevertheless be unstable. We show that instability occurs through
poor control, and that, for a variety of network topologies, only small
modifications to controls are required in order to ensure stability. For
controls which possess a natural monotonicity property, we give some new
results for the classification of the corresponding Markov processes, which
lead to conditions both for stability and for instability.
