This paper provides sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability and
global exponential stability, which can be applied to nonlinear, large-scale,
uncertain discrete-time systems. The conditions are derived by means of vector
Lyapunov functions. The obtained results are applied to traffic networks for
the derivation of sufficient conditions of global exponential stability of the
uncongested equilibrium point of the network. Specific results and algorithms
are provided for freeway models. Various examples illustrate the applicability
of the obtained results.
