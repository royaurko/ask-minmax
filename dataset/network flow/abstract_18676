Identifying communities in social networks becomes an increasingly important
research problem. Several methods for identifying such groups have been
developed, however, qualitative analysis (taking into account the scale of the
problem) still poses serious problems. This paper describes a tool for
facilitating such an analysis, allowing to visualize the dynamics and
supporting localization of different events (such as creation or merging of
groups). In the final part of the paper, the experimental results performed
using the benchmark data (Enron emails) provide an insight into usefulness of
the proposed tool.
