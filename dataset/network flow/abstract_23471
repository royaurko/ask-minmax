The influence of the synaptic channel properties on the stability of delayed
activity maintained by recurrent neural network is studied. The duration of
excitatory post-synaptic current (EPSC) is shown to be essential for the global
stability of the delayed response. NMDA receptor channel is a much more
reliable mediator of the reverberating activity than AMPA receptor, due to a
longer EPSC. This allows to interpret the deterioration of working memory
observed in the NMDA channel blockade experiments. The key mechanism leading to
the decay of the delayed activity originates in the unreliability of the
synaptic transmission. The optimum fluctuation of the synaptic conductances
leading to the decay is identified. The decay time is calculated analytically
and the result is confirmed computationally.
