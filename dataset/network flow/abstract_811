A large computer program is typically divided into many hundreds or even
thousands of smaller units, whose logical connections define a network in a
natural way. This network reflects the internal structure of the program, and
defines the ``information flow'' within the program. We show that, (1) due to
its growth in time this network displays a scale-free feature in that the
probability of the number of links at a node obeys a power-law distribution,
and (2) as a result of performance optimization of the program the network has
a small-world structure. We believe that these features are generic for large
computer programs. Our work extends the previous studies on growing networks,
which have mostly been for physical networks, to the domain of computer
software.
