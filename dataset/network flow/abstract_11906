We present an efficient learning algorithm for the problem of training neural
networks with discrete synapses, a well-known hard (NP-complete) discrete
optimization problem. The algorithm is a variant of the so-called Max-Sum (MS)
algorithm. In particular, we show how, for bounded integer weights with $q$
distinct states and independent concave a priori distribution (e.g. $l_{1}$
regularization), the algorithm's time complexity can be made to scale as
$O\left(N\log N\right)$ per node update, thus putting it on par with
alternative schemes, such as Belief Propagation (BP), without resorting to
approximations. Two special cases are of particular interest: binary synapses
$W\in\{-1,1\}$ and ternary synapses $W\in\{-1,0,1\}$ with $l_{0}$
regularization. The algorithm we present performs as well as BP on binary
perceptron learning problems, and may be better suited to address the problem
on fully-connected two-layer networks, since inherent symmetries in two layer
networks are naturally broken using the MS approach.
