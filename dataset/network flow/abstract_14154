I consider the thermal bremsstrahlung emission from hot accretion flows
(Bondi/ADAFs), taking into account the finite size of the observing telescope's
beam (R_beam) relative to the Bondi accretion radius (R_A). For R_beam >> R_A
soft X-ray emission from the hot interstellar medium surrounding the black hole
dominates the observed emission while for R_beam << R_A hard X-ray emission
from the accretion flow dominates. I apply these models to Chandra observations
of the Galactic Center, for which R_beam ~ R_A. I argue that bremsstrahlung
emission accounts for most of the ``quiescent'' (non-flaring) flux observed by
Chandra from Sgr A*; this emission is spatially extended on scales ~ R_A ~ 1''
and has a relatively soft spectrum, as is observed. If accretion onto the
central black hole proceeds via a Bondi or ADAF flow, a hard X-ray power law
should be present in deeper observations with a flux ~ 1/3 of the soft X-ray
flux; nondetection of this hard X-ray component would argue against ADAF/Bondi
models. I briefly discuss the application of these results to other
low-luminosity AGN.
