In this paper, we study stability and latency of routing in wireless networks
where it is assumed that no collision will occur. Our approach is inspired by
the adversarial queuing theory, which is amended in order to model wireless
communication. More precisely, there is an adversary that specifies
transmission rates of wireless links and injects data in such a way that an
average number of data injected in a single round and routed through a single
wireless link is at most $r$, for a given $r\in (0,1)$. We also assume that the
additional "burst" of data injected during any time interval and scheduled via
a single link is bounded by a given parameter $b$.
  Under this scenario, we show that the nodes following so called {\em
work-conserving} scheduling policies, not necessarily the same, are guaranteed
stability (i.e., bounded queues) and reasonably small data latency (i.e.,
bounded time on data delivery), for injection rates $r<1/d$, where $d$ is the
maximum length of a routing path. Furthermore, we also show that such a bound
is asymptotically optimal on $d$.
