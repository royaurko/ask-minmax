We study a boundary layer problem for the Navier-Stokes-alpha model obtaining
a generalization of the Prandtl equations conjectured to represent the averaged
flow in a turbulent boundary layer. We solve the equations for the
semi-infinite plate, both theoretically and numerically. The latter solutions
agree with some experimental data in the turbulent boundary layer.
