We present experimental results on slow flow properties of a granular
assembly confined in a vertical column and driven upwards at a constant
velocity V. For monodisperse assemblies this study evidences at low velocities
($1<V<100 \mu m/s$) a stiffening behaviour i.e. the stress necessary to obtain
a steady sate velocity increases roughly logarithmically with velocity. On the
other hand, at very low driving velocity ($V<1 \mu m/s$), we evidence a
discontinuous and hysteretic transition to a stick-slip regime characterized by
a strong divergence of the maximal blockage force when the velocity goes to
zero. We show that all this phenomenology is strongly influenced by surrounding
humidity. We also present a tentative to establish a link between the granular
rheology and the solid friction forces between the wall and the grains. We base
our discussions on a simple theoretical model and independent grain/wall
tribology measurements. We also use finite elements numerical simulations to
confront experimental results to isotropic elasticity. A second system made of
polydisperse assemblies of glass beads is investigated. We emphasize the onset
of a new dynamical behavior, i.e. the large distribution of blockage forces
evidenced in the stick-slip regime.
