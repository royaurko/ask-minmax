Multi-hop random access networks have received much attention due to their
distributed nature which facilitates deploying many new applications over the
sensor and computer networks. Recently, utility maximization framework is
applied in order to optimize performance of such networks, however proposed
algorithms result in large transmission delays. In this paper, we will analyze
delay in random access multi-hop networks and solve the delay-constrained
utility maximization problem. We define the network utility as a combination of
rate utility and energy cost functions and solve the following two problems:
'optimal medium access control with link delay constraint' and, 'optimal
congestion and contention control with end-to-end delay constraint'. The
optimal tradeoff between delay, rate, and energy is achieved for different
values of delay constraint and the scaling factors between rate and energy.
Eventually linear and super-linear distributed optimization solutions are
proposed for each problem and their performance are compared in terms of
convergence and complexity.
