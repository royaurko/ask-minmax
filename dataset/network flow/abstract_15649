Our focus is on realistically modeling dynamic networks of
inter-relationships among countries. Important aspects of such data that lead
to problems with current methods include the tendency to move between periods
of slow and rapid variation and the fine time scale at which data are
available. Motivated by this application, we develop a novel methodology for
Locally Adaptive DYnamic (LADY) network inference. The proposed LADY network
model relies on a dynamic latent space representation in which each countries'
position evolves over time via a stochastic differential equation. Using a
state space representation for these stochastic processes and P\`olya-gamma
data augmentation, we develop an efficient MCMC algorithm and online updating
procedures. We evaluate performance via simulation experiments, and consider an
application to international relationships among countries during recent
conflicts and financial crises.
