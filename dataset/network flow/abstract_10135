The effect of a high Reynold's number, pressure-driven flow of a compressible
gas on the conformation of an oligomer tethered to the wall of a square-channel
is studied under both ideal solvent and poor solvent conditions using a hybrid
multiparticle collision dynamics and molecular dynamics algorithm. Unlike
previous studies, the flow field contains an elongational component in addition
to a shear component as well as fluid slip near the walls and results in a
Schmidt number for the polymer beads that is less than unity. In both solvent
regimes the oligomer is found to extend in the direction of flow. Under the
ideal solvent conditions, torsional twisting of the chain and aperiodic
cyclical dynamics are observed for the end of the oligomer. Under poor solvent
conditions, a metastable helix forms in the end of the chain despite the lack
of any attractive potential between beads in the oligomeric chain. The
formation of the helix is postulated to be the result of a solvent induced
chain collapse that has been confined to a single dimension by a strong flow
field.
