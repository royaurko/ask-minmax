We present a quantitative study of vorticity formation in peripheral
ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at sqrt(s)NN = 200 GeV by using the
ECHO-QGP numerical code, implementing relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics in
the causal Israel-Stewart framework in 3+1 dimensions with an initial Bjorken
flow profile. We consider and discuss different definitions of vorticity which
are relevant in relativistic hydrodynamics. After demonstrating the excellent
capabilities of our code, which proves to be able to reproduce Gubser flow up
to 8 fm/c, we show that, with the initial conditions needed to reproduce the
measured directed flow in peripheral collisions corresponding to an average
impact parameter b=11.6 fm and with the Bjorken flow profile for a viscous
Quark Gluon Plasma with \eta/s=0.1 fixed, a vorticity of the order of some
10^{-2} c/fm can develop at freezeout. The ensuing polarization of Lambda
baryons does not exceed 1.4% at midrapidity. We show that the amount of
developed directed flow is sensitive to both the initial angular momentum of
the plasma and its viscosity.
