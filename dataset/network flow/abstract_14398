We consider the integrable Camassa--Holm equation on the line with positive
initial data rapidly decaying at infinity. On such phase space we construct a
one parameter family of integrable hierarchies which preserves the mixed
spectrum of the associated string spectral problem. This family includes the CH
hierarchy. We demonstrate that the constructed flows can be interpreted as
Hamiltonian flows on the space of Weyl functions of the associated string
spectral problem. The corresponding Poisson bracket is the Atiyah--Hitchin
bracket. Using an infinite dimensional version of the Jacobi ellipsoidal
coordinates we obtain a one parameter family of canonical coordinates
linearizing the flows.
