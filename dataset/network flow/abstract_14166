We have compared the bulk flow of recent large-scale peculiar velocity
surveys (SMAC, SC, Lauer and Postman, Willick, EFAR and Tonry's SNIa sample) to
each other, allowing for the errors due to sparse sampling. We conclude that,
contrary to the current perception, there is no significant conflict between
these surveys. The combined peculiar velocity dataset samples a volume $\sim
100 \h^{-1}$ mpc in radius and has a bulk flow of $350 \pm 80 $ km/s. Allowing
for the sparse sampling, we find that this result is not in conflict with the
$\Lambda$CDM models. Structure(s) responsible for the large-scale motion have
not yet been identified, but some likely suspects are presently under
surveillance.
