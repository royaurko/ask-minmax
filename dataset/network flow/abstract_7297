We describe the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz for the spin-1/2 XXX and XXZ
Heisenberg chains with open and periodic boundary conditions in terms of tensor
networks. These Bethe eigenstates have the structure of Matrix Product States
with a conserved number of down-spins. The tensor network formulation suggestes
possible extensions of the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz to two dimensions.
