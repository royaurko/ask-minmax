We investigate the propagation of chemical fronts arising in
Fisher--Kolmogorov--Petrovskii--Piskunov (FKPP) type models in the presence of
a steady cellular flow. In the long-time limit, a steadily propagating
pulsating front is established. Its speed, on which we focus, can be obtained
by solving an eigenvalue problem closely related to large-deviation theory. We
employ asymptotic methods to solve this eigenvalue problem in the limit of
small molecular diffusivity (large P\'eclet number, $\text{Pe} \gg 1$) and
arbitrary reaction rate (arbitrary Damk\"ohler number $\text{Da}$).
  We identify three regimes corresponding to the distinguished limits
$\text{Da} = O(\text{Pe}^{-1})$, $\text{Da}=O\left((\log
\text{Pe})^{-1}\right)$ and $\text{Da} = O(\text{Pe})$ and, in each regime,
obtain the front speed in terms of a different non-trivial function of the
relevant combination of $\text{Pe}$ and $\text{Da}$. Closed-form expressions
for the speed, characterised by power-law and logarithmic dependences on
$\text{Da}$ and $\text{Pe}$ and valid in intermediate regimes, are deduced as
limiting cases. Taken together, our asymptotic results provide a complete
description of the complex dependence of the front speed on $\text{Da}$ for
$\text{Pe} \gg 1$. They are confirmed by numerical solutions of the eigenvalue
problem determining the front speed, and illustrated by a number of numerical
simulations of the advection--diffusion--reaction equation.
