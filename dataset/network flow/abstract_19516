Viscous fingering occurs in the flow of two immiscible, viscous fluids
between the plates of a Hele-Shaw cell. Due to pressure gradients or gravity,
the initially planar interface separating the two fluids undergoes a
Saffman-Taylor instability and develops finger-like structures. When one of the
fluids is a ferrofluid and a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the
labyrinthine instability supplements the usual viscous fingering instability,
resulting in visually striking, complex patterns. We consider this problem in a
rectangular flow geometry using a perturbative mode-coupling analysis. We
deduce two general results: viscosity contrast between the fluids drives
interface asymmetry, with no contribution from magnetic forces; magnetic
repulsion within the ferrofluid generates finger tip-splitting, which is absent
in the rectangular geometry for ordinary fluids.
