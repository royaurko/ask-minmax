Internet of Things is a novel concept that semantically implies a world-wide
network of uniquely addressable interconnected smart objects. It is aimed at
establishing any paradigm in computing. This environment is one where the
boundary between virtual and physical world is eliminated. As the network gets
loaded with hitherto unknown applications, security threats also become
rampant. Current security solutions fail as new threats appear to de-struct the
reliability of information. The network has to be transformed to IPv6 enabled
network to address huge number of smart objects. Thus new addressing schemes
come up with new attacks. Real time analysis of information from the
heterogeneous smart objects needs use of cloud services. This can fall prey to
cloud specific security threats. Therefore need arises for a review of security
threats for a new area having huge demand. Here a study of security issues in
this domain is briefly presented.
