Within the functional renormalization group approach we study the effective
QFT of Einstein gravity and one self-interacting scalar coupled to N_f Dirac
fermions. We include in our analysis the matter anomalous dimensions induced by
all the interactions and analyze the highly non linear beta functions
determining the renormalization flow. We find the existence of a non trivial
fixed point structure both for the gravity and the matter sector, besides the
usual gaussian matter one. This suggest that asymptotic safety could be
realized in the gravitational sector \emph{and} in the standard model. Non
triviality in the Higgs sector might involve gravitational interactions.
