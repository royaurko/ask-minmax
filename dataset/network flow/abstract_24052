Power line as an alternative for data transmission is being explored, and
also being used to a certain extent. But from the data transfer point of view,
power line, as a channel is highly dynamic and hence not quite suitable. To
convert the office or home wiring system to a Local Area Network (LAN),
adaptive changes are to be made to the existing protocols. In this paper, a
slotted transmission scheme is suggested, in which usable timeslots are found
out by physically sensing the media. Common usable timeslots for the
sender-receiver pair are used for communication. But these will not ensure safe
packet delivery since packets may be corrupted on the way during propagation
from sender to receiver. Therefore, we also suggest a proximity based
retransmission scheme where each machine in the LAN, buffers good packet and
machines close to the receiver retransmit on receiving a NACK.
