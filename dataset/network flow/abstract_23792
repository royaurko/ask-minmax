Wireless Multiuser receivers suffer from their relatively higher
computational complexity that prevents widespread use of this technique. In
addition, one of the main characteristics of multi-channel communications that
can severely degrade the performance is the inconsistent and low values of SNR
that result in high BER and poor channel capacity. It has been shown that the
computational complexity of a multiuser receiver can be reduced by using the
transformation matrix (TM) algorithm [4]. In this paper, we provide
quantification of SNR based on the computational complexity of TM algorithm. We
show that the reduction of complexity results high and consistent values of SNR
that can consequently be used to achieve a desirable BER performance. In
addition, our simulation results suggest that the high and consistent values of
SNR can be achieved for a desirable BER performance. The performance measure
adopted in this paper is the consistent values of SNR.
