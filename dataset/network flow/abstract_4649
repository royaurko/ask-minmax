We investigate unitary one-matrix models coupled to bosonic quarks. We derive
a flow equation for the square-root of the specific heat as a function of the
renormalized quark mass. We show numerically that the flows have a finite
number of solitary waves, and we postulate that their number equals the number
of quark flavors. We also study the nonperturbative behavior of this theory and
show that as the number of flavors diverges, the flow does not reach
two-dimensional gravity.
