We consider the simulation of wireless sensor networks (WSN) using a new
approach. We present Shawn, an open-source discrete-event simulator that has
considerable differences to all other existing simulators. Shawn is very
powerful in simulating large scale networks with an abstract point of view. It
is, to the best of our knowledge, the first simulator to support generic
high-level algorithms as well as distributed protocols on exactly the same
underlying networks.
