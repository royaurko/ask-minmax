The impact of electromagnetic stabilization and flow shear stabilization on
ITG turbulence is investigated. Analysis of a low-$\beta$ JET L-mode discharge
illustrates the relation between ITG stabilization, and proximity to the
electromagnetic instability threshold. This threshold is reduced by
suprathermal pressure gradients, highlighting the effectiveness of fast ions in
ITG stabilization. Extensive linear and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations are
then carried out for the high-$\beta$ JET hybrid discharge 75225, at two
separate locations at inner and outer radii. It is found that at the inner
radius, nonlinear electromagnetic stabilization is dominant, and is critical
for achieving simulated heat fluxes in agreement with the experiment. The
enhancement of this effect by suprathermal pressure also remains significant.
It is also found that flow shear stabilization is not effective at the inner
radii. However, at outer radii the situation is reversed. Electromagnetic
stabilization is negligible while the flow shear stabilization is significant.
These results constitute the high-$\beta$ generalization of comparable
observations found at low-$\beta$ at JET. This is encouraging for the
extrapolation of electromagnetic ITG stabilization to future devices. An
estimation of the impact of this effect on the ITER hybrid scenario leads to a
20% fusion power improvement.
