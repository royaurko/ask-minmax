We consider the problem of Joint Routing, Scheduling and Power-control (JRSP)
problem for multihop wireless networks (MHWN) with multiple antennas. We extend
the problem and a (sub-optimal) heuristic solution method for JRSP in MHWN with
single antennas. We present an iterative scheme to calculate link
capacities(achievable rates) in the interference environment of the network
using SINR model. We then present the algorithm for solving the JRSP problem.
This completes a feasible system model for MHWN when nodes have multiple
antennas. We show that the gain we achieve by using multiple antennas in the
network is linear both in optimal performance as well as heuristic algorithmic
performance.
