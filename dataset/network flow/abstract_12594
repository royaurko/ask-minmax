An important first step when deploying a wireless ad hoc network is neighbor
discovery in which every node attempts to determine the set of nodes it can
communicate with in one wireless hop. In the recent years, cognitive radio (CR)
technology has gained attention as an attractive approach to alleviate spectrum
congestion. A cognitive radio transceiver can operate over a wide range of
frequencies, possibly scanning multiple frequency bands. A cognitive radio node
can opportunistically utilize unused wireless spectrum without interference
from other wireless devices in its vicinity. Due to spatial variations in
frequency usage and hardware variations in radio transceivers, different nodes
in the network may perceive different subsets of frequencies available to them
for communication. This heterogeneity in the available channel sets across the
network increases the complexity of solving the neighbor discovery problem in a
cognitive radio network. In this work, we design and analyze several randomized
algorithms for neighbor discovery in such a (heterogeneous) network under a
variety of assumptions (e.g. maximum node degree known or unknown) for both
synchronous and asynchronous systems under minimal knowledge. We also show that
our randomized algorithms are naturally suited to tolerate unreliable channels
and adversarial attacks.
