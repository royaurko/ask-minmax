In this paper, we consider the problem of link scheduling in multi-hop
wireless networks under general interference constraints. Our goal is to design
scheduling schemes that do not use per-flow or per-destination information,
maintain a single data queue for each link, and exploit only local information,
while guaranteeing throughput optimality. Although the celebrated back-pressure
algorithm maximizes throughput, it requires per-flow or per-destination
information. It is usually difficult to obtain and maintain this type of
information, especially in large networks, where there are numerous flows.
Also, the back-pressure algorithm maintains a complex data structure at each
node, keeps exchanging queue length information among neighboring nodes, and
commonly results in poor delay performance. In this paper, we propose
scheduling schemes that can circumvent these drawbacks and guarantee throughput
optimality. These schemes use either the readily available hop-count
information or only the local information for each link. We rigorously analyze
the performance of the proposed schemes using fluid limit techniques via an
inductive argument and show that they are throughput-optimal. We also conduct
simulations to validate our theoretical results in various settings, and show
that the proposed schemes can substantially improve the delay performance in
most scenarios.
