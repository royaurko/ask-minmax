Complexes of physically interacting proteins constitute fundamental
functional units responsible for driving biological processes within cells. A
faithful reconstruction of the entire set of complexes is therefore essential
to understand the functional organization of cells. In this review, we discuss
the key contributions of computational methods developed till date
(approximately between 2003 and 2015) for identifying complexes from the
network of interacting proteins (PPI network). We evaluate in depth the
performance of these methods on PPI datasets from yeast, and highlight
challenges faced by these methods, in particular detection of sparse and small
or sub- complexes and discerning of overlapping complexes. We describe methods
for integrating diverse information including expression profiles and 3D
structures of proteins with PPI networks to understand the dynamics of complex
formation, for instance, of time-based assembly of complex subunits and
formation of fuzzy complexes from intrinsically disordered proteins. Finally,
we discuss methods for identifying dysfunctional complexes in human diseases,
an application that is proving invaluable to understand disease mechanisms and
to discover novel therapeutic targets. We hope this review aptly commemorates a
decade of research on computational prediction of complexes and constitutes a
valuable reference for further advancements in this exciting area.
