The time variation of contacts in a networked system may fundamentally alter
the properties of spreading processes and affect the condition for large-scale
propagation, as encoded in the epidemic threshold. Despite the great interest
in the problem for the physics, applied mathematics, computer science and
epidemiology communities, a full theoretical understanding is still missing and
currently limited to the cases where the time-scale separation holds between
spreading and network dynamics or to specific temporal network models. We
consider a Markov chain description of the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible
process on an arbitrary temporal network. By adopting a multilayer perspective,
we develop a general analytical derivation of the epidemic threshold in terms
of the spectral radius of a matrix that encodes both network structure and
disease dynamics. The accuracy of the approach is confirmed on a set of
temporal models and empirical networks and against numerical results. In
addition, we explore how the threshold changes when varying the overall time of
observation of the temporal network, so as to provide insights on the optimal
time window for data collection of empirical temporal networked systems. Our
framework is both of fundamental and practical interest, as it offers novel
understanding of the interplay between temporal networks and spreading
dynamics.
