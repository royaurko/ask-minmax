Ubiquitous sensing devices frequently disseminate their data between them.
The use of a distributed event-based system that decouples publishers of
subscribers arises as an ideal candidate to implement the dissemination
process. In this paper, we present a network architecture which merges the
network and overlay layers of typical structured event-based systems.
Directional Random Walks (DRWs) are used for the construction of this merged
layer. Our first results show that DRWs are suitable to balance the load using
a few nodes in the network to construct the dissemination path. As future work,
we propose to study the properties of this new layer and to work on the design
of Bloom filters to manage broker nodes.
