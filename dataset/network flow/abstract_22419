Maxwell's equations applied to a superconducting wire (aluminum) covered with
a thick nonsuperconducting sheath (copper), in combination with the superfluid
velocity equation for Cooper pairs which obeys DeWitt's minimal coupling rule,
implies an instantaneous streamline flow that leads to the phenomenon of
"instantaneous superluminality," in which a Cooper pair can disappear from the
left end of the wire and instantaneously reappear at the right end of the wire.
Relativistic causality is not violated by this superluminal phenomenon, which
involves analytic, finite bandwidth waveforms whose spectrum lies below the BCS
gap frequency. Experiments are proposed to test these ideas.
