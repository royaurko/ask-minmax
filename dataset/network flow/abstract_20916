In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the maximum broadcast
decoding delay experienced by all the receivers of generalized instantly
decodable network coding (IDNC). Unlike the sum decoding delay, the maximum
decoding delay as a definition of delay for IDNC allows a more equitable
distribution of the delays between the different receivers and thus a better
Quality of Service (QoS). In order to solve this problem, we first derive the
expressions for the probability distributions of maximum decoding delay
increments. Given these expressions, we formulate the problem as a maximum
weight clique problem in the IDNC graph. Although this problem is known to be
NP-hard, we design a greedy algorithm to perform effective packet selection.
Through extensive simulations, we compare the sum decoding delay and the max
decoding delay experienced when applying the policies to minimize the sum
decoding delay [1] and our policy to reduce the max decoding delay. Simulations
results show that our policy gives a good agreement among all the delay aspects
in all situations and outperforms the sum decoding delay policy to effectively
minimize the sum decoding delay when the channel conditions become harsher.
They also show that our definition of delay significantly improve the number of
served receivers when they are subject to strict delay constraints.
