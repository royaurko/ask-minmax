The paper discusses the basic principles and the architecture of the software
toolkit for constructing knowledge-based systems which can be used
cooperatively over computer networks and also embedded into larger software
systems in different ways. Presented architecture is based on frame knowledge
representation and production rules, which also allows to interface high-level
programming languages and relational databases by exposing corresponding
classes or database tables as frames. Frames located on the remote computers
can also be transparently accessed and used in inference, and the dynamic
knowledge for specific frames can also be transferred over the network. The
issues of implementation of such a system are addressed, which use Java
programming language, CORBA and XML for external knowledge representation.
Finally, some applications of the toolkit are considered, including e-business
approach to knowledge sharing, intelligent web behaviours, etc.
