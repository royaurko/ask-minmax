Recently, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) grow to be one of the dominant
technology trends; new needs are continuously emerging and demanding more
complex constraints in a duty cycle, such as extend the life time communication
. The MAC layer plays a crucial role in these networks; it controls the
communication module and manages the medium sharing. In this work we use
OSC-MAC tackles combining with the performance of cooperative transmission (CT)
in multi-hop WSN and the Wi-Lem technology
