The Saffman-Taylor viscous fingering instability occurs when a less viscous
fluid displaces a more viscous one between narrowly spaced parallel plates in a
Hele-Shaw cell. Experiments in radial flow geometry form fan-like patterns, in
which fingers of different lengths compete, spread and split. Our weakly
nonlinear analysis of the instability predicts these phenomena, which are
beyond the scope of linear stability theory. Finger competition arises through
enhanced growth of sub-harmonic perturbations, while spreading and splitting
occur through the growth of harmonic modes. Nonlinear mode-coupling enhances
the growth of these perturbations with appropriate relative phases, as we
demonstrate through a symmetry analysis of the mode coupling equations. We
contrast mode coupling in radial flow with rectangular flow geometry.
