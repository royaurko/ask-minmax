We aim to study the participant-spectator matter over a wide range of
energies of vanish- ing flow and masses. For this, we have employed different
model parameters at central and semi-central colliding geometries. A nearly
mass independent nature of the participant matter has been obtained at the
energy of vanishing flow. Further, participant matter can also act as an
indicator to study the degree of thermalization.
