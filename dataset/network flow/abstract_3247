In this contribution we present an alternative scenario for the large
elliptic flow observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Motivated by
recent results from Lattice QCD on flavor off-diagonal susceptibilities we
argue that the matter right above $T_{c}$ can be described by single-particle
dynamics in a repulsive single-particle potential, which in turn gives rise to
elliptic flow. These ideas can be tested experimentally by measuring elliptic
flow of heavy quarks, preferably via the measurement of $J/\Psi$ elliptic flow.
