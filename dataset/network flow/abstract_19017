In this paper, we present optimization techniques for WSNs. Our main goal is
to minimize the power consumption and latency. We address the problem of
minimizing the energy consumption in WSNs including hardware. ZigBee protocol
is used to design nodes on WSN to achieve a very low power consumption rate.
Furthermore, we propose to use IRS protocol in WSN within a ZigBee technique to
discover information from unaware locations and achieve efficiency of energy
and sacrifices latency. Our main idea is to support WSNs with both ZigBee
technique and IRS protocol. In addition, we address the problem of efficient
node placement for congestion control in WSNs. Thus, we evaluate the
performance of specific routing and some algorithms of congestion control when
wireless sensor nodes are deployed under different placements of network. To
demonstrate the strength of the used algorithms, our simulation in C# proves
that ZigBee-IRS- ESRT-Flooding approaches reduce the power consumption from 10%
to 19% when compared to existing techniques of low Power and node placement.
