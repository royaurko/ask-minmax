We apply a variant of the explosive percolation procedure to large real-world
networks, and show with finite-size scaling that the university class, ordinary
or explosive, of the resulting percolation transition depends on the structural
properties of the network as well as the number of unoccupied links considered
for comparison in our procedure. We observe that in our social networks, the
percolation clusters close to the critical point are related to the community
structure. This relationship is further highlighted by applying the procedure
to model networks with pre-defined communities.
