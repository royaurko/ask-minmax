The branching (resp. merging) space functor of a flow is a left Quillen
functor. The associated derived functor allows to define the branching (resp.
merging) homology of a flow. It is then proved that this homology theory is a
dihomotopy invariant and that higher dimensional branchings (resp. mergings)
satisfy a long exact sequence.
