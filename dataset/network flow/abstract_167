We calculate the structure of accretion disc around a rapidly rotating black
hole with a super-Eddington accretion rate. The luminosity and height of the
disc are reduced by the advection effect. In the case of a large viscosity
parameter, alpha > 0.03, the accretion flow strongly deviates from
thermodynamic equilibrium and overheats in the central region. With increasing
accretion rate, the flow temperature steeply increases, reaches a maximum, and
then falls off. The maximum is achieved in the advection dominated regime of
accretion. The maximum temperature in the disc around a massive black hole,
M=10^8 M_sun, with alpha=0.3 is of order 3 x 10^8 K. Discs with large accretion
rates can emit X-rays in quasars as well as in galactic black hole candidates.
