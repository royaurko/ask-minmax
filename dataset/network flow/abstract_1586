This paper presents a stream-oriented architecture for structuring cluster
applications. Clusters that run applications based on this architecture can
scale to tenths of thousands of nodes with significantly less performance loss
or reliability problems. Our architecture exploits the stream nature of the
data flow and reduces congestion through load balancing, hides latency behind
data pushes and transparently handles node failures. In our ongoing work, we
are developing an implementation for this architecture and we are able to run
simple data mining applications on a cluster simulator.
