Progress in cell reprogramming recently has revived Waddington's concept of
an epigenetic landscape in the term of a quasi-potential function and cell
attractors in a complex dynamical system embodied by the cell's gene regulatory
network (GRN). The quasi-potential of network states have biological
significance because the relative stability in a multi-stable dynamical system
offers a measure of the effort for the transition between attractors. However,
quasi-potential landscapes that have been developed for continuous systems by
multiple groups are not suitable for discrete networks, which are generally
used to study large networks or ensembles thereof. Here we introduce the
relative stability of network states to Boolean networks by using the
noise-perturbed Markov matrices. With an ensemble approach of a minimal gene
network for pancreas development, we show that Boolean networks with
canalized/sign-compatible Boolean functions can capture essential features of
cell fate dynamics and allow the estimation of relative stabilities of network
states and, hence, of transition barriers. Our Boolean network framework for
calculating the relative stabilities and transition rates of network states can
be used to quantify the influence of different genes on cell transitions,
estimate the time sequence of cell differentiation and facilitate the rational
design of cell reprogramming protocols.
