We obtained global transonic solutions representing optically thin
advection-dominated accretion flow by solving the full set of differential
equations describing such systems. We found that far from the sonic point
self-similar solutions are an excellent approximation of the global flow
structure if the accretion rate is well below the maximum value above which no
optically thin solutions exist.
