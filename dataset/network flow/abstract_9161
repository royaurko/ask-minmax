Finding the underlying relationships among multiple imaging modalities in a
coherent fashion is one of challenging problems in the multimodal analysis. In
this study, we propose a novel multimodal network approach based on multidi-
mensional persistent homology. In this extension of the previous threshold-free
method of persistent homology, we visualize and discriminate the topological
change of integrated brain networks by varying not only threshold but also
mixing ratios between two different imaging modalities. Moreover, we also pro-
pose an integration method for multimodal networks, called one-dimensional
projection, with a specific mixing ratio between modalities. We applied the
proposed methods to PET and MRI data from 21 autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
children and 10 pediatric control subjects. From the results, we found that the
brain networks of ASD children and controls differ significantly, with ASD
showing asymmetrical changes of connected structures between PET and MRI. The
integrated MRI and PET networks showed that ASD children had weaker connections
than controls within the visual cortex, between dorsal and ventral parts of the
temporal pole, between frontal and parietal regions, and between the left
perisylvian and other brain regions. These results provide a multidimensional
homological understanding of disease-related PET and MRI networks that
discloses the network association with ASD.
