The Faulkes Telescope Project is the educational arm of the Las Cumbres
Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT). It currently has two 2-metre
robotic telescopes, located at Haleakala on Maui (FT North) and Siding Spring
in Australia (FT South). It is planned to increase this to six 2-metre
telescopes in the future, complemented by a network of 30-40 smaller (0.4-1
metre) telescopes providing 24 hour coverage of both northern and southern
hemispheres.
  We are undertaking a study of 10 low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) using FT
North to study the optical continuum behaviour of X-ray transients in
quiescence. The introduction of FT South in September 2006 allows us to extend
this monitoring to include 17 southern hemisphere LMXBs. With new
instrumentation, we also intend to expand this monitoring to include both
infrared wavelengths and spectroscopy.
