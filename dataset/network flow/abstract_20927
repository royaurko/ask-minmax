Evolutionary game theory is one of the key paradigms behind many scientific
disciplines from science to engineering. In complex networks, because of the
difficulty of formulating the replicator dynamics, most of previous studies are
confined to a numerical level. In this paper, we introduce a vectorial
formulation to derive three classes of individuals' payoff analytically. The
three classes are pure cooperators, pure defectors, and fence-sitters. Here,
fence-sitters are the individuals who change their strategies at least once in
the strategy evolutionary process. As a general approach, our vectorial
formalization can be applied to all the two-strategies games. To clarify the
function of the fence-sitters, we define a parameter, payoff memory, as the
number of rounds that the individuals' payoffs are aggregated. We observe that
the payoff memory can control the fence-sitters' effects and the level of
cooperation efficiently. Our results indicate that the fence-sitters' role is
nontrivial in the complex topologies, which protects cooperation in an indirect
way. Our results may provide a better understanding of the composition of
cooperators in a circumstance where the temptation to defect is larger.
