High resolution X-ray observations indicate that the entropy profiles in the
central regions of some massive cooling flow clusters are well approximated by
powerlaws. McCarthy and coworkers recently accounted for this trend with an
analytic model that includes the detailed effects of radiative cooling.
Interestingly, these contributors found that cooling (and subsequent inflow of the
gas) naturally establishes approximate steady-state powerlaw entropy profiles
in the cores of clusters. However, the origin of this behavior and its
dependence on initial conditions have yet to be elucidated. In the present
study, we explain this trend in the context of the self-similar cooling wave
model developed previously by Bertschinger (1989). It is shown that the
logarithmic slope of the entropy profile in the cores of relaxed cooling flow
clusters is given by a simple analytic function that depends only on the
logarithmic slopes of the local gravitational potential and the cooling
function. We discuss a number of potentially interesting uses of the above
result, including: (1) a way of measuring the shapes of gravitational
potentials of cooling flow clusters (which may, for example, be compared with
the results of the standard hydrostatic equilibrium method); (2) a simple
method for constructing realistic analytic cluster models that include the
effects of radiative cooling; and (3) a test of the reliability of cooling
routines implemented in analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations.
