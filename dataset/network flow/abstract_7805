For $n+1\geq 3$, we construct complete solutions to Ricci flow on $\RR^{n+1}$
which encounter global singularities at a finite time $T$. The singularities
are forming arbitrarily slowly with the curvature blowing up arbitrarily fast
at the rate $(T-t)^{-2\lambda}$ for $\lambda\geq1$. Near the origin, blow-ups
of such a solution converge uniformly to the Bryant soliton. Near spatial
infinity, blow-ups of such a solution converge uniformly to the shrinking
cylinder soliton. As an application of this result, we prove that there exist
standard solutions of Ricci flow on $\RR^{n+1}$ whose blow-ups near the origin
converge uniformly to the Bryant soliton.
