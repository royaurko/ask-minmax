Random Ising systems on a general hierarchical lattice with both, random
fields and random bonds, are considered. Rigorous inequalities between
eigenvalues of the Jacobian renormalization matrix at the pure fixed point are
obtained. These inequalities lead to upper bounds on the crossover exponents
$\{\phi_i\}$.
