Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification
commonly used by cell signaling networks to transmit information about the
extracellular environment into intracellular organelles for the regulation of
the activity and sorting of proteins within the cell. For this study we
reconstructed a literature-based mammalian kinase-substrate network from
several online resources. The interactions within this directed graph network
connect kinases to their substrates, through specific phosphosites including
kinase-kinase regulatory interactions. However, the "signs" of links,
activation or inhibition of the substrate upon phosphorylation, within this
network are mostly unknown. Here we show how we can infer the "signs"
indirectly using data from quantitative phosphoproteomics experiments applied
to mammalian cells combined with the literature-based kinase-substrate network.
Our inference method was able to predict the sign for 321 links and 153
phosphosites on 120 kinases, resulting in signed and directed subnetwork of
mammalian kinase-kinase interactions. Such an approach can rapidly advance the
reconstruction of cell signaling pathways and networks regulating mammalian
cells.
