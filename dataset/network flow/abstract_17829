This is Part II of a two-part paper series that studies the use of the
proportional fairness (PF) utility function as the basis for capacity
allocation and scheduling in multi-channel multi-rate wireless networks. The
contributions of Part II are twofold. (i) First, we extend the problem
formulation, theoretical results, and algorithms to the case of time-varying
channels, where opportunistic capacity allocation and scheduling can be
exploited to improve system performance. We lay down the theoretical foundation
for optimization that "couples" the time-varying characteristic of channels
with the requirements of the underlying applications into one consideration. In
particular, the extent to which opportunistic optimization is possible is not
just a function of how fast the channel characteristics vary, but also a
function of the elasticity of the underlying applications for delayed capacity
allocation. (ii) Second, building upon our theoretical framework and results,
we study subcarrier allocation and scheduling in orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) cellular wireless networks. We introduce the concept of a
W-normalized Doppler frequency to capture the extent to which opportunistic
scheduling can be exploited to achieve throughput-fairness performance gain. We
show that a "look-back PF" scheduling can strike a good balance between system
throughput and fairness while taking the underlying application requirements
into account.
