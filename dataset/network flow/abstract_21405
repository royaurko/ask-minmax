We study nucleosynthesis in low accretion rate hot advective flows around
black holes. We find that matter is generally photo-dissociated into protons
and neutrons inside the disk. These neutrons stay around black holes for longer
time because they are not coupled to magnetic fields while the protons accrete
into the hole. We find the nature of the resulting neutron disks and estimate
the rate at which these disks contaminate the surroundings.
