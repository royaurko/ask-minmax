A general approach is presented for understanding the stress response
function in anisotropic granular layers in two dimensions. The formalism
accommodates both classical anisotropic elasticity theory and linear theories
of anisotropic directed force chain networks. Perhaps surprisingly, two-peak
response functions can occur even for classical, anisotropic elastic materials,
such as triangular networks of springs with different stiffnesses. In such
cases, the peak widths grow linearly with the height of the layer, contrary to
the diffusive spreading found in `stress-only' hyperbolic models. In principle,
directed force chain networks can exhibit the two-peak, diffusively spreading
response function of hyperbolic models, but all models in a particular class
studied here are found to be in the elliptic regime.
