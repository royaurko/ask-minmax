Network motifs are overrepresented interconnection patterns found in
real-world networks. What functional advantages may they offer for building
complex systems? We show that most network motifs emerge from interconnections
patterns that best exploit the intrinsic stability characteristics of
individual nodes. This feature is observed at different scales in a network,
from nodes to modules, suggesting an efficient mechanism to stably build
complex systems.
