Slowing down of the relaxation of the fluctuations around equilibrium is
investigated both by stochastic simulations and by analysis of Master equation
of reversible reaction networks consisting of resources and the corresponding
products that work as catalysts. As the number of molecules $N$ is decreased,
the relaxation time to equilibrium is prolonged due to the deficiency of
catalysts, as demonstrated by the amplification compared to that by the
continuum limit. This amplification ratio of the relaxation time is represented
by a scaling function as $h = N \exp(-\beta V)$, and it becomes prominent as
$N$ becomes less than a critical value $h \sim 1$, where $\beta$ is the inverse
temperature and $V$ is the energy gap between a product and a resource.
