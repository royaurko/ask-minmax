We comment on mathematical results about the statistical behavior of Lorenz
equations an its attractor, and more generally to the class of singular
hyperbolic systems. The mathematical theory of such kind of systems turned out
to be surprisingly difficult. It is remarkable that a rigorous proof of the
existence of the Lorenz attractor was presented only around the year 2000 with
a computer assisted proof together with an extension of the hyperbolic theory
developed to encompass attractors robustly containing equilibria. We present
some of the main results on the statisitcal behavior of such systems. We show
that for attractors of three-dimensional flows, robust chaotic behavior is
equivalent to the existence of certain hyperbolic structures, known as
singular-hyperbolicity. These structures, in turn, are associated to the
existence of physical measures: \emph{in low dimensions, robust chaotic
behavior for flows ensures the existence of a physical measure}. We then give
more details on recent results on the dynamics of singular-hyperbolic
(Lorenz-like) attractors.
