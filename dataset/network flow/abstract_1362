Vulnerability Discovery with attack Injection security threats are increasing
for the server software, when software is developed, the software tested for
the functionality. Due to unawareness of software vulnerabilities most of the
software before pre-Release the software should be thoroughly tested for not
only functionality reliability, but should be tested for the security flows
(or) vulnerabilities. The approaches such as fuzzers, Fault injection,
vulnerabilities scanners, static vulnerabilities analyzers, Run time prevention
mechanisms and software Rejuvenation are identifying the un-patched software
which is open for security threats address to solve the problem "security
testing". These techniques are useful for generating attacks but cannot be
extendable for the new land of attacks. The system called proactive
vulnerability attack injection tool is suitable for adding new attacks
injection vectors, methods to define new protocol states (or) Specification
using the interface of tool includes Network server protocol specification
using GUI, Attacks generator, Attack injector, monitoring module at the victim
injector, monitoring module at the victim machine and the attacks injection
report generation. This tool can address most of the vulnerabilities (or)
security flows.
