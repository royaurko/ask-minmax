We formulate the data analysis problem for the detection of the Newtonian
waveform from an inspiraling compact-binary by a network of arbitrarily
oriented and arbitrarily distributed laser interferometric gravitational wave
detectors. We obtain for the first time the relation between the optimal
statistic and the magnitude of the network correlation vector, which is
constructed from the matched network-filter. This generalizes the calculation
reported in an earlier work (gr-qc/9906064), where the detectors are taken to
be coincident.
