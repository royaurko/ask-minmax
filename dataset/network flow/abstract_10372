We explore the simple observation that a Markov chain with values in a finite
space $M=\{1,..., m \}$, $m\geq 2$, has many different extensions to a
compatible $n$-point Markov chain in $M^n$, for all $1< n\leq m$. Embedding
this phenomenon into the context of stochastic (L\'evy) flows of
diffeomorphisms in Euclidean spaces, we introduce the notion of an $n$-point
bifurcation of a stochastic flow. Roughly speaking an $n$-point bifurcation
takes place, when a small perturbation of the stochastic flow does not change
the characteristics at lower level $k$-point motions, $k<n$, but does change at
the level of $n$-point motion. We illustrate this phenomenon with an example of
an $n$-point bifurcation, with $n\geq 3$. In addition, we present an algorithm
for the detection of the precise level of an $n$-point bifurcation and a
combinatorial formula for the dimension of the vector space of compatible
extensions for flows of mappings on $M$.
