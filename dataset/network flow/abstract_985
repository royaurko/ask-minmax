One of the main theoretical motivations for the emerging area of network
coding is the achievability of the max-flow/min-cut rate for single source
multicast. This can exceed the rate achievable with routing alone, and is
achievable with linear network codes. The multi-source problem is more
complicated. Computation of its capacity region is equivalent to determination
of the set of all entropy functions $\Gamma^*$, which is non-polyhedral. The
aim of this paper is to demonstrate that this difficulty can arise even in
single source problems. In particular, for single source networks with
hierarchical sink requirements, and for single source networks with secrecy
constraints. In both cases, we exhibit networks whose capacity regions involve
$\Gamma^*$. As in the multi-source case, linear codes are insufficient.
