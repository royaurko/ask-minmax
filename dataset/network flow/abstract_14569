Microfluidic devices can be used to produce highly controlled and
monodisperse double or multiple emulsions. The presence of inner drops inside a
jet of the middle phase introduces deformations in the jet, which leads to
breakup into monodisperse double emulsions. However, the ability to generate
double emulsions can be compromised when the interfacial tension between the
middle and outer phases is low, leading to flow with high capillary and Weber
numbers. In this case, the interface between the fluids is initially deformed
by the inner drops but the jet does not break into drops. Instead, the jet
becomes highly corrugated, which prevents formation of controlled double
emulsions. We show using numerical calculations that the corrugations are
caused by the inner drops perturbing the interface and the perturbations are
then advected by the flow into complex shapes.
