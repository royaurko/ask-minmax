We make some remarks on reconnection in plasmas and want to present some
calculations related to the problem of finding velocity fields which conserve
magnetic flux or at least magnetic field lines. Hereby we start from views and
definitions of ideal and non-ideal flows on one hand, and of reconnective and
non-reconnective plasma dynamics on the other hand. Our considerations give
additional insights into the discussion on violations of the frozen--in field
concept which started recently with the papers by Baranov & Fahr (2003a;
2003b). We find a correlation between the nonidealness which is given by a
generalized form of the Ohm's law and a general transporting velocity, which is
field line conserving.
