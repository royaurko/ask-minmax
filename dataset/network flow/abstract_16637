Transmission of forces in static granular materials are studied within the
framework of the force network ensemble, by numerically evaluating the
mechanical response of hexagonal packings of frictionless grains and
rectangular packings of frictional grains. In both cases, close to the point of
application of the overload, the response is non-linear and displays two peaks,
while at larger length-scales it is linear and elastic-like. The cross-over
between these two behaviors occurs at a depth that increases with the magnitude
of the overload, and decreases with increasing friction.
