We propose a novel approach for distributed statistical detection of
change-points in high-volume network traffic. We consider more specifically the
task of detecting and identifying the targets of Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS) attacks. The proposed algorithm, called DTopRank, performs distributed
network anomaly detection by aggregating the partial information gathered in a
set of network monitors. In order to address massive data while limiting the
communication overhead within the network, the approach combines record
filtering at the monitor level and a nonparametric rank test for doubly
censored time series at the central decision site. The performance of the
DTopRank algorithm is illustrated both on synthetic data as well as from a
traffic trace provided by a major Internet service provider.
