An online user joins multiple social networks in order to enjoy different
services. On each joined social network, she creates an identity and
constitutes its three major dimensions namely profile, content and connection
network. She largely governs her identity formulation on any social network and
therefore can manipulate multiple aspects of it. With no global identifier to
mark her presence uniquely in the online domain, her online identities remain
unlinked, isolated and difficult to search. Earlier research has explored the
above mentioned dimensions, to search and link her multiple identities with an
assumption that the considered dimensions have been least disturbed across her
identities. However, majority of the approaches are restricted to exploitation
of one or two dimensions. We make a first attempt to deploy an integrated
system (Finding Nemo) which uses all the three dimensions of an identity to
search for a user on multiple social networks. The system exploits a known
identity on one social network to search for her identities on other social
networks. We test our system on two most popular and distinct social networks -
Twitter and Facebook. We show that the integrated system gives better accuracy
than the individual algorithms. We report experimental findings in the report.
