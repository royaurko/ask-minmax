In adaptive networks fragmentation transitions have been observed in which
the network breaks into disconnected components. We present an analytical
approach for calculating the transition point in general adaptive network
models. Using the example of an adaptive voter model, we demonstrate that the
proposed approach yields good agreement with numerical results.
