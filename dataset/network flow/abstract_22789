It is shown that the appearance of lunar horizon glow and streamers observed
above the lunar terminator described by the dynamic fountain mode byl Stubbs et
al. (2006) requires a value of dust particles charge several orders exceed what
they obtain on the Lunar surface. To obtain a sufficient charge due to a
departure of photoelectrons separated submicron particles have to flow over the
surface during tens of seconds or even several minutes. Therefore for emergence
of dust streamers at the lunar sunrise it is necessary that dust particles do
not lose the positive charge during a night.
