Interference alignment (IA) has attracted great attention in the last few
years for its breakthrough performance in interference networks. However,
despite the numerous works dedicated to IA, the feasibility conditions of IA
remains unclear for most network topologies. The IA feasibility analysis is
challenging as the IA constraints are sets of high-degree polynomials, for
which no systematic tool to analyze the solvability conditions exists. In this
work, by developing a new mathematical framework that maps the solvability of
sets of polynomial equations to the linear independence of their first-order
terms, we propose a sufficient condition that applies to MIMO interference
networks with general configurations. We have further proved that this
sufficient condition matches with the necessary conditions under a wide range
of configurations. These results further consolidate the theoretical basis of
IA.
