The fact that the modular template coincides with the Lorenz template,
discovered by Ghys, implies modular knots have very peculiar properties. We
obtain a generalization of these results to other Hecke triangle groups. In
this context, the geodesic flow can never be seen as a flow on a subset of
$S^3$, and one is led to consider embeddings into lens spaces. We will
geometrically construct homeomorphisms from the unit tangent bundles of the
orbifolds into the lens spaces, elliminating the need for elliptic functions.
Finally we will use these homeomorphisms to compute templates for the geodesic
flows. This offers a tool for topologically investigating their otherwise well
studied periodic orbits.
