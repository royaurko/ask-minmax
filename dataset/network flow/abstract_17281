Fontes et. al. (2004), obtained criteria to study weak convergence to the
Brownian web. Among them condition $(B_2)$ is often verified by applying FKG
type positive correlation inequality, together with a bound on the distribution
of the coalescence time between two paths. However, FKG is a strong property
that is difficult to verify for most models. Here we propose an alternate
methodology to verify condition $(B_2)$ which depends mainly on the Markovian
structure and does not use any correlation inequality. We also show that this
new method can be applied for three discrete drainage network models in the
basin of attraction of Brownian web to verify $(B_2)$.
