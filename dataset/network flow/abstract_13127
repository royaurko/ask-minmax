We introduce a new variational method for finding periodic orbits of flows
and spatio-temporally periodic solutions of classical field theories, a
generalization of the Newton method to a flow in the space of loops. The
feasibility of the method is demonstrated by its application to several
dynamical systems, including the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system.
