In-band full-duplex (FD) communications have been optimistically promoted to
improve the spectrum utilization in cellular networks. However, the explicit
impact of spatial interference, imposed by FD communications, on uplink and
downlink transmissions has been overlooked in the literature. This paper
presents an extensive study of the explicit effect of FD communications on the
uplink and downlink performances. For the sake of rigorous analysis, we develop
a tractable framework based on stochastic geometry toolset. The developed model
accounts for uplink truncated channel inversion power control in FD cellular
networks. The study shows that FD communications improve the downlink
throughput at the expense of significant degradation in the uplink throughput.
Therefore, we propose a novel fine-grained duplexing scheme, denoted as
$\alpha$-duplex scheme, which allows a partial overlap between uplink and
downlink frequency bands. To this end, we show that the amount of the overlap
can be optimized via adjusting $\alpha$ to achieve a certain design objective.
