This article discusses how concepts and methods of complex networks can be
applied to real-time imaging and computer vision. After a brief introduction of
complex networks basic concepts, their use as means to represent and
characterize images, as well as for modeling visual saliency, are briefly
described. The possibility to apply complex networks in order to model and
simulate the performance of parallel and distributed computing systems for
performance of visual methods is also proposed.
