Network models of dirty electronic systems are mapped onto an interacting
field theory of lower dimensionality by intepreting one space dimension as
time. This is accomplished via Feynman's interpretation of anti-particles as
particles moving backwards in time. The method developed maps calculation of
the moments of the Landauer conductance onto calculation of correlation
functions of an interacting field theory of bosons and fermions. The resulting
field theories are supersymmetric and closely related to the supersymmetric
spin-chain representations of network models recently discussed by various
contributors. As an application of the method, the two-edge Chalker-Coddington model
is shown to be Anderson localized, and a delocalization transition in a related
two-edge network model (recently discussed by Balents and Fisher) is studied by
calculation of the average Landauer conductance.
