The compartmental model is a basic tool for studying signal propagation in
neurons, and, if the model parameters are adequately defined, it can also be of
help in the study of electrical or fluid transport. Here we show that the input
resistance, in different networks which simulate the passive properties of
neurons, is the result of an interplay between the relevant conductances,
morphology and size. These results suggest that neurons must grow in such a way
that facilitates the current flow. We propose that power consumption is an
important factor by which neurons attain their final morphological appearance.
