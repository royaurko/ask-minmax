The spreading (propagation) of diseases, viruses, and disasters such as power
blackout through a huge-scale and complex network is one of the most concerned
issues today. In this paper, we study the control of such spreading in a
nonlinear spreading model of small-world networks. We found that the short-cut
adding probability $p$ in the N-W model \cite{N-W:1999} of small-world networks
determines the Hopf bifurcation and other bifurcating behaviors in the proposed
model. We further show a control technique that stabilize a periodic spreading
behavior onto a stable equilibrium over the proposed model of small-world
networks.
