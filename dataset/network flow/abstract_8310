On directed Small-World networks the
  Majority-vote model with noise is now studied through Monte Carlo
simulations. In this model, the order-disorder phase transition of the order
parameter is well defined in this system. We calculate the value of the
critical noise parameter q_c for several values of rewiring probability p of
the directed Small-World network. The critical exponentes beta/nu, gamma/nu and
1/nu were calculated for several values of p.
