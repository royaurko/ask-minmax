We study the effects of non-magnetic impurities on the phase diagram of a
system of interacting electrons with a flat Fermi surface. The one-loop
Wilsonian renormalization group flow of the angle dependent diffusion function
$D(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$ and interaction $U(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$
determines the critical temperature and the nature of the low temperature
state. As the imperfect nesting increases the critical temperature decreases
and the low temperature phase changes from the spin-density wave (SDW) to the
d-wave superconductivity (dSC) and finally, for bad nesting, to the random
antiferromagnetic state (RAF). Both SDW and dSC phases are affected by
disorder. The pair breaking depends on the imperfect nesting and is the most
efficient when the critical temperature for superconductivity is maximal.
