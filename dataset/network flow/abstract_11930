Network densification with small cell base stations is a promising solution
to satisfy future data traffic demands. However, increasing small cell base
station density alone does not ensure better users quality-of-experience and
incurs high operational expenditures. Therefore, content caching on different
network elements has been proposed as a mean of offloading he backhaul by
caching strategic contents at the network edge, thereby reducing latency. In
this paper, we investigate cache-enabled small cells in which we model and
characterize the outage probability, defined as the probability of not
satisfying users requests over a given coverage area. We analytically derive a
closed form expression of the outage probability as a function of
signal-to-interference ratio, cache size, small cell base station density and
threshold distance. By assuming the distribution of base stations as a Poisson
point process, we derive the probability of finding a specific content within a
threshold distance and the optimal small cell base station density that
achieves a given target cache hit probability. Furthermore, simulation results
are performed to validate the analytical model.
