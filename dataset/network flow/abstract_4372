Effects of synaptic noise on the retrieval process of associative memory
neural networks are studied from the viewpoint of neurobiological and
biophysical understanding of information processing in the brain. We
investigate the statistical mechanical properties of stochastic analog neural
networks with temporally fluctuating synaptic noise, which is assumed to be
white noise. Such networks, in general, defy the use of the replica method,
since they have no energy concept. The self-consistent signal-to-noise analysis
(SCSNA), which is an alternative to the replica method for deriving a set of
order parameter equations, requires no energy concept and thus becomes
available in studying networks without energy functions. Applying the SCSNA to
stochastic network requires the knowledge of the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP)
equation which defines the deterministic networks equivalent to the original
stochastic ones. The study of the TAP equation which is of particular interest
for the case without energy concept is very few, while it is closely related to
the SCSNA in the case with energy concept. This paper aims to derive the TAP
equation for networks with synaptic noise together with a set of order
parameter equations by a hybrid use of the cavity method and the SCSNA.
