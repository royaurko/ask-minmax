We present nanosecond timescale Vlasov-Fokker-Planck-Maxwell modeling of
magnetized plasma transport and dynamics in a hohlraum with an applied external
magnetic field, under conditions similar to recent experiments. Self-consistent
modeling of the kinetic electron momentum equation allows for a complete
treatment of the heat flow equation and Ohm's Law, including Nernst advection
of magnetic fields. In addition to showing the prevalence of non-local
behavior, we demonstrate that effects such as anomalous heat flow are induced
by inverse bremsstrahlung heating. We show magnetic field amplification up to a
factor of 3 from Nernst compression into the hohlraum wall. The magnetic field
is also expelled towards the hohlraum axis due to Nernst advection faster than
frozen-in-flux would suggest. Non-locality contributes to the heat flow towards
the hohlraum axis and results in an augmented Nernst advection mechanism that
is included self-consistently through kinetic modeling.
