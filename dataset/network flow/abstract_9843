We consider a parabolic-like systems of differential equations involving
geometrical quantities to examine uniformization theorems for two- and
three-dimensional closed orientable manifolds. We find that in the
two-dimensional case there is a simple gauge theoretic flow for a connection
built from a Riemannian structure, and that the convergence of the flow to the
fixed points is consistent with the Poincare Uniformization Theorem. We
construct a similar system for the three-dimensional case. Here the connection
is built from a Riemannian geometry, an SO(3) connection and two other 1-form
fields which take their values in the SO(3) algebra. The flat connections
include the eight homogeneous geometries relevant to the three-dimensional
uniformization theorem conjectured by W. Thurston. The fixed points of the flow
include, besides the flat connections (and their local deformations), non-flat
solutions of the Yang-Mills equations. These latter "instanton" configurations
may be relevant to the fact that generic 3-manifolds do not admit one of the
homogeneous geometries, but may be decomposed into "simple 3-manifolds" which
do.
