In many information networks, data items -- such as updates in social
networks, news flowing through interconnected RSS feeds and blogs, measurements
in sensor networks, route updates in ad-hoc networks -- propagate in an
uncoordinated manner: nodes often relay information they receive to neighbors,
independent of whether or not these neighbors received the same information
from other sources. This uncoordinated data dissemination may result in
significant, yet unnecessary communication and processing overheads, ultimately
reducing the utility of information networks. To alleviate the negative impacts
of this information multiplicity phenomenon, we propose that a subset of nodes
(selected at key positions in the network) carry out additional information
filtering functionality. Thus, nodes are responsible for the removal (or
significant reduction) of the redundant data items relayed through them. We
refer to such nodes as filters. We formally define the Filter Placement problem
as a combinatorial optimization problem, and study its computational complexity
for different types of graphs. We also present polynomial-time approximation
algorithms and scalable heuristics for the problem. Our experimental results,
which we obtained through extensive simulations on synthetic and real-world
information flow networks, suggest that in many settings a relatively small
number of filters are fairly effective in removing a large fraction of
redundant information.
