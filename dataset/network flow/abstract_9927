The benchmark test case for non-orthogonal grid mesh, the "driven skewed
cavity flow", first introduced by Demirdzic et al. (1992, IJNMF, 15, 329) for
skew angles of alpha=30 and alpha=45, is reintroduced with a more variety of
skew angles. The benchmark problem has non-orthogonal, skewed grid mesh with
skew angle (alpha). The governing 2-D steady incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations in general curvilinear coordinates are solved for the solution of
driven skewed cavity flow with non-orthogonal grid mesh using a numerical
method which is efficient and stable even at extreme skew angles. Highly
accurate numerical solutions of the driven skewed cavity flow, solved using a
fine grid (512x512) mesh, are presented for Reynolds number of 100 and 1000 for
skew angles ranging between 15<alpha<165.
