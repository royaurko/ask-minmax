Delay tolerant Ad-hoc Networks make use of mobility of relay nodes to
compensate for lack of permanent connectivity and thus enable communication
between nodes that are out of range of each other. To decrease delivery delay,
the information that needs to be delivered is replicated in the network. Our
objective in this paper is to study replication mechanisms that include coding
in order to improve the probability of successful delivery within a given time
limit. We propose an analytical approach that allows to quantify tradeoffs
between resources and performance measures (energy and delay). We study the
effect of coding on the performance of the network while optimizing parameters
that govern routing. Our results, based on fluid approximations, are compared
to simulations which validate the model
