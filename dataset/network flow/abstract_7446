A density functional theory is used to investigate the instability arising in
superfluid $^4$He as it flows at velocity u just above the Landau critical
velocity of rotons v_c. Confirming an early theoretical prediction by one of us
[JETP Lett. 39, 511 (1984)], we find that a stationary periodic modulation of
the density occurs, with amplitude proportional to (u-v_c)^{1/2} and wave
vector equal to the roton wave vector. This density pattern is studied for
supercritical flow both in bulk helium and in a channel of nanometer
cross-section.
