In this paper, we continue to develop a general scheme to study a broad class
of integrable systems naturally associated with the coboundary dynamical Lie
algebroids. In particular, we present a factorization method for solving the
Hamiltonian flows. We also present two important class of new examples, a
family of hyperbolic spin Calogero-Moser systems and the spin Toda lattices. To
illustrate our factorization theory, we show how to solve these Hamiltonian
systems explicitly.
