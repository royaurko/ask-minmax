We can talk about two kinds of stability of the Ricci flow at Ricci flat
metrics. One of them is a linear stability, defined with respect to Perelman's
functional $\mathcal{F}$. The other one is a dynamical stability and it refers
to a convergence of a Ricci flow starting at any metric in a neighbourhood of a
considered Ricci flat metric. We show that dynamical stability implies linear
stability. We also show that a linear stability together with the integrability
assumption imply dynamical stability. As a corollary we get a stability result
for $K3$ surfaces part of which has been done in \cite{dan2002}.
