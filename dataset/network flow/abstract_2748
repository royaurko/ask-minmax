Mobility prediction allows estimating the stability of paths in a mobile
wireless Ad Hoc networks. Identifying stable paths helps to improve routing by
reducing the overhead and the number of connection interruptions. In this
paper, we introduce a neural network based method for mobility prediction in Ad
Hoc networks. This method consists of a multi-layer and recurrent neural
network using back propagation through time algorithm for training.
