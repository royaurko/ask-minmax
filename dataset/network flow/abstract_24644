BD-SIIT and DSTM are widely deployed IPv4/IPv6 Transition mechanism to
improve the performance of the computer network in terms of Throughput,End to
End Delay(EED) and Packet Drop Rate(PDR).In this journal paper we have
Implemented and Compared the Performance Issues of our newly proposed Dollops
Wise Curtail(DW&C)IPv4/IPv6 Migration Mechanism with BD-SIIT and DSTM in NS2.
Implementation and Comparison Performance Analysis between Dollops Wise
Curtail,BD-SIIT and DSTM shows that Dollops Wise Curtail IPv4/IPv6 migration
algorithm performance outperforms than BD-SIIT and DSTM.Based on extensive
simulations,we show that DW&C algorithm reduces the Packet Drop Rate(PDR),End
to End Delay(EED) and achieves better Throughput than BD-SIIT and DSTM.In our
research work observation,the performance metrics such as Throughput,EED and
PLR for DW&C,BD-SIIT and DSTM are measured using TCP,UDP,FTP and CBR Traffics
