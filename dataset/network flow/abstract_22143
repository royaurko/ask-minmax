The dynamics of the magnetic helicity during the electroweak phase transition
in the early Universe is studied. It is shown that the boundary surface between
symmetric (hypermagnetic) phase and Maxwellian phase with a broken symmetry is
a membrana for the separation of the magnetic helicity. Assuming the total
linking number of knots of hypermagnetic field is negative, it is proved that
the helicity rising in the Maxwellian phase is left-handed.
