By combining the features of CSMA and TDMA, fully decentralised WLAN MAC
schemes have recently been proposed that converge to collision-free schedules.
In this paper we describe a MAC with optimal long-run throughput that is almost
decentralised. We then design two \changed{schemes} that are practically
realisable, decentralised approximations of this optimal scheme and operate
with different amounts of sensing information. We achieve this by (1)
introducing learning algorithms that can substantially speed up convergence to
collision free operation; (2) developing a decentralised schedule length
adaptation scheme that provides long-run fair (uniform) access to the medium
while maintaining collision-free access for arbitrary numbers of stations.
