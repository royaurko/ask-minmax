We deal with the problem of streaming multiple video streams between pairs of
nodes in a multi-hop wireless ad hoc network. The nodes are static, know their
locations, and are synchronized (via GPS). We introduce a new interference
model that uses variable interference radiuses. We present an algorithm for
computing a frequency assignment and a schedule whose goal is to maximize
throughput over all the video streams. In addition, we developed a localized
flow-control mechanism to stabilize the queue lengths.
  We simulated traffic scheduled by the algorithm using OMNET++/MixiM (i.e.,
physical SINR interference model with 802.11g) to test whether the computed
throughput is achieved. The results of the simulation show that the computed
solution is \SINR-feasible and achieves predictable stable throughputs.
