We propose a model for the diffusion of several products competing in a
common market based on the generalization of the Ising model of statiscal
mechanics (Potts model). Using an agent based implementation, we analyze two
problems: (i) a three options case, i.e. to adopt a product A, a product B, or
non-adoption and (ii) a four options case, i.e. the adoption of product A,
product B, both, or none. In the first case we analyze a launching strategy for
one of the two products, which delays its launching with the objective of
competing with improvements. Market shares reached by each product are then
estimated at market saturation. Finally, simulations are carried out with
varying degrees of social network topology, uncertainty, and population
homogeneity.
