We calculate the Lyapunov exponents for particles suspended in a random
three-dimensional flow, concentrating on the limit where the viscous damping
rate is small compared to the inverse correlation time. In this limit Lyapunov
exponents are obtained as a power series in epsilon, a dimensionless measure of
the particle inertia. Although the perturbation generates an asymptotic series,
we obtain accurate results from a Pade-Borel summation. Our results prove that
particles suspended in an incompressible random mixing flow can show pronounced
clustering when the Stokes number is large and we characterise two distinct
clustering effects which occur in that limit.
