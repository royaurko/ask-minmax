We attribute the phenomenon known as "the ridge" to long range initial state
correlations from Color Glass Condensate flux tubes and later stage radial
flow. We show that this description can explain the amplitude and azimuthal
width of the soft ridge and nearly explain that of the hard ridge, suggesting
that the two are essentially the same phenomenon.
