A new way of coupling electrical and mechanical waves, using piezoelectric
effect, is presented here. Since the energy exchange between two systems
supporting wave propagation is maximum when their evolution is governed by
similar equations, hence, an optimal electromechanical coupling is obtained by
designing an electric network which is "analog" to the mechanical structure to
be controlled. In this paper, we exploit this idea to enhance the coupling,
between a Kirchhoff-Love plate and one possible synthesis of its circuital
analog, as obtained by means of a set of piezoelectric actuators uniformly
distributed upon the plate. It is shown how this approach allows for an optimal
energy exchange between the mechanic and the electric forms independent of the
modal evolution of the structure. Moreover, we show how an efficient electric
dissipation of the mechanical energy can be obtained adding dissipative
elements in the electric network.
