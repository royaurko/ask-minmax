Hamiltonian mechanics can be used to constrain temperature simultaneously
with energy. We illustrate the interesting situations that develop when two
different temperatures are imposed within a composite Hamiltonian system. The
model systems we treat are "phi-4" chains, with quartic tethers and quadratic
nearest-neighbor Hooke's-law interactions. This model is known to satisfy
Fourier's law. Our prototypical problem sandwiches a Newtonian subsystem
between hot and cold Hamiltonian reservoir regions. We have characterized four
different Hamiltonian reservoir types. There is no tendency for any of these
two-temperature Hamiltonian simulations to transfer heat from the hot to the
cold degrees of freedom. Evidently steady heat flow simulations require energy
sources and sinks, and are therefore incompatible with Hamiltonian mechanics.
