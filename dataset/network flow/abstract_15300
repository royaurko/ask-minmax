A combined base station association and power control problem is studied for
the uplink of multichannel multicell cellular networks, in which each channel
is used by exactly one cell (i.e., base station). A distributed association and
power update algorithm is proposed and shown to converge to a Nash equilibrium
of a noncooperative game. We consider network models with discrete mobiles
(yielding an atomic congestion game), as well as a continuum of mobiles
(yielding a population game). We find that the equilibria need not be Pareto
efficient, nor need they be system optimal. To address the lack of system
optimality, we propose pricing mechanisms. It is shown that these mechanisms
can be implemented in a distributed fashion.
