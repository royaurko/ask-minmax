In this paper, we study the generalized Lagrangian mean curvature flow in
almost Einstein manifold proposed by T. Behrndt. We show that the singularity
of this flow is characterized by the second fundamental form. We also show that
the rescaled flow at a singularity converges to a finite union of Special
Lagrangian cones for generalized Lagrangian mean curvature flow with
zero-Maslov class in almost Calabi-Yau manifold. As a corollary, there is no
finite time Type-I singularity for such a flow.
