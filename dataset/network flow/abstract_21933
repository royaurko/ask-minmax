We study the electromagnetic surface waves localized at an interface
separating a one-dimensional photonic crystal and left-handed metamaterial, the
so-called surface Tamm states. We demonstrate that the metamaterial allows for
a flexible control of the dispersion properties of surface states, and can
support the Tamm states with a backward energy flow and a vortex-like
structure.
