A statistical model of resistor network is proposed to describe a polymer
structure and to simulate the real and imaginary components of its ac
resistivity. It takes into account the polydispersiveness of the material as
well as intrachain and interchain charge transport processes. By the
application of a transfer matrix technique, it reproduces ac resistivity
measurements carried out with polyaniline films in different doping degrees and
at different temperatures. Our results indicate that interchain processes
govern the resistivity behavior in the low frequency region while, for higher
frequencies, intrachain mechanisms are dominant.
