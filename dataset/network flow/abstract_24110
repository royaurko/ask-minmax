In this paper, a search for supersymmetry (SUSY) is presented in events with
two opposite-sign isolated leptons in the final state, accompanied by hadronic
jets and missing transverse energy. An artificial neural network is employed to
discriminate possible SUSY signals from a standard model background. The
analysis uses a data sample collected with the CMS detector during the 2011 LHC
run, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.98 inverse femtobarns of
proton-proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Compared to
other CMS analyses, this one uses relaxed criteria on missing transverse energy
(missing ET > 40 GeV) and total hadronic transverse energy (HT > 120 GeV), thus
probing different regions of parameter space. Agreement is found between
standard model expectation and observations, yielding limits in the context of
the constrained mininal supersymmetric standard model and on a set of
simplified models.
