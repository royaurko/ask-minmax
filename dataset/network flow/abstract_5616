In this work, we consider Corporate Governance (CG) ties among companies from
a multiple network perspective. Such a structure naturally arises from the
close interrelation between the Shareholding Network (SH) and the Board of
Directors network (BD). In order to capture the simultaneous effects of both
networks on CG, we propose to model the CG multiple network structure via
tensor analysis. In particular, we consider the TOPHITS model, based on the
PARAFAC tensor decomposition, to show that tensor techniques can be
successfully applied in this context. By providing some empirical results from
the Italian financial market in the univariate case, we then show that a
tensor--based multiple network approach can reveal important information.
