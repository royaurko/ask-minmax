The study of hydrodynamics of liquid crystal leads to many fasci- nating
mathematical problems, which has prompted various interesting works recently.
This article reviews the static Oseen-Frank theory and surveys some recent
progress on the existence, regularity, uniqueness, and large time asymp- totic
of the hydrodynamic flow of nematic liquid crystals. We will also propose a few
interesting questions for future investigations.
