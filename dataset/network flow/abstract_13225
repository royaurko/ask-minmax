Evolution equations for the orientation distribution of axisymmetric
particles in periodic flows are derived in the regime of small but non-zero
Brownian rotations. The equations are based on a multiple time scale approach
that allows fast computation of the relaxation processes leading to statistical
equilibrium. The approach has been applied to the calculation of the effective
viscosity of a thin disk suspension in gravity waves.
