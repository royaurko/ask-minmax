In this paper, 14-velocity and 18-velocity multiple-relaxation-time (MRT)
lattice Boltzmann (LB) models are proposed for three-dimensional incompressible
flows. These two models are constructed based on the incompressible LBGK model
proposed by He et al. (Chin. Phys., 2004, 13: 40-46) and the MRT LB model
proposed by d'Humi\`{e}res et al. (Philos. Trans. R. Soc., A, 2002, 360:
437-451), which have advantages in the computational efficiency and stability,
respectively. Through the Chapman-Enskog analysis, the models can recover to
three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the low Mach number
limit. To verify the present models, the steady Poiseuille flow, unsteady
pulsatile flow and lid-driven cavity flow in three dimensions are simulated.
The simulation results agree well with the analytical solutions or the existing
numerical results. Moreover, it is found that the present models show higher
accuracy than d'Humi\`{e}res et al. model and better stability than He et al.
model.
