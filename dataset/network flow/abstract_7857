For flows the rank is an invariant by linear change of time. But what we can
say about isomorphisms? It seems that in case of mixing flows this problem is
the most difficult. However the known technique of joinings provides
non-isomorphism for mixing rank-one flows under linear change of time. For
automorphisms we consider another problems (with similar solutions). For
example, the staircase cutting-and-stacking construction is set by a height
$h_1$ of the first tower and a sequence $\{r_j\}$ of cut numbers. Let us
consider two similar constructions: one is set by $(h_1, \{r_j\})$, another is
set by ($h_1+1, \{r_j\}$), and $r_j=j$. We prove a general theorem implying the
non-isomorphism of these constructions.
