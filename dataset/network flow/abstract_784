We study a mathematical model of a blood circulation network which is a
generalization of the coronary model proposed by Smith, Pullan and Hunter. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the initial-boundary
value problem and discuss the continuity of dependence of the solution and its
derivatives on initial, boundary and forcing functions and their derivatives.
