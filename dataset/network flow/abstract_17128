Mobile communication has become a vigorous field of research in computer
science, due to the wide spreading of mobile technologies, applications and
services. The intertwining of communication, computation and mobility
constantly poses new challenges to algorithmic design in this area. The
Foundations of Mobile Computing (FOMC) workshop is dedicated to all aspects
that cover contributions both in the design and analysis of
discrete/distributed algorithms, and in the system modeling of mobile, wireless
and similarly dynamic networks. It aims to bring together the practitioners and
theoreticians of the field to foster cooperation between research in mobile
computing and algorithms.
