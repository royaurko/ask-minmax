Neuromorphic chips embody computational principles operating in the nervous
system, into microelectronic devices. In this domain it is important to
identify computational primitives that theory and experiments suggest as
generic and reusable cognitive elements. One such element is provided by
attractor dynamics in recurrent networks. Point attractors are equilibrium
states of the dynamics (up to fluctuations), determined by the synaptic
structure of the network; a `basin' of attraction comprises all initial states
leading to a given attractor upon relaxation, hence making attractor dynamics
suitable to implement robust associative memory. The initial network state is
dictated by the stimulus, and relaxation to the attractor state implements the
retrieval of the corresponding memorized prototypical pattern. In a previous
work we demonstrated that a neuromorphic recurrent network of spiking neurons
and suitably chosen, fixed synapses supports attractor dynamics. Here we focus
on learning: activating on-chip synaptic plasticity and using a theory-driven
strategy for choosing network parameters, we show that autonomous learning,
following repeated presentation of simple visual stimuli, shapes a synaptic
connectivity supporting stimulus-selective attractors. Associative memory
develops on chip as the result of the coupled stimulus-driven neural activity
and ensuing synaptic dynamics, with no artificial separation between learning
and retrieval phases.
