In this paper we describe a novel method of exchanging data between Bluetooth
smartphones on the Android platform without requiring any pairing of the
devices. We discuss our approach of encoding and decoding data inside the UUIDs
used by the Bluetooth Service Discovery Protocol (SDP). Future research remains
to be done on the latency, bandwidth and compatibility of this approach, as
well as the possibility of utilizing other protocols in conjunction with this
method.
