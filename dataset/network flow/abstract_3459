Nowadays, scaling methods for general large-scale complex networks have been
developed. We proposed a new scaling scheme called "two-site scaling". This
scheme was applied iteratively to various networks, and we observed how the
degree distribution of the network changes by two-site scaling. In particular,
networks constructed by the BA algorithm behave differently from the networks
observed in the nature. In addition, an iterative scaling scheme can define a
new renormalizing method. We investigated the possibility of defining the
Wilsonian renormalization group method on general complex networks and its
application to the analysis of the dynamics of complex networks.
