Harnessing human computation for solving complex problems call spawns the
issue of finding the unknown competitive group of solvers. In this paper, we
propose an approach called Friendlysourcing to build up teams from social
network answering a business call, all the while avoiding partial solution
disclosure to competitive groups. The contributions of this paper include (i) a
clustering based approach for discovering collaborative and competitive team in
social network (ii) a Markov-chain based algorithm for discovering implicit
interactions in the social network.
