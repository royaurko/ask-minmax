Distributed adaptive networks are suitable for decentralized inference tasks.
Recent works have intensively studied distributed optimization problems in the
case where the nodes have to estimate a single optimum parameter vector
collaboratively. However, there are many important applications that are multi
task oriented in the sense that there are multiple optimum parameter vectors to
be estimated simultaneously, in a collaborative manner over the area covered by
the network. This paper presents diffusion strategies based on the Affine
Projection Algorithm (APA) that address multi task distributed estimation over
adaptive networks by minimizing an appropriate mean-square error criterion with
$l_{2}$-regularization. The usage of APA makes the algorithm robust against the
correlated input. The stability and performance of the algorithm in the mean
and mean square error sense are analyzed. Simulations are conducted to verify
the analytical results
