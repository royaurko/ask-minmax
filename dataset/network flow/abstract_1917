In this paper, we present a dislocation-density-based three-dimensional
continuum model, where the dislocation substructures are represented by pairs
of dislocation density potential functions (DDPFs), denoted by $\phi$ and
$\psi$. The slip plane distribution is characterized by the contour surfaces of
$\psi$, while the distribution of dislocation curves on each slip plane is
identified by the contour curves of $\phi$ which represents the plastic slip on
the slip plane. By using DDPFs, we can explicitly write down an evolution
equation system, which is shown consistent with the underlying discrete
dislocation dynamics. The system includes i) A constitutive stress rule, which
describes how the total stress field is determined in the presence of
dislocation networks and applied loads; ii) A plastic flow rule, which
describes how dislocation ensembles evolve. The proposed continuum model is
validated through comparisons with discrete dislocation dynamics simulation
results and experimental data. As an application of the proposed model, the
"smaller-being-stronger" size effect observed in single-crystal micro-pillars
is studied. A scaling law for the pillar flow stress $\sigma_{\text{flow}}$
against its (non-dimensionalized) size $D$ is derived to be
$\sigma_{\text{flow}}\sim\log(D)/D$.
