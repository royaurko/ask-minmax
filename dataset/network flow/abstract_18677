In this paper, we propose Energy-efficient Adaptive Scheme for Transmission
(EAST) in WSNs. EAST is IEEE 802.15.4 standard compliant. In this approach,
open-loop is used for temperature-aware link quality estimation and
compensation. Whereas, closed-loop feedback helps to divide network into three
logical regions to minimize overhead of control packets on basis of Threshold
transmitter power loss (RSSIloss) for each region and current number of
neighbor nodes that help to adapt transmit power according to link quality
changes due to temperature variation. Simulation results show that propose
scheme; EAST effectively adapts transmission power to changing link quality
with less control packets overhead and energy consumption compared to classical
approach with single region in which maximum transmitter power assigned to
compensate temperature variation.
