We study a class of four-dimensional N=1 superconformal field theories
obtained from the six-dimensional (1,0) theory, on M5-branes on C^2/Z_k
orbifold singularity, compactified on a Riemann surface. This produces various
quiver gauge theories whose matter contents are chiral. We classify the
building blocks associated to pairs-of-pants, and study the gauging of them as
the gluing of punctures. The Riemann surface picture makes the duality
invariance of the resulting quiver theories manifest: the theories associated
to the same Riemann surface flow to the same nontrivial infrared fixed point.
We explicitly check this from the 't Hooft anomalies of the global symmetries
and central charges.
