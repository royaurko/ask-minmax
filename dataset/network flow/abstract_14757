Using a numerical tight-binding approach based on the Chebyshev-Bogoliubov-de
Gennes method we describe Josephson junctions made of multilayer graphene
contacted by top superconducting gates. Both Bernal (ABA) and rhombohedral
(ABC) stacking are considered and we find that the type of stacking has a
strong effect on the proximity effect and the supercurrent flow. For both cases
the pair amplitude shows a polarization between dimer and non-dimer atoms,
being more pronounced for rhombohedral stacking. Even though the proximity
effect in non-dimer sites is enhanced when compared to single layer graphene,
we find that the supercurrent is suppressed. The spatial distribution of the
supercurrent shows that for Bernal stacking the current flows only in the
top-most layers while for rhombohedral stacking the current flows throughout
the whole structure.
