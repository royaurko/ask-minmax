We investigate subsurface moat flow system around symmetrical sunspots of
McIntosh type H and compare it to the flow system within supergranular cells.
Representatives of both types of flows are constructed by means of statistical
averaging of flow maps obtained by time--distance helioseismic inversions. We
find that moat flows around H-type sunspots replace the supergranular flows but
there are two principal differences between the two phenomena: The moat flow is
asymmetrical, probably due to proper motion of sunspots with respect to the
local frame of rest, while the flow in the supergranular cell is highly
symmetrical. Further, the whole moat is a downflow region, while the
supergranule contains the upflow in the centre, which turns into the downflow
at some 60 % of the cell radius from its centre. We estimate that the mass
downflow rate in the moat region is at least two times larger than the mass
circulation rate within the supergranular cell.
