Unveiling the community structure of networks is a powerful methodology to
comprehend interconnected systems across the social and natural sciences. To
identify different types of functional modules in interaction data aggregated
in a single network layer, researchers have developed many powerful methods.
For example, flow-based methods have proven useful for identifying modular
dynamics in weighted and directed networks that capture constraints on flow in
the systems they represent. However, many networked systems consist of agents
or components that exhibit multiple layers of interactions. Inevitably,
representing this intricate network of networks as a single aggregated network
leads to information loss and may obscure the actual organization. Here we
propose a method based on compression of network flows that can identify
modular flows in non-aggregated multilayer networks. Our numerical experiments
on synthetic networks show that the method can accurately identify modules that
cannot be identified in aggregated networks or by analyzing the layers
separately. We capitalize on our findings and reveal the community structure of
two multilayer collaboration networks: scientists affiliated to the Pierre
Auger Observatory and scientists publishing works on networks on the arXiv.
Compared to conventional aggregated methods, the multilayer method reveals
smaller modules with more overlap that better capture the actual organization.
