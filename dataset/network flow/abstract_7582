Directed and elliptic flow of protons and positively charged pions has been
studied in the target fragmentation region using the Plastic Ball detector in
the WA98 experiment. The results exhibit a strong dependence on centrality,
rapidity, and transverse momentum.
  The rapidity dependence can be described by a Gaussian distribution. The
model comparisons reveal a large discrepancy of the flow strength obtained from
the data and the simulations.
