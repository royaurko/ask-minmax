The idea of rare event sampling is applied to the estimation of the
performance of error-correcting codes. The essence of the idea is importance
sampling of the pattern of noises in the channel by Multicanonical Monte Carlo,
which enables efficient estimation of tails of the distribution of bit error
rate. The idea is successfully tested with a convolutional code.
