We study numerically the stability of granular flow on a rough slope in
collisional flow regime in the two-dimension. We examine the density dependence
of the flowing behavior in low density region, and demonstrate that the
particle collisions stabilize the flow above a certain density in the parameter
region where a single particle shows an accelerated behavior. Within this
parameter regime, however, the uniform flow is only metastable and is shown to
be unstable against clustering when the particle density is not high enough.
