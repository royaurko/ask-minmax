This work presents a model that allows the study of research specialties
through the manifestations of the specialty's social and epistemological
processes in a collection of journal papers. Collections of papers are modeled
as coupled bipartite networks interlinking 7 types of entities. Matrix-based
link weight functions are introduced to calculate weighted bipartite networks
and weighted unipartite co-occurrence networks in the collection of papers.
These weight calculation methods, when used in conjunction with unweighted
bipartite growth models, produce simple growth models for weighted networks in
collections of papers.
