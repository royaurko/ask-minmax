Biopolymer Networks play an important role in coordinating and regulating
collective cellular dynamics via a number of signaling pathways. Here, we
investigate the mechanical response of a model biopolymer network due to the
active contraction of embedded cells. Specifically, a graph (bond-node) model
derived from confocal microscopy data is used to represent the network
microstructure, and cell contraction is modeled by applying correlated
displacements at specific nodes, representing the focal adhesion sites. A
force-based stochastic relaxation method is employed to obtain force-balanced
network under cell contraction. We find that the majority of the forces are
carried by a small number of heterogeneous force chains emitted from the
contracting cells. The force chains consist of fiber segments that either
possess a high degree of alignment before cell contraction or are aligned due
to the reorientation induced by cell contraction. Large fluctuations of the
forces along different force chains are observed. Importantly, the decay of the
forces along the force chains is significantly slower than the decay of
radially averaged forces in the system. These results suggest that the fibrous
nature of biopolymer network structure can support long-range force
transmission and thus, long-range mechanical signaling between cells.
