We study a layered $K$-user $M$-hop Gaussian relay network consisting of
$K_m$ nodes in the $m^{\operatorname{th}}$ layer, where $M\geq2$ and
$K=K_1=K_{M+1}$. We observe that the time-varying nature of wireless channels
or fading can be exploited to mitigate the inter-user interference. The
proposed amplify-and-forward relaying scheme exploits such channel variations
and works for a wide class of channel distributions including Rayleigh fading.
We show a general achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) region for this class of
Gaussian relay networks. Specifically, the set of all $(d_1,..., d_K)$ such
that $d_i\leq 1$ for all $i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^K d_i\leq K_{\Sigma}$ is
achievable, where $d_i$ is the DoF of the $i^{\operatorname{th}}$
source--destination pair and $K_{\Sigma}$ is the maximum integer such that
$K_{\Sigma}\leq \min_m\{K_m\}$ and $M/K_{\Sigma}$ is an integer. We show that
surprisingly the achievable DoF region coincides with the cut-set outer bound
if $M/\min_m\{K_m\}$ is an integer, thus interference-free communication is
possible in terms of DoF. We further characterize an achievable DoF region
assuming multi-antenna nodes and general message set, which again coincides
with the cut-set outer bound for a certain class of networks.
