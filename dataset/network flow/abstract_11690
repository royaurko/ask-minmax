Images become an important and prevalent way to express users' activities,
opinions and emotions. In a social network, individual emotions may be
influenced by others, in particular by close friends. We focus on understanding
how users embed emotions into the images they uploaded to the social websites
and how social influence plays a role in changing users' emotions. We first
verify the existence of emotion influence in the image networks, and then
propose a probabilistic factor graph based emotion influence model to answer
the questions of "who influences whom". Employing a real network from Flickr as
experimental data, we study the effectiveness of factors in the proposed model
with in-depth data analysis. Our experiments also show that our model, by
incorporating the emotion influence, can significantly improve the accuracy
(+5%) for predicting emotions from images. Finally, a case study is used as the
anecdotal evidence to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model.
