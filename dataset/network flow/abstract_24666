Full-duplex multi-way relaying is a potential solution for supporting high
data rates in future Internet-of-Things (IoT) and 5G networks. Thus, in this
paper the full-duplex MIMO multi-way channel consisting of 3 users (Y-channel)
with $M$ antennas each and a common relay node with $N$ antennas is studied.
Each user wants to exchange messages with all the other users via the relay. A
transmission strategy is proposed based on channel diagonalization that
decomposes the channel into parallel sub-channels, and physical-layer network
coding over these sub-channels. It is shown that the proposed strategy achieves
the optimal DoF region of the channel if $N\leq M$. Furthermore, the proposed
strategy that requires joint encoding over multiple sub-channels is compared to
another strategy that encodes over each sub-channel separately. It turns out
that coding jointly over sub-channels is necessary for an optimal transmission
strategy. This shows that the MIMO Y-channel is inseparable.
