The dynamical system for inertial particles in fluid flow has both attracting
and repelling regions, the interplay of which can localize particles. In
laminar flow experiments we find that particles, initially moving throughout
the fluid domain, can undergo an instability and cluster into subdomains of the
fluid when the flow Reynolds number exceeds a critical value that depends on
particle and fluid inertia. We derive an expression for the instability
boundary and for a universal curve that describes the clustering rate for all
particles.
