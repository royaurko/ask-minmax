We present three dimensional realizations of the model introduced recently by
(Karlin, B\"osch, Chikatamarla, Phys. Rev. E 2014) and review the role of the
entropic stabilizer. The presented models achieve outstanding numerical
stability in presence of turbulent high Reynolds number flows. We report
accurate results for low order moments for homogeneous isotropic decaying
turbulence and second order grid convergence for most assessed statistical
quantities. The explicit and efficient nature of the scheme renders it a very
promising candidate for both engineering and scientific purposes in the
vicinity of highly turbulent flows.
