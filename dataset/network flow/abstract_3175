The growing online traffic that is bringing the infrastructure to its limits
induces an urgent demand for an efficient content delivery model. Capitalizing
social networks and using advanced delivery networks potentially can help to
solve this problem. However, due to the complex nature of the involved networks
such a model is difficult to assess. In this paper we use a simulative approach
to analyze how the SatTorrent P2P protocol supported by social networks can
improve content delivery by means of reduced download duration and traffic.
