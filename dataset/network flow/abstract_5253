The interaction between flows and orography is a fundamental aspect of
theoretical fluid dynamics for its direct applications (e.g., in dynamical
meteorology); a comprehensive description is nowadays still lacking in some
aspects. In this work, in particular, the contributors would like to face the
problem of flow-blocking and of the streamlines pattern formation, examining
the role of stratification (i.e., Brunt-Vaisala frequency) and Froude number on
these problems. In particular this work wants to investigate the role of
vertical advection on flow-blocking and on streamlines geometry. The importance
of streamlines curvature and stratification for the formation of pressure
perturbation, then their role in flow-blocking will be shown. Moreover it will
be shown how flow-blocking cannot be easly predict using only a stratification
parameter or the Froude number.
