We study the effects of a collective flow and multiple scattering on
two-particle correlation measurements in Hanbury-Brown-Twiss intensity
interferometry. We find that under a collective flow the effective source
distribution in a two-particle correlation measurement depends on the initial
source distribution. In addition, it depends on a collective flow phase
function which consists of terms that tend to cancel each other. As the
detected particles traverse from the source point to the freeze-out point, they
are subject to multiple scattering with medium particles. We examine the
effects of multiple scattering on HBT correlations. By using the Glauber theory
of multiple scattering at high energies and the optical model at intermediate
energies, we find that multiple scattering leads to an absorption and an
effective density distribution that depends on the initial source distribution.
