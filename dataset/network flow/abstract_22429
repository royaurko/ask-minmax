This paper is devoted to study the effects arising from imposing a
value-at-risk (VaR) constraint in mean-variance portfolio selection problem for
an investor who receives a stochastic cash flow which he/she must then invest
in a continuous-time financial market. For simplicity, we assume that there is
only one investment opportunity available for the investor, a risky stock.
Using techniques of stochastic linear-quadratic (LQ) control, the optimal
mean-variance investment strategy with and without VaR constraint are derived
explicitly in closed forms, based on solution of corresponding
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Furthermore, some numerical examples
are proposed to show how the addition of the VaR constraint affects the optimal
strategy.
