The large sizes of Lyman alpha ``clouds'' inferred from coincident absorption
in the spectrum of close quasar pairs suggests that these are transient
flattened structures of small overdensity. It is argued that the observed
absorbers should be preferentially located in underdense regions of the
universe and should typically expand faster than the Hubble flow.
