We prove special decay properties of solutions to the initial value problem
associated to the $k$-generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation. These are related
with persistence properties of the solution flow in weighted Sobolev spaces and
with sharp unique continuation properties of solutions to this equation. As
application of our method we also obtain results concerning the decay behavior
of perturbations of the traveling wave solutions as well as results for
solutions corresponding to special data.
