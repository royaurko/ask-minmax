Modularity is widely used to effectively measure the strength of the disjoint
community structure found by community detection algorithms. Although several
overlapping extensions of modularity were proposed to measure the quality of
overlapping community structure, there is lack of systematic comparison of
different extensions. To fill this gap, we overview overlapping extensions of
modularity to select the best. In addition, we extend the Modularity Density
metric to enable its usage for overlapping communities. The experimental
results on four real networks using overlapping extensions of modularity,
overlapping modularity density, and six other community quality metrics show
that the best results are obtained when the product of the belonging
coefficients of two nodes is used as the belonging function. Moreover, our
experiments indicate that overlapping modularity density is a better measure of
the quality of overlapping community structure than other metrics considered.
