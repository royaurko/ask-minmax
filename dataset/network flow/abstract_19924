The slip phenomena in thin polymer films confined by either flat or
periodically corrugated surfaces are investigated by molecular dynamics and
continuum simulations. For atomically flat surfaces and weak wall-fluid
interactions, the shear rate dependence of the slip length has a distinct local
minimum which is followed by a rapid increase at higher shear rates. For
corrugated surfaces with wavelength larger than the radius of gyration of
polymer chains, the effective slip length decays monotonically with increasing
corrugation amplitude. At small amplitudes, this decay is reproduced accurately
by the numerical solution of the Stokes equation with constant and
rate-dependent local slip length. When the corrugation wavelength is comparable
to the radius of gyration, the continuum predictions overestimate the effective
slip length obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. The analysis of the
conformational properties indicates that polymer chains tend to stretch in the
direction of shear flow above the crests of the wavy surface.
