Sensor networks are currently an active research area mainly due to the
potential of their applications. In this paper we investigate the use of
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for air pollution monitoring in Mauritius. With
the fast growing industrial activities on the island, the problem of air
pollution is becoming a major concern for the health of the population. We
proposed an innovative system named Wireless Sensor Network Air Pollution
Monitoring System (WAPMS) to monitor air pollution in Mauritius through the use
of wireless sensors deployed in huge numbers around the island. The proposed
system makes use of an Air Quality Index (AQI) which is presently not available
in Mauritius. In order to improve the efficiency of WAPMS, we have designed and
implemented a new data aggregation algorithm named Recursive Converging
Quartiles (RCQ). The algorithm is used to merge data to eliminate duplicates,
filter out invalid readings and summarise them into a simpler form which
significantly reduce the amount of data to be transmitted to the sink and thus
saving energy. For better power management we used a hierarchical routing
protocol in WAPMS and caused the motes to sleep during idle time.
