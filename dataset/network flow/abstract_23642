Discrete symmetries are commonplace in field theoretical models but pose a
severe problem for cosmology since they lead to the formation of domain walls
during spontaneous symmetry breaking in the early universe. However if one of
the vacuua is favoured over the others, either energetically, or because of
initial conditions, it will eventually come to dominate the universe. Using
numerical methods, we study the evolution of the domain wall network for a
variety of field configurations in two and three dimensions and quantify the
rate at which the walls disappear. Good agreement is found with a recent
analytic estimate of the termination of the scaling regime of the wall network.
