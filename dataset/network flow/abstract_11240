A stochastic model for a mobile network is studied. Users enter the network,
and then perform independent Markovian routes between nodes where they receive
service according to the Processor-Sharing policy. Once their service
requirement is satisfied, they leave the system. The stability region is
identified via a fluid limit approach, and strongly relies on a "spatial
homogenization" property: at the fluid level, customers are instantaneously
distributed across the network according to the stationary distribution of
their Markovian dynamics and stay distributed as such as long as the network is
not empty. In the unstable regime, spatial homogenization almost surely holds
asymptotically as time goes to infinity (on the normal scale), telling how the
system fills up. One of the technical achievements of the paper is the
construction of a family of martingales associated to the multidimensional
process of interest, which makes it possible to get crucial estimates for
certain exit times.
