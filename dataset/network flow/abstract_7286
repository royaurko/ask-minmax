We study the emergence of a power law distribution in the systems which can
be characterized by a hierarchically organized supplying network. It is shown
that conservation laws on the branches of the network can, at some
approximation, impose power law properties on the systems. Some simple examples
taken from economics, biophysics etc. are considered.
