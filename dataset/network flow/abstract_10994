Binary mixtures growing on small-world networks under far-from-equilibrium
conditions are studied by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. For any
positive value of the shortcut fraction of the network ($p>0$), the system
undergoes a continuous order-disorder phase transition, while it is noncritical
in the regular lattice limit ($p=0$). Using finite-size scaling relations, the
phase diagram is obtained in the thermodynamic limit and the critical exponents
are evaluated. The small-world networks are thus shown to trigger criticality,
a remarkable phenomenon which is analogous to similar observations reported
recently in the investigation of equilibrium systems.
