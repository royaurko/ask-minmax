Wireless control systems (WCSs) often have to operate in dynamic environments
where the network traffic load may vary unpredictably over time. The sampling
in sensors is conventionally time triggered with fixed periods. In this
context, only worse-than-possible quality of control (QoC) can be achieved when
the network is underloaded, while overloaded conditions may significantly
degrade the QoC, even causing system instability. This is particularly true
when the bandwidth of the wireless network is limited and shared by multiple
control loops. To address these problems, a flexible time-triggered sampling
scheme is presented in this work. Smart sensors are used to facilitate dynamic
adjustment of sampling periods, which enhances the flexibility and resource
efficiency of the system based on time-triggered sampling. Feedback control
technology is exploited for adapting sampling periods in a periodic manner. The
deadline miss ratio in each control loop is maintained at/around a desired
level, regardless of workload variations. Simulation results show that the
proposed sampling scheme is able to deal with dynamic and unpredictable
variations in network traffic load. Compared to conventional time-triggered
sampling, it leads to much better QoC in WCSs operating in dynamic
environments.
