Planetary systems toward the Galactic Bulge can be detected through
microlensing measurements. The microlensing planet search technique has some
unique merits: low-mass planets can be detected from the ground; the Galactic
family of planetary systems can be sampled unbiased; the time scale for the
completion of each event is relatively short. The unambiguity of the underlying
low-multiplicity point lenses is an indispensable element that allows robust
interpretaion of the events.
  We have found the first circumbinary planet in the microlensing event
MACHO-97-BLG-41. We have found evidence of a low mass planet (few Earths to
Neptune mass) in a very high magnification event MACHO-98-BLG-35. We emphasize
the necessity for coherent searches of microlensing planets with a network of
instruments in the southern hemisphere. The network can also be vitally
instrumental for follow-up observations of SN1a's and GRB's which share with
microlensing planets the transiency as well as the clues to our quest of the
origins.
