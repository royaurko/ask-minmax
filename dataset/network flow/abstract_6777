Using a generalized non-spherical, multi-transonic accretion flow model, we
analytically calculate the normalized QPO frequency ${\bar {\bf {\nu}}}_{qpo}$
of galactic black hole candidates in terms of dynamical flow variables and
self-consistently study the dependence of ${\bar {\bf {\nu}}}_{qpo}$ on such
variables. Our results are in fairly close agreement with the observed QPO
frequencies of GRS 1915+105. We find that ${\bar {\bf {\nu}}}_{qpo}$ is quite
sensitive to various parameters describing the black hole accretion flow
containing dissipative and non-dissipative shock waves. Thus the QPO phenomena
is, {\it indeed}, regulated by `shocked' black hole accretion, and, for the
first time, we establish a definitive connection between the QPO frequency and
the properties of advective BH accretion flows. This information may provide
the explanation of some important observations of galactic micro quasars.
