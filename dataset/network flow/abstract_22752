Aqueous colloidal dispersions of silica particles become anisotropic when
they are dried through evaporation. This anisotropy is generated by a uniaxial
strain of the liquid dispersions as they are compressed by the flow of water
toward a solidification front. Part of the strain produced by the compression
is relaxed, and part of it is stored and transferred to the solid. This stored
elastic strain has consequences for the properties of the solid, where it may
facilitate the growth of shear bands, and generate birefringence.
