We consider non-selfadjoint perturbations of a self-adjoint
$h$-pseudodifferential operator in dimension 2. In the present work we treat
the case when the classical flow of the unperturbed part is periodic and the
strength $\epsilon $ of the perturbation satisfies $h^{\delta_0} <\epsilon \le
\epsilon_0$ for some $\delta_0\in ]0,1/2[$ and a sufficiently small $\epsilon
_0>0$. We get a complete asymptotic description of all eigenvalues in certain
rectangles $[-1/C,1/C]+i\epsilon [F_0-1/C,F_0+1/C]$. In particular we are able
to treat the case when $\epsilon >0$ is small but independent of $h$.
