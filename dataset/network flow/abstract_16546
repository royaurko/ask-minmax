We provide general formulae for the configurational exponents of an arbitrary
polymer network connected to the surface of an arbitrary wedge of the
two-dimensional plane, where the surface is allowed to assume a general mixture
of boundary conditions on either side of the wedge. We report on a
comprehensive study of a linear chain by exact enumeration, with various
attachments of the walk's ends to the surface, in wedges of angles $\pi/2$ and
$\pi$, with general mixed boundary conditions.
