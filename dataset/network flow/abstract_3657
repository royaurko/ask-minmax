The evolution of turbulent spots in a parallel shear flow is studied by means
of full three-dimensional numerical simulations. The flow is bounded by free
surfaces and driven by a volume force. Three regions in the spanwise spot
cross-section can be identified: a turbulent interior, an interface layer with
prominent streamwise streaks and vortices and a laminar exterior region with a
large scale flow induced by the presence of the spot. The lift-up of streamwise
streaks which is caused by non-normal amplification is clearly detected in the
region adjacent to the spot interface. The spot can be characterized by an
exponentially decaying front that moves with a speed different from that of the
cross-stream outflow or the spanwise phase velocity of the streamwise roll
pattern. Growth of the spots seems to be intimately connected to the large
scale outside flow, for a turbulent ribbon extending across the box in
downstream direction does not show the large scale flow and does not grow.
Quantitatively, the large scale flow induces a linear instability in the
neighborhood of the spot, but the associated front velocity is too small to
explain the spot spreading.
