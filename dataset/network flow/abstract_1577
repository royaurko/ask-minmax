This is a short review on the compatibility between (a) mean-field,
mode-coupling theories of the glass transition, where potential energy
landscape ideas are natural, and (b) the necessity of describing the slowing
down of glassy materials in terms of a growing cooperative length, absent from
mean-field descriptions. We summarize some of the outstanding questions that
remain before we can say we understand why glasses do not flow.
