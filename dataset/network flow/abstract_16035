In this paper, we present a novel approach for robust optimal resource
allocation with joint carrier aggregation to allocate multiple carriers
resources optimally among users with elastic and inelastic traffic in cellular
networks. We use utility proportional fairness allocation policy, where the
fairness among users is in utility percentage of the application running on the
user equipment (UE). Each UE is assigned an application utility function based
on the type of its application. Our objective is to allocate multiple carriers
resources optimally among users subscribing for mobile services. In addition,
each user is guaranteed a minimum quality of service (QoS) that varies based on
the user's application type. We present a robust algorithm that solves the
drawback in the algorithm presented in [1] by preventing the fluctuations in
the resource allocation process, in the case of scarce resources, and allocates
optimal rates for both high-traffic and low-traffic situations. Our distributed
resource allocation algorithm allocates an optimal rate to each user from all
carriers in its range while providing the minimum price for the allocated rate.
In addition, we analyze the convergence of the algorithm with different network
traffic densities and show that our algorithm provides traffic dependent
pricing for network providers. Finally, we present simulation results for the
performance of our resource allocation algorithm.
