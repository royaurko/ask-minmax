We have developed a Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automata model for
describing of vehicular traffic flow at a single intersection. A set of traffic
lights operating in fixed-time scheme controls the traffic flow. Open boundary
condition is applied to the streets each of which conduct a uni-directional
flow. Streets are single-lane and cars can turn upon reaching to the
intersection with prescribed probabilities. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations
are carried out to find the model flow characteristics. In particular, we
investigate the flows dependence on the signalisation parameters, turning
probabilities and input rates. It is shown that for each set of parameters,
there exist a plateau region inside which the total outflow from the
intersection remains almost constant. We also compute total waiting time of
vehicles per cycle behind red lights for various control parameters.
