We derive the finite size dependence of the clustering coefficient of
scale-free random graphs generated by the configuration model with degree
distribution exponent $2<\gamma<3$. Degree heterogeneity increases the presence
of triangles in the network up to levels that compare to those found in many
real networks even for extremely large nets. We also find that for values of
$\gamma \approx 2$, clustering is virtually size independent and, at the same
time, becomes a {\it de facto} non self-averaging topological property. This
implies that a single instance network is not representative of the ensemble
even for very large network sizes.
