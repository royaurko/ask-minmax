We study a simple general scenario of ad hoc networks based on IEEE 802.11
wireless communications, consisting in a chain of transmitters, each of them
being in the carrier sense area of its neighbors. Each transmitter always
attempts to send some data frames to one receiver in its transmission area,
forming a pair sender-receiver. This scenario includes the three pairs fairness
problem, and allows to study some fairness issues of the IEEE 802.11 medium
access mechanism. We show by simulation that interesting phenomena appear,
depending on the number n of pairs in the chain and of its parity. We also
point out a notable asymptotic behavior. We introduce a powerful modeling, by
simply considering the probability for a transmitter to send data while its
neighbors are waiting. This model leads to a non-linear system of equations,
which matches very well the simulations, and which allows to study both small
and very large chains. We then analyze the fairness issue in the chain
regarding some parameters, as well as the asymptotic behavior. By studying very
long chains, we notice good asymptotic fairness of the IEEE 802.11 medium
sharing mechanism. As an application, we show how to increase the fairness in a
chain of three pairs.
