We report the application of the Monte Carlo simulation to phase separation
dynamics. First, we deal with the phase separation under shear flow. The
thermal effect on the phase separation is discussed, and the anisotropic growth
exponents in the late stage are estimated. Next, we study the effect of
surfactants on the three-component solvents. We obtain the mixture of
macrophase separation and microphase separation, and investigate the dynamics
of both phase separations.
