The multicast capacity of the Gaussian two-hop relay network with one source,
$N$ relays, and $L$ destinations is studied. It is shown that a careful
modification of the partial decode--forward coding scheme, whereby the relays
cooperate through degraded sets of message parts, achieves the cutset upper
bound within $(1/2)\log N$ bits regardless of the channel gains and power
constraints. This scheme improves upon a previous scheme by Chern and Ozgur,
which is also based on partial decode--forward yet has an unbounded gap from
the cutset bound for $L \ge 2$ destinations. When specialized to independent
codes among relays, the proposed scheme achieves within $\log N$ bits from the
cutset bound. The computation of this relaxation involves evaluating mutual
information across $L(N+1)$ cuts out of the total $L 2^N$ possible cuts,
providing a very simple linear-complexity algorithm to approximate the
single-source multicast capacity of the Gaussian two-hop relay network.
