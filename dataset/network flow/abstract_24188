We study the set of all pseudoline arrangements with contact points which
cover a given support. We define a natural notion of flip between these
arrangements and study the graph of these flips. In particular, we provide an
enumeration algorithm for arrangements with a given support, based on the
properties of certain greedy pseudoline arrangements and on their connection
with sorting networks. Both the running time per arrangement and the working
space of our algorithm are polynomial.
  As the motivation for this work, we provide in this paper a new
interpretation of both pseudotriangulations and multitriangulations in terms of
pseudoline arrangements on specific supports. This interpretation explains
their common properties and leads to a natural definition of
multipseudotriangulations, which generalizes both. We study elementary
properties of multipseudotriangulations and compare them to iterations of
pseudotriangulations.
