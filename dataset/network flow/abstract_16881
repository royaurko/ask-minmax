Using 16,068 articles in Wikipedia's Medicine Wikiproject, we study the
relationship between collaboration and quality. We assess whether certain
collaborative patterns are associated with information quality in terms of
self-evaluated quality and article viewership. We find that the number of
contributors has a curvilinear relationship to information quality, more
contributors improving quality but only up to a certain point. Other articles
that its collaborators work on also influences the quality of an information
artifact, creating an interdependent network of artifacts and contributors.
Finally, we see evidence of a recursive relationship between information
quality and contributor activity, but that this recursive relationship
attenuates over time.
