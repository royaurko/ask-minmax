A prototype of modular networked robot for autonomous monitoring works with
full control over web through wireless connection has been developed. The robot
is equipped with a particular set of built-in analyzing tools and appropriate
censors, depending on its main purposes, to enable self-independent and
real-time data acquisition and processing. The paper is focused on the
microcontroller-based system to realize the modularity. The whole system is
divided into three modules : main unit, data acquisition and data processing,
while the analyzed results and all aspects of control and monitoring systems
are fully accessible over an integrated web-interface. This concept leads to
some unique features : enhancing flexibility due to enabling partial
replacement of the modules according to user needs, easy access over web for
remote users, and low development and maintenance cost due to software
dominated components.
