We develop a necessary condition for the existence of stable fixed points for
the general network Kuramoto model, and use it to show that for the complete
network the homogeneous model has no non-zero stable fixed point solution. This
result provides further evidence that in the homogeneous case the zero fixed
point has an attractor set consisting of the entire space minus a set of
measure zero, a conjecture of Verwoerd and Mason (2007).
