We consider the existence problem for `Steiner networks' (trivalent graphs
with 120 degree angles at each junction) in strictly convex domains, with
`Neumann' boundary conditions (orthogonal intersection with the domain
boundary.) For each of the three possible combinatorial possibilities,
sufficient conditions on the domain are derived for existence; in addition, in
each case explicit examples of nonexistence are given.
