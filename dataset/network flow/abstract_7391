New X-ray observations from the {\it Chandra} and XMM-{\it Newton}
observatories have shown that cooling of the intracluster medium is occurring
at rates that are now approaching the star formation rates measured in cD
galaxies at the bases of cooling flows. Star formation proceeds in repeated
episodes, possibly indicating an intermittent fuel supply. Coupled with new
evidence for heating by AGN, a new paradigm of self-regulated cooling and star
formation in cluster cores is emerging.
