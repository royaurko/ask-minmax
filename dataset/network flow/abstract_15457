Financial markets are exposed to systemic risk (SR), the risk that a major
fraction of the system ceases to function and collapses. Since recently it is
possible to quantify SR in terms of underlying financial networks where nodes
represent financial institutions, and links capture the size and maturity of
assets (loans), liabilities, and other obligations such as derivatives. We show
that it is possible to quantify the share of SR that individual liabilities in
a financial network contribute to the overall SR. We use empirical data of
nation-wide interbank liabilities to show that a few liabilities carry the
major fraction of the overall SR. We propose a tax on individual transactions
that is proportional to their contribution to overall SR. If a transaction does
not increase SR it is tax free. With an agent based model (CRISIS
macro-financial model) we demonstrate that the proposed Systemic Risk Tax (SRT)
leads to a self-organized re-structuring of financial networks that are
practically free of SR. ABM predictions agree remarkably well with the
empirical data and can be used to understand the relation of credit risk and
SR.
