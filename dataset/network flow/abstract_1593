We show the standard two-level continuous-time model of loss-modulated CO$_2$
lasers to display the same regular network of self-similar stability islands
known so far to be typically present only in discrete-time models based on
mappings. For class B laser models our results suggest that, more than just
convenient surrogates, discrete mappings in fact could be isomorphic to
continuous flows.
