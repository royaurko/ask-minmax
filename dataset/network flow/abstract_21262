We consider an ensemble of fully connected networks of N oscillators coupled
harmonically with random springs and show, using Random Matrix Theory
considerations, that both the average phonon heat current and its variance are
scale-invariant and take universal values in the large N-limit. These anomalous
mesoscopic uctuations is the hallmark of strong correlations between normal
modes.
