A ROSAT HRI observation of the cluster MS0839.9+2938 at z=0.194 is presented.
It confirms the earlier suggestion, based on the detection of extended
H$\alpha$ emission, that the inner regions of this cluster are dominated by a
cooling flow. The surface brightness distribution within the cooling radius
shows structures which can be interpreted as evidence of a highly inhomogeneous
space distribution of the cooling process. We note that the brightness at the
barycentre of its distribution, which falls right on top of the central giant
elliptical galaxy, is lower than the peaks in the structures around: we suggest
that this situation is likely to arise as a consequence of photoelectric
absorption by cold gas within the cooling flow, with an equivalent column
density in the order of 5$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ within $\sim$10" from the
centre.
