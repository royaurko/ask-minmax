The choice of generator in the Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) flow
equation determines the evolution pattern of the Hamiltonian. The kinetic
energy has been used in the generator for most prior applications to nuclear
interactions, and other options have been largely unexplored. Here we show how
variations of this standard choice can allow the evolution to proceed more
efficiently without losing its advantages.
