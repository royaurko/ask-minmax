We show that the vibrational response of a glassy liquid at finite
frequencies can be described by continuum mechanics despite the vast degeneracy
of the vibrational ground state; standard continuum elasticity assumes a unique
ground state. The effective elastic constants are determined by the bare
elastic constants of individual free energy minima of the liquid, the magnitude
of built-in stress, and temperature, analogously to how the dielectric response
of a polar liquid is determined by the dipole moment of the constituent
molecules and temperature. In contrast with the dielectric constant---which is
enhanced by adding polar molecules to the system---the elastic constants are
down-renormalized by the relaxation of the built-in stress. The renormalization
flow of the elastic constants has three fixed points, two of which are trivial
and correspond to the uniform liquid state and an infinitely compressible solid
respectively. There is also a nontrivial fixed point at the Poisson ratio equal
to 1/5, which corresponds to an isospin-like degeneracy between shear and
uniform deformation. The present description predicts a discontinuous jump in
the (finite frequency) shear modulus at the crossover from collisional to
activated transport, consistent with the RFOT theory.
