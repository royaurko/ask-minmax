We study a Lagrangian numerical scheme for solution of a nonlinear drift
diffusion equation on an interval. The discretization is based on the
equation's gradient flow structure with respect to the Wasserstein distance.
The scheme inherits various properties of the continuous flow, like entropy
monotonicity, mass preservation, metric contraction and minimum/maximum
principles. As the main result, we give a proof of convergence in the limit of
vanishing mesh size under a CFL-type condition. We also present results from
numerical experiments.
