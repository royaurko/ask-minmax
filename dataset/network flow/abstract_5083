The goal of this paper is two-fold. First, to establish a tractable model for
the underwater acoustic channel useful for network optimization in terms of
convexity. Second, to propose a network coding based lower bound for
transmission power in underwater acoustic networks, and compare this bound to
the performance of several network layer schemes. The underwater acoustic
channel is characterized by a path loss that depends strongly on transmission
distance and signal frequency. The exact relationship among power, transmission
band, distance and capacity for the Gaussian noise scenario is a complicated
one. We provide a closed-form approximate model for 1) transmission power and
2) optimal frequency band to use, as functions of distance and capacity. The
model is obtained through numerical evaluation of analytical results that take
into account physical models of acoustic propagation loss and ambient noise.
Network coding is applied to determine a lower bound to transmission power for
a multicast scenario, for a variety of multicast data rates and transmission
distances of interest for practical systems, exploiting physical properties of
the underwater acoustic channel. The results quantify the performance gap in
transmission power between a variety of routing and network coding schemes and
the network coding based lower bound. We illustrate results numerically for
different network scenarios.
