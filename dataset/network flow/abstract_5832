The body of knowledge accumulated in recent years on the structure and the
dynamics of complex networks has offered useful insights on the behaviour of
many natural and artificial complex systems. The analysis of some of these,
namely those formed by companies and institutions, however, has proved
problematical mainly for the difficulties in collecting a reasonable amount of
data. This contribution argues that the World Wide Web can provide an efficient
and effective way to gather significant samples of networked socio-economic
systems to be used for network analyses and simulations. The case discussed
refers to a tourism destination, the fundamental subsystem of an industry which
can be considered one of the most important in today's World economy.
