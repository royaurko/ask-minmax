Quickly moving to a new area of research is painful for researchers due to
the vast amount of scientific literature in each field of study. One possible
way to overcome this problem is to summarize a scientific topic. In this paper,
we propose a model of summarizing a single article, which can be further used
to summarize an entire topic. Our model is based on analyzing others' viewpoint
of the target article's contributions and the study of its citation summary
network using a clustering approach.
