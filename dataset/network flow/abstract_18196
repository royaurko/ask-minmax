Inspired by the local minority game, we propose a network Boolean game and
investigate its dynamical properties on scale-free networks. The system can
self-organize to a stable state with better performance than random choice
game, although only the local information is available to the agent. By
introducing the heterogeneity of local interactions, we find the system has the
best performance when each agent's interaction frequency is linear correlated
with its information capacity. Generally, the agents with more information gain
more than those with less information, while in the optimal case, each agent
almost has the same average profit. In addition, we investigate the role of
irrational factor and find an interesting symmetrical behavior.
