We suggest a disordered traffic flow model that captures many features of
traffic flow. It is an extension of the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) stochastic
cellular automata for single line vehicular traffic model. It incorporates
random acceleration and deceleration terms that may be greater than one unit.
Our model leads under its intrinsic dynamics, for high values of braking
probability $p$, to a constant flow at intermediate densities without
introducing any spatial inhomogeneities. For a system of fast drivers $p\to 0$,
the model exhibits a density wave behavior that was observed in car following
models with optimal velocity. The gap of the disordered model we present
exhibits, for high values of $p$ and random deceleration, at a critical
density, a power law distribution which is a hall mark of a self organized
criticality phenomena.
