This paper is an extension to the memory retrieval procedure of the B-Matrix
approach [6],[17] to neural network learning. The B-Matrix is a part of the
interconnection matrix generated from the Hebbian neural network, and in memory
retrieval, the B-matrix is clamped with a small fragment of the memory. The
fragment gradually enlarges by means of feedback, until the entire vector is
obtained. In this paper, we propose the use of delta learning to enhance the
retrieval rate of the stored memories.
