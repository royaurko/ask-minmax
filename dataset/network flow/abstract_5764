The self-organized dopant percolative filamentary model, entirely orbital in
character (no fictive spins), explains chemical trends in superconductive
transition temperatures Tc, assuming that Cooper pairs are formed near dopants
because attractive electron-phonon interactions outweigh repulsive Coulomb
interactions. According to rules previously used successfully for network
glasses, the host networks are marginally stable mechanically. The high Tc's
are caused by softening of the host network, enormously enhanced by large
electron-phonon interactions at interlayer dopants for states near the Fermi
energy. Background (in)homogeneities (pseudogap regions) produce novel
percolative features in phase diagrams.
