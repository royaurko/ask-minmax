Numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the diffusive shock acceleration in the
test particle limit are investigated. We simulate high relativistic flow
astrophysical plasmas for upstream $\gamma$ $\sim5$ and up to $\gamma$
$\sim1000$. These gamma values are relevant to the diffusive shock acceleration
models of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). The
spectral shape for the above high relativistic processes will be calculated.
This work presents distinctive spectral shapes with plateau-like
characteristics due to the relativistic effects and the spectral indexes are
found to be as flat as the flow becomes relativistic; the latter is in a very
good agreement with previous theoretical and numerical works concerning
relativistic plasma flows.
