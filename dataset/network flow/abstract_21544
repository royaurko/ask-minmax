We describe a new effect in semiconductor spintronics that leads to
dissipationless spin-currents in paramagnetic spin-orbit coupled systems. We
argue that in a high mobility two-dimensional electron system with substantial
Rashba spin-orbit coupling, a spin-current that flows perpendicular to the
charge current is intrinsic. In the usual case where both spin-orbit split
bands are occupied, the spin-Hall conductivity has a universal value.
