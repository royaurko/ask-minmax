A cold, thin film of liquid impinging on an isothermal hot, horizontal
surface has been investigated. An approximate solution for the velocity and
temperature distributions in the flow along the horizontal surface is
developed, which exploits the hydrodynamic similarity solution for thin film
flow. The approximate solution may provide a valuable basis for assessing flow
and heat transfer in more complex settings.
