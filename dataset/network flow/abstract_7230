To what extent do the characteristic features of a chemical reaction network
reflect its purpose and function? In general, one argues that correlations
between specific features and specific functions are key to understanding a
complex structure. However, specific features may sometimes be neutral and
uncorrelated with any system-specific purpose, function or causal chain. Such
neutral features are caused by chance and randomness. Here we compare two
classes of chemical networks: one that has been subjected to biological
evolution (the chemical reaction network of metabolism in living cells) and one
that has not (the atmospheric planetary chemical reaction networks). Their
degree distributions are shown to share the very same neutral
system-independent features. The shape of the broad distributions is to a large
extent controlled by a single parameter, the network size. From this
perspective, there is little difference between atmospheric and metabolic
networks; they are just different sizes of the same random assembling network.
In other words, the shape of the degree distribution is a neutral
characteristic feature and has no functional or evolutionary implications in
itself; it is not a matter of life and death.
