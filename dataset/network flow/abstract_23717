For the voter model, we study the effect of a memory-dependent transition
rate. We assume that the transition of a spin into the opposite state decreases
with the time it has been in its current state. Counter-intuitively, we find
that the time to reach a macroscopically ordered state can be accelerated by
slowing-down the microscopic dynamics in this way. This holds for different
network topologies, including fully-connected ones. We find that the ordering
dynamics is governed by two competing processes which either stabilize the
majority or the minority state. If the first one dominates, it accelerates the
ordering of the system. The conclusions of this Letter are not restricted to
the voter model, but remain valid to many other spin systems as well.
