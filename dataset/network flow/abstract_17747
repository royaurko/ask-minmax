A mode parabolic equation method for resonantly interacted modes was
developed. The flow of acoustic energy is conserved for the derived equations
with an accuracy adequate to the used approximation. The testing calculations
were done for ASA wedge benchmark and proved excellent agreement with COUPLE
program.
