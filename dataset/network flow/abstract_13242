Vibrational energy flows unevenly in molecules, repeatedly going back and
forth between trapping and roaming. We identify bottlenecks between diffusive
and chaotic behavior, and describe generic mechanisms of these transitions,
taking the carbonyl sulphide molecule OCS as a case study. The bottlenecks are
found to be lower-dimensional tori; their bifurcations and unstable manifolds
govern the transition mechanisms.
