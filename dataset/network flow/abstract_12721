Distinguishing the long-range bonds with the regular ones, the critical
temperature of the spin-lattice Guassian model built on two typical Small-world
Networks (SWNs) is studied. The results show much difference from the classical
case, and thus may induce some more accurate discussion on the critical
properties of the spin-lattice systems combined with the SWNs.
