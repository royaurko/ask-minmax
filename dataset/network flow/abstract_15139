To characterize the structure, dynamics and operational state of the Internet
it requires distributed measurements. Although in the last decades several
systems capable to do this have been created, the easy access of these
infrastructures and orchestration of complex measurements is not solved. We
propose a system architecture that combines the flexibility of mature network
measurement infrastructures such as PlanetLab or ETOMIC with the general
accessibility and popularity of public services like Web based bandwidth
measurement or traceroute servers. To realize these requirements we developed a
multi-layer architecture based on Web Services and the basic principles of SOA,
which is a very popular paradigm in distributed business application
development. Our approach opens the door to perform complex network
measurements, handles heterogeneous measurement devices, automatically stores
the results in a public database and protects against malicious users as well.
To demonstrate our concept we developed a public prototype system, called
SONoMA.
