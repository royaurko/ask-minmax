Congestion is an important issue which researchers focus on in the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) network environment. To keep the stability
of the whole network, congestion control algorithms have been extensively
studied. Queue management method employed by the routers is one of the
important issues in the congestion control study. Active queue management (AQM)
has been proposed as a router-based mechanism for early detection of congestion
inside the network. In this paper we analyzed several active queue management
algorithms with respect to their abilities of maintaining high resource
utilization, identifying and restricting disproportionate bandwidth usage, and
their deployment complexity. We compare the performance of FRED, BLUE, SFB, and
CHOKe based on simulation results, using RED and Drop Tail as the evaluation
baseline. The characteristics of different algorithms are also discussed and
compared. Simulation is done by using Network Simulator(NS2) and the graphs are
drawn using X- graph.
