The past few years have seen a surge of interest in the field of
probabilistic logic learning and statistical relational learning. In this
endeavor, many probabilistic logics have been developed. ProbLog is a recent
probabilistic extension of Prolog motivated by the mining of large biological
networks. In ProbLog, facts can be labeled with probabilities. These facts are
treated as mutually independent random variables that indicate whether these
facts belong to a randomly sampled program. Different kinds of queries can be
posed to ProbLog programs. We introduce algorithms that allow the efficient
execution of these queries, discuss their implementation on top of the
YAP-Prolog system, and evaluate their performance in the context of large
networks of biological entities.
