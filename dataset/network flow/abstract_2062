The complex permittivity of conducting polyaniline and zeolite - polyaniline
blends was measured in the frequency range 0.01 to 2000000 Hz from room
temperature to liquid nitrogen temperature. A loss peak is detected for 25, 35
and 50 wt % zeolite blends. Its position in the frequency domain, activation
energy and intensity is a function of composition. The experimental results are
interpreted through the competing multiple role of zeolite: as being less
conducting than polyaniline, it impedes the electric charge flow by dividing
large conducting polyaniline regions into smaller pieces, subsequently provides
short-range pathways and, moreover, enriches the blend in interfaces separating
zeolite from polyaniline.
