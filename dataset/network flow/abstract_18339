Inspired by the ubiquity of composite filamentous networks in nature we
investigate models of biopolymer networks that consist of interconnected floppy
and stiff filaments. Numerical simulations carried out in three dimensions
allow us to explore the microscopic partitioning of stresses and strains
between the stiff and floppy fractions c_s and c_f, and reveal a non-trivial
relationship between the mechanical behavior and the relative fraction of stiff
polymer: when there are few stiff polymers, non-percolated stiff ``inclusions``
are protected from large deformations by an encompassing floppy matrix, while
at higher fractions of stiff material the stiff network is independently
percolated and dominates the mechanical response.
