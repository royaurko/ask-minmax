We are concerned with maximizing the lifetime of a data-gathering wireless
sensor network consisting of set of nodes directly communicating with a
base-station. We model this scenario as the m-message interactive communication
between multiple correlated informants (sensor nodes) and a recipient
(base-station). With this framework, we show that m-message interactive
communication can indeed enhance network lifetime. Both worst-case and
average-case performances are considered.
