Consider the set $\chi^0_{\mathrm{nw}}$ of non-wandering continuous flows on
a closed surface. Then such a flow can be approximated by regular non-wandering
flows without heteroclinic connections nor locally dense orbits in
$\chi^0_{\mathrm{nw}}$. Using this approximation, we show that a non-wandering
continuous flow on a closed connected surface is topologically stable if and
only if the orbit space of it is homeomorphic to a closed interval. Moreover we
state the non-existence of topologically stable non-wandering flows on closed
surfaces which are not neither $\mathbb{S}^2$, $\mathbb{P}^2$, nor
$\mathbb{K}^2$.
