Fast slip flow was reported for water inside the interlayer gallery between
graphene layers or carbon nanotubes. We report here that this flow rate
enhancement (over two orders) breaks down with the presence of chemical
functionalization and relaxation of the nanoconfinement in graphene oxides.
Molecular dynamics simulation results show that hydrodynamics applies in this
circumstance, even at length scales down to nanometers. However, corrections on
the slip boundary condition and viscosity of nanoconfined flow must be included
to make quantitative predictions. These results were discussed with structural
characteristics of the liquid water and hydrogen bond networks.
