This paper focuses on contention-based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols
used in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). We propose a novel MAC protocol
called Adaptive Backoff Tuning MAC (ABTMAC) based on IEEE 802.11 DCF. In our
proposed MAC protocol, we utilize a fixed transmission attempt rate and each
node dynamically adjusts its backoff window size considering the current
network status. We determined the appropriate transmission attempt rate for
both cases where the Request-To-Send/Clear-To-Send (RTS/CTS) mechanism was and
was not employed. Robustness against performance degradation caused by the
difference between desired and actual values of the attempt rate parameter is
considered when setting it. The performance of the protocol is evaluated
analytically and through simulations. These results indicate that a wireless
network utilizing ABTMAC performs better than one using IEEE 802.11 DCF.
