We compare the predicted local peculiar velocity field from the IRAS 1.2 Jy
flux-limited redshift survey and the Optical Redshift Survey (ORS) to the
measured peculiar velocities from the recently completed SBF Survey of Galaxy
Distances. The analysis produces a value of \beta = \Omega^{0.6}/b for the
redshift surveys, where b is the linear biasing factor, and a tie to the Hubble
flow, i.e., a value of H_0, for the SBF Survey. There is covariance between
these parameters, but we find good fits with H_0 \approx 74 \kmsM for the SBF
distances, \beta_I \approx 0.44 for the IRAS survey predictions, and \beta_O
\approx 0.3 for the ORS. The small-scale velocity error \sigv \sim 200 \kms is
similar to, though slightly larger than, the value obtained in our parametric
flow modeling with SBF.
