The flux flow resistivity associated with purely viscous motion of vortices
in high-quality MgB_2 was measured by microwave surface impedance. Flux flow
resistivity exhibits unusual field dependence with strong enhancement at low
field, which is markedly different to conventional s-wave superconductors. A
crossover field which separates two distinct flux flow regimes having different
flux flow resistivity slopes was clearly observed in H//ab-plane. The unusual
H-dependence indicates that two very differently sized superconducting gaps in
MgB_2 manifest in the vortex dynamics and almost equally contribute to energy
dissipation. The carrier scattering rate in two different bands is also
discussed with the present results, compared to heat capacity and thermal
conductivity results.
