We examine the Stillinger-Weber analysis of the potential energy landscape
for its stability and conclude that it does not provide a stable description of
the system as the free energy slope and curvature vanish simultaneously. An
alternative analysis developed recently by us involving complexity provides a
stable description with complexity a monotonic increasing function of
temperature.
