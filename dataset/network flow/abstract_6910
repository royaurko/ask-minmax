We consider fermion-dimer scattering in the presence of a large positive
scattering length in the frame of functional renormalization group equations. A
flow equation for the momentum dependent fermion-dimer scattering amplitude is
derived from first principles in a systematic vertex expansion of the exact
flow equation for the effective action. The resummation obtained from the
nonperturbative flow is shown to be equivalent to the one performed by the
integral equation by Skorniakov and Ter-Martirosian (STM). The flow equation
approach allows to integrate out fermions and bosons simultaneously, in line
with the fact that the bosons are not fundamental but build up gradually as
fluctuation induced bound states of fermions. In particular, the STM result for
atom-dimer scattering is obtained by choosing the relative cutoff scales of
fermions and bosons such that the fermion fluctuations are integrated out
already at the initial stage of the RG evolution.
