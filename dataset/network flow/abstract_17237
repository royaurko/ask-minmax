In this paper we investigate the Web interfaces of several DSL home routers
that can be used to manage their settings via a Web browser. Our goal is to
change these settings by using primary XSS and UI redressing attacks. This
study evaluates routers from 10 different manufacturers (TP-Link, Netgear,
Huawei, D-Link, Linksys, LogiLink, Belkin, Buffalo, Fritz!Box, and Asus). We
were able to circumvent the security of all of them. To demonstrate how all
devices are able to be attacked, we show how to do fast fingerprinting attacks.
Furthermore, we provide countermeasures to make administration interfaces and
therefore the use of routers more secure.
