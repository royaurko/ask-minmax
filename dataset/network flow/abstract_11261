We present an evolutionary programming algorithm for solving the dynamic
routing and wavelength assignment (DRWA) problem in optical wavelength-division
multiplexing (WDM) networks under wavelength continuity constraint. We assume
an ideal physical channel and therefore neglect the blocking of connection
requests due to the physical impairments. The problem formulation includes
suitable constraints that enable the algorithm to balance the load among the
individuals and thus results in a lower blocking probability and lower mean
execution time than the existing bio-inspired algorithms available in the
literature for the DRWA problems. Three types of wavelength assignment
techniques, such as First fit, Random, and Round Robin wavelength assignment
techniques have been investigated here. The ability to guarantee both low
blocking probability without any wavelength converters and small delay makes
the improved algorithm very attractive for current optical switching networks.
