We consider the problem of realizing tight contact structures on closed
orientable three-manifolds. By applying the theorems of Hofer et al., one may
deduce tightness from dynamical properties of (Reeb) flows transverse to the
contact structure. We detail how two classical constructions, Dehn surgery and
branched covering, may be performed on dynamically-constrained links in such a
way as to preserve a transverse tight contact structure.
