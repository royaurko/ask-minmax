Fluid dynamics videos of unstable thin annular liquid sheets are presented in
this short paper. These videos are to be presented in the Gallery of Fluid
Motion for the American Physical Society 65th Annual Meeting of the Division of
Fluid Dynamics in San Diego, CA, 18-20 November 2012. An annular sheet of
thickness h=1mm and mean radius R=18.9mm is subjected to aerodynamic axial
shear from co-flowing air at various shear rates on both the inner and outer
surface at a liquid sheet Reynolds Number of Re=500.
