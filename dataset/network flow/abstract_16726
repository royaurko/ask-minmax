We report structure formation in submonolayers of magnetic microparticles
subjected to periodic electrostatic and magnetic excitations. Depending on the
excitation parameters, we observe the formation of a rich variety of
structures: clusters, rings, chains, and networks. The growth dynamics and
shapes of the structures are strongly dependent on the amplitude and frequency
of the external magnetic field. We find that for pure ac magnetic driving at
low densities of particles, the low-frequency magnetic excitation favors
clusters while high frequency excitation favors chains and net-like structures.
An abrupt phase transition from chains to a network phase was observed for a
high density of particles.
