Rheological properties of dense flows of hard particles are singular as one
approaches the jamming threshold where flow ceases, both for aerial granular
flows dominated by inertia, and for over-damped suspensions. Concomitantly, the
lengthscale characterizing velocity correlations appears to diverge at jamming.
Here we introduce a theoretical framework that proposes a tentative, but
potentially complete scaling description of stationary flows. Our analysis,
which focuses on frictionless particles, applies {\it both} to suspensions and
inertial flows of hard particles. We compare our predictions with the empirical
literature, as well as with novel numerical data. Overall we find a very good
agreement between theory and observations, except for frictional inertial flows
whose scaling properties clearly differ from frictionless systems. For
over-damped flows, more observations are needed to decide if friction is a
relevant perturbation or not. Our analysis makes several new predictions on
microscopic dynamical quantities that should be accessible experimentally.
