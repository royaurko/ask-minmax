Cooperative games provide an appropriate framework for fair and stable profit
distribution in multiagent systems. In this paper, we study the algorithmic
issues on path cooperative games that arise from the situations where some
commodity flows through a network. In these games, a coalition of edges or
vertices is successful if it enables a path from the source to the sink in the
network, and lose otherwise. Based on dual theory of linear programming and the
relationship with flow games, we provide the characterizations on the CS-core,
least-core and nucleolus of path cooperative games. Furthermore, we show that
the least-core and nucleolus are polynomially solvable for path cooperative
games defined on both directed and undirected network.
