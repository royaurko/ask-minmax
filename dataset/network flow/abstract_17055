In this paper, we consider a model of impulsive recurrent neural networks
with piecewise constant delay. The dynamics are presented by differential
equations with discontinuities such as impulses at fixed moments and piecewise
constant argument of generalized type. Sufficient conditions ensuring the
existence, uniqueness and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point
are obtained. By employing Green's function we derive new result of existence
of the periodic solution. The global asymptotic stability of the solution is
investigated. Examples with numerical simulations are given to validate the
theoretical results.
