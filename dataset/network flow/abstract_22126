We consider field theory side of new multiple Seiberg dualities conjectured
within superconformal index matching approach. We study the case of SU(2)
supersymmetric QCD and find that the numerous conjectured duals are different
faces of handful of master theories. These different faces are inequivalent to
each other in a very peculiar sense. Some master theories are fully known; we
construct superpotentials for others. We confirm that all index identities
correspond to theories flowing to one and the same theory in the infrared, thus
supporting the conjecture of index matching for Seiberg dual theories. However,
none of the index identities considered in this paper actually implies an
entirely new, unknown duality.
