In this paper, the solution of the problem of identification of thermal
properties of investigated multi-layer structure is presented. In order of
that, artificial neural network was used to find the set of thermal properties
for which the complex contrast characteric derived fits the best to the one
evaluated basing upon experimenatal data.
