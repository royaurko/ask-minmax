Several cases of the Sznajd model of socio-physics, that only a group of
people sharing the same opinion can convince their neighbors, have been
simulated on a more realistic network with a stronger clustering. In addition,
many opinions, instead of usually only two, and a convincing probability have
been also considered. Finally, with minor changes we obtain a vote distribution
in good agreement with reality.
