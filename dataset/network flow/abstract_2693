Two flows defined on a smooth manifold are equivalent if there exists a
homeomorphism of the manifold that sends each orbit of one flow onto an orbit
of the other flow while preserving the time orientation. The topological
entropy of a flow is defined as the entropy of its time-1 map. While
topological entropy is an invariant for equivalent homeomorphisms, finite
non-zero topological entropy for a flow cannot be an invariant because its
value is affected by time reparameterization. However, 0 and $\infty$
topological entropy are invariants for equivalent flows without fixed points.
  In equivalent flows with fixed points there exists a counterexample,
constructed by Ohno, showing that neither 0 nor $\infty$ topological entropy is
preserved by equivalence. The two flows constructed by Ohno are suspensions of
a transitive subshift and thus are not differentiable. Note that a
differentiable flow on a compact manifold cannot have $\infty$ entropy. These
facts led Ohno in 1980 to ask the following: "Is 0 topological entropy an
invariant for equivalent differentiable flows?"
  In this paper, we construct two equivalent $C^\infty$ smooth flows with a
singularity, one of which has positive topological entropy while the other has
zero topological entropy. This gives a negative answer to Ohno's question in
the class $C^\infty$.
