We describe direct imaging measurements of the collective and relative
diffusion of two colloidal spheres near a flat plate. The bounding surface
modifies the spheres' dynamics, even at separations of tens of radii. This
behavior is captured by a stokeslet analysis of fluid flow driven by the
spheres' and wall's no-slip boundary conditions. In particular, this analysis
reveals surprising asymmetry in the normal modes for pair diffusion near a flat
surface.
