We present a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) three dimensional simulation of
a nonradiative accretion flow originating in a pressure supported torus. The
evolution is controlled by the magnetorotational instability which produces
turbulence. The flow forms a nearly Keplerian disk. The total pressure scale
height in this disk is comparable to the vertical size of the initial torus.
Gas pressure dominates only near the equator; magnetic pressure is more
important in the surrounding atmosphere. A magnetically dominated bound outflow
is driven from the disk. The accretion rate through the disk exceeds the final
rate into the hole, and a hot torus forms inside 10 r_g. Hot gas, pushed up
against the centrifugal barrier and confined by magnetic pressure, is ejected
in a narrow, unbound, conical outflow. The dynamics are controlled by magnetic
turbulence, not thermal convection, and a hydrodynamic alpha model is
inadequate to describe the flow. The limitations of two dimensional MHD
simulations are also discussed.
