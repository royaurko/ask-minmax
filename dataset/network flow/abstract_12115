We present a general approach to the study of synchrony in networks of weakly
nonlinear systems described by singularly perturbed equations of the type
$x''+x+\epsilon f(x,x')=0$. By performing a perturbative calculation based on
normal form theory we analytically obtain an $\O(\epsilon)$ approximation to
the Floquet multipliers that determine the stability of the synchronous
solution. The technique allows us to prove and generalize recent results
obtained using heuristic approaches, as well as reveal the structure of the
approximating equations. We illustrate the results in several examples, and
discuss extensions to the analysis of stability of multisynchronous states in
networks with complex architectures.
