Optimizing interconnection networks is a prime object in switching schemes.
In this work the contributors present a novel approach for obtaining a required
channel arrangement in a multi-stage interconnection network, using a new
concept - a fundamental arrangement. The fundamental arrangement is an initial
N-1 stage switch arrangement that allows obtaining any required output channel
arrangement given an input arrangement, using N/2 binary switches at each
stage. The paper demonstrates how a fundamental arrangement can be achieved and
how, once this is done, any required arrangement may be obtained within 2(N-1)
steps.
