We review the application of Statistical Mechanics methods to the study of
online learning of a drifting concept in the limit of large systems. The model
where a feed-forward network learns from examples generated by a time dependent
teacher of the same architecture is analyzed. The best possible generalization
ability is determined exactly, through the use of a variational method. The
constructive variational method also suggests a learning algorithm. It depends,
however, on some unavailable quantities, such as the present performance of the
student. The construction of estimators for these quantities permits the
implementation of a very effective, highly adaptive algorithm. Several other
algorithms are also studied for comparison with the optimal bound and the
adaptive algorithm, for different types of time evolution of the rule.
