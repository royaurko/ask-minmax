The differential rotation of anti-solar type detected by observations for
several stars may result from a fast meridional flow. The sufficiently
intensive meridional circulation may be caused by large-scale thermal
inhomogeneities or, perhaps, by tidal forcing from a companion star. First
results of simulations of the anti-solar rotation of a giant star with
magnetically induced thermal inhomogeneities are presented. Perspectives for
observational check of the theory are discussed.
