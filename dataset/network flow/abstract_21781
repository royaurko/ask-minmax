We develop the idea of self-indexing and the technology of gradient-like
vector fields in the setting of Morse theory on a complex algebraic
stratification. Our main result is the local existence, near a Morse critical
point, of gradient-like vector fields satisfying certain ``stratified dimension
bounds up to fuzz'' for the ascending and descending sets. As a global
consequence of this, we derive the existence of self-indexing Morse functions.
