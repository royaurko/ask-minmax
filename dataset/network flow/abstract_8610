The fractal and self-similarity properties are revealed in many complex
networks. In order to show the influence of different part in the complex
networks to the information dimension, we have proposed a new information
dimension based on Tsallis entropy namely Tsallis information dimension. The
Tsallis information dimension can show the fractal property from different
perspective by set different value of q.
