Uno, Nessuno, Centomila ("One, No One and One Hundred Thousand") is a classic
novel by Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello. Published in 1925, it recounts
the tragedy of Vitangelo Moscarda, a man who struggles to reclaim a coherent
and unitary identity for himself in the face of an inherently social and
multi-faceted world. What would Moscarda identity tragedy look like today? In
this article we transplant Moscarda's identity play from its offline setting to
the contemporary arena of social media and online social networks. With
reference to established theories on identity construction, performance, and
self-presentation, we re-imagine how Moscarda would go about defending the
integrity of his selfhood in the face of the discountenancing influences of the
online world.
