This paper proposes an Automata Networks approach to address the influence of
memory loss on the formation of shared conventions. We focus our analysis on a
numerical description of the dynamics over one and two dimensional periodic
lattices, through an energy function that measures the local agreement between
the individuals. For the two dimensional case, it exhibits a sharp transition
on the relation between the energy and the parameter defined to measure the
amount of memory loss. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications for the
formation of language.
