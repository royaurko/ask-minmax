Multiplex networks describe a large variety of complex systems, whose
elements (nodes) can be connected by different types of interactions forming
different layers (networks) of the multiplex. Multiplex networks include social
networks, transportation networks or biological networks in the cell or in the
brain. Extracting relevant information from these networks is of crucial
importance for solving challenging inference problems and for characterizing
the multiplex networks microscopic and mesoscopic structure. Here we propose an
information theory method to extract the network between the layers of
multiplex datasets, forming a "network of networks". We build an indicator
function, based on the entropy of network ensembles, to characterize the
mesoscopic similarities between the layers of a multiplex network and we use
clustering techniques to characterize the communities present in this network
of networks. We apply the proposed method to study the Multiplex Collaboration
Network formed by scientists collaborating on different subjects and publishing
in the Americal Physical Society (APS) journals. The analysis of this dataset
reveals the interplay between the collaboration networks and the organization
of knowledge in physics.
