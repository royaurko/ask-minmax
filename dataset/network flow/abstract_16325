The subpulse modulation of pulsar radio emission goes to prove that the
plasma flow in the open field line tube breaks into isolated narrow streams. I
propose a model which attributes formation of streams to the process of the
electric current adjustment in the magnetosphere. A mismatch between the
magnetospheric current distribution and the current injected by the polar cap
accelerator gives rise to reverse plasma flows in the magnetosphere. The
reverse flow shields the electric field in the polar gap and thus shuts up the
plasma production process. I assume that a circulating system of streams is
formed such that the upward streams are produced in narrow gaps separated by
downward streams. The electric drift is small in this model because the
potential drop in narrow gaps is small. The gaps have to drift because by the
time a downward stream reaches the star surface and shields the electric field,
the corresponding gap has to shift. The transverse size of the streams is
determined by the condition that the potential drop in the gaps is sufficient
for the pair production. This yields the radius of the stream roughly 10% of
the polar cap radius, which makes it possible to fit in the observed
morphological features such as the "carousel" with 10-20 subbeams and the
system of the core - two nested cone beams.
