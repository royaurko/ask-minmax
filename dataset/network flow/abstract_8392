IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.3 are wireless standards originally designed for
wireless local area network (WLAN) and wireless personal area network (WPAN).
This paper studies MAC throughput analysis of both standards. We present a
comparative analysis of both standards in terms of MAC throughput and bandwidth
efficiency. Numerical results show that the performance of IEEE 802.15.3
transcends IEEE 802.11 in all cases.
