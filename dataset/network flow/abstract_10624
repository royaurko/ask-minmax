In computer simulations of spiking neural networks, often it is assumed that
every two neurons of the network are connected by a probability of 2\%, 20\% of
neurons are inhibitory and 80\% are excitatory. These common values are based
on experiments, observations, and trials and errors, but here, I take a
different perspective, inspired by evolution, I systematically simulate many
networks, each with a different set of parameters, and then I try to figure out
what makes the common values desirable. I stimulate networks with pulses and
then measure their: dynamic range, dominant frequency of population activities,
total duration of activities, maximum rate of population and the occurrence
time of maximum rate. The results are organized in phase diagram. This phase
diagram gives an insight into the space of parameters -- excitatory to
inhibitory ratio, sparseness of connections and synaptic weights. This phase
diagram can be used to decide the parameters of a model. The phase diagrams
show that networks which are configured according to the common values, have a
good dynamic range in response to an impulse and their dynamic range is robust
in respect to synaptic weights, and for some synaptic weights they oscillate in
$\alpha$ or $\beta$ frequencies, even in absence of external stimuli.
