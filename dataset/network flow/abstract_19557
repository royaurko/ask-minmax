We study shear yielding and steady state flow of glassy materials with
molecular dynamics simulations of two standard models: amorphous polymers and
bidisperse Lennard-Jones glasses. For a fixed strain rate, the maximum shear
yield stress and the steady state flow stress in simple shear both drop
linearly with increasing temperature. The dependence on strain rate can be
described by a either a logarithm or a power-law added to a constant. In marked
contrast to predictions of traditional thermal activation models, the rate
dependence is nearly independent of temperature. The relation to more recent
models of plastic deformation and glassy rheology is discussed, and the
dynamics of particles and stress in small regions is examined in light of these
findings.
