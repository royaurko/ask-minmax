We describe a methodology for modeling the performance of decision-level data
fusion between different sensor configurations, implemented as part of the
JIEDDO Analytic Decision Engine (JADE). We first discuss a Bayesian network
formulation of classical probabilistic data fusion, which allows elementary
fusion structures to be stacked and analyzed efficiently. We then present an
extension of the Wald sequential test for combining the outputs of the Bayesian
network over time. We discuss an algorithm to compute its performance
statistics and illustrate the approach on some examples. This variant of the
sequential test involves multiple, distinct stages, where the evidence
accumulated from each stage is carried over into the next one, and is motivated
by a need to keep certain sensors in the network inactive unless triggered by
other sensors.
