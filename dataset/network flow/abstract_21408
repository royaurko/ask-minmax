We have performed large-scale shell-model calculations of the half-lives and
neutron-branching probabilties of the r-process waiting point nuclei at the
magic neutron number N=82. We find good agreement with the measured half-lives
of 129Ag and 130Cd. Our shell-model half-lives are noticeably shorter than
those currently adopted in r-process simulations. Our calculation suggests that
130Cd is not produced in beta-flow equilibrium with the other N=82 isotones on
the r-process path.
