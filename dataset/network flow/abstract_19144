With the advent of high-throughput wet lab technologies the amount of protein
interaction data available publicly has increased substantially, in turn
spurring a plethora of computational methods for in silico knowledge discovery
from this data. In this paper, we focus on parameterized methods for modeling
and solving complex computational problems encountered in such knowledge
discovery from protein data. Specifically, we concentrate on three relevant
problems today in proteomics, namely detection of lethal proteins, functional
modules and alignments from protein interaction networks. We propose novel
graph theoretic models for these problems and devise practical parameterized
algorithms. At a broader level, we demonstrate how these methods can be viable
alternatives for the several heurestic, randomized, approximation and
sub-optimal methods by arriving at parameterized yet optimal solutions for
these problems. We substantiate these theoretical results by experimenting on
real protein interaction data of S. cerevisiae (budding yeast) and verifying
the results using gene ontology.
