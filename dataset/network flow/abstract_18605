The crushing demand for wireless data services will soon exceed the
capability of the current homogeneous cellular architecture. An emerging
solution is to overlay small-cell networks with the macro-cell networks. In
this paper, we propose an amplitude space sharing (ASS) method among the
macro-cell user and small-cell users. By transmit layer design and data-rate
optimization, the signals and interferences are promised to be separable at
each receiver and the network sum-rate is maximized. The Han-Koboyashi coding
is employed and optimal power allocation is derived for the one small-cell
scenario, and a simple ASS transmission scheme is developed for the multiple
small-cells scenarios. Simulation results show great superiority over other
interference management schemes.
