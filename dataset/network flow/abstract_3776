We analyze the well-posedness of a flow-plate interaction considered in [22,
24]. Specifically, we consider the Kutta-Joukowski boundary conditions for the
flow [20, 28, 26], which ultimately give rise to a hyperbolic equation in the
half-space (for the flow) with mixed boundary conditions. This boundary
condition has been considered previously in the lower-dimensional interactions
[1, 2], and dramatically changes the properties of the flow-plate interaction
and requisite analytical techniques.
  We present results on well-posedness of the fluid-structure interaction with
the Kutta-Joukowsky flow conditions in force. The semigroup approach to the
proof utilizes an abstract setup related to that in [16] but requires (1) the
use of a Neumann-flow map to address a Zaremba type elliptic problem and (2) a
trace regularity assumption on the acceleration potential of the flow. This
assumption is linked to invertibility of singular integral operators which are
analogous to the finite Hilbert transform in two dimensions. (We show the
validity of this assumption when the model is reduced to a two dimensional flow
interacting with a one dimensional structure; this requires microlocal
techniques.) Our results link the analysis in [16] to that in [1, 2].
