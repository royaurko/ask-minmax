In this paper, we study the Wasserstein gradient flow structure of the porous
medium equation. We prove that, for the case of $q$-Gaussians on the real line,
the functional derived by the JKO-discretization scheme is asymptotically
equivalent to a rate-large-deviation-like functional. The result explains why
the Wasserstein metric as well as the combination of it with the
Tsallis-entropy play an important role.
