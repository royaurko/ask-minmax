We use three-dimensional particle dynamics simulations, coupled with
volume-averaged gas phase hydrodynamics, to study vertically vibrated
gas-fluidized beds of fine, cohesive powders. The volume-averaged interstitial
gas flow is restricted to be one-dimensional (1D). This simplified model
captures the spontaneous development of 1D traveling waves, which corresponds
to bubble formation in real fluidized beds. We use this model to probe the
manner in which vibration and gas flow combine to influence the dynamics of
cohesive particles. We find that as the gas flow rate increases, cyclic
pressure pulsation produced by vibration becomes more and more significant than
direct impact, and in a fully fluidized bed this pulsation is virtually the
only relevant mechanism. We demonstrate that vibration assists fluidization by
creating large tensile stresses during transient periods, which helps break up
the cohesive assembly into agglomerates.
