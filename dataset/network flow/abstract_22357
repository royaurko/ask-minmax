We present HST/FOS ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy of the black hole
X-ray transient GRO J0422+32 shortly before the system reached quiescence. We
find that the accretion spectrum from 2500-9000A can be very well fit by a
self-absorbed synchrotron model, with superposed HI and MgII emission lines.
The explanations we suggest for this spectrum are that it is either due to
active coronal regions above a geometrically thin accretion disc, or that the
disc is evaporated into an advective flow.
