Recently, the STAR collaboration at RHIC has presented experimental evidence
for the correlation between the elliptic flow difference of charged pions and
charge asymmetry as a possible signal of the chiral magnetic wave. We
demonstrate that the STAR results can be understood within the standard viscous
hydrodynamics.
