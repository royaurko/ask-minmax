We use ordinal patterns and symbolic analysis to construct global climate
networks and uncover long and short term memory processes. The data analyzed is
the monthly averaged surface air temperature (SAT field) and the results
suggest that the time variability of the SAT field is determined by patterns of
oscillatory behavior that repeat from time to time, with a periodicity related
to intraseasonal oscillations and to El Ni\~{n}o on seasonal-to-interannual
time scales.
