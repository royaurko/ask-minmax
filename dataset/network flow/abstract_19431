The cooling-flow problem is a long-standing puzzle that has received
considerable recent attention, in part because the mechanism that quenches
cooling flows in galaxy clusters is likely to be the same mechanism that
sharply truncates the high end of the galaxy luminosity function. Most of the
recent models for halting cooling in clusters have focused on AGN heating, but
the actual heating mechanism has remained mysterious. Here we present a
framework for AGN heating derived from a Chandra survey of gas entropy profiles
within cluster cores. This set of observations strongly suggests that the inner
parts of cluster cores are shock-heated every ~10^8 years by intermittent AGN
outbursts, driven by a kinetic power output of ~ 10^45 erg/sec and lasting at
least 10^7 years. Beyond ~30 kpc these shocks decay to sound waves, releasing
buoyant bubbles that heat the core's outer parts. Between heating episodes,
cooling causes the core to relax toward an asymptotic pure-cooling profile. The
density distribution in this asymptotic profile is sufficiently peaked that the
AGN shock does not cause a core entropy inversion, allowing the cluster core to
retain a strong iron abundance gradient, as observed.
