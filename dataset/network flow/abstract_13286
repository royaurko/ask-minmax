We demonstrate that optical illumination strongly influences spin transport
in n-type GaAs. Specifically, increasing the power density of optical spin
pumping results in a significant expansion of the spin diffusion profile. A
further means of manipulation is the application of a weak transverse magnetic
field, which strongly increases spin flow out of the excitation spot. These
effects are directly monitored in spin imaging experiments and spatially
resolved Hanle measurements.
