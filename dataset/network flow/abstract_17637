The early thermalization and HBT puzzles in relativistic heavy-ion collisions
studied at RHIC are shortly reviewed. The results of recent hydrodynamic
calculations that shed light on these two intriguing issues are presented. In
particular, the role of the elliptic flow as a signature of early
thermalization is critically examined.
