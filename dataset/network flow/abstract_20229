We discuss the irreversibility, nonlocality, and fluctuations, as well as the
Lyapunov and hydrodynamic instabilities characterizing atomistic,
smooth-particle, and finite-difference solutions of the two-dimensional
Rayleigh-B\'enard problem. To speed up the numerical analysis we control the
time-dependence of the Rayleigh number so as to include many distinct flow
morphologies in a single simulation. The relatively simple nature of these
computational algorithms and the richness of the results they can yield make
such studies and their interpretation particularly well suited to
graduate-level research.
