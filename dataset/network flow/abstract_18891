MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which regulate gene expression
by binding to the 3' UTR of the corresponding messenger RNAs. We construct
miRNA co-target networks for 22 different species using a target prediction
database, MicroCosm Tagets. The miRNA pairs of individual species having one or
more common target genes are connected and the number of co-targets are
assigned as the weight of these links. We show that the link-weight
distributions of all the species collapse remarkably onto each other when
scaled suitably. It turns out that the scale-factor is a measure of complexity
of the species. A simple model, where targets are chosen randomly by miRNAs,
could provide the correct scaling function and explain the universality.
