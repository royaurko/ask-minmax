The origin of the resistive transition broadening for MgB2 thin films was
investigated. Thermally activated flux flow is found to be responsible for the
resistivity contribution in the vicinity of Tc. The origin of the observed
extraordinary strong magnetic field dependence of the activation energy of the
flux motion is discussed.
