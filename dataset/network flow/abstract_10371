We present a comprehensive review of the physical behavior of yield stress
materials in soft condensed matter, which encompasses a broad range of soft
materials from colloidal assemblies and gels to emulsions and non-Brownian
suspensions. All these disordered materials display a nonlinear response to an
external mechanical forcing, which results from the existence of a finite force
threshold for flow to occur, the yield stress. We discuss both the physical
origin and the rheological consequences associated with this nonlinear
behavior. We give an overview of the different experimental techniques
developed to measure the yield stress. We discuss extensively the recent
progress concerning a microscopic description of the flow dynamics of yield
stress materials, emphasizing in particular the role played by relaxation
timescales, the interplay between shear flow and aging behavior, the existence
of inhomogeneous shear flows and shear bands, wall slip, and non-local effects
in confined geometries. We finally review the status of modeling of the shear
rheology of yield stress materials in the framework of continuum mechanics.
