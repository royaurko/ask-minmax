Community detection is an important research topic in complex networks. We
present the employment of a genetic algorithm to detect communities in complex
networks which is based on optimizing network modularity. It does not need any
prior knowledge about the number of communities. Its performance is tested on
two real life networks with known community structures and a set of synthetic
networks. As the performance measure an information theoretical metric
variation of information is used. The results are promising and in some cases
better than previously reported studies.
