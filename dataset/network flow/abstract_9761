We study wireless ad hoc networks in the absence of any channel contention or
transmit power control and ask how antenna directivity affects network
connectivity in the interference limited regime. We answer this question by
deriving closed-form expressions for the outage probability, capacity and mean
node degree of the network using tools from stochastic geometry. These novel
results provide valuable insights for the design of future ad hoc networks.
Significantly, our results suggest that the more directional the interfering
transmitters are, the less detrimental are the effects of interference to
individual links. We validate our analytical results through computer
simulations.
