We investigate the pinning and driven dynamics of vortices interacting with
twin boundaries using large scale molecular dynamics simulations on samples
with near one million pinning sites. For low applied driving forces, the vortex
lattice orients itself parallel to the twin boundary and we observe the
creation of a flux gradient and vortex free region near the edges of the twin
boundary. For increasing drive, we find evidence for several distinct dynamical
flow phases which we characterize by the density of defects in the vortex
lattice, the microscopic vortex flow patterns, and orientation of the vortex
lattice. We show that these different dynamical phases can be directly related
to microscopically measurable voltage - current V(I) curves and voltage noise.
By conducting a series of simulations for various twin boundary parameters we
derive several vortex dynamic phase diagrams.
