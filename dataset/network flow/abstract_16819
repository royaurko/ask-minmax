We show here that the network averaged teleseismic P-wave spectra for Indian
explosions of May 11, 1998, given by Barker et al, do not have an unambiguous
interpretation. Barker et al had earlier demonstrated these were similar to the
Shagan River testing site of former Soviet Union. We prove here that these are
equally consistent with RUBIS (57 kt) and PILEDRIVER (62kt) explosions in
French Hogger and US Nevada testing sites respectively.
