The success in the growing wireless standards can be measured by the
achievement of quality of service (QoS) specifications by the designers. The
IEEE802.11 wireless standards are widely accepted as wireless technology for
wireless LAN. Efforts have been made over the years by the task group to
provide adequate number of QoS enhancement schemes for the increasing numbers
of multimedia applications. This paper examines the empirical performances of
ad hoc wireless networks deployed on IEEE802.11 standard variants. A survey to
some of the QoS schemes incorporated in IEEE802.11 wireless PHY layers were
carried out. Then the effects of this enhancement schemes in relation to data
throughput and system capacity and reliability in the newest technology
deployed on IEEE802.11ac standards was investigated using real time
applications and simulation based approaches.
