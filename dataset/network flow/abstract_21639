We study the two-dimensional renormalization-group flow induced by
perturbations that reduce the global symmetry of the O(3) sigma-model to the
discrete symmetries of Platonic solids. We estimate the value of the
correlation length at which differences in the behaviour of the various models
should be expected. For the icosahedron model, we find xi > 200. We provide an
explanation for the recent numerical results of Patrascioiu and Seiler and of
Hasenfratz and Niedermayer.
