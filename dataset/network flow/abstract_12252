This work deals with the decoding aspect of wireless network coding in the
canonical two-way relay channel where two senders exchange messages via a
common relay and they receive the mixture of two messages. One of the recent
works on wireless network coding was well explained by Katti \textit{et al.} in
SIGCOMM'07. In this work, we analyze the issue with one of their decoders when
minimum-shift keying (MSK) is employed as the modulation format, and propose a
new noncoherent decoder in the presence of two interfering signals.
