We consider the dynamics of a compressible fluid under the influence of
electrostrictive ponderomotive forces in strong inhomogeneous nonstationary
electric fields. It is shown that if the fronts of the voltage rise at a sharp,
needle-like electrode are rather steep (less than or about nanoseconds), and
the region of negative pressure arises, which can reach values at which the
fluid loses its continuity with the formation of cavitation ruptures. If the
voltage on the electrode is not large enough or the front is flatter, the
cavitation in the liquid does not occur. However, a sudden shutdown of the
field results in a reverse flow of liquid from the electrode, which leads to
appearance of negative pressure, and, possibly, cavitation.
