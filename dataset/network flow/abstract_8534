Spectral decomposition has been rarely used to investigate complex networks.
In this work we apply this concept in order to define two types of
link-directed attacks while quantifying their respective effects on the
topology. Several other types of more traditional attacks are also adopted and
compared. These attacks had substantially diverse effects, depending on each
specific network (models and real-world structures). It is also showed that the
spectral-based attacks have special effect in affecting the transitivity of the
networks.
