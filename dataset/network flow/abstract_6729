Research interest on Online Social Networks (OSNs), has increased
dramatically over the last decade, mainly because online networks provide a
vast source of social information. Graph structure, user connections, growth,
information exposure and diffusion, are some of the most frequently researched
subjects. However, some areas of these networks, such as anonymity, equality
and bias are overlooked or even unconsidered. In the related bibliography, such
features seem to be influential to social interactions. Based on these studies,
we aim at determining how universal anonymity affects bias, user equality,
information propagation, sharing and exposure, connection establishment, as
well as network structure. Thus, we propose a new Anonymous Online Social
Network, which will facilitate a variety of monitoring and data analysis.
