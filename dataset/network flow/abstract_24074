Quality of Service(QoS) in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) though a
challenge, becomes a necessity because of its applications in critical
scenarios. Providing QoS for users belonging to various profiles and playing
different roles, becomes the need of the hour. In this paper, we propose
proportional share scheduling and MAC protocol (PS2-MAC) model. It classifies
users based on their profile as High Profiled users (HP), Medium Profiled users
(MP) and Low profiled users (LP) and assigns proportional weights. Service
Differentiation for these three service classes is achieved through, rationed
dequeuing algorithm, variable inter frame space, proportionate prioritized
backoff timers and enhanced RTS/CTS control packets. Differentiated services is
simulated in ns2 and results show that 9.5% control overhead is reduced in our
proposed scheme than the existing scheme and results also justify that,
differentiated services have been achieved for the different profiles of users
with proportionate shares and thereby reducing starvation.
