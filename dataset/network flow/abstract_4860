We investigate the origins of $k^{-2}$ spectrum in a decaying Taylor-Green
magnetohydrodynamic flow with zero large scale magnetic flux that was reported
in Lee et al. (2010). A possible candidate for this scaling exponent has been
the weak turbulence phenomenology. From our numerical simulations, we observe
that current sheets in the magnetic Taylor-Green flow are formed in regions of
magnetic discontinuities. Based on this observation and by studying the
influence of the current sheets on the energy spectrum, using a filtering
technique, we argue that the discontinuities are responsible for the $-2$ power
law scaling of the energy spectra of this flow.
