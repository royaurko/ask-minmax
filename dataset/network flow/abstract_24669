This article presents an overview of the challenges of increasing development
of wireless links to enable a more consistent and transparent interconnection
between people and the digital world. These issues are in the domain of high
performance architectures for conventional applications of wireless Internet,
but also in the field of sensor networks and connected objects. Beyond the
constraints of the various applications push to develop architectures with high
digital capabilities like software defined radio. In each of these categories,
examples of approaches proposed by INRIA Socrate team are presented.
