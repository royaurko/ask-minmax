We report a new nonlocal effect in vortex matter, where an electric current
confined to a small region of a long and sufficiently narrow superconducting
wire causes vortex flow at distances hundreds of inter-vortex separations away.
The observed remote traffic of vortices is attributed to a very efficient
transfer of a local strain through the one-dimensional vortex lattice, even in
the presence of disorder. We also observe mesoscopic fluctuations in the
nonlocal vortex flow, which arise due to "traffic jams" when vortex
arrangements do not match a local geometry of a superconducting channel.
