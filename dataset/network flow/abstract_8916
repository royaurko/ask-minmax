The geometric quantization of the geodesic flow on a compact Riemannian
manifold via the BKS "dragging projection" yields the Laplacian plus a scalar
curvature term. To avoid convergence issues, the standard construction involves
somewhat unnatural hypotheses that do not hold in typical examples. In this
paper, we use adapted complex structures to make sense of a Wick-rotated
version of the dragging projection which avoids the convergence issues.
