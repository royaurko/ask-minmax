Directed flow, v1, of charged hardons has been measured in Au-Au collisions
at RHIC for center-of-mass energies sqrt(sNN) = 19.6, 130, 62.4, and 200 GeV
using the PHOBOS detector. The large acceptance of PHOBOS for charged particles
allows measurements over the full range of pseudorapidity |eta| <5.4. The
results for a symmetric subevent method are shown at all four energies.
Comparison is made to a mixed harmonic method for the highest energy, and
compared to similar results from the STAR collaboration.
