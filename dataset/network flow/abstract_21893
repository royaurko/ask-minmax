The bulk of the hot and dense matter created at RHIC behaves like an almost
ideal fluid. I present the evidence for this and also discuss what we can learn
about the transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) from the gradual
breakdown of ideal fluid dynamic behavior at large transverse momenta, lower
beam energies, larger impact parameters, and forward rapidities.
