We show that the shear-induced solidification of dilute charge-stabilized
(DLVO) colloids is due to the interplay between the shear-induced formation and
breakage of large non-Brownian clusters. While their size is limited by
breakage, their number density increases with the shearing-time. Upon flow
cessation, the dense packing of clusters interconnects into a rigid state by
means of grainy bonds, each involving a large number of primary colloidal
bonds. The emerging picture of shear-driven solidification in dilute colloidal
suspensions combines the gelation of Brownian systems with the jamming of
athermal systems.
