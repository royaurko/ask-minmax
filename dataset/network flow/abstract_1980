Graph theory provides a primary tool for analyzing and designing computer
communication networks. In the past few decades, Graph theory has been used to
study various types of networks, including the Internet, wide Area Networks,
Local Area Networks, and networking protocols such as border Gateway Protocol,
Open shortest Path Protocol, and Networking Networks. In this paper, we present
some key graph theory concepts used to represent different types of networks.
Then we describe how networks are modeled to investigate problems related to
network protocols. Finally, we present some of the tools used to generate graph
for representing practical networks.
