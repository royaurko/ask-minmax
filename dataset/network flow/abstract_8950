A {\em sectional-Anosov flow} is a vector field on a compact manifold
inwardly transverse to the boundary such that the maximal invariant set is
sectional-hyperbolic (in the sense of \cite{mm}). We prove that any $C^2$
transitive sectional-Anosov flow has a unique SRB measure which is
stochastically stable under small random perturbations.
