The goal of this paper is to present a centrality measurement for the nodes
of a hypergraph, by using existing literature which extends eigenvector
centrality from a graph to a hypergraph, and literature which give a general
centrality measurement for a graph. We will use this measurement to say more
about the number of communications in a hypergraph, to implement a learning
mechanism, and to construct certain networks.
