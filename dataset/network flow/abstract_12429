The growing availability of network data and of scientific interest in
distributed systems has led to the rapid development of statistical models of
network structure. Typically, however, these are models for the entire network,
while the data consists only of a sampled sub-network. Parameters for the whole
network, which is what is of interest, are estimated by applying the model to
the sub-network. This assumes that the model is consistent under sampling, or,
in terms of the theory of stochastic processes, that it defines a projective
family. Focusing on the popular class of exponential random graph models
(ERGMs), we show that this apparently trivial condition is in fact violated by
many popular and scientifically appealing models, and that satisfying it
drastically limits ERGM's expressive power. These results are actually special
cases of more general results about exponential families of dependent random
variables, which we also prove. Using such results, we offer easily checked
conditions for the consistency of maximum likelihood estimation in ERGMs, and
discuss some possible constructive responses.
