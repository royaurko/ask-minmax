Network self-similarity or fractality are widely accepted as an important
topological property of metabolic networks; however, recent studies cast doubt
on the reality of self-similarity in the networks. Therefore, we perform a
comprehensive evaluation of metabolic network fractality using a box-covering
method with an earlier version and the latest version of metabolic networks,
and demonstrate that the latest metabolic networks are almost self-dissimilar,
while the earlier ones are fractal, as reported in a number of previous
studies. This result may be because the networks were randomized because of an
increase in network density due to database updates, suggesting that the
previously observed network fractality was due to a lack of available data on
metabolic reactions. This finding may not entirely discount the importance of
self-similarity of metabolic networks. Rather, it highlights the need for a
more suitable definition of network fractality and a more careful examination
of self-similarity of metabolic networks.
