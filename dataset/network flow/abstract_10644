We investigate a generalised version of the recently proposed ordinal
partition time series to network transformation algorithm. Firstly we introduce
a fixed time lag for the elements of each partition that is selected using
techniques from traditional time delay embedding. The resulting partitions
define regions in the embedding phase space that are mapped to nodes in the
network space. Edges are allocated between nodes based on temporal succession
thus creating a Markov chain representation of the time series. We then apply
this new transformation algorithm to time series generated by the R\"ossler
system and find that periodic dynamics translate to ring structures whereas
chaotic time series translate to band or tube-like structures -- thereby
indicating that our algorithm generates networks whose structure is sensitive
to system dynamics. Furthermore we demonstrate that simple network measures
including the mean out degree and variance of out degrees can track changes in
the dynamical behaviour in a manner comparable to the largest Lyapunov
exponent. We also apply the same analysis to experimental time series generated
by a diode resonator circuit and show that the network size, mean shortest path
length and network diameter are highly sensitive to the interior crisis
captured in this particular data set.
