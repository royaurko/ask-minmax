An enhanced approach for network monitoring is to create a network monitoring
tool that has artificial intelligence characteristics. There are a number of
approaches available. One such approach is by the use of a combination of rule
based, fuzzy logic and neural networks to create a hybrid ANFIS system. Such
system will have a dual knowledge database approach. One containing membership
function values to compare to and do deductive reasoning and another database
with rules deductively formulated by an expert (a network administrator). The
knowledge database will be updated continuously with newly acquired patterns.
In short, the system will be composed of 2 parts, learning from data sets and
fine-tuning the knowledge-base using neural network and the use of fuzzy logic
in making decision based on the rules and membership functions inside the
knowledge base. This paper will discuss the idea, steps and issues involved in
creating such a system.
