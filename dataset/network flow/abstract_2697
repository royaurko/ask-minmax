We obtain the evolution equations for the Riemann tensor, the Ricci tensor
and the scalar curvature induced by the mean curvature flow. The evolution for
the scalar curvature is similar to the Ricci flow, however, negative, rather
than positive, curvature is preserved. Our results are valid in any dimension.
