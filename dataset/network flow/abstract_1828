This paper presents FAIR, a forwarding accountability mechanism that
incentivizes ISPs to apply stricter security policies to their customers. The
Autonomous System (AS) of the receiver specifies a traffic profile that the
sender AS must adhere to. Transit ASes on the path mark packets. In case of
traffic profile violations, the marked packets are used as a proof of
misbehavior.
  FAIR introduces low bandwidth overhead and requires no per-packet and no
per-flow state for forwarding. We describe integration with IP and demonstrate
a software switch running on commodity hardware that can switch packets at a
line rate of 120 Gbps, and can forward 140M minimum-sized packets per second,
limited by the hardware I/O subsystem.
  Moreover, this paper proposes a "suspicious bit" for packet headers - an
application that builds on top of FAIR's proofs of misbehavior and flags
packets to warn other entities in the network.
