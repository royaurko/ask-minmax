A novel dynamic radio-cooperation strategy is proposed for Cloud Radio Access
Networks (C-RANs) consisting of multiple Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) connected to
a central Virtual Base Station (VBS) pool. In particular, the key capabilities
of C-RANs in computing-resource sharing and real-time communication among the
VBSs are leveraged to design a joint dynamic radio clustering and cooperative
beamforming scheme that maximizes the downlink weighted sum-rate system utility
(WSRSU). Due to the combinatorial nature of the radio clustering process and
the non-convexity of the cooperative beamforming design, the underlying
optimization problem is NP-hard, and is extremely difficult to solve for a
large network. Our approach aims for a suboptimal solution by transforming the
original problem into a Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Program (MI-SOCP),
which can be solved efficiently using a proposed iterative algorithm. Numerical
simulation results show that our low-complexity algorithm provides
close-to-optimal performance in terms of WSRSU while significantly
outperforming conventional radio clustering and beamforming schemes.
Additionally, the results also demonstrate the significant improvement in
computing-resource utilization of C-RANs over traditional RANs with distributed
computing resources.
