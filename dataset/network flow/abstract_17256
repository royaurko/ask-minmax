Real-time signal processing applications are increasingly focused on
analyzing privacy-sensitive data obtained from individuals, and this data might
need to be processed through model-based estimators to produce accurate
statistics. Moreover, the models used in population dynamics studies, e.g., in
epidemiology or sociology, are often necessarily nonlinear. This paper presents
a design approach for nonlinear privacy-preserving model-based observers,
relying on contraction analysis to give differential privacy guarantees to the
individuals providing the input data. The approach is illustrated in two
applications: estimation of edge formation probabilities in a dynamic social
network, and syndromic surveillance relying on an epidemiological model.
