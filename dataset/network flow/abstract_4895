Lubrication theory is broadly applicable to the flow characterization of thin
fluid films and the motion of particles near surfaces. We offer an extension to
lubrication theory by considering higher-order terms of the analytical
approximation to describe the fluid flow in a channel with features of a modest
aspect ratio. We find good agreement between our analytical results and
numerical simulations. We show that the extended lubrication theory is a robust
tool for an accurate estimate of laminar fluid flow in channels with features
on the order of the channel height, accounting for both smooth and sharp
changes in geometry.
