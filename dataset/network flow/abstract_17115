We study the BPS spectrum of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal
field theory of Argyres-Douglas type, obtained via twisted compactification of
six-dimensional $A_{N-1}$ $(2,0)$ theory on a sphere with an irregular
puncture, by using spectral networks. We give strong evidence of the
equivalence of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories from
six-dimensional theories of different ranks by systematically comparing the
chamber structure and wall-crossing phenomena.
