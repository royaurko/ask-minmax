In Part I of this paper, we presented a mathematical model for communication
subject to both network interference and noise, where the interferers are
scattered according to a spatial Poisson process, and are operating
asynchronously in a wireless environment subject to path loss, shadowing, and
multipath fading. We determined the distribution of the aggregate interference
and the error performance of the link. In this second part, we characterize the
capacity of the link subject to both network interference and noise. Then, we
put forth the concept of spectral outage probability (SOP), a new
characterization of the aggregate radio-frequency emission generated by
communicating nodes in a wireless network. We present some applications of the
SOP, namely the establishment of spectral regulations and the design of covert
military networks. The proposed framework captures all the essential physical
parameters that affect the aggregate network emission, yet is simple enough to
provide insights that may be of value in the design and deployment of wireless
networks.
