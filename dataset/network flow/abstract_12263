Relaying is considered a promising cost-efficient solution in 3GPP
LTE-Advanced for coverage extension and throughput enhancement. The compact
physical characteristics and low power requirements of the relay nodes offer
more flexible deployment options than traditional macro evolved Node Bs. This
paper provides an overview of general relaying concepts and presents the relay
deployment within the LTE-Advanced framework. Furthermore, the impact of relay
backhauling on envisioned relaying gains is discussed and the methods to
improve the performance of the backhauling are included.
