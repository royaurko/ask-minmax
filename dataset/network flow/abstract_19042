GeneNetMiner is standalone software which parses the sentences of iHOP and
captures regulatory relations. The regulatory relations are either gene gene
regulations or gene biological processes relations. Capturing of gene
biological process relations is a unique feature for the tools of this kind.
These relations can be used to build up gene regulatory networks for specific
biological processes, diseases, or phenotypes. Users are able to search genes
and biological processes to find the regulatory relationships between them.
Each regulatory relationship has been assigned a confidence score, which
indicates the probability of the true relation. Furthermore, it reports the
sentence containing the queried terms, which allows users to manually checking
whether the relation is true if they wish. GeneNetMiner is able to accurately
capture the regulatory relationships between genes from literature.
