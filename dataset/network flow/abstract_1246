This paper studies the problem of scheduling in single-hop wireless networks
with real-time traffic, where every packet arrival has an associated deadline
and a minimum fraction of packets must be transmitted before the end of the
deadline. Using optimization and stochastic network theory we propose a
framework to model the quality of service (QoS) requirements under delay
constraints. The model allows for fairly general arrival models with
heterogeneous constraints. The framework results in an optimal scheduling
algorithm which fairly allocates data rates to all flows while meeting
long-term delay demands. We also prove that under a simplified scenario our
solution translates into a greedy strategy that makes optimal decisions with
low complexity.
