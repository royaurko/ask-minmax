In this paper, we investigated the neural spikes synchronisation in a neural
network with synaptic plasticity and external perturbation. In the simulations
the neural dynamics is described by the Hodgkin Huxley model considering
chemical synapses (excitatory) among neurons. According to neural spikes
synchronisation is expected that a perturbation produce non synchronised
regimes. However, in the literature there are works showing that the
combination of synaptic plasticity and external perturbation may generate
synchronised regime. This article describes the effect of the synaptic
plasticity on the synchronisation, where we consider a perturbation with a
uniform distribution. This study is relevant to researches of neural disorders
control.
