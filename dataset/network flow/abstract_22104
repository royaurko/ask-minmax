The aim of this note is to set in the field of dynamical systems a recent
theorem by Obersnel and Omari about the presence of periodic solutions of all
periods for a class of scalar time-periodic first order differential equations
without uniqueness, provided a subharmonic solution (and thus, for instance, a
solution of period two) does exist. Indeed, making use of the Bebutov flow, we
try to clarify in what sense the term "chaos" has to be understood and which
dynamical features can be inferred for the system under analysis.
