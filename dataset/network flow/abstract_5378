This paper describes a new architecture for transient mobile networks
destined to merge existing and future network architectures, communication
implementations and protocol operations by introducing a new paradigm to data
delivery and identification. The main goal of our research is to enable
seamless end-to-end communication between mobile and stationary devices across
multiple networks and through multiple communication environments. The
architecture establishes a set of infrastructure components and protocols that
set the ground for a Persistent Identification Network (PIN). The basis for the
operation of PIN is an identification space consisting of unique location
independent identifiers similar to the ones implemented in the Handle system.
Persistent Identifiers are used to identify and locate Digital Entities which
can include devices, services, users and even traffic. The architecture
establishes a primary connection independent logical structure that can operate
over conventional networks or more advanced peer-to-peer aggregation networks.
Communication is based on routing pools and novel protocols for routing data
across several abstraction levels of the network, regardless of the end-points'
current association and state...
