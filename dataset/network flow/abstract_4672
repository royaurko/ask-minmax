The geodesic flow of a Riemannian metric on a compact manifold $Q$ is said to
be toric integrable if it is completely integrable and the first integrals of
motion generate a homogeneous torus action on the punctured cotangent bundle
$T^*Q\setminus{Q}$. If the geodesic flow is toric integrable, the cosphere
bundle admits the structure of a contact toric manifold. By comparing the Betti
numbers of contact toric manifolds and cosphere bundles, we are able to provide
necessary conditions for the geodesic flow on a compact, connected
3-dimensional manifold to be toric integrable.
