Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) provide continuous health monitoring and analysis
of physiological parameters. A high degree of Quality-of-Service (QoS) for BSN
is extremely required. Inter-user interference is introduced by the
simultaneous communication of BSNs congregating in the same area. In this
paper, a decentralized inter-user interference suppression algorithm for BSN,
namely DISG, is proposed. Each BSN measures the SINR from other BSNs and then
adaptively selects the suitable channel and transmission power. By utilizing
non-cooperative game theory and no regret learning algorithm, DISG provides an
adaptive inter-user interference suppression strategy. The correctness and
effectiveness of DISG is theoretically proved, and the experimental results
show that DISG can reduce the effect of inter-user interference effectively.
