Sound scattering by a finite width beam on a single rigid body rotation
vortex flow is detected by a linear array of transducers (both smaller than a
flow cell), and analyzed using a revised scattering theory. Both the phase and
amplitude of the scattered signal are obtained on 64 elements of the detector
array and used for the analysis of velocity and vorticity fields. Due to
averaging on many pulses the signal-to-noise ratio of the phases difference in
the scattered sound signal can be amplified drastically, and the resolution of
the method in the detection of circulation, vortex radius, vorticity, and
vortex location becomes comparable with that obtained earlier by time-reversal
mirror (TRM) method (P. Roux, J. de Rosny, M. Tanter, and M. Fink, {\sl Phys.
Rev. Lett.} {\bf 79}, 3170 (1997)). The revised scattering theory includes two
crucial steps, which allow overcoming limitations of the existing theories.
First, the Huygens construction of a far field scattering signal is carried out
from a signal obtained at any intermediate plane. Second, a beam function that
describes a finite width beam is introduced, which allows using a theory
developed for an infinite width beam for the relation between a scattering
amplitude and the vorticity structure function. Structure functions of the
velocity and vorticity fields deduced from the sound scattering signal are
compared with those obtained from simultaneous particle image velocimetry (PIV)
measurements. Good quantitative agreement is found.
