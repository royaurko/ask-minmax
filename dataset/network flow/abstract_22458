We study the coupled magnon energy transport and collective magnetization
dynamics in ferromagnets with magnetic textures. By constructing a
phenomenological theory based on irreversible thermodynamics, we describe
motion of domain walls by thermal gradients and generation of heat flows by
magnetization dynamics. From microscopic description based on magnon kinetics,
we estimate the transport coefficients and analyze the feasibility of
energy-related applications in insulating ferromagnets, such as yttrium iron
garnet and europium oxide.
