This article examines the theory of vortex flows in relation to the processes
occurring in the radiation-wave cracking of crude oil, when the crude oil is
sprayed into the gas stream in the form of a mist and then is fed into the
reactor, where it is treated by the accelerated electrons and the UHF
radiation. The output of this process are the products with the specified
parameters (high-octane petroleum products). This process operates at the
ambient pressure and temperature, which makes the process safer for industrial
purposes. Besides the process itself, the contributors described the equipment used
in this process, as well as the parameters of the optimal process.
