In this paper, we want to study the informative value of negative links in
signed complex networks. For this purpose, we extract and analyze a collection
of signed networks representing voting sessions of the European Parliament
(EP). We first process some data collected by the VoteWatch Europe Website for
the whole 7 th term (2009-2014), by considering voting similarities between
Members of the EP to define weighted signed links. We then apply a selection of
community detection algorithms, designed to process only positive links, to
these data. We also apply Parallel Iterative Local Search (Parallel ILS), an
algorithm recently proposed to identify balanced partitions in signed networks.
Our results show that, contrary to the conclusions of a previous study focusing
on other data, the partitions detected by ignoring or considering the negative
links are indeed remarkably different for these networks. The relevance of
negative links for graph partitioning therefore is an open question which
should be further explored.
