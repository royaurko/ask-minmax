We consider inverse curvature flows in $\Hh$ with star-shaped initial
hypersurfaces and prove that the flows exist for all time, and that the leaves
converge to infinity, become strongly convex exponentially fast and also more
and more totally umbilic. After an appropriate rescaling the leaves converge in
$C^\infty$ to a sphere.
