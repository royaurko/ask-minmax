We propose a method of generating a vortex ring in a Bose-Einstein condensate
by means of electromagnetically-induced atomic transitions. Some remnant
population of atoms in a second internal state remains within the toroidal trap
formed by the mean field repulsion of the vortex ring. This population can be
removed, or it can be made to flow around the torus (i.e. within the vortex
ring). If this flow has unit topological winding number, the entire structure
formed by the two condensates is an example of a three-dimensional skyrmion
texture.
