We introduce a parabolic flow of almost Kahler structures, providing an
approach to constructing canonical geometric structures on symplectic
manifolds. We exhibit this flow as one of a family of parabolic flows of almost
Hermitian structures, generalizing our previous work on parabolic flows of
Hermitian metrics. We exhibit a long time existence obstruction for solutions
to this flow by showing certain smoothing estimates for the curvature and
torsion. We end with a discussion of the limiting objects as well as some open
problems related to the symplectic curvature flow.
