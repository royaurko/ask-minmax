Many growing networks possess accelerating statistics where the number of
links added with each new node is an increasing function of network size so the
total number of links increases faster than linearly with network size. In
particular, biological networks can display a quadratic growth in regulator
number with genome size even while remaining sparsely connected. These features
are mutually incompatible in standard treatments of network theory which
typically require that every new network node possesses at least one
connection. To model sparsely connected networks, we generalize existing
approaches and add each new node with a probabilistic number of links to
generate either accelerating, hyper-accelerating, or even decelerating network
statistics in different regimes. Under preferential attachment for example,
slowly accelerating networks display stationary scale-free statistics
relatively independent of network size while more rapidly accelerating networks
display a transition from scale-free to exponential statistics with network
growth. Such transitions explain, for instance, the evolutionary record of
single-celled organisms which display strict size and complexity limits.
