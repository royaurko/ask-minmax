The network communication scenario where one or more receivers request all
the information transmitted by different sources is considered. We introduce
distributed polynomial-time network codes in the presence of malicious nodes.
Our codes can achieve any point inside the rate region of multiple-source
multicast transmission scenarios both in the cases of coherent and non-coherent
network coding. For both cases the encoding and decoding algorithm runs in
poly(|E|)exp(s) time, where poly(|E|) is a polynomial function of the number of
edges |E| in the network and exp(s) is an exponential function of the number of
sources s. Our codes are fully distributed and different sources require no
knowledge of the data transmitted by their peers. Our codes are "end-to-end",
that is, all nodes apart from the sources and the receivers are oblivious to
the adversaries present in the network and simply implement random linear
network coding.
