We study the dynamics of the Naming Game as an opinion formation model on
time-varying social networks. This agent-based model captures the essential
features of the agreement dynamics by means of a memory-based negotiation
process. Our study focuses on the impact of time-varying properties of the
social network of the agents on the Naming Game dynamics. We investigate the
outcomes of the dynamics on two different types of time-varying data - (i) the
networks vary across days and (ii) the networks vary within very short
intervals of time (20 seconds). In the first case, we find that networks with
strong community structure hinder the system from reaching global agreement;
the evolution of the Naming Game in these networks maintains clusters of
coexisting opinions indefinitely leading to metastability. In the second case,
we investigate the evolution of the Naming Game in perfect synchronization with
the time evolution of the underlying social network shedding new light on the
traditional emergent properties of the game that differ largely from what has
been reported in the existing literature
