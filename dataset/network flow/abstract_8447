Based on ideas of K\"otter and Kschischang we use constant dimension
subspaces as codewords in a network. We show a connection to the theory of
q-analogues of a combinatorial designs, which has been studied in Braun, Kerber
and Laue as a purely combinatorial object. For the construction of network
codes we successfully modified methods (construction with prescribed
automorphisms) originally developed for the q-analogues of a combinatorial
designs. We then give a special case of that method which allows the
construction of network codes with a very large ambient space and we also show
how to decode such codes with a very small number of operations.
