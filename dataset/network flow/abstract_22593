We solve the stationary Navier-Stokes equations for non-Newtonian
incompressible fluids with shear dependent viscosty in domains with unbounded
outlets, in the case of shear thickening viscosity, i.e. the viscosity is given
by the shear rate to the power p-2 where p>2. The flux assumes arbitrary given
values and the Dirichlet integral of the velocity field grows at most linearly
in the outlets of the domain. Under some smallness conditions on the "energy
dispersion" we also show that the solution of this problem is unique. Our
results are an extension of those obtained by O.A. Ladyzhenskaya and V.A.
Solonnikov (J. Soviet Math., 21 (1983) 728-761) for Newtonian fluids (p=2).
