In this paper, we find a new large scale instability displayed by a rotating
flow in forced turbulence. The turbulence is generated by a small scale
external force at low Reynolds number. The theory is built on the rigorous
asymptotic method of multi-scale development. The nonlinear equations for the
instability are obtained at the third order of the perturbation theory. In this
article, we explain a detailed study of the nonlinear stage of the instability
and generation vortex kinks.
