In this study, series of experiments under laboratory conditions were carried
out to investigate pedestrian flow through a T-junction, i.e., two branches
merging into the main stream. The whole duration of the experiments was
recorded by video cameras and the trajectories of each pedestrian were
extracted using the software Petrack from these videos. The Voronoi method is
used to resolve the fine structure of the fundamental diagram and spatial
dependence of the measured quantities from trajectories. In our study, only the
data in the stationary state are used by analyzing the time series of density
and velocity. The density, velocity and specific flow profiles are obtained by
refining the size of the measurement area (here 10 cm \times 10 cm are
adopted). With such a high resolution, the spatial distribution of density,
velocity and specific flow can be obtained separately and the regions with
higher value can be observed intuitively. Finally, the fundamental diagrams of
T-junction flow is compared in three different locations. It is shown that the
fundamental diagrams of the two branches match well. However, the velocities in
front of the merging are significantly lower than that in the main stream at
the same densities. After the merging, the specific flow increases with the
density \rho till 2.5 m-2. While in the branches, the specific flow is almost
independent of the density between \rho = 1.5 m-2 and 3.5 m-2
