Cosmic Flows is a program to determine galaxy distances for 30,000 galaxies
with systematic errors below 2%, almost ten times the number currently known
and a five-fold improvement in systematics. The resultant velocity field will
provide input for constrained local universe simulations: CLUES
(www.clues-project.org). The observed and the simulated universe are then
comparatively studied. This synergy of observations and theory distinguishes
the program, and should lead to fundamental discoveries regarding the sources
of deviations from the expansion of the universe. Specifically, the program
should give a definitive answer to one of the most outstanding unsolved problem
in cosmology: the cause of the motion of 630 km/s of our Galaxy manifested in
the microwave background dipole. This paper presents current results with
particular emphasis on the "great attractor" reconstruction.
