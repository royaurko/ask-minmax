Second order systems whose drift is defined by the gradient of a given
potential are considered, and minimization of the $L^1$-norm of the control is
addressed. An analysis of the extremal flow emphasizes the role of singular
trajectories of order two [25,29]; the case of the two-body potential is
treated in detail. In $L^1$-minimization, regular extremals are associated with
controls whose norm is bang-bang; in order to assess their optimality
properties, sufficient conditions are given for broken extremals and related to
the no-fold conditions of [20]. An example of numerical verification of these
conditions is proposed on a problem coming from space mechanics.
