Accreting X-ray pulsars are among the most luminous objects in the X-ray sky.
In highly magnetized neutron stars (B~10^12 G), the flow of matter is dominated
by the strong magnetic field. The general properties of accreting X-ray
binaries are presented, focusing on the spectral characteristics of the
systems. The use of cyclotron lines as a tool to directly measure a neutron
star's magnetic field and to test the theory of accretion are discussed. We
conclude with the current and future prospects for accreting X-ray binary
studies.
