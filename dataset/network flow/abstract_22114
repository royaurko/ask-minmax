Holography is an optical technique enabling to record phase objects.
Holographic interferometry uses this faculty to make a phase object interfere
with a memory of itself at a preceding time, recorded on a hologram.
Interference fringes therefore inform on any variation of the phase of the
object. For the study of liquids, these phase changes can result from the
evolution of temperature or concentration (via the index of refraction). This
access to the real-time evolution of concentration can be used to measure
diffusion coefficients, Soret coefficients or dissolution coefficients.
Temperature fringes can be used to study convective flows.
