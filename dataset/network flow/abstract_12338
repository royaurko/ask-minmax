The shortest path problem is among the most fundamental combinatorial
optimization problems to answer reachability queries. It is hard to deter-mine
which vertices or edges are visited during shortest path traversals. In this
paper, we provide an empirical analysis on how traversal algorithms behave on
social networks. First, we compute the shortest paths between set of vertices.
Each shortest path is considered as one transaction. Second, we utilize the
pat-tern mining approach to identify the frequency of occurrence of the
vertices. We evaluate the results in terms of network properties, i.e. degree
distribution, clustering coefficient.
