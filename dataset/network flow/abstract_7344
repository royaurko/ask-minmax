Simple algebraic rules can produce complex networks with rich structures.
These graphs are obtained when looking at a monoid operating on a ring. There
are relations to dynamical systems theory and number theory. This document
illustrates this class of networks introduced together with Montasser Ghachem.
Besides showing off pictures, we look at elementary results related to the
Chinese remainder theorem, the Collatz problem, the Artin constant, Fermat
primes and Pierpont primes.
