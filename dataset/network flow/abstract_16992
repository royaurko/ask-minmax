This paper studies evaluation of the capacity region for interference
networks with point-to-point (p2p) capacity-achieving codes. Such capacity
region has recently been characterized as union of several sub-regions each of
which has distinctive operational characteristics. Detailed evaluation of this
region, therefore, can be accomplished in a very simple manner by acknowledging
such characteristics, which, in turn, provides an insight for a simple
implementation scenario. Completely generalized message assignment which is
also practically relevant is considered in this paper, and it is shown to
provide strictly larger achievable rates than what traditional message
assignment does when a receiver with joint decoding capability is used.
