We model and analyze heterogeneous cellular networks with multiple antenna
BSs (multi-antenna HetNets) with K classes or tiers of base stations (BSs),
which may differ in terms of transmit power, deployment density, number of
transmit antennas, number of users served, transmission scheme, and path loss
exponent. We show that the cell selection rules in multi-antenna HetNets may
differ significantly from the single-antenna HetNets due to the possible
differences in multi-antenna transmission schemes across tiers. While it is
challenging to derive exact cell selection rules even for maximizing
signal-to-interferenceplus-noise-ratio (SINR) at the receiver, we show that
adding an appropriately chosen tier-dependent cell selection bias in the
received power yields a close approximation. Assuming arbitrary selection bias
for each tier, simple expressions for downlink coverage and rate are derived.
For coverage maximization, the required selection bias for each tier is given
in closed form. Due to this connection with biasing, multi-antenna HetNets may
balance load more naturally across tiers in certain regimes compared to
single-antenna HetNets, where a large cell selection bias is often needed to
offload traffic to small cells.
