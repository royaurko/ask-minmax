We use laser-Doppler velocimetry (LDV) experiments and Reynolds-averaged
Navier--Stokes (RANS) simulations to study the characteristic flow patterns
downstream of a standardized clockwise swirl disturbance generator. After
quantifying the impact of the mesh size, we evaluate the potential of various
eddy-viscosity turbulence models in providing reasonable approximations with
respect to the experimental reference. Our results suggest that models from the
$k$-$\epsilon$ family are more accurate in predicting swirling flows than
models from the $k$-$\omega$ family. For sufficiently resolved meshes, the
realizable $k$-$\epsilon$ model provides the most accurate approximation of the
velocity magnitudes, although it fails to capture small-scale flow structures
which are accurately predicted by the standard $k$-$\epsilon$ model and the RNG
$k$-$\epsilon$ model. Throughout the article, we highlight practical guidance
for the choice of RANS turbulence models for swirling flow.
