Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems are becoming more and more
popular in the field of ubiquitous computing, in particular for objects
identification. An RFID system is composed by one or more readers and a number
of tags. One of the main issues in an RFID network is the fast and reliable
identification of all tags in the reader range. The reader issues some queries,
and tags properly answer. Then, the reader must identify the tags from such
answers. This is crucial for most applications. Since the transmission medium
is shared, the typical problem to be faced is a MAC-like one, i.e. to avoid or
limit the number of tags transmission collisions. We propose a protocol which,
under some assumptions about transmission techniques, always achieves a 100%
perfomance. It is based on a proper recursive splitting of the concurrent tags
sets, until all tags have been identified. The other approaches present in
literature have performances of about 42% in the average at most. The
counterpart is a more sophisticated hardware to be deployed in the manufacture
of low cost tags.
