Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network (KAREN) has been used to
transfer large volumes of radio astronomical data between the Radio
Astronomical Observatory at Warkworth, New Zealand and various international
organizations involved in joint projects and VLBI observations. Here we report
on the current status of connectivity and on the results of testing different
data transfer protocols. We investigate new UDP protocols such as 'tsunami' and
UDT and demonstrate that the UDT protocol is more efficient than 'tsunami' and
'ftp'. We also report on the tests on direct data streaming from the radio
telescope receiving system to the correlation centre without intermediate
buffering or recording (real-time eVLBI).
