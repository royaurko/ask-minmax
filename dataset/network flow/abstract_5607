There is a complex relation between the mechanism of preferential attachment,
scale-free degree distributions and hyperbolicity in complex networks. In fact,
both preferential attachment and hidden hyperbolic spaces often generate
scale-free networks. We show that there is actually a duality between a class
of growing spatial networks based on preferential attachment on the sphere and
a class of static random networks on the hyperbolic plane. Both classes of
networks have the same scale-free degree distribution as the Barabasi-Albert
model. As a limit of this correspondence, the Barabasi-Albert model is
equivalent to a static random network on an hyperbolic space with infinite
curvature.
