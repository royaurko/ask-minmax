In this work we study the performance of a heterogeneous wireless sensor
network which consists of 4 different hardware platforms (TelosB, SunSPOT,
Arduino, iSense). All hardware platforms use 802.15.4 compliant radios. Due to
partial implementation of the standard, they do not communicate out of the box.
A first contribution of our work is a careful description of the necessary
steps to make such a heterogeneous network interoperate. Our software code is
available online. We deploy a heterogeneous network testbed and conduct a
thorough evaluation of the performance. We examine various network performance
metrics (e.g., transmission rate, receiving rate, packet loss, etc.), and
assess the capabilities of each device and their intercommunication. We used
different setups (e.g., distance between transmitters and receivers, etc.) to
better understand the network limitations for each hardware platform.
