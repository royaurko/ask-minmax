Merging-based sorting networks are an important family of sorting networks.
Most merge sorting networks are based on 2-way or multi-way merging algorithms
using 2-sorters as basic building blocks. An alternative is to use n-sorters,
instead of 2-sorters, as the basic building blocks so as to greatly reduce the
number of sorters as well as the latency. Based on a modified Leighton's
columnsort algorithm, an n-way merging algorithm, referred to as SS-Mk, that
uses n-sorters as basic building blocks was proposed. In this work, we first
propose a new multiway merging algorithm with n-sorters as basic building
blocks that merges n sorted lists of m values each in 1 + ceil(m/2) stages (n
<= m). Based on our merging algorithm, we also propose a sorting algorithm,
which requires O(N log2 N) basic sorters to sort N inputs. While the asymptotic
complexity (in terms of the required number of sorters) of our sorting
algorithm is the same as the SS-Mk, for wide ranges of N, our algorithm
requires fewer sorters than the SS-Mk. Finally, we consider a binary sorting
network, where the basic sorter is implemented in threshold logic and scales
linearly with the number of inputs, and compare the complexity in terms of the
required number of gates. For wide ranges of N, our algorithm requires fewer
gates than the SS-Mk.
