Central cluster galaxies in cooling flows show the signatures of gaseous
accretion and ongoing star formation at rates ranging between 1-100 solar
masses per year. Their blue morphologies usually reflect the low net angular
momentum content of the less than 10,000 K gas from which the accretion
population formed, and the effects of interactions between the cool gas and
their FR I radio sources. For example, there is strong evidence that star
formation is being triggered, in part, by interactions between the 10,000 K gas
and the radio sources in some objects. Disk star formation on kiloparsec scales
is rare in cooling flows. The optically determined star formation rates,
assuming the Local initial mass function (IMF), are typically factors of 10-100
smaller than the cooling rates determined from X-ray observations, and
signatures of the remaining material have not been identified outside of the
X-ray band. The IMF is poorly understood in cooling flows; most of the cooling
material may be deposited in low-mass stars or some other form of dark matter.
Continued study of the interactions between radio sources and the intercluster
medium will further our understanding of how elliptical galaxies, particularly
radio ellipticals in the early universe, evolve.
