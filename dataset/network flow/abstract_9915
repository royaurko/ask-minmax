It is shown that a new quantum-foam in-flow theory of gravity is
mathematically equivalent to the General Relativity theory of gravity for the
operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS). The differences between the
two theories become experimentally evident in other situations such as in the
so-called `dark matter' effect, in the observation of absolute motion and ipso
facto in the observation of the in-flow motion into the Sun, and in the
observation of a new class of gravitational waves, effects which are present in
existing experimental observations, but are not within General Relativity. This
new theory of gravity arises within the information-theoretic Process Physics.
