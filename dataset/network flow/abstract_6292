The interaction between natural selection and random mutation is frequently
debated in recent years. Does similar dilemma also exist in the evolution of
real networks such as biological networks? In this paper, we try to discuss
this issue by a simple model system, in which the topological structure of
networks is repeatedly modified and selected in order to make them have better
performance in dynamical processes. Interestingly, when the networks with
optimal performance deviate from the steady state networks under pure
mutations, we find the evolution behaves as a balance between mutation and
selection. Furthermore, when the timescales of mutations and dynamical
processes are comparable with each other, the steady state of evolution is
mainly determined by mutation. On the opposite side, when the timescale of
mutations is much longer than that of dynamical processes, selection dominates
the evolution and the steady-state networks turn to have much improved
performance and highly heterogeneous structures. Despite the simplicity of our
model system, this finding could give useful indication to detect the
underlying mechanisms that rein the evolution of real systems.
