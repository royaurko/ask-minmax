In this fluid dynamics video, results from high fidelity numerical
simulations are presented, which have been carried out to study the flow and
droplet dynamics of liquid sheets formed by two impinging jets. A
three-dimensional Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method with adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) based on octree meshes [1] is used to simulate the various flow patterns
associated with impinging jets, secondary breakup and binary collision of
droplets. In addition to AMR, a thickness based refinement algorithm is also
developed and implemented to efficiently resolve the various scales of surface
tension driven interfacial flows.
