In Lagrangian turbulence one is faced with the puzzle that 2D
  Navier-Stokes flows are nearly as intermittent as in three dimensions
although no intermittency is present in the inverse cascade in 2D Eulerian
turbulence. In addition, an inertial range is very difficult to detect and it
is questionable whether it exists at all. Here, we investigate the transition
of Eulerian to Lagrangian probability density functions (PDFs) which leads to a
new type of Lagrangian structure function. This possesses an extended inertial
range similar to the case of tracer particles in a frozen turbulent velocity
field. This allows a connection to the scaling of Eulerian transversal
structure functions.
