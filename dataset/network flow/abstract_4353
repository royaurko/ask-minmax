Bandwidth allocation is a fundamental problem in communication networks. With
current network moving towards the Future Internet model, the problem is
further intensified as network traffic demanding far from exceeds network
bandwidth capability. Maintaining a certain user satisfaction degree therefore
becomes a challenge research topic. In this paper, we deal with the problem by
proposing BASMIN, a novel bandwidth allocation scheme that aims to maximize
network user's happiness. We also defined a new metric for evaluating network
user satisfaction degree: network worth. A three-step evaluation process is
then conducted to compare BASMIN efficiency with other three popular bandwidth
allocation schemes. Throughout the tests, we experienced BASMIN's advantages
over the others; we even found out that one of the most widely used bandwidth
allocation schemes, in fact, is not effective at all.
