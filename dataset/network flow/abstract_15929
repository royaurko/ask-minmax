Spectral algorithms are classic approaches to clustering and community
detection in networks. However, for sparse networks the standard versions of
these algorithms are suboptimal, in some cases completely failing to detect
communities even when other algorithms such as belief propagation can do so.
Here we introduce a new class of spectral algorithms based on a
non-backtracking walk on the directed edges of the graph. The spectrum of this
operator is much better-behaved than that of the adjacency matrix or other
commonly used matrices, maintaining a strong separation between the bulk
eigenvalues and the eigenvalues relevant to community structure even in the
sparse case. We show that our algorithm is optimal for graphs generated by the
stochastic block model, detecting communities all the way down to the
theoretical limit. We also show the spectrum of the non-backtracking operator
for some real-world networks, illustrating its advantages over traditional
spectral clustering.
