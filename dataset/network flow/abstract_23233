Safe operation of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities require
design consideration of a sudden catastrophic loss of vacuum (SCLV) adjacent
with liquid helium (LHe) vessels and subsequent dangers. An experiment is
discussed to test the longitudinal effects of SCLV along the beam line of a
string of scaled SRF cavities. Each scaled cavity includes one segment of beam
tube within a LHe vessel containing 2 K saturated LHe, and a riser pipe
connecting the LHe vessel to a common gas header. At the beam tube inlet is a
fast acting solenoid valve to simulate SCLV and a high/low range orifice plate
flow-meter to measure air influx to the cavity. The gas header exit also has an
orifice plate flow-meter to measure helium venting the system at the relief
pressure of 0.4 MPa. Each cavity is instrumented with Validyne pressure
transducers and Cernox thermometers. The purpose of this experiment is to
quantify the time required to spoil the beam vacuum and the effects of
transient heat and mass transfer on the helium system. Heat transfer data is
expected to reveal a longitudinal effect due to the geometry of the experiment.
Details of the experimental design criteria and objectives are presented.
