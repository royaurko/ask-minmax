We consider the problem of identifying a single line outage in a power grid
by using data from phasor measurement units (PMUs). When a line outage occurs,
the voltage phasor of each bus node changes in response to the change in
network topology. Each individual line outage has a consistent "signature," and
a multiclass logistic regression (MLR) classifier can be trained to distinguish
between these signatures reliably. We consider first the ideal case in which
PMUs are attached to every bus, but phasor data alone is used to detect outage
signatures. We then describe techniques for placing PMUs selectively on a
subset of buses, with the subset being chosen to allow discrimination between
as many outage events as possible. We also discuss extensions of the MLR
technique that incorporate explicit information about identification of outages
by PMUs measuring line current flow in or out of a bus. Experimental results
with synthetic 24-hour demand profile data generated for 14, 30, 57 and 118-bus
systems are presented.
