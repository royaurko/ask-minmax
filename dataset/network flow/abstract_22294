We characterize the volume entropy of an arbitrary regular building as the
topological pressure of the geodesic flow on an apartment. We show that the
Liouville measure is not entropy maximizing measure for regular hyperbolic
buildings. As a consequence, we obtain a strict lower bound on the volume
entropy in terms of the branching numbers and the volume of the boundary
polyhedrons.
