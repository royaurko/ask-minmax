We investigate both experimentally and theoretically the traffic of particles
flowing in microfluidic obstacle networks. We show that the traffic dynamics is
a non-linear process: the particle current does not scale with the particle
density even in the dilute limit where no particle collision occurs. We
demonstrate that this non-linear behavior stems from long range hydrodynamic
interactions. Importantly, we also establish that there exists a maximal
current above which no stationary particle flow can be sustained. For higher
current values, intermittent traffic jams form thereby inducing the ejection of
the particles from the initial path and the subsequent invasion of the network.
Eventually, we put our findings in the broader context of the transport
proccesses of driven particles in low dimension.
