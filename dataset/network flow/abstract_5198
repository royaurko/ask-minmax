One of the most striking results is the large elliptic flow ($v_2$) at RHIC.
Detailed mass and transverse momentum dependence of elliptic flow are well
described by ideal hydrodynamic calculations for $p_{\mathrm{T}} < $ 1 GeV/c,
and by parton coalescence/recombination picture for $p_{\mathrm{T}} = 2 - 6$
GeV/c. The systematic error on $v_2$ is dominated by so-called "non-flow
effects", which is the correlation not originated from reaction plane. It is
crucial to understand and reduce the systematic error from non-flow effects in
order to understand the underlying collision dynamics. In this paper, we
present the centrality dependence of $v_2$ with respect to the first harmonic
event plane at ZDC-SMD ($v_2$\{ZDC-SMD\}) in Au + Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Large rapidity gap ($|\Delta\eta| > 6$) between
midrapidity and the ZDC could enable us to minimize possible non-flow
contributions. We compare the results of $v_2$\{ZDC-SMD\} with $v_2$\{BBC\},
which is measured by event plane determined at $|\eta| = 3.1 - 3.9$. Possible
non-flow contributions in those results will be discussed.
