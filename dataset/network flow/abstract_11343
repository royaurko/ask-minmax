Heterogeneous applications could be assimilated within the same wireless
sensor network with the aid of modern motes that have multiple sensor boards on
a single radio board. Different types of data generated from such types of
motes might have different transmission characteristics in terms of priority,
transmission rate, required bandwidth, tolerable packet loss, delay demands
etc. Considering a sensor network consisting of such multi-purpose nodes, in
this paper we propose Prioritized Heterogeneous Traffic-oriented Congestion
Control Protocol (PHTCCP) which ensures efficient rate control for prioritized
heterogeneous traffic. Our protocol uses intra-queue and inter-queue priorities
for ensuring feasible transmission rates of heterogeneous data. It also
guarantees efficient link utilization by using dynamic transmission rate
adjustment. Detailed analysis and simulation results are presented along with
the description of our protocol to demonstrate its effectiveness in handling
prioritized heterogeneous traffic in wireless sensor networks.
