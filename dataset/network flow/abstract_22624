We study Markov exclusion process for a particle system with a local
interaction in the integer strip. This process models the exchange of
velocities and particle-hole exchange of the liquid molecules. It is shown that
the mean velocity profile corresponds to the behaviour which is characteristic
for incompressible viscous liquid. We prove the existence of phase transition
between laminar and turbulent profiles.
