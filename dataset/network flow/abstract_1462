In this document we study the application of weighted proportional fairness
to data flows in the Internet. We let the users set the weights of their
connections in order to maximise the utility they get from the network. When
combined with a pricing scheme where connections are billed by weight and time,
such a system is known to maximise the total utility of the network. Our study
case is a national Web cache server connected to long distance links. We
propose two ways of weighting TCP connections by manipulating some parameters
of the protocol and present results from simulations and prototypes. We finally
discuss how proportional fairness could be used to implement an Internet with
differentiated services.
