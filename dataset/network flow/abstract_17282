The effect of glycerol, water and glycerol-water binary mixtures on the
structure and dynamics of biomolecules has been well studied. However, a lot
remains to be learned about the effect of varying glycerol concentration and
temperature on the dynamics of water. We have studied the effect of
concentration and temperature on the hydrogen bonded network formed by water
molecules. A strong correlation between the relaxation time of the network and
average number of hydrogen bonds per water molecules was found. The radial
distribution function of water oxygen and hydrogen atoms clarifies the effect
of concentration on the structure and clustering of water.
