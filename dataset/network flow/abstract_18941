We study the effect of external infection sources on phase transitions in
epidemic processes. In particular, we consider an epidemic spreading on a
network via the SIS/SIR dynamics, which in addition is aided by external agents
- sources unconstrained by the graph, but possessing a limited infection rate
or virulence. Such a model captures many existing models of externally aided
epidemics, and finds use in many settings - epidemiology, marketing and
advertising, network robustness, etc. We provide a detailed characterization of
the impact of external agents on epidemic thresholds. In particular, for the
SIS model, we show that any external infection strategy with constant virulence
either fails to significantly affect the lifetime of an epidemic, or at best,
sustains the epidemic for a lifetime which is polynomial in the number of
nodes. On the other hand, a random external-infection strategy, with rate
increasing linearly in the number of infected nodes, succeeds under some
conditions to sustain an exponential epidemic lifetime. We obtain similar sharp
thresholds for the SIR model, and discuss the relevance of our results in a
variety of settings.
