We study statistical properties of a family of maps acting in the space of
integer valued sequences, which model dynamics of simple deterministic traffic
flows. We obtain asymptotic (as time goes to infinity) properties of
trajectories of those maps corresponding to arbitrary initial configurations in
terms of statistics of densities of various patterns and describe weak
attractors of these systems and the rate of convergence to them. Previously
only the so called regular initial configurations (having a density with only
finite fluctuations of partial sums around it) in the case of a slow particles
model (with the maximal velocity 1) have been studied rigorously. Applying
ideas borrowed from substitution dynamics we are able to reduce the analysis of
the traffic flow models corresponding to the multi-lane traffic and to the flow
with fast particles (with velocities greater than 1) to the simplest case of
the flow with the one-lane traffic and slow particles, where the crucial
technical step is the derivation of the exact life-time for a given cluster of
particles. Applications to the optimal redirection of the multi-lane traffic
flow are discussed as well.
