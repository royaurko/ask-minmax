We consider a passive scalar field under the action of pumping, diffusion and
advection by a smooth flow with a Lagrangian chaos. We present theoretical
arguments showing that scalar statistics is not conformal invariant and
formulate new effective semi-analytic algorithm to model the scalar turbulence.
We then carry massive numerics of passive scalar turbulence with the focus on
the statistics of nodal lines. The distribution of contours over sizes and
perimeters is shown to depend neither on the flow realization nor on the
resolution (diffusion) scale $r_d$ for scales exceeding $r_d$. The scalar
isolines are found fractal/smooth at the scales larger/smaller than the pumping
scale $L$. We characterize the statistics of bending of a long isoline by the
driving function of the L\"owner map, show that it behaves like diffusion with
the diffusivity independent of resolution yet, most surprisingly, dependent on
the velocity realization and the time of scalar evolution.
