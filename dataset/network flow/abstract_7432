The introduction of a steady-state spatially-periodic Raman coupling between
two components of an ultracold atomic gas produces a dressed-state gas with an
anisotropic and tunable dispersion relation. A Bose-Einstein condensate formed
in such a gas is consequently characterized by an anisotropic superfluid
critical velocity. The anisotropic dissipation of superfluid flow is quantified
by considering the scattering of impurities flowing through this superfluid. A
gradual transition from the isotropic nature of an uncoupled Bose-Einstein
condensate to the anisotropic periodically-dressed condensate is obtained as
the strength of the Raman coupling is varied. These results present a clear
signature for future experiemental realizations of this novel superfluid.
