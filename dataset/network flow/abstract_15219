Teaching network security can be a difficult task for university teachers,
especially for teachers at smaller universities where the course loads are more
diverse. Creating a new course in network security requires investigation into
multiple subject areas within the field and from multiple sources. This task
can be daunting and overwhelming for teachers from smaller universities because
of their requirement to teach multiple subjects, not just network security.
Along with the requirement of teachers to understand the material that they
wish to teach, the factors of obsolescence and the ability to build material
off of core topics need to be addressed. These three factors are difficult for
a smaller university teacher to address without a set of standards to analyze
these areas. A rubric addressing these topic areas of timelessness,
associability, and simplicity has been created to assist in the selection of
materials based on the three criteria. The use of this rubric provides an
effective means to choose material for a new course and help teachers to
present the material they determine most appropriate to teach.
