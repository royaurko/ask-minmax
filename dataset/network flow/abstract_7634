As it follows from the interrelation of Gamma and Poisson distributions the
observed value of asymmetry for Poisson flows of events has the bias. The Monte
Carlo experiment confirms the presence of this bias between the observed and
initial asymmetries. The obtained results allow to correct the estimation of
the asymmetry of flow rates.
