We propose and compare six different ways of mapping the modified $q$-voter
model to complex networks. Considering square lattices, Barab\'asi-Albert,
Watts-Strogatz and real Twitter networks, we ask the question if always a
particular choice of the group of influence of a fixed size $q$ leads to
different behavior at the macroscopic level. Using Monte Carlo simulations we
show that the answer depends on the relative average path length of the network
and for real-life topologies the differences between the considered mappings
may be negligible.
