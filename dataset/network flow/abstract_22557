We numerically study elongated helical spin textures in ferromagnetic spin-1
Bose-Einstein condensates subject to dipolar interparticle forces. Stationary
states of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation are solved and analyzed for various
values of the helical wave vector and dipolar coupling strength. We find two
helical spin textures which differ by the nature of their topological defects.
The spin structure hosting a pair of Mermin-Ho vortices with opposite mass
flows and aligned spin currents is stabilized for a nonzero value of the
helical wave vector.
