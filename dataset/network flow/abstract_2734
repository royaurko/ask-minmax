We study networks that connect points in geographic space, such as
transportation networks and the Internet. We find that there are strong
signatures in these networks of topography and use patterns, giving the
networks shapes that are quite distinct from one another and from
non-geographic networks. We offer an explanation of these differences in terms
of the costs and benefits of transportation and communication, and give a
simple model based on the Monte Carlo optimization of these costs and benefits
that reproduces well the qualitative features of the networks studied.
