Social network sites allow users to publicly tag people in their posts. These
tagged posts allow users to share to both the general public and a targeted
audience, dynamically assembled via notifications that alert the people
mentioned. We investigate people's perceptions of this mixed sharing mode
through a qualitative study with 120 participants. We found that individuals
like this sharing modality as they believe it strengthens their relationships.
Individuals also report using tags to have more control of Facebook's ranking
algorithm, and to expose one another to novel information and people. This work
helps us understand people's complex relationships with the algorithms that
mediate their interactions with each another. We conclude by discussing the
design implications of these findings.
