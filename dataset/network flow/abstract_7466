Examples of Morse functions with integrable gradient flows on some classical
Riemannian manifolds are considered. In particular, we show that a generic
height function on the symmetric embeddings of classical Lie groups and certain
symmetric spaces is a perfect Morse function, i.e. has as many critical points
as the homology requires, and the corresponding gradient flow can be described
explicitly. This gives an explicit cell decomposition and geometric realization
of the homology for such a manifold. As another application of the integrable
Morse functions we give an elementary proof of Vassiljev's theorem on the flag
join of Grassmannians.
