We study the cohomological pressure introduced by R.Sharp (defined by using
topological pressures of certain potentials of Anosov flows). In particular, we
get the rigidity in the case that this pressure coincides with the metrical
entropy, generalising related rigidity results of A.Katok and P. Foulon.
