We show that the BPS spectrum of pure SU(3) four-dimensional super Yang-Mills
with N=2 supersymmetry exhibits a surprising phenomenon: there are regions of
the Coulomb branch where the growth of the BPS degeneracies with the charge is
exponential. We show this using spectral networks and independently using
wall-crossing formulae and quiver methods. The computations using spectral
networks provide a very nontrivial example of how these networks determine the
four-dimensional BPS spectrum. We comment on some physical implications of the
wild spectrum: for example, exponentially many field-theoretic BPS states with
large charge are gigantic. Finally, we exhibit some surprising, thus far
unexplained, regularities of the BPS spectrum.
