In this paper we propose and investigate the performance of a multi-channel
scheduling algorithm based on the well-known deficit round-robin (DRR), which
we call multi-channel DRR (MCDRR). We extend the original DRR to the case of
multiple channels with tunable transmitters and fixed receivers to provide
efficient fair queueing in hybrid time division multiplexing (TDM)/wavelength
division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. We take into account the
availability of channels and tunable transmitters in extending the DRR and
allow the overlap of `rounds' in scheduling to efficiently utilize channels and
tunable transmitters. Simulation results show that the proposed MCDRR can
provide nearly perfect fairness with ill-behaved flows for different sets of
conditions for interframe times and frame sizes in hybrid TDM/WDM optical
networks with tunable transmitters and fixed receivers.
