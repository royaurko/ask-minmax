The structure of the basin of attraction of a stable equilibrium point is
investigated for a dynamical system (W97) often used to model transition to
turbulence in shear flows. The basin boundary contains not only an equilibrium
point Xlb but also a periodic orbit P, and it is the latter that mediates the
transition. Orbits starting near Xlb relaminarize. We offer evidence that this
is due to the extreme narrowness of the region complementary to basin of
attraction in that part of phase space near Xlb. This leads to a proposal for
interpreting the 'edge of chaos' in terms of more familiar invariant sets.
