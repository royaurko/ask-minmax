Coupling frequently enhances noise-induced coherence and synchronization in
interacting nonlinear systems, but it does so separately. In principle
collective stochastic coherence and synchronizability are incompatible
phenomena, since strongly synchronized elements behave identically and thus
their response to noise is indistinguishable to that of a single element.
Therefore one can expect systems that synchronize well to have a poor
collective response to noise. Here we show that, in spite of this apparent
conflict, a certain coupling architecture is able to reconcile the two
properties. Specifically, our results reveal that weighted scale-free networks
of diffusively coupled excitable elements exhibit both high synchronizability
of their subthreshold dynamics and a good collective response to noise of their
pulsed dynamics. This is established by comparing the behavior of this system
to that of random, regular, and unweighted scale-free networks. We attribute
the optimal response of weighted scale-free networks to the link homogeneity
(with respect to node degree) provided by the weighting procedure, which
balances the degree heterogeneity typical of SFNs.
