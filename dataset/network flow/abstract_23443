Mutation is introduced into autocatalytic reaction networks. Examples of low
dimensional dynamical systems --- n = 2, 3 and 4 --- are discussed and complete
qualitative analysis is presented. Error thresholds known from simple
replication-mutation kinetics with frequency independent replication rates
occur here as well. Instead of cooperative transitions or higher order phase
transistions the thresholds appear here as supercritical or subcritical
bifurcations being analogous to first order phase transitions.
