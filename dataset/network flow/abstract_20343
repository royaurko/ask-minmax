The paper considers heat transfer characteristics of thin film flow over a
hot horizontal cylinder resulting from a cold vertical sheet of liquid falling
onto the surface. The underlying physical features of the developing film
thickness, velocity and temperature distributions have been illustrated by
numerical solutions of high accuracy for large Reynolds numbers using the
modified Keller box method. The solutions for film thickness distribution are
good agreement with those obtained using the Pohlhausen integral momentum
technique thus providing a basic confirmation of the validity of the results
presented.
