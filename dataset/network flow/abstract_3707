In this paper, we study the performance of detectors in a diffusive molecular
communication environment where steady uniform flow is present. We derive the
expected number of information molecules to be observed in a passive spherical
receiver, and determine the impact of flow on the assumption that the
concentration of molecules throughout the receiver is uniform. Simulation
results show the impact of advection on detector performance as a function of
the flow's magnitude and direction. We highlight that there are disruptive
flows, i.e., flows that are not in the direction of information transmission,
that lead to an improvement in detector performance as long as the disruptive
flow does not dominate diffusion and sufficient samples are taken.
