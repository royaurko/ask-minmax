In a distributed computing system a modular program must have its modules assigned among the processors so as to avoid excessive interprocessor communication while taking advantage of specific efficiencies of some processors in executing some program modules. In this paper we show that this program module assignment problem can be solved efficiently by making use of the well-known Fordâ€“Fulkerson algorithm for finding maximum flows in commodity networks as modified by Edmonds and Karp, Dinic, and Karzanov. A solution to the two-processor problem is given, and extensions to three and n-processors are considered with partial results given without a complete efficient solution.
