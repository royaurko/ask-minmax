We present the simulation of 3D time dependent flow of rotating ideal gas
falling into a Schwarzschild black hole. It is shown that also in the 3D case
steady shocks are formed in a wide range of parameters (initial angular
momentum and thermal energy). We therefore highlight the stability of the
phenomenon of shock formation in sub keplerian flows onto black holes, and
reenforce the role of the shocks in the high luminosity emission from black
hole candidates. The simulations have been performed using a parallelized code
based on the Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics method (SPH). We also discuss
some properties of the shock problem that allow its use as a quantitative test
of the accuracy of the used numerical method. This shows that the accuracy of
SPH is acceptable although not excellent.
