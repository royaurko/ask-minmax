To predict flow behavior of entangled polymer melt, we have developed
multiscale simulation composed of Lagrangian fluid particle simulation and
coarse-grained polymer dynamics simulation. We have introduced a particle
deformation in the Lagrangian fluid particle simulation to describe elongation
flow at a local point. The particle deformation is obtained to be consistent
with the local polymer deformation.
