C. Remling obtained a theorem on limit set of the shift operation on a space
of functions on R when the associated 1-D half line Schr\"odinger operators
have absolutely continuous component in their spectrum. The purpose of the
paper is to define a KdV flow on a certain class of functions containing
algebro-geometric functions and to extend this result to the KdV flow.
