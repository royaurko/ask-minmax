In this paper, we have introduced an algorithm to implement a sorting network
for reversible logic synthesis based on swapping bit strings. The algorithm
first constructs a network in terms of n*n Toffoli gates read from left to
right. The number of gates in the circuit produced by our algorithm is then
reduced by template matching and removing useless gates from the network. We
have also compared the efficiency of the proposed method with the existing
ones.
