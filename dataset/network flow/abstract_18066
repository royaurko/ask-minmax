Biological molecules can form hydrogen bonds between nearby residues, leading
to helical secondary structures. The associated reduction of configurational
entropy leads to a temperature dependence of this effect: the "helix-coil
transition". Since the formation of helices implies a dramatic shortening of
the polymer dimensions, an externally imposed end-to-end distance R affects the
equilibrium helical fraction of the polymer and the resulting force- extension
curves show anomalous plateau regimes. In this article, we investigate the
behaviour of a cross-linked network of such helicogenic molecules,
particularly, focusing on the coupling of the (average) helical content present
in a network to the externally imposed strain. We show that both an elongation
and compression can lead to an increase in helical domains under appropriate
conditions.
