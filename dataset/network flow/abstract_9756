Multistationary chemical reaction networks are of interest to scientists and
mathematicians alike. While some criteria for multistationarity exist,
obtaining explicit reaction rates and steady states that exhibit
multistationarity for a given network -- in order to check nondegeneracy or
determine stability of the steady states, for instance -- is nontrivial.
Nonetheless, we accomplish this task for a certain family of sequestration
networks. Additionally, our results allow us to prove the existence of
nondegenerate steady states for some of these sequestration networks, thereby
resolving a subcase of a conjecture of Joshi and Shiu. Our work relies on the
determinant optimization method, developed by Craciun and Feinberg, for
asserting that certain networks are multistationary. More precisely, we
implement the construction of reaction rates and multiple steady states which
appears in the proofs that underlie their method. Furthermore, we describe in
detail the steps of this construction so that other researchers can more easily
obtain, as we did, multistationary rates and steady states.
