We give a proof that Brakke's mean curvature flow under the unit density
assumption is smooth almost everywhere in space-time. More generally, if the
velocity is equal in a weak sense to its mean curvature plus some given
\alpha-H\"{o}lder continuous vector field, then we show C^{2,\alpha} regularity
almost everywhere.
