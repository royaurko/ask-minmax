The replica method is applied to a neural network model with state-dependent
synapses built from those patterns having a correlation with the state of the
system greater than a certain threshold. Replica-symmetric and first-step
replica-symmetry-breaking results are presented for the storage capacity at
zero temperature as a function of this threshold value. A comparison is made
with existing results based upon mean-field equations obtained by using a
statistical method.
