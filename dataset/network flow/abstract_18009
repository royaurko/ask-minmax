Social networks with positive and negative links often split into two
antagonistic factions. Examples of such a split abound: revolutionaries versus
an old regime, Republicans versus Democrats, Axis versus Allies during the
second world war, or the Western versus the Eastern bloc during the Cold War.
Although this structure, known as social balance, is well understood, it is not
clear how such factions emerge. An earlier model could explain the formation of
such factions if reputations were assumed to be symmetric. We show this is not
the case for non-symmetric reputations, and propose an alternative model which
(almost) always leads to social balance, thereby explaining the tendency of
social networks to split into two factions. In addition, the alternative model
may lead to cooperation when faced with defectors, contrary to the earlier
model. The difference between the two models may be understood in terms of the
underlying gossiping mechanism: whereas the earlier model assumed that an
individual adjusts his opinion about somebody by gossiping about that person
with everybody in the network, we assume instead that the individual gossips
with that person about everybody. It turns out that the alternative model is
able to lead to cooperative behaviour, unlike the previous model.
