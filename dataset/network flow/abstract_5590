This paper conducts a detailed simulation study of stateless anycast routing
in a mobile wireless ad hoc network. The model covers all the fundamental
aspects of such networks with a routing mechanism using a scheme of
orientation-dependent inter-node communication links. The simulation system
Winsim is used which explicitly represents parallelism of events and processes
in the network. The purpose of these simulations is to investigate the effect
of node s maximum speed, and different TTL over the network performance under
two different scenarios. Simulation study investigates five practically
important performance metrics of a wireless mobile ad hoc network and shows the
dependence of this metrics on the transmission radius, link availability, and
maximal possible node speed.
