Self-similarity in the network traffic has been studied from several aspects:
both at the user side and at the network side there are many sources of the
long range dependence. Recently some dynamical origins are also identified: the
TCP adaptive congestion avoidance algorithm itself can produce chaotic and long
range dependent throughput behavior, if the loss rate is very high. In this
paper we show that there is a close connection between the static and dynamic
origins of self-similarity: parallel TCPs can generate the self-similarity
themselves, they can introduce heavily fluctuations into the background traffic
and produce high effective loss rate causing a long range dependent TCP flow,
however, the dropped packet ratio is low.
