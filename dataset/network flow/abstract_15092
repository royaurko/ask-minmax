In many stochastic simulations of biochemical reaction networks, it is
desirable to ``coarse-grain'' the reaction set, removing fast reactions while
retaining the correct system dynamics. Various coarse-graining methods have
been proposed, but it remains unclear which methods are reliable and which
reactions can safely be eliminated. We address these issues for a model gene
regulatory network that is particularly sensitive to dynamical fluctuations: a
bistable genetic switch. We remove protein-DNA and/or protein-protein
association-dissociation reactions from the reaction set, using various
coarse-graining strategies. We determine the effects on the steady-state
probability distribution function and on the rate of fluctuation-driven switch
flipping transitions. We find that protein-protein interactions may be safely
eliminated from the reaction set, but protein-DNA interactions may not. We also
find that it is important to use the chemical master equation rather than
macroscopic rate equations to compute effective propensity functions for the
coarse-grained reactions.
