We prove that the Benjamin-Ono equation is globally well-posed in $ H^s(\T) $
for $ s\ge 0 $. Moreover we show that the associated flow-map is Lipschitz on
every bounded set of $ {\dot H}^s(\T) $, $s\ge 0$, and even real-analytic in
this space for small times. This result is sharp in the sense that the flow-map
(if it can be defined and coincides with the standard flow-map on $
H^\infty(\T) $) cannot be of class $ C^{1+\alpha} $, $\alpha>0 $, from $ {\dot
H}^s(\T) $ into $ {\dot H}^s(\T) $ as soon as $ s< 0 $.
