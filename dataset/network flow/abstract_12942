Experimental results are presented on the transport properties of granular
materials on a vibratory conveyor. For circular oscillations of the shaking
trough a non-monotonous dependence of the transport velocity on the normalized
acceleration is observed. Two maxima are separated by a regime, where the
granular flow is much slower and, in a certain driving range, even reverses its
direction. A similar behavior is found for a single solid body with a low
coefficient of restitution, whereas an individual glass bead of 1 mm diameter
is propagated in the same direction for all accelerations.
