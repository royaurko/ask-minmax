We propose a simple continuum model to interpret the shearing motion of
dense, dry and cohesion-less granular media. Compressibility, dilatancy and
Coulomb-like friction are the three basic ingredients. The granular stress is
split into a rate-dependent part representing the rebound-less impacts between
grains and a rate-independent part associated with long-lived contacts. Because
we consider stationary flows only, the grain compaction and the grain velocity
are the two main variables. The predicted velocity and compaction profiles are
in apparent agreement with the experimental or numerical results concerning
free-surface shear flows as well as confined shear flows
