We have designed a novel Event-Condition-Action(ECA) scheme based Ad hoc
On-demand Distance Vector(ECA-AODV) routing protocol for a Ubiquitous
Network(UbiNet). ECA-AODV is designed to make routing decision dynamically and
quicker response to dynamic network conditions as and when event occur. ECA
scheme essentially consists of three modules to make runtime routing decision
quicker. First, event module receive event that occur in a UbiNet and split up
event into event type and event attributes. Second, condition module obtain
event details from event module split up each condition into condition
attributes that matches event and fire the rule as soon as condition hold.
Third, action module make runtime decisions based on event obtained and
condition applied. We have simulated and tested the designed ECA scheme by
considering ubiquitous museum environment as a case study with nodes range from
10 to 100. The simulation results show the time efficient with minimal
operations
