In this article we discuss network growth based on Prisoner's Dilemma(PD)
where palyers on nodes in a network palay with its linked players. The players
estimate total profits in the PD. When a new node is attached, the node make
linkes to nodes in the network with the probabilities in proportion to the
profits made by the game. Iterating this process, a network grows. We
investigate properties of this type of growing networks, especially the degree
distribution and time-depending strategy distribution by running computer
simulation. We also find a sort of phase transition in the strategy
distributions. For these phenomena given by computer simulation, theoretical
studies are also carried out.
