We first summarize briefly several properties concerning the dynamics of
two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, with an emphasis on the inverse cascade of
energy to the largest accessible scale of the system. In order to study a
similar phenomenon in three-dimensional (3D) turbulence undergoing strong
solid-body rotation, we test a previously developed Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
model against a high-resolution direct numerical simulation of rotating
turbulence on a grid of $3072^3$ points. We then describe new numerical results
on the inverse energy cascade in rotating flows using this LES model and
contrast the case of 2D versus 3D forcing, as well as non-helical forcing
(i.e., with weak overall alignment between velocity and vorticity) versus the
fully helical Beltrami case, both for deterministic and random forcing. The
different scaling of the inverse energy cascade can be attributed to the
dimensionality of the forcing, with, in general, either a $k_{\perp}^{-3}$ or a
$k_{\perp}^{-5/3}$ energy spectrum of slow modes at large scales, perpendicular
referring to the direction of rotation. We finally invoke the role of shear in
the case of a strongly anisotropic deterministic forcing, using the so-called
ABC flow.
