Communities of vertices within a giant network such as the World-Wide Web are
likely to be vastly smaller than the network itself. However, Fortunato and
Barth\'{e}lemy have proved that modularity maximization algorithms for
community detection may fail to resolve communities with fewer than
$\sqrt{L/2}$ edges, where $L$ is the number of edges in the entire network.
This resolution limit leads modularity maximization algorithms to have
notoriously poor accuracy on many real networks. Fortunato and Barth\'{e}lemy's
argument can be extended to networks with weighted edges as well, and we derive
this corollary argument. We conclude that weighted modularity algorithms may
fail to resolve communities with fewer than $\sqrt{W \epsilon/2}$ total edge
weight, where $W$ is the total edge weight in the network and $\epsilon$ is the
maximum weight of an inter-community edge. If $\epsilon$ is small, then small
communities can be resolved.
  Given a weighted or unweighted network, we describe how to derive new edge
weights in order to achieve a low $\epsilon$, we modify the ``CNM'' community
detection algorithm to maximize weighted modularity, and show that the
resulting algorithm has greatly improved accuracy. In experiments with an
emerging community standard benchmark, we find that our simple CNM variant is
competitive with the most accurate community detection methods yet proposed.
