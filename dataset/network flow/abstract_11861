Future wireless networks are expected to be highly heterogeneous with the
co-existence of macrocells and small cells as well as provide support for
device-to-device (D2D) communication. In such muti-tier heterogeneous systems
centralized radio resource allocation and interference management schemes will
not be scalable. In this work, we propose an auction-based distributed solution
to allocate radio resources in a muti-tier heterogeneous network. We provide
the bound of achievable data rate and show that the complexity of the proposed
scheme is linear with number of transmitter nodes and the available resources.
The signaling issues (e.g., information exchange over control channels) for the
proposed distributed solution is also discussed. Numerical results show the
effectiveness of proposed solution in comparison with a centralized resource
allocation scheme.
