The exploitation of the mm-wave bands is one of the most promising solutions
for 5G mobile radio networks. However, the use of mm-wave technologies in
cellular networks is not straightforward due to mm-wave severe propagation
conditions that limit access availability. In order to overcome this obstacle,
hybrid network architectures are being considered where mmwave small cells can
exploit an overlay coverage layer based on legacy technology. The additional
mm-wave layer can also take advantage of a functional split between control and
user plane, that allows to delegate most of the signaling functions to legacy
base stations and to gather context information from users for resource
optimization. However, mm-wave technology requires multiple antennas and highly
directional transmissions to compensate for high path loss and limited power.
Directional transmissions must be also used for the cell discovery and
synchronization process, and this can lead to a non negligible delay due to
need to scan the cell area with multiple transmissions in different angles. In
this paper, we propose to exploit the context information related to user
position, provided by the separated control plane, to improve the cell search
procedure and minimize delay. We investigate the fundamental trade-offs of the
cell discovery process with directional antennas and the effects of the context
information accuracy on its performance. Numerical results are provided to
validate our observations.
