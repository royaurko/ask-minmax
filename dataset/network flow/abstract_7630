Turbulent-laminar patterns near transition are simulated in plane Couette
flow using an extension of the minimal flow unit methodology. Computational
domains are of minimal size in two directions but large in the third. The long
direction can be tilted at any prescribed angle to the streamwise direction.
Three types of patterned states are found and studied: periodic, localized, and
intermittent. These correspond closely to observations in large aspect ratio
experiments.
