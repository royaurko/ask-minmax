This paper presents preliminary results of Croatian syllable networks
analysis. Syllable network is a network in which nodes are syllables and links
between them are constructed according to their connections within words. In
this paper we analyze networks of syllables generated from texts collected from
the Croatian Wikipedia and Blogs. As a main tool we use complex network
analysis methods which provide mechanisms that can reveal new patterns in a
language structure. We aim to show that syllable networks have much higher
clustering coefficient in comparison to Erd\"os-Renyi random networks. The
results indicate that Croatian syllable networks exhibit certain properties of
a small world networks. Furthermore, we compared Croatian syllable networks
with Portuguese and Chinese syllable networks and we showed that they have
similar properties.
