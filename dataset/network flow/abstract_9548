Every device defines the behavior of various applications running on it with
the help of user profiles or settings. What if a user wants different different
applications to run in different different networks. Then he cannot do this
because in todays existing operating systems the application profile, user
specific tool settings and any such system usage settings do not consider the
current network characteristics of the user or system and are therefore static
in nature.Therefore there is a need for an intelligent system which will
dynamically change or apply changes to the settings of various applications
running on the system considering the current network characteristics based on
user specifications. This paper presents an idea such that a user can set
different different applications in different different networks.This paper
presents how the user will get pop up messages when he visits to safe web
sites. And according to the users current network status he will get a pop up
message when he will go for download or stream audio or video files.
