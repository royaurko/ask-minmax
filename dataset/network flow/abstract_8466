In this technical report, we analyze the performance of an interference-aware
opportunistic relay selection protocol for multi-hop line networks which is
based on the following simple rule: a node always transmits if it has a packet,
except when its successive node on the line is transmitting. We derive
analytically the saturation throughput and the end-to-end delay for two and
three hop networks, and present simulation results for higher numbers of hops.
In the case of three hops, we determine the throughput-optimal relay positions.
