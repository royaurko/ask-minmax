More often than not, bad decisions are bad regardless of where and when they
are made. Information sharing might thus be utilized to mitigate them. Here we
show that sharing the information about strategy choice between players
residing on two different networks reinforces the evolution of cooperation. In
evolutionary games the strategy reflects the action of each individual that
warrants the highest utility in a competitive setting. We therefore assume that
identical strategies on the two networks reinforce themselves by lessening
their propensity to change. Besides network reciprocity working in favour of
cooperation on each individual network, we observe the spontaneous emerge of
correlated behaviour between the two networks, which further deters defection.
If information is shared not just between individuals but also between groups,
the positive effect is even stronger, and this despite the fact that
information sharing is implemented without any assumptions with regards to
content.
