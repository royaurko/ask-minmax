We have obtained a "hierarchical regionalization" of 3,107 county-level units
of the United States based upon 1995-2000 intercounty migration flows. The
methodology employed was the two-stage (double-standardization and strong
component directed graph] hierarchical clustering) algorithm described in the
2009 PNAS letter arXiv:0904.4863. Various features (e. g., cosmopolitan vs.
provincial aspects) of the regionalization have been discussed in
arXiv:0907.2393, arXiv:0903.3623 and arXiv:0809.2768. However, due to the
cumbersome (38-page) nature of the dendrogram, this interesting tree structure
was not readily available for inspection (but see
http://www.spatial.ucsb.edu/events/brownbags/docs/2009-2010/Slater-Ordinal-Hierarchy.pdf).
Here, we do directly present this (searchable) dendrogram. An ordinal
scale--rather than the originally-derived cardinal scale of the
doubly-standardized values--in which groupings/features are more immediately
apparent, is employed.
