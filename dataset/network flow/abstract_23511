An intriguing heuristic model of development, decline, and change conceived
by Bernard J.F. Lonergan (BL) in the late 1940's was laid out in a manner now
recognizable as representing an early model of complexity. This report is a
first effort toward eventually translating that qualitative vision, designated
Emergent Probability, into a viable network computer program.
  In his study of human understanding, Lonergan saw the task of constructing a
cohesive body of explanatory knowledge as a convoluted building process of
schemes of recurrence that act as foundational elements to further growth.
Although BL's kernal recurrent scheme was composed of the cognitional dynamics
surrounding Insight, other examples abound in nature: resource cycles, motor
skills, biological routines, autocatalytic processes, etc. The corresponding
growing generic World Process can alternatively be thought of as chemical,
environmental, evolutionary, social, organizational, economical, psychological,
or ethical, and its generality might be of particular interest to complex
systems researchers.
