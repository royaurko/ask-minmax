The aim of this work is to identify the physical processes that occur in the
network and contribute to its dynamics and heating. We model the network as
consisting of individual flux tubes with a non-potential field structure that
are located in intergranular lanes. With a typical horizontal size of 200 km at
the base of the photosphere, they expand upward and merge with their neighbors
at a height of about 600 km. Above a height of approximately 1000 km the
magnetic field starts to become uniform.
  Waves are generated in this medium by means of motions at the lower boundary.
We focus on transverse driving, which generates both fast and slow waves within
a flux tube and acoustic waves at the interface of the tube and the field-free
medium. The acoustic waves at the interface are due to compression of the gas
on one side of the flux tube and expansion on the other. These waves travel
upward along the two sides of the (2D) flux tube and enter it, where they
become longitudinal waves. For impulsive excitation with a time constant of 120
s, we find that a dominant feature is the creation of vortical motions that
propagate upward. We have identified an efficient mechanism for the generation
of longitudinal waves and shock formation in the chromospheric part of the flux
concentration. We examine some broad implications of our results.
