Adaptive networks appear in many biological applications. They combine
topological evolution of the network with dynamics in the network nodes.
Recently, the dynamics of adaptive networks has been investigated in a number
of parallel studies from different fields, ranging from genomics to game
theory. Here we review these recent developments and show that they can be
viewed from a unique angle. We demonstrate that all these studies are
characterized by common themes, most prominently: complex dynamics and robust
topological self-organization based on simple local rules.
