One of the important techniques of Data mining is Classification. Many real
world problems in various fields such as business, science, industry and
medicine can be solved by using classification approach. Neural Networks have
emerged as an important tool for classification. The advantages of Neural
Networks helps for efficient classification of given data. In this study a
Heart diseases dataset is analyzed using Neural Network approach. To increase
the efficiency of the classification process parallel approach is also adopted
in the training phase.
