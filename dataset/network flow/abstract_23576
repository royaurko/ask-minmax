We study the temperature dependence of the superconductor-insulator
transition in granular superconductors. Empirically, these systems are
characterized by very broad resistance tails, which depend exponentially on the
temperature, and the normal state resistance. We model these systems by a
two-dimensional random resistor percolation networks in which the resistance
between two grains is governed either by Josephson junction coupling or by
quasi particle tunneling. Our numerical simulations as well as an effective
medium evaluation explain the experimental results over a wide range of
temperatures and resistances. Using effective medium approximation we find an
analytical expression for the effective resistance of the system and the value
of the critical resistance separating conducting from insulating branches.
