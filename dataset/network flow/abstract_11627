From transportation networks to complex infrastructures, and to social and
communication networks, a large variety of systems can be described in terms of
multiplexes formed by a set of nodes interacting through different networks
(layers). Multiplexes may display an increased fragility with respect to the
single layers that constitute them. However, so far the overlap of the links in
different layers has been mostly neglected, despite the fact that it is an
ubiquitous phenomenon in most multiplexes. Here we show that the overlap among
layers can improve the robustness of interdependent multiplex systems and
change the critical behavior of the percolation phase transition in a complex
way.
