We formulate a simple edge generation rule based on an inverse like mass
action principle for random graphs over a structured vertex set. We show that
under very weak assumptions on the structure generating distribution we obtain
a scale free distribution for the degree. We furthermore introduce and study a
"my friends are your friends" local search principle which makes the clustering
coefficient large.
