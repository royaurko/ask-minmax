The hybrid relay selection (HRS) scheme, which adaptively chooses
amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols, is very
effective to achieve robust performance in wireless networks. This paper
analyzes the frame error rate (FER) of the HRS scheme in general cooperative
wireless networks without and with utilizing error control coding at the source
node. We first develop an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold-based
FER approximation model. Then, we derive an analytical average FER expression
as well as an asymptotic expression at high SNR for the HRS scheme and
generalize to other relaying schemes. Simulation results are in excellent
agreement with the theoretical analysis, which validates the derived FER
expressions.
