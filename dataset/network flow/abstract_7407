Using thin film pillars ~100 nm in diameter, containing two ferromagnetic Co
layers of different thicknesses separated by a paramagnetic Cu spacer, we
examine effects of torques due to spin-polarized currents flowing perpendicular
to the layers. In accordance with spin-transfer theory, spin-polarized
electrons flowing from the thin to the thick Co layer can switch the magnetic
moments of the layers antiparallel, while a reversed electron flow causes
switching to a parallel state. When large magnetic fields are applied, the
current no longer fully reverses the magnetic moment, but instead stimulates
spin-wave excitations.
