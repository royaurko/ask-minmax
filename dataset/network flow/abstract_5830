Minimum distance diagrams are a way to encode the diameter and routing
information of multi-loop networks. For the widely studied case of double-loop
networks, it is known that each network has at most two such diagrams and that
they have a very definite form "L-shape''.
  In contrast, in this paper we show that there are triple-loop networks with
an arbitrarily big number of associated minimum distance diagrams. For doing
this, we build-up on the relations between minimum distance diagrams and
monomial ideals.
