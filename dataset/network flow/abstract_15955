In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic spectrum allocation in
cognitive radio (CR) networks and propose a novel sealed-bid auction framework
to address the spectrum allocation problem when the spectrum is not available
with certainty. In our model, we assume that the moderator plays the dual role
of being a fusion center (FC) for spectrum sensing and an auctioneer for
spectrum allocation where it attempts to maximize its utility. We also consider
the cost of collisions with the primary user (PU) and assign this cost to the
FC, making it completely responsible for its allocation decision. With the help
of CRs participating in the network, the FC makes a global inference on the
availability of the spectrum followed by spectrum allocation decisions. We
derive the optimal auction for spectrum allocation in the presence of
uncertainty in spectrum availability at the moderator. Furthermore, we
investigate feasibility conditions for the proposed auction, in addition to an
analysis of multi-dimensional truthfulness where CRs are encouraged to reveal
truthful sensing decisions to the moderator. We also prove that the utility of
the moderator in traditional auctions such as VCG auction is always less than
that of the proposed auction even though the overall network throughput is the
same for both these mechanisms. Some numerical examples are presented to
provide insights into the performance of the proposed auction under different
scenarios.
