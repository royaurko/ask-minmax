We used the HI data from the LAB survey to map the ring-shaped gap in HI
density which lies slightly outside the solar circle. Adopting $R_0$= 7.5 kpc,
we find and average radius of 8.3 kpc and an average gap width of 0.8 kpc. The
characteristics of the HI gap correspond closely to the expected ones, as
predicted by theory and by numerical simulations of the gas flow near the
corotation resonance.
