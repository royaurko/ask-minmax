We investigate, by numerical simulations, how the avalanche dynamics of the
Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) sandpile model can induce emergence of scale-free
(SF) networks and how this emerging structure affects dynamics of the system.
We also discuss how the observed phenomenon can be used to explain evolution of
scientific collaboration.
