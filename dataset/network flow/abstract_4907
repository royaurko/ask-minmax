In this work, we investigate links between the formulation of the flow of
marginals of reversible diffusion processes as gradient flows in the space of
probability measures and path wise large deviation principles for sequences of
such processes. An equivalence between the LDP principle and Gamma-convergence
for a sequence of functionals appearing in the gradient flow formulation is
proved. As an application, we study large deviations from the hydrodynamic
limit for two variants of the Ginzburg-Landau model endowed with Kawasaki
dynamics.
