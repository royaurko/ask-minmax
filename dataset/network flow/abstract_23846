The increasing availability of distributed energy resources (DERs) and
sensors in smart grid, as well as overlaying communication network, provides
substantial potential benefits for improving the power system's reliability. In
this paper, the problem of sensor selection is studied for the MAC layer design
of wireless sensor networks for regulating the voltages in smart grid. The
framework of hybrid dynamical system is proposed, using Kalman filter for
voltage state estimation and LQR feedback control for voltage adjustment. The
approach to obtain the optimal sensor selection sequence is studied. A sub-
optimal sequence is obtained by applying the sliding window algorithm.
Simulation results show that the proposed sensor selection strategy achieves a
40% performance gain over the baseline algorithm of the round-robin sensor
polling.
