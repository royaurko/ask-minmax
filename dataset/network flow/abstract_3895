Spatial evolution game has traditionally assumed that players interact with
neighbors on a single network, which is isolated and not influenced by other
systems. We introduce the simple game model into the interdependent networks
composed of two networks, and show that when the interdependent factor $\alpha$
is smaller than a particular value $\alpha_C$, homogeneous cooperation can be
guaranteed. However, as interdependent factor exceeds $\alpha_C$, spontaneous
symmetry breaking of fraction of cooperators presents itself between different
networks. In addition, our results can be well predicted by the strategy-couple
pair approximation method.
