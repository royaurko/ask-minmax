On microstructured hydrophobic surfaces, geometrical patterns may lead to the
appearance of a superhydrophobic state, where gas bubbles at the surface can
have a strong impact on the fluid flow along such surfaces. In particular, they
can strongly influence a detected slip at the surface. We present two-phase
lattice Boltzmann simulations of a flow over structured surfaces with attached
gas bubbles and demonstrate how the detected slip depends on the pattern
geometry, the bulk pressure, or the shear rate. Since a large slip leads to
reduced friction, our results allow to assist in the optimization of
microchannel flows for large throughput.
