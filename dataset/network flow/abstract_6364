We investigate the problem of disseminating broadcast messages in wireless
networks with time-varying links from a percolation-based perspective. Using a
model of wireless networks based on random geometric graphs with dynamic on-off
links, we show that the delay for disseminating broadcast information exhibits
two behavioral regimes, corresponding to the phase transition of the underlying
network connectivity. When the dynamic network is in the subcritical phase,
ignoring propagation delays, the delay scales linearly with the Euclidean
distance between the sender and the receiver. When the dynamic network is in
the supercritical phase, the delay scales sub-linearly with the distance.
Finally, we show that in the presence of a non-negligible propagation delay,
the delay for information dissemination scales linearly with the Euclidean
distance in both the subcritical and supercritical regimes, with the rates for
the linear scaling being different in the two regimes.
