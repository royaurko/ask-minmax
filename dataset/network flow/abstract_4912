Three-dimensional instability of axisymmetric flow in a rotating disk -
cylinder configuration is studied numerically for the case of low cylinders
with the height/radius aspect ratio varying between 1 and 0.1. A complete
stability diagram for the transition from steady axisymmetric to oscillatory
three-dimensional flow regime is reported. A good agreement with experimental
results is obtained. It is shown that critical azimuthal wavenumber grows with
the decrease of the aspect ratio, reaching the value of 19 at the aspect ratio
0.1. It is argued that the observed instability cannot be described as
resulting from a B\"odewadt flow or from a boundary layer only. Other reasons
that can destabilize the flow are discussed.
