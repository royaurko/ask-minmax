The minimization of Fisher's information (MFI) approach of Frieden et al.
[Phys. Rev. E {\bf 60} 48 (1999)] is applied to the study of size distributions
in social groups on the basis of a recently established analogy between scale
invariant systems and classical gases [arXiv:0908.0504]. Going beyond the ideal
gas scenario is seen to be tantamount to simulating the interactions taking
place in a network's competitive cluster growth process. We find a scaling rule
that allows to classify the final cluster-size distributions using only one
parameter that we call the competitiveness. Empirical city-size distributions
and electoral results can be thus reproduced and classified according to this
competitiveness, which also allows to correctly predict well-established
assessments such as the "six-degrees of separation", which is shown here to be
a direct consequence of the maximum number of stable social relationships that
one person can maintain, known as Dunbar's number. Finally, we show that scaled
city-size distributions of large countries follow the same universal
distribution.
