In the paper the flow in a thin tubular structure is considered. The velocity
of the flow stands for a coefficient in the diffusion-convection equation set
in the thin structure. An asymptotic expansion of solution is constructed. This
expansion is used further for justification of an asymptotic domain
decomposition strategy essentially reducing the memory and the time of the
code. A numerical solution obtained by this strategy is compared to the
numerical solution obtained by a direct FEM computation.
