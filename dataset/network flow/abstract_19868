Tidal disruption of stars by massive black holes produce transient accretion
flows that flare at optical, UV, and X-ray wavelengths. At late times, these
accretion flows may launch relativistic jets that can be detected through the
interaction of the jet with the dense interstellar medium of the galaxy. We
present an upper limit for the flux density of a radio counterpart to a tidal
disruption event detected by GALEX that is a factor of 6 below theoretical
predictions. We also examine existing radio surveys for transients with a time
scale of 1 year and use these to set a $2 \sigma$ upper limit on the rate of
tidal disruption events producing relativistic jets of ~14 x 10^-7 Mpc^-3 y^-1.
This rate is an order of magnitude lower than the highest values from
theoretical models and is consistent with detection rates from optical and
X-ray surveys.
