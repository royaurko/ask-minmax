Motivated by recent experimental advances (Stroock et al. 2002) in
microfluidic mixers, we study the passive mixing and flow properties of a
patterned microchannel by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Such
geometries overcome the low Reynolds number, high Peclet number boundaries to
efficient mixing by creating a three-dimensional flow that yields chaotic
trajectories for advected passive scalars. The flow seems to exploit an
effective shearing mechanism, or 'ditch mixing,' rather than the alternating
span-wise vorticity mechanism we anticipated. Further, we find superexponential
mixing for a modification of the geometry. It is hoped that such CFD studies
advance both the capabilities and the understanding of such micropatterned
mixing flows.
