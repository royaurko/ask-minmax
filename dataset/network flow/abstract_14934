A recent paper "Emergence of scaling in random networks" (cond-mat/9910332)
by Barabasi and Albert proposes a growth mechanism to produce a stationary
scale free distribution of the number of edges per node in large networks such
as the Web. The Barabasi-Albert model predicts that older vertices acquire new
edges at the expense of younger ones, giving a strong correlation between the
time a vertex is introduced and the number of edges it has. We present data
from the Web showing that there is no such correlation and point to an
alternative growth model which produces the correct relationship between the
age of a site and the number of links it has.
