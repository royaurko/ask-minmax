Based on the quark coalescence model, we derive relations among the momentum
anisotropies of mesons and baryons in relativistic heavy ion collisions from a
given, but arbitrary azimuthal distribution for the partons. Besides the
familiar even Fourier coefficients such as the elliptic flow, we also pay
attention to odd Fourier coefficients such as the directed flow, which has been
observed at finite rapidity even at RHIC energies.
