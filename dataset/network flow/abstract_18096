Within the framework of Von Neumann's expanding model, we study the maximum
growth rate r achievable by an autocatalytic reaction network in which
reactions involve a finite (fixed or fluctuating) number D of reagents. r is
calculated numerically using a variant of the Minover algorithm, and
analytically via the cavity method for disordered systems. As the ratio between
the number of reactions and that of reagents increases the system passes from a
contracting (r<1) to an expanding regime (r>1). These results extend the
scenario derived in the fully connected model ($D\to\infinity$), with the
important difference that, generically, larger growth rates are achievable in
the expanding phase for finite D and in more diluted networks. Moreover, the
range of attainable values of r shrinks as the connectivity increases.
