We study tram priority at signalized intersections using a stochastic
cellular automaton model for multimodal traffic flow. We simulate realistic
traffic signal systems, which include signal linking and adaptive cycle lengths
and split plans, with different levels of tram priority. We find that tram
priority can improve service performance in terms of both average travel time
and travel time variability. We consider two main types of tram priority, which
we refer to as full and partial priority. Full tram priority is able to
guarantee service quality even when traffic is saturated, however, it results
in significant costs to other road users. Partial tram priority significantly
reduces tram delays while having limited impact on other traffic, and therefore
achieves a better result in terms of the overall network performance. We also
study variations in which the tram priority is only enforced when trams are
running behind schedule, and we find that those variations retain almost all of
the benefit for tram operations but with reduced negative impact on the
network.
