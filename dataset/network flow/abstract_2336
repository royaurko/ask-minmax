We introduce singular Ricci flows, which are Ricci flow spacetimes subject to
certain asymptotic conditions. We consider the behavior of Ricci flow with
surgery starting from a fixed initial compact Riemannian 3-manifold, as the
surgery parameter varies. We prove that the flow with surgery subconverges to a
singular Ricci flow as the surgery parameter tends to zero. We establish a
number of geometric and analytical properties of singular Ricci flows.
