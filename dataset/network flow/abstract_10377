Suspensions with fiber-like particles in the low Reynolds number regime are
modeled by two different approaches that both use a Lagrangian representation
of individual particles. The first method is the well-established formulation
based on Stokes flow that is formulated as integral equations. It uses a
slender body approximation for the fibers to represent the interaction between
them directly without explicitly computing the flow field. The second is a new
technique using the 3D lattice Boltzmann method on parallel supercomputers.
Here the flow computation is coupled to a computational model of the dynamics
of rigid bodies using fluid-structure interaction techniques. Both methods can
be applied to simulate fibers in fluid flow. They are carefully validated and
compared against each other, exposing systematically their strengths and
weaknesses regarding their accuracy, the computational cost, and possible model
extensions.
