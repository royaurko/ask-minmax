Recent work has shown that the speed of the cooling front in soft X-ray
transients may be an important clue in understanding the nature of accretion
disk viscosity. In a previous paper (Vishniac and Wheeler 1996) we derived the
scaling law for the cooling front speed. Here we derive a similarity solution
for the hot inner part of disks undergoing cooling. This solution is exact in
the limit of a thin disk, power law opacities, and a minimum hot state column
density which is an infinitesimal fraction of the maximum cold state density.
For a disk of finite thickness the largest error is in the ratio of the mass
flow across the cooling front to the mass flow at small radii. Comparison to
the numerical simulations of Cannizzo et al. (1995) inidcates that the errors
in the other parameters do not exceed $(c_{sF}/r_F\Omega_F)^q$, that is, the
ratio of the sound speed at the disk midplane to its orbital velocity,
evaluated at the cooling front, to the qth power. Here $q\approx 1/2$. Its
precise value is determined by the relevant hot state opacity law and the
functional form of the dimensionless viscosity.
