Nodes in ad hoc networks with randomly oriented directional antenna patterns
typically have fewer short links and more long links which can bridge together
otherwise isolated subnetworks. This network feature is known to improve
overall connectivity in 2D random networks operating at low channel path loss.
To this end, we advance recently established results to obtain analytic
expressions for the mean degree of 3D networks for simple but practical
anisotropic gain profiles, including those of patch, dipole and end-fire array
antennas. Our analysis reveals that for homogeneous systems (i.e. neglecting
boundary effects) directional radiation patterns are superior to the isotropic
case only when the path loss exponent is less than the spatial dimension.
Moreover, we establish that ad hoc networks utilizing directional transmit and
isotropic receive antennas (or vice versa) are always sub-optimally connected
regardless of the environment path loss. We extend our analysis to investigate
boundary effects in inhomogeneous systems, and study the geometrical reasons
why directional radiating nodes are at a disadvantage to isotropic ones.
Finally, we discuss multi-directional gain patterns consisting of many equally
spaced lobes which could be used to mitigate boundary effects and improve
overall network connectivity.
