Bilateral trade relationships in the international level between pairs of
countries in the world give rise to the notion of the International Trade
Network (ITN). This network has attracted the attention of network researchers
as it serves as an excellent example of the weighted networks, the link weight
being defined as a measure of the volume of trade between two countries. In
this paper we analyzed the international trade data for 53 years and studied in
detail the variations of different network related quantities associated with
the ITN. Our observation is that the ITN has also a scale invariant structure
like many other real-world networks.
