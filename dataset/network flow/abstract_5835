Today's industrial sensor networks require strong reliability and guarantees
on messages delivery. These needs are even more important in real time
applications like control/command, such as robotic wireless communications
where strong temporal constraints are critical. For these reasons, classical
random-based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols present a non-null frame
collision probability. In this paper we present an original full deterministic
MAC-layer for industrial wireless network and its performance evaluation thanks
to the development of a material prototype.
