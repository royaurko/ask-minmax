We investigate the integral conditions to extend the mean curvature flow in a
Riemannian manifold. We prove that the mean curvature flow solution with finite
total mean curvature on a finite time interval $[0,T)$ can be extended over
time $T$. Moreover, we show that the condition is optimal in some sense.
