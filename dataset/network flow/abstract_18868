This paper presents a framework for node distribution with respect to
density, network connectivity and communication time. Using NS2, we evaluate
and compare performance of three routing protocols; Ad-hoc On-demand Distance
Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Fisheye State Routing (FSR)
both in MANETs (IEEE 802.11) and VANETs (IEEE 802.11p). We further enhanced
these protocols by changing their routing information exchange intervals; MOD
AODV, MOD DSR and MOD FSR. A comprehensive simulation work is performed for the
comparison of these routing protocols for varying motilities and scalabilities
of nodes. As a result, we can say that AODV outperforms DSR and FSR both in
MANETs and VANETs.
