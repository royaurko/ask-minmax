We consider mesh networks composed of groups of relaying nodes which operate
in decode-and-forward mode, where each node from a group relays information to
all the nodes in the next group. We study these networks in two setups, one
where the nodes have complete channel state information from the nodes that
transmit to them, and another when they only have the statistics of the
channel. We derive recursive expressions for the probabilities of errors of the
nodes and present several implementations of detectors used in these networks.
We compare the mesh networks with multihop networks, the latter being formed by
a set of parallel sections of multiple relaying nodes. We demonstrate with
numerous simulations that there are significant improvements in performance of
mesh over multihop networks in various scenarios.
