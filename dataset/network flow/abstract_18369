In this paper, a transmission protocol is studied for a two relay wireless
network in which simple repetition coding is applied at the relays.
Information-theoretic achievable rates for this transmission scheme are given,
and a space-time V-BLAST signalling and detection method that can approach them
is developed. It is shown through the diversity multiplexing tradeoff analysis
that this transmission scheme can recover the multiplexing loss of the
half-duplex relay network, while retaining some diversity gain. This scheme is
also compared with conventional transmission protocols that exploit only the
diversity of the network at the cost of a multiplexing loss. It is shown that
the new transmission protocol offers significant performance advantages over
conventional protocols, especially when the interference between the two relays
is sufficiently strong.
