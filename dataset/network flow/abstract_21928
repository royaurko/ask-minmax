We introduce a three independent functions variational formalism for
stationary and non-stationary barotropic flows. This is less than the four
variables which appear in the standard equations of fluid dynamics which are
the velocity field $\vec v$ and the density $\rho$. It will be shown how in
terms of our new variable the Euler and continuity equations can be integrated
in the stationary case.
