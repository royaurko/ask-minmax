We have created a genome-scale network reconstruction of chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cell metabolism. Existing reconstructions were improved in terms of
annotation standards, to facilitate their subsequent use in dynamic modelling.
The resultant network is available from ChoNet (http://cho.sf.net/).
