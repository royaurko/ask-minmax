We develop a generalized loss network framework for capacity planning of a
perinatal network in the UK. Decomposing the network by hospitals, each unit is
analyzed with a GI/G/c/0 overflow loss network model. A two-moment
approximation is performed to obtain the steady state solution of the GI/G/c/0
loss systems, and expressions for rejection probability and overflow
probability have been derived. Using the model framework, the number of
required cots can be estimated based on the rejection probability at each level
of care of the neonatal units in a network. The generalization ensures that the
model can be applied to any perinatal network for renewal arrival and discharge
processes.
