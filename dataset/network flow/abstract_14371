Let $M$ be a compact $C^{\infty}$ Riemannian manifold. Given $p$ and $q$ in
$M$ and $T>0$, define $n_{T}(p,q)$ as the number of geodesic segments joining
$p$ and $q$ with length $\leq T$. Ma\~n\'e showed that the exponential growth
rate of the integral of $n_{T}(p,q)$ over $M \times M$ is the topological
entropy of the geodesic flow of $M$. In the present paper we exhibit an open
set of metrics on the two-sphere for which the exponential growth rate of
$n_{T}(p,q$ is less than the topological entropy of the geodesic flow for a
positive measure set of $(p,q)\in M\times M$. This answers in the negative
questions raised by Ma\~n\'e.
