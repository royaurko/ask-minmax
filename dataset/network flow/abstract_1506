We present HORNET, a system that enables high-speed end-to-end anonymous
channels by leveraging next generation network architectures. HORNET is
designed as a low-latency onion routing system that operates at the network
layer thus enabling a wide range of applications. Our system uses only
symmetric cryptography for data forwarding yet requires no per-flow state on
intermediate nodes. This design enables HORNET nodes to process anonymous
traffic at over 93 Gb/s. HORNET can also scale as required, adding minimal
processing overhead per additional anonymous channel. We discuss design and
implementation details, as well as a performance and security evaluation.
