Columnar joints are three-dimensional fracture networks that form in cooling
basalt and several other media. The network organizes itself into ordered,
mostly hexagonal columns. The same pattern can be observed on a smaller scale
in desiccating starch. We show how surface boundary conditions in the
desiccation of starch affect the formation of columnar joints. Under constant
drying power conditions, we find a power law dependence of columnar
cross-sectional area with depth, while under constant drying rate conditions
this coarsening is eventually halted. Discontinuous transitions in pattern
scale can be observed under constant external conditions, which may prompt a
reinterpretation of similar transitions found in basalt. Starch patterns are
statistically similar to those found in basalt, suggesting that mature columnar
jointing patterns contain inherent residual disorder, but are statistically
scale invariant.
