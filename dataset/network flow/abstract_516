Routing games are used to to understand the impact of individual users'
decisions on network efficiency. Most prior work on routing games uses a
simplified model of network flow where all flow exists simultaneously, and
users care about either their maximum delay or their total delay. Both of these
measures are surrogates for measuring how long it takes to get all of a user's
traffic through the network. We attempt a more direct study of how competition
affects network efficiency by examining routing games in a flow over time
model. We give an efficiently computable Stackelberg strategy for this model
and show that the competitive equilibrium under this strategy is no worse than
a small constant times the optimal, for two natural measures of optimality.
