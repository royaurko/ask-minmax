Spoofing with falsified IP-MAC pair is the first step in most of the LAN
based-attacks. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is stateless, which is the
main cause that makes spoofing possible. Several network level and host level
mechanisms have been proposed to detect and mitigate ARP spoofing but each of
them has their own drawback. In this paper we propose a Host-based Intrusion
Detection system for LAN attacks, which works without any extra constraint like
static IP-MAC, modifying ARP etc. The proposed scheme is verified under all
possible attack scenarios. The scheme is successfully validated in a test bed
with various attack scenarios and the results show the effectiveness of the
proposed technique.
