The concept of Wardrop equilibrium plays an important role in congested
traffic problems since its introduction in the early 50's. As shown in [2],
when we work in two-dimensional cartesian and increasingly dense networks,
passing to the limit by {\Gamma}-convergence, we obtain continuous minimization
problems posed on measures on curves. Here we study the case of general
networks in R d which become very dense. We use the notion of generalized
curves and extend the results of the cartesian model.
