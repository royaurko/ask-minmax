In this paper, computations of transient, incompressible, turbulent, plane
jets using the discrete lattice BGK Boltzmann equation are reported. A priori
derivation of the discrete lattice BGK Boltzmann equation with a spatially and
temporally dependent relaxation time parameter, which is used to represent the
averaged flow field, from its corresponding continuous form is given. The
averaged behavior of the turbulence field is represented by the standard {\it
k-$\epsilon$} turbulence model and computed using a finite-volume scheme on
non-uniform grids. Computed results are compared with analytical solutions,
experimental data and results of other computational methods. Satisfactory
agreement is shown.
