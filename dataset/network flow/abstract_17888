Efficient routing mechanism is a challenging issue for group oriented
computing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). The ability of MANETs to support
adequate Quality of Service (QoS) for group communication is limited by the
ability of the underlying ad-hoc routing protocols to provide consistent
behavior despite the dynamic properties of mobile computing devices. In MANET
QoS requirements can be quantified in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR),
Data Latency, Packet Loss Probability, Routing Overhead, Medium Access Control
(MAC) Overhead and Data Throughput etc. This paper presents an in depth study
of one to many and many to many communications in MANETs and provides a
comparative performance evaluation of unicast and broadcast routing protocols.
Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) is used as unicast protocol and BCAST is
used to represent broadcast protocol. The performance differentials are
analyzed using ns2 network simulator varying multicast group size (number of
data senders and data receivers). Both protocols are simulated with identical
traffic loads and mobility models. Simulation result shows that BCAST performs
better than DSR in most cases.
