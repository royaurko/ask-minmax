In the context of large-scale networks, the consideration of faults is an
evident necessity. This document is focussing on the self-stabilizing approach
which aims at conceiving algorithms "repairing themselves" in case of transient
faults, that is of faults implying an arbitrary modification of the states of
the processes. The document focuses on two different contexts, covering the
major part of my research work these last years. The first part of the document
is dedicated to the design and analysis of self-stabilizing algorithms for
networks of processes. The second part of the document is dedicated to the
design and analysis of self-stabilizing algorithms for autonomous entities
(i.e., software agents, robots, etc.) moving in a network.
