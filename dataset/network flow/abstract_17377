String theoretic resolution of classical spacetime singularities is
discussed. Particular emphasis is on the use of brane probes, and the
connection [1] of the enhancon phenomenon [2] to the n=2* Pilch-Warner flow
spacetime [3]. Some comments and details on the singularity of the PW spacetime
are added. For the proceedings of Strings 2001, Mumbai, India.
