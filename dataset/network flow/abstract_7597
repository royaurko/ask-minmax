We report on measurements of directed flow as a function of pseudorapidity in
Au+Au collisions at energies of $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} =$ 19.6, 62.4, 130 and 200
GeV as measured by the PHOBOS detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC). These results are particularly valuable because of the extensive,
continuous pseudorapidity coverage of the PHOBOS detector. There is no
significant indication of structure near midrapidity and the data surprisingly
exhibit extended longitudinal scaling similar to that seen for elliptic flow
and charged particle pseudorapidity density.
