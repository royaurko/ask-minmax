We introduce application layer specifications, which allow us to reason about
the state and transactions of rich Internet applications. We define variants of
the state/event based logic UCTL* along with two example applications to
demonstrate this approach, and then look at a distributed, rich Internet
application, proving properties about the information it stores and
disseminates. Our approach enables us to justify proofs about abstract
properties that are preserved in the face of concurrent, networked inputs by
proofs about concrete properties in an Internet setting. We conclude that our
approach makes it possible to reason about the programs and protocols that
comprise the Internet's application layer with reliability and generality.
