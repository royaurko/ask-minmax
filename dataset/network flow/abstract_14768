In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model to describe the
nanoparticles transport carried by a two-phase flow in a porous medium
including gravity, capillary forces and Brownian diffusion. Nonlinear iterative
IMPES scheme is used to solve the flow equation, and saturation and pressure
are calculated at the current iteration step and then the transport equation is
soved implicitly. Therefore, once the nanoparticles concentration is computed,
the two equations of volume of the nanoparticles available on the pore surfaces
and the volume of the nanoparticles entrapped in pore throats are solved
implicitly. The porosity and the permeability variations are updated at each
time step after each iteration loop. Two numerical examples, namely, regular
heterogeneous permeability and random permeability are considered. We monitor
the changing of the fluid and solid properties due to adding the nanoparticles.
Variation of water saturation, water pressure, nanoparticles concentration and
porosity are presented graphically.
