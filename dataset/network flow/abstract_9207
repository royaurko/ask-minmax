The resistance between arbitrary nodes of infinite networks of resistors is
studied when the network is perturbed by removing one bond from the perfect
lattice. A connection is made between the resistance and the lattice Green's
function of the perturbed network. Solving Dyson's equation the Green's
function and the resistance of the perturbed lattice are expressed in terms of
those of the perfect lattice. Numerical results are presented for a square
lattice. Our method of the lattice Green's function in studying resistor
networks can also be applied in the field of random walks as well as electrical
and mechanical breakdown phenomena in insulators, thin films and modern
ceramics.
