A hypothetical test resistor is connected in parallel to a two terminal
network. The temperature of the test resistor is tuned, until there is no net
flow of noise energy between the network and the resistor. It is shown that
this temperature is independent of the value of the resistor. It is therefore
suggested that this temperature may serve as an alternative definition of the
equivalent noise temperature of a two terminal network. Quite interestingly,
this equivalent noise temperature of an ideal pn diode equals the actual
temperatue of the diode. Furthermore, if this newly defined equivalent noise
temperature can be estimated for a given network by physical arguments, than
the noise of the network can be calculated provided its current voltage
dependence is known. As an example, the suppression of shot noise due to
recombination in the space charge region of a pn diode is estimated using this
procedure.
