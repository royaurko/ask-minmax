In this paper, we propose a general analytical framework for information
spreading in mobile networks based on a new performance metric, mobile
conductance, which allows us to separate the details of mobility models from
the study of mobile spreading time. We derive a general result for the
information spreading time in mobile networks in terms of this new metric, and
instantiate it through several popular mobility models. Large scale network
simulation is conducted to verify our analysis.
