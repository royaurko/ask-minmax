This paper discusses a new energy aware routing scheme which uses variable
transmission range. The protocol has been incorporated along with the route
discovery procedure of AODV as a case study. Both the protocols are simulated
using Network Simulator and comparisons are made to analyze their performance
based on energy consumption, network lifetime and number of alive nodes metrics
for different network scenarios. The results show that EAR makes effective node
energy utilization.
