Processing large complex networks like social networks or web graphs has
recently attracted considerable interest. In order to do this in parallel, we
need to partition them into pieces of about equal size. Unfortunately, previous
parallel graph partitioners originally developed for more regular mesh-like
networks do not work well for these networks. This paper addresses this problem
by parallelizing and adapting the label propagation technique originally
developed for graph clustering. By introducing size constraints, label
propagation becomes applicable for both the coarsening and the refinement phase
of multilevel graph partitioning. We obtain very high quality by applying a
highly parallel evolutionary algorithm to the coarsened graph. The resulting
system is both more scalable and achieves higher quality than state-of-the-art
systems like ParMetis or PT-Scotch. For large complex networks the performance
differences are very big. For example, our algorithm can partition a web graph
with 3.3 billion edges in less than sixteen seconds using 512 cores of a high
performance cluster while producing a high quality partition -- none of the
competing systems can handle this graph on our system.
