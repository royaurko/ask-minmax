How can we protect the network infrastructure from malicious traffic, such as
scanning, malicious code propagation, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
attacks? One mechanism for blocking malicious traffic is filtering: access
control lists (ACLs) can selectively block traffic based on fields of the IP
header. Filters (ACLs) are already available in the routers today but are a
scarce resource because they are stored in the expensive ternary content
addressable memory (TCAM).
  In this paper, we develop, for the first time, a framework for studying
filter selection as a resource allocation problem. Within this framework, we
study five practical cases of source address/prefix filtering, which correspond
to different attack scenarios and operator's policies. We show that filter
selection optimization leads to novel variations of the multidimensional
knapsack problem and we design optimal, yet computationally efficient,
algorithms to solve them. We also evaluate our approach using data from
Dshield.org and demonstrate that it brings significant benefits in practice.
Our set of algorithms is a building block that can be immediately used by
operators and manufacturers to block malicious traffic in a cost-efficient way.
