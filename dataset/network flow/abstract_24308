Advanced internet technologies providing services like e-mail, social
networking, online banking, online shopping etc., have made day-to-day
activities simple and convenient. Increasing dependency on the internet,
convenience, and decreasing cost of electronic devices have resulted in
frequent use of online services. However, increased indulgence over the
internet has also accelerated the pace of digital crimes. The increase in
number and complexity of digital crimes has caught the attention of forensic
investigators. The Digital Investigators are faced with the challenge of
gathering accurate digital evidence from as many sources as possible. In this
paper, an attempt was made to recover digital evidence from a system's RAM in
the form of information about the most recent browsing session of the user.
Four different applications were chosen and the experiment was conducted across
two browsers. It was found that crucial information about the target user such
as, user name, passwords, etc., was recoverable.
