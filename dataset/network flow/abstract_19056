With the formidable growth of various booming wireless communication services
that require ever-increasing data throughputs, the conventional microwave band
below 10 GHz, which is currently used by almost all mobile communication
systems, is going to reach its saturation point within just a few years.
Therefore, the attention of radio system designers has been pushed towards
ever-higher segments of the frequency spectrum in a quest for capacity
increase. In this article, we investigate the feasibility, advantages and
challenges of future wireless communications over the E-band frequencies. We
start from a brief review of the history of E-band spectrum and its light
licensing policy as well as benefits/challenges. Then we introduce the
propagation characteristics of E-band signals, based on which some potential
fixed and mobile applications at the E-band are investigated. In particular, we
analyze the achievability of non-trivial multiplexing gain in fixed
point-to-point E-band links and propose an E-band mobile broadband (EMB) system
as a candidate for the next generation mobile communication networks. The
channelization and frame structure of the EMB system are discussed in details.
