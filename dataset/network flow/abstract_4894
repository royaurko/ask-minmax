We prove that the conical K\"ahler-Ricci flows introduced in \cite{CYW} exist
for all time $t\in [0,+\infty)$. These immortal flows possess maximal
regularity in the conical category. As an application, we show if the twisted
first Chern class $C_{1,\beta}$ is negative or zero, the corresponding conical
K\"ahler-Ricci flows converge to K\"ahler-Einstein metrics with conical
singularities exponentially fast. To establish these results, one of our key
steps is to prove a Liouville type theorem for K\"ahler-Ricci flat metrics
(which are defined over $\mathbb{C}^{n}$) with conical singularities.
