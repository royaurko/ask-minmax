This paper explores optimization of paging and registration policies in
cellular networks. Motion is modeled as a discrete-time Markov process, and
minimization of the discounted, infinite-horizon average cost is addressed. The
structure of jointly optimal paging and registration policies is investigated
through the use of dynamic programming for partially observed Markov processes.
It is shown that there exist policies with a certain simple form that are
jointly optimal, though the dynamic programming approach does not directly
provide an efficient method to find the policies.
  An iterative algorithm for policies with the simple form is proposed and
investigated. The algorithm alternates between paging policy optimization and
registration policy optimization. It finds a pair of individually optimal
policies, but an example is given showing that the policies need not be jointly
optimal. Majorization theory and Riesz's rearrangement inequality are used to
show that jointly optimal paging and registration policies are given for
symmetric or Gaussian random walk models by the nearest-location-first paging
policy and distance threshold registration policies.
