Based on the concept of manifold valued generalized functions we initiate a
study of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with singular (in
particular: distributional) right hand sides in a global setting. After
establishing several existence and uniqueness results for solutions of such
equations and flows of singular vector fields we compare the solution concept
employed here with the purely distributional setting. Finally, we derive
criteria securing that a sequence of smooth flows corresponding to a
regularization of a given singular vector field converges to a measurable
limiting flow.
