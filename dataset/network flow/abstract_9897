We continue the analysis of the preceding talk with a discussion of the
elliptic flow and the HBT pion correlation radii. It is shown that the thermal
model can be extended to describe these phenomena. The description of the
elliptic flow involves an appropriate deformation of the freeze-out
hypersurface and flow velocity. The obtained results agree reasonably with the
data for soft (< 2 GeV) transverse momenta. For the pionic HBT correlation
radii the experimental feature that R_out/R_side ~ 1 is naturally obtained. The
reproduction of individual R_side and R_out can be achieved with the inclusion
of the excluded volume corrections, which effectively increase the radii by
\~30%.
