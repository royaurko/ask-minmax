A self-consistent analysis of the currents in a tokamak yields the result
that the parallel neutralizing current is given simply by the sum of currents
commonly called the bootstrap current and the Pfirsch-Schlueter current. An
expression is given relating the parallel and perpendicular pressure gradient
induced species flow velocities to the total current.
