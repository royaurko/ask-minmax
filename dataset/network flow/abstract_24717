The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) will be a valuable
tool for observing the chromosphere of our Sun at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths
at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution and as such has great
potential to address long-standing scientific questions in solar physics. In
order to make the best use of this scientific opportunity, the Solar
Simulations for the Atacama Large Millimeter Observatory Network has been
initiated. A key goal of this international collaboration is to support the
preparation and interpretation of future observations of the Sun with ALMA.
