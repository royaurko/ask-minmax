BATS codes are proposed for communication through networks with linear
network coding, and can be regarded as a matrix generalization of Raptor codes.
In this paper, the performance of finite-length BATS codes is analyzed with
respect to both belief propagation (BP) decoding and inactivation decoding. For
a fixed number of input symbols and a fixed number of batches, a recursive
formula is obtained to calculate the exact probability distribution of the
stopping time of the BP decoder. When BP decoding stops before all the inputs
symbols are decoded, some input symbols can be inactivated so that the BP
procedure can be resumed. Such a decoding approach is called inactivation
decoding. Extra computation cost is involved to decode the inactivated symbols
by Gaussian elimination. To evaluate the extra computation cost involved in
inactivation decoding, a recursive formula is derived to calculate the expected
number of inactive symbols. When the number of batches follows a Poisson
distribution, recursive formulae with lower computational complexity are
derived for the above problems. Since Raptor codes are BATS codes with unit
batch size, these results also provide new analytical tools for Raptor codes.
