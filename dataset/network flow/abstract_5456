The growth of the Internet technology enables us to use network applications
for streaming audio and video. Especially, real-time streaming services using
peer-to-peer (P2P) technology are currently emerging. An important issue on P2P
streaming is how to construct a logical network (overlay network) on a physical
network (IP network). In this paper, we propose an initial peer configuration
algorithm for a multi-streaming peer-to-peer network. The proposed algorithm is
based on a mesh-pull approach where any node has multiple parent and child
nodes as neighboring nodes, and content transmitted between these neighboring
nodes depends on their parent-child relationships. Our simulation experiments
show that the proposed algorithm improves the number of joining node and
traffic load.
