Ricci flow deformation of cosmological initial data sets in general
relativity is a technique for generating families of initial data sets which
potentially would allow to interpolate between distinct spacetimes. This idea
has been around since the appearance of the Ricci flow on the scene, but it has
been difficult to turn it into a sound mathematical procedure. In this
expository talk we illustrate, how Perelman's recent results in Ricci flow
theory can considerably improve on such a situation. From a physical point of
view this analysis can be related to the issue of finding a constant-curvature
template spacetime for the inhomogeneous Universe, relevant to the
interpretation of observational data and, hence, bears relevance to the dark
energy and dark matter debates. These techniques provide control on curvature
fluctuations (intrinsic backreaction terms) in their relation to the averaged
matter distribution.
