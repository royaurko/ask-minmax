The Information Flow Framework (IFF) is a descriptive category metatheory. It
is an experiment in foundations, which follows a bottom-up approach to logical
description. The IFF forms the structural aspect of the IEEE P1600.1 Standard
Upper Ontology (SUO) project. The categorical approach of the IFF provides a
principled framework for the modular design of object-level ontologies. The IFF
represents meta-logic, and as such operates at the structural level of
ontologies. In the IFF, there is a precise boundary between the metalevel and
the object level. The modular architecture of the IFF consists of metalevels,
namespaces and meta-ontologies. Each metalevel services the levels below by
providing a metalanguage used to declare and axiomatize those levels.
Corresponding to the metalevels are nested metalanguages, where each
metalanguage axiomatization includes specialization of the one immediately
above. Within each metalevel, the terminology is partitioned into namespaces,
and various namespaces are collected together into meaningful composites called
meta-ontologies. All of the various meta-ontologies in the IFF are anchored to
the IFF metastack. The IFF development is largely driven by the principles of
conceptual warrant, categorical design and institutional logic.
