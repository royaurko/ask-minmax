This study aims to assess wireless network security holistically and attempts
to determine the weakest link among the parts that comprise the 'secure' aspect
of the wireless networks: security protocols, wireless technologies and user
habits. The assessment of security protocols is done by determining the time
taken to break a specific protocol's encryption key, or to pass an access
control by using brute force attack techniques. Passphrase strengths as well as
encryption key strengths ranging from 40 to 256 bits are evaluated. Different
scenarios are planned and created for passphrase generation, using different
character sets and different number of characters. Then each scenario is
evaluated based on the time taken to break that passphrase. At the end of the
study, it is determined that the choice of the passphrase is the weakest part
of the entire 802.11 wireless security system.
