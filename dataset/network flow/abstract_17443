The spiraling of adjacent trajectories in chaotic dynamical systems can be
characterized by distribution of local angular velocities of rotation of the
displacement vector, which is governed by linearized equations of motion. This
distribution, akin to that of local Lyapunov exponents, is studied for three
examples of three-dimensional flows. Toy model shows that the rotation rate of
adjacent trajectories influences on the rate of mixing of dynamic variables and
on the sensitivity of trajectories to perturbations.
