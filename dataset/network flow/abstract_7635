We compute numerically the threshold for dynamo action in Taylor-Green
swirling flows. Kinematic calculations, for which the flow field is fixed to
its time averaged profile, are compared to dynamical runs for which both the
Navier-Stokes and the induction equations are jointly solved. The kinematic
instability is found to have two branches, for all explored Reynolds numbers.
The dynamical dynamo threshold follows these branches: at low Reynolds number
it lies within the low branch while at high kinetic Reynolds number it is close
to the high branch.
