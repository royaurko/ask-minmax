Many real-world networks are large, complex and thus hard to understand,
analyze or visualize. The data about networks is not always complete, their
structure may be hidden or they change quickly over time. Therefore,
understanding how incomplete system differs from complete one is crucial. In
this paper, we study the changes in networks under simplification (i.e.,
reduction in size). We simplify 30 real-world networks with six simplification
methods and analyze the similarity between original and simplified networks
based on preservation of several properties, for example degree distribution,
clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, density and degree mixing. We
propose an approach for assessing the effectiveness of simplification process
to define the most appropriate size of simplified networks and to determine the
method, which preserves the most properties of original networks. The results
reveal the type and size of original networks do not influence the changes of
networks under simplification process, while the size of simplified networks
does. Moreover, we investigate the performance of simplification methods when
the size of simplified networks is 10% of the original networks. The findings
show that sampling methods outperform merging ones, particularly random node
selection based on degree and breadth-first sampling perform the best.
