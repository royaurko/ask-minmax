Growth dynamic of real networks because of emerging complexities is an open
and interesting question. Indeed it is not realistic to ignore history impact
on the current events. The mystery behind that complexity could be in the role
of history in some how. To regard this point, the average effect of history has
been included by a kernel function in differential equation of Barabasi Albert
(BA) model . This approach leads to a fractional order BA differential equation
as a generalization of BA model. As opposed to unlimited growth for degree of
nodes, our results show that over time the memory impact will cause a decay for
degrees. This gives a higher chance to younger members for turning to a hub. In
fact in a real network, there are two competitive processes. On one hand, based
on preferential attachment mechanism nodes with higher degree are more likely
to absorb links. On the other hand, node history through aging process prevents
new connections. Our findings from simulating a network grown by considering
these effects also from studying a real network of collaboration between
Hollywood movie actors conforms the results and significant effects of history
and time on dynamic.
