We conceived a model experiment for a continuous separation strategy of
chiral molecules (enantiomers) without the need of any chiral selector
structure or derivatization agents: Micro-particles that only differ by their
chirality are shown to migrate along different directions when driven by a
steady fluid flow through a square lattice of cylindrical posts. In accordance
with our numerical predictions, the transport directions of the enantiomers
depend very sensitively on the orientation of the lattice relatively to the
fluid flow.
