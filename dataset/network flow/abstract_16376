We study a nonlinear, unsteady, moving boundary, fluid-structure interaction
(FSI) problem arising in modeling blood flow through elastic and viscoelastic
arteries. The fluid flow, which is driven by the time-dependent pressure data,
is governed by 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, while the
elastodynamics of the cylindrical wall is modeled by the 1D cylindrical Koiter
shell model. Two cases are considered: the linearly viscoelastic and the
linearly elastic Koiter shell. The fluid and structure are fully coupled (2-way
coupling) via the kinematic and dynamic lateral boundary conditions describing
continuity of velocity (the no-slip condition), and balance of contact forces
at the fluid-structure interface. We prove existence of weak solutions to the
two FSI problems (the viscoelastic and the elastic case) as long as the
cylinder radius is greater than zero.
  The proof is based on a novel semi-discrete, operator splitting numerical
scheme, known as the kinematically coupled scheme, introduced in \cite{GioSun}
to solve the underlying FSI problems. The backbone of the kinematically coupled
scheme is the well-known Marchuk-Yanenko scheme, also known as the Lie
splitting scheme. We effectively prove convergence of that numerical scheme to
a solution of the corresponding FSI problem.
