We have explored the structure of hot magnetized accretion flow with thermal
conduction. The importance of thermal conduction in hot accretion flows has
been confirmed by observations of the hot gas surrounding Sgr $A^*$ and a few
other nearby galactic nuclei. For a steady state structure of such accretion
flows a set of self similar solutions are presented. In this paper, we have
actually tried to re-check the solution presented by Abbassi et al. (2008)
using a physical constrain. In this study we find that Eq 29 places a new
constrain that limits answers presented by Abbassi et al. 2008. In that paper
the parameter space in which it is established in the new constrain was
plotted. However, the new requirement makes up only a small parameter space
with physically acceptable solutions. And now in this manuscript we have
followed the idea with more effort, and tried to find out how thermal
conduction influences the structur of the disks in a physical parameter space.
We have found out that the existence of thermal conduction will lead to
reduction of accretion and radial and azimuthal velocities as well as the
vertical thickness of the disk, which is slightly reduced. Moreover, the
surface density of the disk will increase when the thermal conduction becomes
important in the hot magnetized flow.
