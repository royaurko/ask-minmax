We show that solutions to certain higher-order intrinsic geometric flows on a
compact manifold, including some flows generated by the ambient obstruction
tensor, are unique. With the goal of providing a complete self-contained proof,
details surrounding map covariant derivatives and a careful application of the
DeTurck trick are provided.
