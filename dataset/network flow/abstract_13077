Let $(M, g)$ be a complete non-compact K\"ahler manifold with non-negative
and bounded holomorphic bisectional curvature. Extending our techniques
developed in \cite{CT3}, we prove that the universal cover $\wt M$ of $M$ is
biholomorphic to $\ce^n$ provided either that $(M, g)$ has average quadratic
curvature decay, or $M$ supports an eternal solution to the K\"ahler-Ricci flow
with non-negative and uniformly bounded holomorphic bisectional curvature. We
also classify certain local limits arising from the K\"ahler-Ricci flow in the
absence of uniform estimates on the injectivity radius.
