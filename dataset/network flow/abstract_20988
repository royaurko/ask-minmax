Load balancing by proactively offloading users onto small and otherwise
lightly-loaded cells is critical for tapping the potential of dense
heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs). Offloading has mostly been studied for
the downlink, where it is generally assumed that a user offloaded to a small
cell will communicate with it on the uplink as well. The impact of coupled
downlink-uplink offloading is not well understood. Uplink power control and
spatial interference correlation further complicate the mathematical analysis
as compared to the downlink. We propose an accurate and tractable model to
characterize the uplink SINR and rate distribution in a multi-tier HCN as a
function of the association rules and power control parameters. Joint
uplink-downlink rate coverage is also characterized. Using the developed
analysis, it is shown that the optimal degree of channel inversion (for uplink
power control) increases with load imbalance in the network. In sharp contrast
to the downlink, minimum path loss association is shown to be optimal for
uplink rate. Moreover, with minimum path loss association and full channel
inversion, uplink SIR is shown to be invariant of infrastructure density. It is
further shown that a decoupled association---employing differing association
strategies for uplink and downlink---leads to significant improvement in joint
uplink-downlink rate coverage over the standard coupled association in HCNs.
