This paper demonstrates the concept of using Heterogeneous networks (HetNets)
to improve Long Term Evolution (LTE) system by introducing the LTE Advance
(LTE-A). The type of HetNets that has been chosen for this study is Macro with
Pico cells. Comparing the system performance with and without Pico cells has
clearly illustrated using three well-known scheduling algorithms (Proportional
Fair PF, Maximum Largest Weighted Delay First MLWDF and
Exponential/Proportional Fair EXP/PF). The system is judged based on
throughput, Packet Loss Ratio PLR, delay and fairness.A simulation platform
called LTE-Sim has been used to collect the data and produce the paper outcomes
and graphs. The results prove that adding Pico cells enhances the overall
system performance. From the simulation outcomes, the overall system
performance is as follows: throughput is duplicated or tripled based on the
number of users, the PLR is almost quartered, the delay is nearly reduced ten
times (PF case) and changed to be a half (MLWDF/EXP cases), and the fairness
stays closer to value of 1. It is considered an efficient and cost effective
way to increase the throughput, coverage and reduce the latency.
