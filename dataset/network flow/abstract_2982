Recently it was found that helical magnetized flows efficiently amplify
Alfv\'en waves (Rogava et al. 2003, A&A, v.399, p.421). This robust and
manifold nonmodal effect was found to involve regimes of transient algebraic
growth (for purely ejectional flows), and exponential instabilities of both
usual and parametric nature. However the study was made in the incompressible
limit and an important question remained open - whether this amplification is
inherent to swirling MHD flows per se and what is the degree of its dependence
on the incompressibility condition. In this paper, in order to clear up this
important question, we consider full compressible spectrum of MHD modes:
Alfv\'en waves (AW), slow magnetosonic waves (SMW) and fast magnetosonic waves
(FMW). We find that helical flows inseparably blend these waves with each other
and make them unstable, creating the efficient energy transfer from the mean
flow to the waves. The possible role of these instabilities for the onset of
the MHD turbulence, self-heating of the flow and the overall dynamics of
astrophysical flows are discussed.
