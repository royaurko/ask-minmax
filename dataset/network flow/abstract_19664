Anomalous kinetics of infective (e.g., autocatalytic) reactions in open,
nonhyperbolic chaotic flows are important for many applications in biological,
chemical, and environmental sciences. We present a scaling theory for the
singular enhancement of the production caused by the universal, underlying
fractal patterns. The key dynamical invariant quantities are the effective
fractal dimension and effective escape rate, which are primarily determined by
the hyperbolic components of the underlying dynamical invariant sets. The
theory is general as it includes all previously studied hyperbolic reactive
dynamics as a special case. We introduce a class of dissipative embedding maps
for numerical verification.
