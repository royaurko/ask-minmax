It is often hypothesized that a crucial role for recurrent connections in the
brain is to constrain the set of possible response patterns, thereby shaping
the neural code. This implies the existence of neural codes that cannot arise
solely from feedforward processing. We set out to find such codes in the
context of one-layer feedforward networks, and identified a large class of
combinatorial codes that indeed cannot be shaped by the feedforward
architecture alone. However, these codes are difficult to distinguish from
codes that share the same sets of maximal activity patterns in the presence of
noise. When we coarsened the notion of combinatorial neural code to keep track
only of maximal patterns, we found the surprising result that all such codes
can in fact be realized by one-layer feedforward networks. This suggests that
recurrent or many-layer feedforward architectures are not necessary for shaping
the (coarse) combinatorial features of neural codes. In particular, it is not
possible to infer a computational role for recurrent connections from the
combinatorics of neural response patterns alone.
  Our proofs use mathematical tools from classical combinatorial topology, such
as the nerve lemma and the existence of an inverse nerve. An unexpected
corollary of our main result is that any prescribed (finite) homotopy type can
be realized by removing a polyhedron from the positive orthant of some
Euclidean space.
