The topological structure resulting from the network of contacts between
grains (contact network) is studied for very large samples of disorderly-packed
monosized spheres with densities ranging from 0.58 to 0.64. The hierarchical
organization of such a structure is studied by means of a topological map which
starts from a given sphere and moves outwards in concentric shells through the
contact network. We find that the topological density of disordered sphere
packing is larger than the topological density of equivalent lattice sphere
packings.
