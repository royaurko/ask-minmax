We show the short-time existence and uniqueness of solutions for the motion
of an evolving hypersurface in contact with a solid container driven by
volume-preserving mean curvature flow (MCF) taking line tension effects on the
boundary into account. Difficulties arise due to dynamic boundary conditions
and due to the contact angle and the non-local nature of the resulting second
order, nonlinear PDE. In addition, we prove the same result for the Willmore
flow with line tension, which results in a nonlinear PDE of fourth order. For
both flows we will use a Hanzawa transformation to write the flows as graphs
over a fixed reference hypersurface.
