Network coding has the potential to improve the overall throughput of a
network by combining different streams of data and forwarding them. In wireless
networks, the wireless channel provide an excellent medium for physical layer
network coding as signals from different transmitters are combined
automatically by the wireless channel. In such scenarios, it would be
interesting to investigate protocols and algorithms which can optimally relay
information. In this paper, we look at a four-node two-way or bidirectional
relay network, and propose a relay protocol which can relay information
efficiently in this network.
