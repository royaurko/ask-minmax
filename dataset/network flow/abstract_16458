We construct a new AdS_4 background in Type IIB supergravity by means of a
non-Abelian T-duality transformation on the Type IIA dual of ABJM. The analysis
of probe and particle-like branes suggests a dual CFT in which each of the
gauge groups is doubled. A common feature of non-Abelian T-duality is that in
the absence of any global information coming from String Theory it gives rise
to non-compact dual backgrounds, with coordinates living in the Lie algebra of
the Lie group involved in the dualization. In backgrounds with CFT duals this
poses obvious problems to the CFTs. In this paper we show that for the new
AdS_4 background the gauge groups of the associated dual CFT undergo a spectral
flow as the non-compact internal direction runs from 0 to infinity, which
resembles Seiberg duality in N=1. This phenomenon, very reminiscent of the
cascade, provides an interpretation in the CFT for the running of the
non-compact coordinate, and suggests that at the end of the flow the extra
charges disappear and the dual CFT is described by a 2-node quiver very similar
to ABJM, albeit with reduced supersymmetry.
