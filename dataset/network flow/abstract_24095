A new model for a cluster of hybrid sensors network with multi sub-clusters
is proposed. The model is in particular relevant to the early warning system in
a large scale monitoring system in, for example, a nuclear power plant. It
mainly addresses to a safety critical system which requires real-time processes
with high accuracy. The mathematical model is based on the extended
conventional search algorithm with certain interactions among the nearest
neighborhood of sensors. It is argued that the model could realize a highly
accurate decision support system with less number of parameters. A case of one
dimensional interaction function is discussed, and a simple algorithm for the
model is also given.
