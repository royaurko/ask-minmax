We present a kinematic study of the Herbig-Haro objects HH 202, 203 and 204
using Halpha and [NII] Fabry-Perot velocity maps. For HH 202 we find new
features that could belong to this HH object or that perhaps are associated
with an outflow different from HH 202. Because of its high velocity (up to 100
km/seg) this outflow probably can be a HH flow not catalogued previously. Large
internal motions are found in the fainter regions of HH 203-204, as well as
evidence of transverse density gradients. We show that the apex of HH 204 is
the zone of maximum velocity in agreement with bow shock models. From our
studies, we find kinematic evidence that suggests that HH 203-204 and HH 202
are part of a single and large (approx 0.55 pc) HH flow.
