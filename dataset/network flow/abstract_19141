Deployment of network/distributed systems sets high requirements for
procedures, tools and approaches for the complex testing of these systems. This
work provides a survey of testing activities with regard to these systems based
on standards and actual practices for both software-based and distribution
(network) aspects. On the basis of this survey, we determine formal testing
procedures/processes which cover these aspects, but which are not contrary to
both aspects. The next step, based on the analysis of the implementation phase
of System Development Life Cycle, determines a formal model for these processes
