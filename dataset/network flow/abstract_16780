We analyze the coherent dynamics of excitons in three dimensional
topologically disordered networks with traps. If the interactions between the
nodes of the network are long ranged, i.e., algebraically decaying as a
function of the distance between the nodes, the average survival probability of
an exciton surprisingly shows a characteristic decay with features similar to
the decay found for regular one-dimensional systems. We further show how this
decay can be related to the eigenstates of the same system without a trap.
