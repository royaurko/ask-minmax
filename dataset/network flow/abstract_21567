We propose a setup which allows to couple the electron spin degree of freedom
to the mechanical motions of a nanomechanical system not involving any of the
ferromagnetic components. The proposed method employs the strain induced
spin-orbit interaction of electrons in narrow gap semiconductors. We have shown
how this method can be used for detection and manipulation of the spin flow
through a suspended rod in a nanomechanical device.
