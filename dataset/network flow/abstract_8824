FlowPy is a numerical toolbox for the solution of partial differential
equations encountered in Functional Renormalization Group equations. This
toolbox compiles flow equations to fast machine code and is able to handle
coupled systems of flow equations with full momentum dependence, which
furthermore may be given implicitly.
