A full (3+1)-dimensional calculation using the Lagrangian hydrodynamics is
proposed for relativistic nuclear collisions. The calculation enables us to
evaluate anisotropic flow of hadronic matter which appears in non-central
and/or asymmetrical relativistic nuclear collisions. Applying hydrodynamical
calculations to the deformed uranium collisions at AGS energy region, we
discuss the nature of space-time structure and particle distributions in
detail.
