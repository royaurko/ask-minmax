We consider the stability of periodic gravity free-surface water waves
traveling downstream at a constant speed over a shear flow of finite depth. In
case the free surface is flat, a sharp criterion of linear instability is
established for a general class of shear flows with inflection points and the
maximal unstable wave number is found. Comparison to the rigid-wall setting
testifies that free surface has a destabilizing effect. For a class of unstable
shear flows, the bifurcation of nontrivial periodic traveling waves of
small-amplitude is demonstrated at any wave number. We show the linear
instability of small nontrivial waves bifurcated at an unstable wave number of
the background shear flow. The proof uses a new formulation of the linearized
water-wave problem and a perturbation argument. An example of the background
shear flow of unstable small-amplitude periodic traveling waves is constructed
for an arbitrary vorticity strength and for an arbitrary depth, illustrating
that vorticity has a subtle influence on the stability of water waves.
