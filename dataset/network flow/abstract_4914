Multi-commodity flows over time exhibit the non-intuitive property that
letting flow wait can allow us to send flow faster overall. Fleischer and
Skutella (IPCO~2002) show that the speed-up through storage is at most a factor
of~$2$, and that there are instances where the speed-up is as large as a factor
of~$4/3$. We close this gap by presenting a family of instances for which the
speed-up factor through storage converges to~$2$.
