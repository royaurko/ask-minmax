Could social media data aid in disaster response and damage assessment?
Countries face both an increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters
due to climate change. And during such events, citizens are turning to social
media platforms for disaster-related communication and information. Social
media improves situational awareness, facilitates dissemination of emergency
information, enables early warning systems, and helps coordinate relief
efforts. Additionally, spatiotemporal distribution of disaster-related messages
helps with real-time monitoring and assessment of the disaster itself. Here we
present a multiscale analysis of Twitter activity before, during, and after
Hurricane Sandy. We examine the online response of 50 metropolitan areas of the
United States and find a strong relationship between proximity to Sandy's path
and hurricane-related social media activity. We show that real and perceived
threats -- together with the physical disaster effects -- are directly
observable through the intensity and composition of Twitter's message stream.
We demonstrate that per-capita Twitter activity strongly correlates with the
per-capita economic damage inflicted by the hurricane. Our findings suggest
that massive online social networks can be used for rapid assessment
("nowcasting") of damage caused by a large-scale disaster.
