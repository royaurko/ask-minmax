Dileptons, as an electromagnetic probe, are crucial to study the properties
of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in heavy ion collisions. We calculated the
invariant mass spectra and the anisotropic emission of thermal dielectrons from
Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energy
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$~GeV based on EPOS3. This approach provides a realistic
(3+1)-dimensional event-by-event viscous hydrodynamic description of the
expanding hot and dense matter with a very particular initial condition, and a
large set of hadron data and direct photons (besides $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ !) can
be successfully reproduced. Thermal dilepton emission from both QGP phase and
the hadronic gas are considered, with the emission rates based on Lattice QCD
and a vector meson model, respectively. We find that the computed invariant
mass spectra (thermal contribution + STAR cocktail) can reproduce the measured
ones from STAR at different centralities. Different from other model
predictions, the obtained elliptic flow of thermal dileptons is larger than the
STAR measurement referring to all dileptons. A clear centrality dependence of
thermal dilepton occurs not only to elliptic flow $v_{2}$ but also to high
orders for centrality in 0-60\%. At a given centrality, $v_{n}$ of thermal
dileptons decreases neatly with $n$ for $2 \leq n \leq 5$.
