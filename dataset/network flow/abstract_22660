Recently, De Lellis and Sz\'ekelyhidi constructed H\"older continuous,
dissipative (weak) solutions to the incompressible Euler equations in the torus
$\mathbb T^3$. The construction consists in adding fast oscillations to the
trivial solution. We extend this result by establishing optimal h-principles in
two and three space dimensions. Specifically, we identify all subsolutions
(defined in a suitable sense) which can be approximated in the $H^{-1}$-norm by
exact solutions. Furthermore, we prove that the flows thus constructed on
$\mathbb T^3$ are genuinely three-dimensional and are not trivially obtained
from solutions on $\mathbb T^2$.
