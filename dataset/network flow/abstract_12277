FCC new regulation for cognitive use of the TV white space spectrum provides
a new means for improving traditional cellular network performance. But it also
introduces a number of technical challenges. This letter studies one of the
challenges, that is, given the significant differences in the propagation
property and the transmit power limitations between the cellular band and the
TV white space, how to jointly utilize both bands such that the benefit from
the TV white space for improving cellular network performance is maximized.
Both analytical and simulation results are provided.
