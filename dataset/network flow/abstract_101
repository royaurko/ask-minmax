This report provides a comprehensive complexity study of line switching in
the Linear DC model for the feasibility problem and the optimization problems
of maximizing the load that can be served (maximum switching flow, MSF) and
minimizing generation cost (optimal transmission switching, OTS). Our results
show that these problems are NP-complete and that there is no fully
polynomial-time approximation scheme for planar networks with a maximum-node
degree of 3. Additionally, we demonstrate that the problems are still NP-hard
if we restrict the network structure to cacti with a maximum degree of 3. We
also show that the optimization problems can not be approximated within any
constant factor.
