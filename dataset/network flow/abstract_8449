We consider critical phenomena on heterogeneous small-world networks having a
scale-free character but also arbitrary short-loops. After deriving the
self-consistent equation for the order parameter and the critical surface, we
prove that the critical behavior on complex networks is in fact infinitely
robust with respect to the presence of arbitrary short-loops.
