We report wide-range optical investigations on transparent conducting
networks made from separated (semiconducting, metallic) and reference (mixed)
single-walled carbon nanotubes, complemented by transport measurements.
Comparing the intrinsic frequency-dependent conductivity of the nanotubes with
that of the networks, we conclude that higher intrinsic conductivity results in
better transport properties, indicating that the properties of the nanotubes
are at least as much important as the contacts. We find that HNO3 doping offers
a larger improvement in transparent conductive quality than separation.
Spontaneous dedoping occurs in all samples but is most effective in films made
of doped metallic tubes, where the sheet conductance returns close to its
original value within 24 hours.
