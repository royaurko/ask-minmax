We study the detailed growth of a social networking site with full temporal
information by examining the creation process of each friendship relation that
can collectively lead to the macroscopic properties of the network. We first
study the reciprocal behavior of users, and find that link requests are quickly
responded to and that the distribution of reciprocation intervals decays in an
exponential form. The degrees of inviters/accepters are slightly negatively
correlative with reciprocation time. In addition, the temporal feature of the
online community shows that the distributions of intervals of user behaviors,
such as sending or accepting link requests, follow a power law with a universal
exponent, and peaks emerge for intervals of an integral day. We finally study
the preferential selection and linking phenomena of the social networking site
and find that, for the former, a linear preference holds for preferential
sending and reception, and for the latter, a linear preference also holds for
preferential acceptance, creation, and attachment. Based on the linearly
preferential linking, we put forward an analyzable network model which can
reproduce the degree distribution of the network. The research framework
presented in the paper could provide a potential insight into how the
micro-motives of users lead to the global structure of online social networks.
