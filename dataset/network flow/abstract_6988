We investigate the interaction of thermonuclear flames in Type Ia supernova
explosions with vortical flows by means of numerical simulations. In our study,
we focus on small scales, where the flame propagation is no longer dominated by
the turbulent cascade originating from large-scale effects. Here, the flame
propagation proceeds in the cellular burning regime, resulting from a balance
between the Landau-Darrieus instability and its nonlinear stabilization. The
interaction of a cellularly stabilized flame front with a vortical fuel flow is
explored applying a variety of fuel densities and strengths of the velocity
fluctuations. We find that the vortical flow can break up the cellular flame
structure if it is sufficiently strong. In this case the flame structure adapts
to the imprinted flow field. The transition from the cellularly stabilized
front to the flame structure dominated by vortices of the flow proceeds in a
smooth way. The implications of the results of our simulations for Type Ia
Supernova explosion models are discussed.
