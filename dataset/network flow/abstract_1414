We consider the quantitative group testing problem where the objective is to
identify defective items in a given population based on results of tests
performed on subsets of the population. Under the quantitative group testing
model, the result of each test reveals the number of defective items in the
tested group. The minimum number of tests achievable by nested test plans was
established by Aigner and Schughart in 1985 within a minimax framework. The
optimal nested test plan offering this performance, however, was not obtained.
In this work, we establish the optimal nested test plan in closed form. This
optimal nested test plan is also asymptotically (as the population size grows
to infinity) optimal among all test plans. We then focus on the application of
heavy hitter detection problem for traffic monitoring and anomaly detection in
the Internet and other communication networks. For such applications, it is
often the case that a few abnormal traffic flows with exceptionally high volume
(referred to as heavy hitters) make up most of the traffic seen by the entire
network. Since the volume of heavy hitters is much higher than that of normal
flows, the number of heavy hitters in a group of flows can be accurately
estimated from the aggregated traffic load. Other potential applications
include detecting idle channels in the radio spectrum in the high SNR regime.
