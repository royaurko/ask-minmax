In this paper, we present analytical study of routing overhead of reactive
routing protocols for Wireless Multihop Networks (WMhNs). To accomplish the
framework of generalized routing overhead, we choose Ad-Hoc on Demand Distance
Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Dynamic MANET on Demand (DYMO).
Considering basic themes of these protocols, we enhance the generalized network
models by adding route monitoring overhead. Later, we take different network
parameters and produce framework discussing the impact of variations of these
parameters in network and routing performance. In the second part of our work,
we simulate above mentioned routing protocols and give a brief discussion and
comparison about the environments where these routing protocols perform better.
