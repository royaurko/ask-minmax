The eigenvalue spectrum of the transition matrix of a network encodes
important information about its structural and dynamical properties. We study
the transition matrix of a family of fractal scale-free networks and
analytically determine all the eigenvalues and their degeneracies. We then use
these eigenvalues to evaluate the closed-form solution to the eigentime for
random walks on the networks under consideration. Through the connection
between the spectrum of transition matrix and the number of spanning trees, we
corroborate the obtained eigenvalues and their multiplicities.
