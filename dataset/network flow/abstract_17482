We address a model for adhesive unilateral frictionless Signorini-type
contact between bodies of heat-conductive viscoelastic material, in the linear
Kelvin-Voigt rheology, undergoing thermal expansion. The flow-rule for
debonding the adhesion is considered rate-independent and unidirectional, and a
thermodynamically consistent model is derived and analysed as far as the
existence of a weak solution is concerned.
