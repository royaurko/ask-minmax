We investigate the economics of internet of things (IoT). An economic model
of IoT consists of end users, advertisers and three different kinds of
providers. We model different kinds of interaction among the providers as a
combination of sequential and parallel non-cooperative games. We characterize
the equilibrium pricing strategy and payoff of providers and corresponding
demands of end users in each such setting. We quantify the impact of
advertising revenue on the equilibrium pricing and demands, and compare the
payoffs and demands for different interaction models.
