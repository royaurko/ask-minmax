Wireless networking has become very popular in recent years due to the
increase in adoption of mobile devices. As more and more employees demand for
Wi-Fi access for their devices, more companies have been jumping onto the
"Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) bandwagon[1] to appease their employees. One
such example of an enterprise wireless infrastructure is the George Washington
University's GWireless.
  For this project, I will attempt to capture hashes of authentication
credentials from users who are connecting to the GWireless network using what
is commonly known as the "evil twin" attack. I will document the hardware,
software used and steps taken to configure the devices. I will then evaluate
the feasibility of such an attack, explore variations of the attack and
document measures that can be taken to prevent such an attack.
