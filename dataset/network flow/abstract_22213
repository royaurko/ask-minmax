The key findings of classical population genetics are derived using a
framework based on information theory using the entropies of the allele
frequency distribution as a basis. The common results for drift, mutation,
selection, and gene flow will be rewritten both in terms of information
theoretic measurements and used to draw the classic conclusions for balance
conditions and common features of one locus dynamics. Linkage disequilibrium
will also be discussed including the relationship between mutual information
and r^2 and a simple model of hitchhiking.
