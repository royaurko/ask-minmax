In this paper we proceed with investigation of connections between Fokker -
Planck equation and continuum mechanics. We base upon expressions from our work
[2], based upon the spectral decomposition of Fokker - Planck equation
solution. In this decomposition we preserve only terms with the smallest
degrees of damping. We find, that macroscopic parameters of Fokker-Planck
flows, obtained in this way, satisfy the set of conservation laws of classic
hydrodynamics. The expression for stresses (30) contains additional term - this
term is negligible in big times limit. We proved also, that the velocities
field alone satisfy Burgers equation without mass forces - but with some
additional term. This term is also negligible in big times limit. For the zero
degree theory, considered in [1], there are no additional terms. But this
theory is valid only for the potential velocities field, fully deductible from
density - the potential is proportional to density logarithm. In this theory we
can not specify initial conditions for velocities independently from density.
Taking in account of the next degree terms could partly solve this problem, but
result in some loss of exactness.
