Spectral graph theory-based methods represent an important class of tools for
studying the structure of networks. Spectral methods are based on a first-order
Markov chain derived from a random walk on the graph and thus they cannot take
advantage of important higher-order network substructures such as triangles,
cycles, and feed-forward loops. Here we propose a Tensor Spectral Clustering
(TSC) algorithm that allows for modeling higher-order network structures in a
graph partitioning framework. Our TSC algorithm allows the user to specify
which higher-order network structures (cycles, feed-forward loops, etc.) should
be preserved by the network clustering. Higher-order network structures of
interest are represented using a tensor, which we then partition by developing
a multilinear spectral method. Our framework can be applied to discovering
layered flows in networks as well as graph anomaly detection, which we
illustrate on synthetic networks. In directed networks, a higher-order
structure of particular interest is the directed 3-cycle, which captures
feedback loops in networks. We demonstrate that our TSC algorithm produces
large partitions that cut fewer directed 3-cycles than standard spectral
clustering algorithms.
