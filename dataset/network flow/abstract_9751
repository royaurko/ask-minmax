A reflection of our ultimate understanding of a complex system is our ability
to control its behavior. Typically, control has multiple prerequisites: It
requires an accurate map of the network that governs the interactions between
the system's components, a quantitative description of the dynamical laws that
govern the temporal behavior of each component, and an ability to influence the
state and temporal behavior of a selected subset of the components. With deep
roots in nonlinear dynamics and control theory, notions of control and
controllability have taken a new life recently in the study of complex
networks, inspiring several fundamental questions: What are the control
principles of complex systems? How do networks organize themselves to balance
control with functionality? To address these here we review recent advances on
the controllability and the control of complex networks, exploring the
intricate interplay between a system's structure, captured by its network
topology, and the dynamical laws that govern the interactions between the
components. We match the pertinent mathematical results with empirical findings
and applications. We show that uncovering the control principles of complex
systems can help us explore and ultimately understand the fundamental laws that
govern their behavior.
