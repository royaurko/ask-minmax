By analysing the financial data of firms across Japan, a nonlinear power law
with an exponent of 1.3 was observed between the number of business partners
(i.e. the degree of the inter-firm trading network) and sales. In a previous
study using numerical simulations, we found that this scaling can be explained
by both the money-transport model, where a firm (i.e. customer) distributes
money to its out-edges (suppliers) in proportion to the in-degree of
destinations, and by the correlations among the Japanese inter-firm trading
network. However, in this previous study, we could not specifically identify
what types of structure properties (or correlations) of the network determine
the 1.3 exponent. In the present study, we more clearly elucidate the
relationship between this nonlinear scaling and the network structure by
applying mean-field approximation of the diffusion in a complex network to this
money-transport model. Using theoretical analysis, we obtained the mean-field
solution of the model and found that, in the case of the Japanese firms, the
scaling exponent of 1.3 can be determined from the power law of the average
degree of the nearest neighbours of the network with an exponent of -0.7.
