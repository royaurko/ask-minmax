In this paper, we first discuss some connections between template theory and
the description of basic sets of Smale flows on 3-manifolds due to F. B\'eguin
and C. Bonatti. The main tools we use are symbolic dynamics, template moves and
some combinatorial surgeries. Second, we obtain some relationship between the
surgeries and the number of $S^1 \times S^2$ factors of $M$ for a nonsingular
Smale flow on a given closed orientable 3-manifold $M$. Besides these, we also
prove that any template $T$ can model a basic set $\Lambda$ of a nonsingular
Smale flow on $nS^1 \times S^2$ for some positive integer $n$.
