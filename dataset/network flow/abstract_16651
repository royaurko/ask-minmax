In performance analysis and design of communication netword modeling data
traffic is important. With introduction of new applications, the
characteristics of the data traffic changes. We present a brief review the
different models of data traffic and how they have evolved. We present results
of data traffic analysis and simulated traffic, which demonstrates that the
packet train model fits the traffic at source destination level and long-memory
(self-similar) model fits the traffic at the aggregate level.
