Partially invariant solution to (2+1)D shallow water equation is constructed
and investigated. The solution describes an extension of a stripe, bounded by
linear source and drain of fluid. Realizations of smooth flow and of hydraulic
jump are possible. Particle trajectories and sonic characteristics on the
obtained solution are calculated.
