We propose a continuum model for the degree distribution of directed networks
in free and open-source software. The degree distributions of links in both the
in-directed and out-directed dependency networks follow Zipf's law for the
intermediate nodes, but the heavily linked nodes and the poorly linked nodes
deviate from this trend and exhibit finite-size effects. The finite-size
parameters make a quantitative distinction between the in-directed and
out-directed networks. For the out-degree distribution, the initial condition
for a dynamic evolution corresponds to the limiting count of the most heavily
liked nodes that the out-directed network can finally have. The number of nodes
contributing out-directed links grows with every generation of software
release, but this growth ultimately saturates towards a terminal value due to
the finiteness of semantic possibilities in the network.
