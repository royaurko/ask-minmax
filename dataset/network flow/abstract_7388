The role of turbulence in a spherically symmetric accreting system has been
studied on very large spatial scales of the system. This is also a highly
subsonic flow region and here the accreting fluid has been treated as nearly
incompressible. It has been shown here that the coupling of the mean flow and
the turbulent fluctuations, gives rise to a scaling relation for an effective
"turbulent viscosity". This in turn leads to a dynamic scaling for sound
propagation in the accretion process. As a consequence of this scaling, the
sonic horizon of the transonic inflow solution is shifted inwards, in
comparison with the inviscid flow.
