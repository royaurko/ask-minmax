Despite intensive research in the area of network connectivity, there is an
important category of problems that remain unsolved: how to measure the quality
of connectivity of a wireless multi-hop network which has a realistic number of
nodes, not necessarily large enough to warrant the use of asymptotic analysis,
and has unreliable connections, reflecting the inherent unreliable
characteristics of wireless communications? The quality of connectivity
measures how easily and reliably a packet sent by a node can reach another
node. It complements the use of \emph{capacity} to measure the quality of a
network in saturated traffic scenarios and provides a native measure of the
quality of (end-to-end) network connections. In this paper, we explore the use
of probabilistic connectivity matrix as a possible tool to measure the quality
of network connectivity. Some interesting properties of the probabilistic
connectivity matrix and their connections to the quality of connectivity are
demonstrated. We argue that the largest eigenvalue of the probabilistic
connectivity matrix can serve as a good measure of the quality of network
connectivity.
