Recent work has proposed the use of a composite hypothesis Hoeffding test for
statistical anomaly detection. Setting an appropriate threshold for the test
given a desired false alarm probability involves approximating the false alarm
probability. To that end, a large deviations asymptotic is typically used
which, however, often results in an inaccurate setting of the threshold,
especially for relatively small sample sizes. This, in turn, results in an
anomaly detection test that does not control well for false alarms. In this
paper, we develop a tighter approximation using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
under Markovian assumptions. We apply our result to a network anomaly detection
application and demonstrate its advantages over earlier work.
