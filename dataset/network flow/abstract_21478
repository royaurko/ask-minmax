The moment of inertia Q of a trapped superfluid gas of atomic Fermions (6Li)
is calculated as a function of the temperature. At zero temperature the moment
of inertia takes on the irrotational flow value. Only for T very close to Tc
rigid rotation is attained. It is proposed that future measurements of the
rotational energy will unambiguously reveal whether the system is in a
superfluid state or not.
