In recent times Massive Multiplayer Online Game has appeared as a computer
game that enables hundreds of players from all parts of the world to interact
in a game world (common platform) at the same time instance. Current
architecture used for MMOGs based on the classic tightly coupled distributed
system. While, MMOGs are getting more interactive same time number of
interacting users is increasing, classic implementation architecture may raise
scalability and interdependence issues. This requires a loosely coupled service
oriented architecture to support evolution in MMOG application. Data flow
architecture, Event driven architecture and client server architecture are
basic date orchestration approaches used by any service oriented architecture.
Real time service is hottest issue for service oriented architecture. The basic
requirement of any real time service oriented architecture is to ensure the
quality of service. In this paper we have proposed a service oriented
architecture for massive multiplayer online game and a specific middleware
(based on open source DDS) in MMOGs for fulfilling real time constraints.
