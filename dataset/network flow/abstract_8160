We obtain the general forms for the current density and the vorticity from
the integrability conditions of the basic equations which govern the stationary
states of axisymmetric magnetized self-gravitating barotropic objects with
meridional flows under the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation. As
seen from the stationary condition equations for such bodies, the presence of
the meridional flows and that of the poloidal magnetic fields act oppositely on
the internal structures.
  The different actions of these two physical quantities, the meridional flows
and the poloidal magnetic fields, could be clearly seen through stationary
structures of the toroidal gaseous configurations around central point masses
in the framework of Newtonian gravity because the effects of the two physical
quantities can be seen in an amplified way for toroidal systems compared to
those for spheroidal stars. The meridional flows make the structures more
compact, i.e. the widths of toroids thinner, while the poloidal magnetic fields
are apt to elongate the density contours in a certain direction depending on
the situation. Therefore, the simultaneous presence of the internal flows and
the magnetic fields would work as if there were no such different actions
within and around the stationary gaseous objects such as axisymmetric
magnetized toroids with internal motions around central compact objects under
the ideal MHD approximation, although these two quantities might exist in real
systems.
