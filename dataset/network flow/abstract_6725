Cellular networks are now rapidly evolving to the renewable heterogeneous
network (HetNet) architectures, where a mixture of macro base stations (BSs)
and small cell BSs coexist. Particularly, these BSs are partly-powered or
self-powered by renewable energy sources (RES). In this context, joint user
association and resource allocation is challenging. In addition, wireless
backhaul is rapidly becoming a reality for small cells, which generally has
significantly less bandwidth and larger delay. Thus, the limited backhaul
becomes a crucial constraint. In this paper, with the goal of maximizing the
network utility, the backhaul-aware user association and resource allocation is
jointly considered for energy constrained HetNets. Based on the complementary
slackness property, BSs' efficient and meaningful resource allocation is
achieved, and then a distributed user association algorithm is proposed.
Furthermore, a virtual scheme, which is based on network function
virtualization (NFV) and software-designed networking (SDN), is developed.
Simulation results demonstrate the improvement on network utility and load
balancing with the proposed algorithm.
