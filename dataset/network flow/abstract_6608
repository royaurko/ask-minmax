The Long Term Evolution (LTE) broadcast is a promising solution to cope with
exponentially increasing user traffic by broadcasting common user requests over
the same frequency channels. In this paper, we propose a novel network
framework provisioning broadcast and unicast services simultaneously. For each
serving file to users, a cellular base station determines either to broadcast
or unicast the file based on user demand prediction examining the file's
content specific characteristics such as: file size, delay tolerance, price
sensitivity. In a network operator's revenue maximization perspective while not
inflicting any user payoff degradation, we jointly optimize resource
allocation, pricing, and file scheduling. In accordance with the state of the
art LTE specifications, the proposed network demonstrates up to 32% increase in
revenue for a single cell and more than a 7-fold increase for a 7 cell
coordinated LTE broadcast network, compared to the conventional unicast
cellular networks.
