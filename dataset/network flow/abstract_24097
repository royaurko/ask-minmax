We obtain revenue guarantees for the simple pricing mechanism of a single
posted price, in terms of a natural parameter of the distribution of buyers'
valuations. Our revenue guarantee applies to the single item n buyers setting,
with values drawn from an arbitrary joint distribution. Specifically, we show
that a single price drawn from the distribution of the maximum valuation Vmax =
max {V_1, V_2, ...,V_n} achieves a revenue of at least a 1/e fraction of the
geometric expecation of Vmax. This generic bound is a measure of how revenue
improves/degrades as a function of the concentration/spread of Vmax.
  We further show that in absence of buyers' valuation distributions,
recruiting an additional set of identical bidders will yield a similar
guarantee on revenue. Finally, our bound also gives a measure of the extent to
which one can simultaneously approximate welfare and revenue in terms of the
concentration/spread of Vmax.
