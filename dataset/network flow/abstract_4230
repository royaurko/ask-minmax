There are diverse mechanisms driving the evolution of social networks. A key
open question dealing with understanding their evolution is: How various
preferential linking mechanisms produce networks with different features? In
this paper we first empirically study preferential linking phenomena in an
evolving online social network, find and validate the linear preference. We
propose an analyzable model which captures the real growth process of the
network and reveals the underlying mechanism dominating its evolution.
Furthermore based on preferential linking we propose a generalized model
reproducing the evolution of online social networks, present unified analytical
results describing network characteristics for 27 preference scenarios, and
explore the relation between preferential linking mechanism and network
features. We find that within the framework of preferential linking analytical
degree distributions can only be the combinations of finite kinds of functions
which are related to rational, logarithmic and inverse tangent functions, and
extremely complex network structure will emerge even for very simple sublinear
preferential linking. This work not only provides a verifiable origin for the
emergence of various network characteristics in social networks, but bridges
the micro individuals' behaviors and the global organization of social
networks.
