A distributed spiral algorithm for distributed optimization in WSN is
proposed. By forming a spiral-shape message passing scheme among clusters,
without loss of estimation accuracy and convergence speed, the algorithm is
proved to converge with a lower total transport cost than the distributed
in-cluster algorithm.
