In this letter, we study some evolution networks that grow with linear
preferential attachment. Based upon some recent results on the quotient Gamma
function, we give a rigorous proof of the asymptotic Mandelbrot law for the
degree distribution $p_k \propto (k + c)^{-\gamma}$ in certain conditions. We
also analytically derive the best fitting values for the scaling exponent
$\gamma$ and the shifting coefficient $c$.
