We study the effects of low-$p_T$ collective flow on radiative energy loss
from high-$p_T$ partons traversing the QCD medium created in high-energy
nucleus-nucleus collisions. We illustrate this idea through three examples. Due
to longitudinal flow, jet profiles at the LHC present marked asymmetries in the
$\eta\times \phi$-plane, and widths in $\eta$ and $\phi$ of particle
distributions associated with a high-$p_T$ trigger at RHIC become different.
Finally, transverse flow implies an increase of high-$p_T$ $v_2$ at RHIC.
