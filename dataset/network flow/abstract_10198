The mean rate of energy dissipation in turbulence is traditionally assumed to
scale with parameters of the energy-containing large scales, i.e., the
root-mean-square fluctuation of the longitudinal velocity u and its correlation
length L(u). However, the resultant scaling coefficient C(u) is known to depend
on the large-scale configuration of the flow. We define the correlation length
L(u2) of the local energy u2, study the scaling coefficient C(u2) with
experimental data of several flows, and find a possibility that C(u2) does not
depend on the flow configuration. Not L(u) but rather L(u2) could scale with
the typical size of the energy-containing eddies, so that L(u2) determines the
mean rate at which the energy is transferred from those eddies to the smaller
eddies and is eventually dissipated into heat. The independence from the flow
configuration is also found for the two-point correlations and so on if L(u2)
is used to normalize the scale.
