In this paper we prove approximation properties of the solutions of the
defoucsing NLS equation on the circle by nearly linear flows. In addition we
show that spatially periodic solutions of the defocusing NLS equation evolving
in fractional Sobolev spaces $H^s$ with $s\geq 1$ remain bounded for all times.
