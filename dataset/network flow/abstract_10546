Performance and reliability of content access in mobile networks is
conditioned by the number and location of content replicas deployed at the
network nodes. Facility location theory has been the traditional, centralized
approach to study content replication: computing the number and placement of
replicas in a network can be cast as an uncapacitated facility location
problem. The endeavour of this work is to design a distributed, lightweight
solution to the above joint optimization problem, while taking into account the
network dynamics. In particular, we devise a mechanism that lets nodes share
the burden of storing and providing content, so as to achieve load balancing,
and decide whether to replicate or drop the information so as to adapt to a
dynamic content demand and time-varying topology. We evaluate our mechanism
through simulation, by exploring a wide range of settings and studying
realistic content access mechanisms that go beyond the traditional
assumptionmatching demand points to their closest content replica. Results show
that our mechanism, which uses local measurements only, is: (i) extremely
precise in approximating an optimal solution to content placement and
replication; (ii) robust against network mobility; (iii) flexible in
accommodating various content access patterns, including variation in time and
space of the content demand.
