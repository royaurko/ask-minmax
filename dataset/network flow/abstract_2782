Authors compare different ways of selecting change agents within network
analysis paradigm and propose a new algorithm of doing so. All methods are
evaluated against network coverage measure that calculates how many network
members can be directly reached by selected nodes. Results from the analysis of
organizational network show that compared to other methods the proposed
algorithm provides better network coverage, at the same time selecting change
agents that are well connected, influential opinion leaders.
