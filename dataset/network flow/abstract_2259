The conventional wisdom is that social networks exhibit an assortative mixing
pattern, whereas biological and technological networks show a disassortative
mixing pattern. However, the recent research on the online social networks
modifies the widespread belief, and many online social networks show a
disassortative or neutral mixing feature. Especially, we found that an online
social network, Wealink, underwent a transition from degree assortativity
characteristic of real social networks to degree disassortativity
characteristic of many online social networks, and the transition can be
reasonably elucidated by a simple network model that we propose. The relations
among network assortativity, clustering, and modularity are also discussed in
the paper.
