We show how to compute real space renormalization group flows in lattice
field theory by a self-consistent method. In each step, the integration over
the fluctuation field (high frequency components of the field) is performed by
a saddle point method. The saddle point depends on the block-spin. Higher
powers of derivatives of the field are neglected in the actions, but no
polynomial approximation in the field is made. The flow preserves a simple
parameterization of the action. In this paper we treat scalar field theories as
an example.
