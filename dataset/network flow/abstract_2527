There have been several approaches to provisioning traffic between core
network nodes in Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. Such approaches aim
to minimize network delay, increase network capacity, and enhance network
security services. MATE (Multipath Adaptive Traffic Engineering) protocol has
been proposed for multipath adaptive traffic engineering between an ingress
node (source) and an egress node (destination). Its novel idea is to avoid
network congestion and attacks that might exist in edge and node disjoint paths
between two core network nodes.
  This paper builds an adaptive, robust, and reliable traffic engineering
scheme for better performance of communication network operations. This will
also provision quality of service (QoS) and protection of traffic engineering
to maximize network efficiency. Specifically, we present a new approach, S-MATE
(secure MATE) is developed to protect the network traffic between two core
nodes (routers or switches) in a cloud network. S-MATE secures against a single
link attack/failure by adding redundancy in one of the operational paths
between the sender and receiver. The proposed scheme can be built to secure
core networks such as optical and IP networks.
