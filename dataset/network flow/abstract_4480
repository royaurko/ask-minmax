The interaction of distinct units in physical, social, biological and
technological systems naturally gives rise to complex network structures.
Networks have constantly been in the focus of research for the last decade,
with considerable advances in the description of their structural and dynamical
properties. However, much less effort has been devoted to studying the
controllability of the dynamics taking place on them. Here we introduce and
evaluate a dynamical process defined on the edges of a network, and demonstrate
that the controllability properties of this process significantly differ from
simple nodal dynamics. Evaluation of real-world networks indicates that most of
them are more controllable than their randomized counterparts. We also find
that transcriptional regulatory networks are particularly easy to control.
Analytic calculations show that networks with scale-free degree distributions
have better controllability properties than uncorrelated networks, and
positively correlated in- and out-degrees enhance the controllability of the
proposed dynamics.
