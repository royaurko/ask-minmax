Glauber dynamics is a powerful tool to generate randomized, approximate
solutions to combinatorially difficult problems. Applications include Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and distributed scheduling for wireless
networks. In this paper, we derive bounds on the mixing time of a
generalization of Glauber dynamics where multiple vertices are allowed to
update their states in parallel and the fugacity of each vertex can be
different. The results can be used to obtain various conditions on the system
parameters such as fugacities, vertex degrees and update probabilities, under
which the mixing time grows polynomially in the number of vertices.
