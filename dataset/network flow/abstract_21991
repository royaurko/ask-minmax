We consider a suspension of polarizable particles under the action of
traveling wave dielectrophoresis (DEP) and focus on particle induced effects.
In a situation where the particles are driven by the DEP force, but no external
forces are exerted on the fluid, the joint motion of the particles can induce a
steady fluid flow, which leads to particle entrapment. This feedback effect is
proven to be non-negligible even for small volume concentration of particles.
