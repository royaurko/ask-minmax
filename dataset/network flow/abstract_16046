In this work, we propose a fast, robust and scalable method for retrieving
and analyzing recurring patterns of activity induced by a causal process,
typically modeled as time series on a graph. We introduce a particular type of
multilayer graph as a model for the data. This graph is structured for
emphasizing causal relations between connected nodes and their successive time
series values. Within the data, the patterns of activity are assumed to be
dynamic, sparse or small compared to the size of the network. For some
applications they are also expected to appear in a repeated manner over time
but are allowed to differ from an exact copy. The analysis of the activity
within a social network and within a transportation network illustrates the
power and efficiency of the method. Relevant information can be extracted,
giving insights on the behavior of group of persons in social networks and on
traffic congestion patterns. Moreover, in this era of big data, it is crucial
to design tools able to handle large datasets. Our approach scales linearly
with the dataset size and is implemented in a parallel manner. By leveraging a
state-of-the-art data analytics framework, our implementation can be
distributed on clusters of computers and easily handles millions of nodes on a
single commodity server.
