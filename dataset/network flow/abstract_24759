Let $A$ be a finite set and $n \geq 2$. This paper introduces the concept of
universal simulation in the context of semigroups of transformations of $A^n$,
also known as finite state-homogeneous automata networks. For $m \geq n$, a
transformation of $A^m$ is defined as $n$-universal of size $m$ if it may
simulate every transformation of $A^n$ by updating one coordinate (or register)
at a time. Using tools from memoryless computation, it is established that
there is no $n$-universal transformation of size $n$, but there is such a
transformation of size $n+2$. An $n$-universal transformation is defined as
complete if it may sequentially simulate every finite sequence of
transformations of $A^n$; in this case, minimal examples and bounds for the
size and time of simulation are determined. It is also shown that there is no
$n$-universal transformation that updates all the registers in parallel, but
that there exists a complete one that updates all but one register in parallel.
This illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of parallel models of
computation, such as cellular automata.
