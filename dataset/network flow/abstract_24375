Consider $n$ source-destination pairs randomly located in a shared wireless
medium, resulting in interference between different transmissions. All wireless
links are modeled by independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
variables, indicating that the dominant channel effect is the random fading
phenomenon. We characterize the throughput of one-hop communication in such
network. First, we present a closed-form expression for throughput scaling of a
heuristic strategy, for a completely general channel power distribution. This
heuristic strategy is based on activating the source-destination pairs with the
best direct links, and forcing the others to be silent. Then, we present the
results for several common examples, namely, Gamma (Nakagami-$m$ fading),
Weibull, Pareto, and Log-normal channel power distributions. Finally -- by
proposing an upper bound on throughput of all possible strategies for
super-exponential distributions -- we prove that the aforementioned heuristic
method is order-optimal for Nakagami-$m$ fading.
