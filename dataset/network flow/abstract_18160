The role of competition and monetary benefits in the design of Content
Delivery Networks (CDNs) is largely an unexplored area. In this paper, we
investigate the effect of competition among the competitive web based CDNs and
show that little difference in their performance may cause significant
financial gain/loss. It turns out that the economy of scale effect is very
significant for the success of a CDN in a competitive market. So CDN peering
might be a good idea. Since performance and conforming to the service level
agreement (SLA) with content providers is very important, we then focus on
designing CDN from this perspective. We provide an asymptotically optimal
static request routing policy for a CDN under a model where a CDN company
guarantees a certain level of user latency to the content providers in the SLA.
