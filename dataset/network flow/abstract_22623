We consider the energy-critical Schroedinger map initial value problem with
smooth initial data from R^2 into the sphere S^2. Given sufficiently
energy-dispersed data with subthreshold energy, we prove that the system admits
a unique global smooth solution. This improves earlier analogous conditional
results. The key behind this improvement lies in exploiting estimates on the
commutator of the Schroedinger map and harmonic map heat flows.
