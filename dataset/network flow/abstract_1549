The temporal variations of the rotation rate in the solar interior are
studied using frequency splittings from Global Oscillations Network Group
(GONG) data obtained during the period 1995-99. We find alternating latitudinal
bands of faster and slower rotation which appear to move towards the equator
with time - similar to the torsional oscillations seen at the solar surface.
This flow pattern appears to persist to a depth of about 0.1R_sun and in this
region its magnitude is well correlated with solar activity indices. We do not
find any periodic or systematic changes in the rotation rate near the base of
the convection zone.
