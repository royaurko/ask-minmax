We extend the usual treatment of two-particle momentum correlations to
include the possibility of non-chaotic or correlated particle emission from the
hadronic freeze-out surface in heavy-ion collisions. We adopt a modified
two-particle emission density which permits the description of nontrivial
differences between pair autocorrelations for different pair types. If
different pair types sample nuclear radial or Hubble flow in different ways we
predict a unique signature in two-particle momentum distributions. Analysis of
such effects may provide detailed information on the small-scale structure of
the freeze-out surface.
