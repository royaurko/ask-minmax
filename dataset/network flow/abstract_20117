In the recent paper by Bernardini et al. [J. Comput. Phys. 232 (2013), 1-6]
the discrepancy in the performance of finite difference and spectral models for
simulations of flows with a preferential direction of propagation was studied.
In a simplified investigation carried out using the viscous Burgers equation
the contributors attributed the poorer numerical results of finite difference models
to a violation of Galilean invariance in the discretization and propose to
carry out the computations in a reference frame moving with the bulk velocity
of the flow. Here we further discuss this problem and relate it to known
results on invariant discretization schemes. Non-invariant and invariant finite
difference discretizations of Burgers equation are proposed and compared with
the discretization using the remedy proposed by Bernardini et al..
