We introduce an algorithm for the reduction of computer generated atomistic
polymer samples to networks of primitive paths. By examining network ensembles
of Polyethylene and cis-1,4 Polybutadiene melts, we quantify the underlying
topologies through the radial distribution function of entanglements and the
distribution of the number of monomers between entanglements. A suitable
scaling of acquired data leads to a unifying microscopic topological
description of both melts.
