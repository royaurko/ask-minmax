Small-cell networks have been proposed to meet the demand of ever growing
mobile data traffic. One of the prominent challenges faced by small-cell
networks is the lack of sufficient backhaul capacity to connect small-cell base
stations (small-BSs) to the core network. We exploit the effective application
layer semantics of both spatial and temporal locality to reduce the backhaul
traffic. Specifically, small-BSs are equipped with storage facility to cache
contents requested by users. As the {\em cache hit ratio} increases, most of
the users' requests can be satisfied locally without incurring traffic over the
backhaul. To make informed caching decisions, the mobility patterns of users
must be carefully considered as users might frequently migrate from one small
cell to another. We study the issue of mobility-aware content caching, which is
formulated into an optimization problem with the objective to maximize the
caching utility. As the problem is NP-complete, we develop a polynomial-time
heuristic solution termed {\em MobiCacher} with bounded approximation ratio. We
also conduct trace-based simulations to evaluate the performance of {\em
MobiCacher}, which show that {\em MobiCacher} yields better caching utility
than existing solutions.
