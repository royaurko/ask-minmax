Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are widely used by GSM and UMTS carriers
with the aim of evaluating the network performance and the Quality of Service
(QoS) delivered to users. TETRA networks are basically designed to provide
telecommunication services to Public Safety & Security (PSS) organizations,
thus the compliance of the QoS levels required by these clients is usually
critical. Despite that, the use of KPIs to assess the network performance and
the QoS achieved in TETRA systems is not very common. This paper not only
states the need of monitoring and evaluating these parameters, but also
introduces a set of KPIs which is considered necessary and sufficient in order
to allow TETRA operators to be aware of whether provided services meet the QoS
requirements established by end users.
