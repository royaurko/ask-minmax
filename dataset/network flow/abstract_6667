Different graph generalizations have been recently used in an ad-hoc manner
to represent multilayer networks, i.e. systems formed by distinct layers where
each layer can be seen as a network. Similar constructions have also been used
to represent time-varying networks. We introduce the concept of MultiAspect
Graph (MAG) as a graph generalization that we prove to be isomorphic to a
directed graph, and also capable of representing all these previous
generalizations. In our proposal, the set of vertices, layers, time instants,
or any other independent feature is considered as an aspect of the MAG. For
instance, a MAG is able to represent multilayer or time-varying networks, while
both concepts can also be combined to represent a multilayer time-varying
network. Since the MAG structure admits an arbitrary (finite) number of
aspects, it hence introduces a powerful modelling abstraction for networked
complex systems. This paper formalizes the concept of MAG and then derives
theoretical results that can be useful in the analysis of complex networked
systems modelled using the proposed MAG abstraction.
