In this paper we present the application of a novel methodology to scientific
citation and collaboration networks. This methodology is designed for
understanding the governing dynamics of evolving networks and relies on an
attachment kernel, a scalar function of node properties, which stochastically
drives the addition and deletion of vertices and edges. We illustrate how the
kernel function of a given network can be extracted from the history of the
network and discuss other possible applications.
