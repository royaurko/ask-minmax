A Stokes experiment for foams is proposed. It consists in a two-dimensional
flow of a foam, confined between a water subphase and a top plate, around a
fixed circular obstacle. We present systematic measurements of the drag exerted
by the flowing foam on the obstacle, \emph{versus} various separately
controlled parameters: flow rate, bubble volume, bulk viscosity, obstacle size,
shape and boundary conditions. We separate the drag into two contributions, an
elastic one (yield drag) at vanishing flow rate, and a fluid one (viscous
coefficient) increasing with flow rate. We quantify the influence of each
control parameter on the drag. The results exhibit in particular a power-law
dependence of the drag as a function of the bulk viscosity and the flow rate
with two different exponents. Moreover, we show that the drag decreases with
bubble size, and increases proportionally to the obstacle size. We quantify the
effect of shape through a dimensioned drag coefficient, and we show that the
effect of boundary conditions is small.
