With the Lattice Boltzmann method (using the BGK approximation) we
investigate the dynamics of Hele-Shaw flow under conditions corresponding to
various experimental systems. We discuss the onset of the instability
(dispersion relation), the static properties (characterization of the
interface) and the dynamic properties (growth of the mixing zone) of simulated
Hele-Shaw systems. We examine the role of reactive processes (between the two
fluids) and we show that they have a sharpening effect on the interface similar
to the effect of surface tension.
