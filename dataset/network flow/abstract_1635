Designing efficient and fair algorithms for sharing multiple resources
between heterogeneous demands is becoming increasingly important. Applications
include compute clusters shared by multi-task jobs and routers equipped with
middleboxes shared by flows of different types. We show that the currently
preferred objective of Dominant Resource Fairness has a significantly less
favorable efficiency-fairness tradeoff than alternatives like Proportional
Fairness and our proposal, Bottleneck Max Fairness. In addition to other
desirable properties, these objectives are equally strategyproof in any
realistic scenario with dynamic demand.
