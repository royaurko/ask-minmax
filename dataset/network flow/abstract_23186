We study the temperature dependence of the resistivity as a function of
magnetic field in superconducting transition (Tconset - TcR=0) region for
different Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} superconducting samples being synthesized
using sol-gel method. The superconducting transition temperature (TcR=0) of the
studied samples is increased from 32 K to 82K by simply increasing the final
sintering temperature with an improved grains morphology. On the other hand,
broadening of transition is increased substantially with decrease in sintering
temperature; this is because Tconset is not affected much with grains
morphology. Further broadening of the superconducting transition is seen under
magnetic field, which is being explained on the basis of thermally activated
flux flow (TAFF) below superconducting transition temperature (Tc). TAFF
activation energy (U0) is calculated using the resistive broadening of samples
in the presence of magnetic field. Temperature dependence of TAFF activation
energy revealed linear temperature dependence for all the samples. Further,
magnetic field dependence is found to obey power law for all the samples and
the negative exponent is increased with increase in sintering temperature or
the improved grains morphology for different Bi-2212 samples. We believe that
the sintering temperature and the ensuing role of grain morphology is yet a key
issue to be addressed in case of cuprate superconductors.
