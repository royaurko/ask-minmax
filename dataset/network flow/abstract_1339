The goal of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is ``to map in detail one-quarter of
the entire sky, determining the positions and absolute brightnesses of more
than 100 million celestial objects''. The survey will be performed by taking
``snapshots'' through a large telescope. Each snapshot can capture up to 600
objects from a small circle of the sky. This paper describes the design and
implementation of the algorithm that is being used to determine the snapshots
so as to minimize their number. The problem is NP-hard in general; the
algorithm described is a heuristic, based on Lagriangian-relaxation and
min-cost network flow. It gets within 5-15% of a naive lower bound, whereas
using a ``uniform'' cover only gets within 25-35%.
