We extend our earlier multidimensional, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
coronal rain occurring in magnetic arcades with higher resolution,
grid-adaptive computations covering a much longer ($>6$ hour) timespan. We
quantify how in-situ forming blob-like condensations grow along and across
field lines and show that rain showers can occur in limit cycles, here
demonstrated for the first time in 2.5D setups. We discuss dynamical,
multi-dimensional aspects of the rebound shocks generated by the siphon inflows
and quantify the thermodynamics of a prominence-corona-transition-region like
structure surrounding the blobs. We point out the correlation between
condensation rates and the cross-sectional size of loop systems where
catastrophic cooling takes place. We also study the variations of the typical
number density, kinetic energy and temperature while blobs descend, impact and
sink into the transition region. In addition, we explain the mechanisms leading
to concurrent upflows while the blobs descend. As a result, there are plenty of
shear flows generated with relative velocity difference around 80 km s$^{-1}$
in our simulations. These shear flows are siphon flows set up by multiple blob
dynamics and they in turn affect the deformation of the falling blobs. In
particular, we show how shear flows can break apart blobs into smaller
fragments, within minutes.
