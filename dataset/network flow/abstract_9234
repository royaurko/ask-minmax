The question addressed is whether magnetic materials based on physical small
world networks are possible. Physical constraints, such as uniform bond length
and embedding in three dimensions, are the new features added to make small
world networks physical. Results are presented to further determine if physical
small world networks can exist, and the effect of the small world connections
on the critical phenomena of Ising models on such networks. Spectra of the
Laplacian on randomly-collapsed bead-chain networks are studied. The scaling
function for the order parameter of an Ising model with physical small world
connections is presented.
