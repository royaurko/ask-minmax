A vast variety of real-life networks display the ubiquitous presence of
scale-free phenomenon and small-world effect, both of which play a significant
role in the dynamical processes running on networks. Although various dynamical
processes have been investigated in scale-free small-world networks, analytical
research about random walks on such networks is much less. In this paper, we
will study analytically the scaling of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for
random walks on scale-free small-world networks. To this end, we first map the
classical Koch fractal to a network, called Koch network. According to this
proposed mapping, we present an iterative algorithm for generating the Koch
network, based on which we derive closed-form expressions for the relevant
topological features, such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient,
average path length, and degree correlations. The obtained solutions show that
the Koch network exhibits scale-free behavior and small-world effect. Then, we
investigate the standard random walks and trapping issue on the Koch network.
Through the recurrence relations derived from the structure of the Koch
network, we obtain the exact scaling for the MFPT. We show that in the infinite
network order limit, the MFPT grows linearly with the number of all nodes in
the network. The obtained analytical results are corroborated by direct
extensive numerical calculations. In addition, we also determine the scaling
efficiency exponents characterizing random walks on the Koch network.
