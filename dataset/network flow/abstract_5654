Efficient and flexible information matching over wireless networks has become
increasingly important and challenging with the popularity of smart devices and
the growth of social-network-based applications. Some existing approaches
designed for wired networks are not applicable to wireless networks, due to
their overwhelming control overheads. In this paper, we propose a reliable and
scalable binary range vector summary tree (BRVST) infrastructure for flexible
information expression support, effective content matching and timely
information dissemination over the dynamic wireless network. A novel attribute
range vector structure has been introduced for efficient and accurate content
representation and a summary tree structure to facilitate information
aggregation. For robust and scalable operations over dynamic wireless network,
the proposed overlay system exploits a virtual hierarchical geographic
management framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate that BRVST has a
significantly faster event matching speed, while incurs very low storage and
traffic overhead, as compared with peer schemes tested.
