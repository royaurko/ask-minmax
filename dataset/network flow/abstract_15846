In this paper, we propose a novel inference method for dynamic genetic
networks which makes it possible to face with a number of time measurements n
much smaller than the number of genes p. The approach is based on the concept
of low order conditional dependence graph that we extend here in the case of
Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Most of our results are based on the theory of
graphical models associated with the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). In this
way, we define a minimal DAG G which describes exactly the full order
conditional dependencies given the past of the process. Then, to face with the
large p and small n estimation case, we propose to approximate DAG G by
considering low order conditional independencies. We introduce partial qth
order conditional dependence DAGs G(q) and analyze their probabilistic
properties. In general, DAGs G(q) differ from DAG G but still reflect relevant
dependence facts for sparse networks such as genetic networks. By using this
approximation, we set out a non-bayesian inference method and demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach on both simulated and real data analysis. The
inference procedure is implemented in the R package 'G1DBN' freely available
from the CRAN archive.
