In this paper, we present a numerical scheme for the diffuse-interface model
in [Abels, Garcke, Gr\"un, M3AS 22(3), 2012] for two-phase flow of immiscible,
incompressible fluids. As that model is in particular consistent with
thermodynamics, energy estimates are expected to carry over to the discrete
setting. By a subtle discretization of the convective coupling with the flux of
the phase-field in the momentum equation, we prove discrete consistency with
thermodynamics. Numerical experiments in two spatial dimensions -- ranging from
Rayleigh-Taylor instability to a comparison with previous modeling approaches
-- indicate the full practicality of our scheme and enable a first validation
of the new modeling approach in [Abels, Garcke, Gr\"un, M3AS 22(3), 2012].
