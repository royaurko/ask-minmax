The development of prebiotic homochirality on early-Earth or another
planetary platform may be viewed as a critical phenomenon. It is shown, in the
context of spatio-temporal polymerization reaction networks, that environmental
effects -- be them temperature surges or other external disruptions -- may
destroy any net chirality previously produced. In order to understand the
emergence of prebiotic homochirality it is important to model the coupling of
polymerization reaction networks to different planetary environments.
