We derive a modular fluid-flow network congestion control model based on a
law of fundamental nature in networks: the conservation of information. Network
elements such as queues, users, and transmission channels and network
performance indicators like sending/acknowledgement rates and delays are
mathematically modelled by applying this law locally. Our contributions are
twofold. First, we introduce a modular metamodel that is sufficiently generic
to represent any network topology. The proposed model is composed of building
blocks that implement mechanisms ignored by the existing ones, which can be
recovered from exact reduction or approximation of this new model. Second, we
provide a novel classification of previously proposed models in the literature
and show that they are often not capable of capturing the transient behavior of
the network precisely. Numerical results obtained from packet-level simulations
demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model.
