The nonlinear elastic properties of fibrin networks are crucial for normal
blood clotting. Here, we show that the extraordinary strain-stiffening response
of fibrin clots reflects the hierarchical architecture of the fibrin fibers,
which are bundles of wormlike protofibrils. We measure the rheology of networks
of unbundled protofibrils, and find excellent agreement with an affine model of
extensible wormlike polymers. By direct comparison with these data, we show
that physiological clots of thick fibers can be modeled as networks of tight
protofibril bundles. At high stress, the protofibrils contribute independently
to the network elasticity, which may reflect a decoupling of the tight bundle
structure. The hierarchical architecture of fibrin fibers can thus account for
the enormous elastic resilience characteristic of blood clots.
