In this study, we develop a complex network approach on a rough fracture,
where evolution of elementary aperture during translational shear is
characterized. In this manner, based on some hidden metric spaces (similarity
measurements) between apertures profiles, we make evolutionary network in two
directions (in parallel and perpendicular to the shear direction) and on the
measured apertures profiles. Evaluation of the emerged network shows the
connectivity degree (distribution) of network, after a transition step; fall in
to the stable states which are coincided with the Gaussian distribution. Based
on this event and real observations of the complex network changes, a simple
model has been proposed in which evolving (decaying) of network is accomplished
using a preferential detachment of edges. This suggests that destroying of
surfaces is accomplished in a manner that is followed as a combination of
random and preferential selection of each element. Also, evolving of cluster
coefficients and number of edges displays similar patterns as well as are
appeared in shear stress, hydraulic conductivity and dilation changes, which
can be engaged to estimate shear strength distribution of asperities.
Distinguishing of the contact profiles (or their equivalent : percolating
clusters) and their changes, despite the former case, disclosed new side of a
network, namely growing networks, which shed light the details of changes
within intra-topology of profiles.
