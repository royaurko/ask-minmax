We extend the Wilson renormalization group (RG) formulation to chiral gauge
theories and show that local gauge symmetry can be implemented by a suitable
choice of the RG flow boundary conditions. Since the space-time dimension is
four, there is no ambiguity in handling the matrix $\g_5$ and left and right
fermions are not coupled. As a result the ultraviolet action contains all
possible globally chiral invariant interactions. Nevertheless, the correct
chiral anomaly is reproduced.
