In this work gelatinized potato starch is shown to retain the memory of past
loading history. It exhibits a visco-elastic response which does not depend
solely on instantaneous conditions. A simple squeeze flow experiment is
performed, where loading is done in two steps with a time lag $\tau \sim$
seconds between the steps. The effect on the strain, of varying $\tau$ is
reproduced by a three element visco-elastic solid model. Non-linearity is
introduced through a generalized calculus approach by incorporating a
non-integer order time derivative in the viscosity equation. A strain hardening
proportional to the time lag between the two loading steps is also
incorporated.
  This model reproduces the three salient features observed in the experiment,
namely - the memory effect, slight initial oscillations in the strain as well
as the long-time solid-like response. Dynamic visco-elasticity of the sample is
also reported.
