We offer a platform for database consultations and/or biomedical images
exchanges, adapted to the low rate wireless transmission, and intended for
general practitioners or specialists. The goal can be preventive, diagnostic
and therapeutic. it Concerns specialties such as radiology, ultrasound, the
anatomical pathology or endoscopy. The main features required in such a context
are to adjust the data compression of both the specific needs of telemedicine
and limited capabilities of wireless communication networks. We present our
approach in which we have set out criteria on Biomedical images quality,
compressed by the wavelet method to retain all the necessary information for an
accurate diagnosis, and determined the characteristics of a wireless network
with minimal performances for the transmission of these images within
constraints related to the modality and the data flow, in this case Wifi based
on the IEEE 802.11 standard. Our results will assess the capacity of this
standard in terms of speed, to transmit images at a rate of 10 frames per
second. It will be necessary to quantify the amount of information to add to
the image datas to enable a transmission in good conditions and the appropriate
modus operandi.
