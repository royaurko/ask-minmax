In this paper, we have analyzed the effect of node mobility on the
performance of AOMDV multipath routing protocol. This routing protocol in ad
hoc network has been analyzed with random way point mobility model only. This
is not sufficient to evaluate the behavior of a routing protocol. Therefore, in
this paper, we have considered Random waypoint, Random Direction and
Probabilistic Random Walk mobility Model for performance analysis of AOMDV
protocol. The result reveals that packet delivery ratio decreases with the
increasing node mobility for all mobility models. Also, average end-to-end
delay is also vary with varying node speed, initially upto 20 nodes in all
mobility models delay is minimum.
