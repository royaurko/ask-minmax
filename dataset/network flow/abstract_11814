In the original Gilbert model of random geometric graphs, nodes are placed
according to a Poisson process, and links formed between those within a fixed
range. Motivated by wireless network applications "soft" or "probabilistic"
connection models have recently been introduced, involving a "connection
function" H(r) that gives the probability that two nodes at distance r directly
connect. In many applications, not only in wireless networks, it is desirable
that the graph is fully connected, that is every node is connected to every
other node in a multihop fashion. Here, the full connection probability of a
dense network in a convex polygonal or polyhedral domain is expressed in terms
of contributions from boundary components, for a very general class of
connection functions. It turns out that only a few quantities such as moments
of the connection function appear. Good agreement is found with connection
functions used in previous studies and with numerical simulations.
