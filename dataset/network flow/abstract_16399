In the standard cascade picture of 3D turbulent fluid flows, energy is input
at a constant rate at large scales. Energy is then transferred to smaller
scales by an intermittent process that has been the focus of a vast literature.
However, the energy input at large scales is not constant in most real
turbulent flows. We explore the signatures of these fluctuations of large scale
energy input on small scale turbulence statistics. Measurements were made in a
flow between oscillating grids, with Re up to 271, in which temporal variations
in the large scale energy input can be introduced by modulating the oscillating
grid frequency. We find that the Kolmogorov constant for second order
longitudinal structure functions depends on the magnitude of the fluctuations
in the large scale energy input. We can quantitatively predict the measured
change with a model based on Kolmogorov's refined similarity theory. The
effects of fluctuations of the energy input can also be observed using
structure functions conditioned on the instantaneous large scale velocity. A
linear parameterization using the curvature of the iconditional structure
functions provides a fairly good match with the measured changes in the
Kolmogorov constant. Conditional structure functions are found to provide a
more sensitive measure of the presence of fluctuations in the large scale
energy input than inertial range scaling coefficients.
