The existence and stability of the universality class associated to local
minimal energy landscapes is investigated. Using extensive numerical
simulations, we first study the dependence on a parameter $\gamma$ of a partial
differential equation which was proposed to describe the evolution of a rugged
landscape toward a local minimum of the dissipated energy. We then compare the
results with those obtained by an evolution scheme based on a variational
principle (the optimal channel networks). It is found that both models yield
qualitatively similar river patterns and similar dependence on $\gamma$. The
aggregation mechanism is however strongly dependent on the value of $\gamma$. A
careful analysis suggests that scaling behaviors may weakly depend both on
$\gamma$ and on initial condition, but in all cases it is within observational
data predictions. Consequences of our results
