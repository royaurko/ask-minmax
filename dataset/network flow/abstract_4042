Behavior of a dilute polymer solution in a random three-dimensional flow with
an average shear is studied experimentally. Polymer contribution to the shear
stress is found to be more than two orders of magnitude higher than in a
laminar shear flow. The results indicate that the polymer molecules get
strongly stretched by the random motion of the fluid.
