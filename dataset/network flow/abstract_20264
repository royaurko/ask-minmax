Anisotropic super-hydrophobic surfaces have the potential to greatly reduce
drag and enhance mixing phenomena in microfluidic devices. Recent work has
focused mostly on cases of super-hydrophobic stripes. Here, we analyze a
relevant situation of cosine variation of the local slip length. We derive
approximate formulae for maximal (longitudinal) and minimal (transverse)
directional effective slip lengths that are in good agreement with the exact
numerical solution and lattice-Bolzmann simulations for any surface slip
fraction. The cosine texture can provide a very large effective (forward) slip,
but it was found to be less efficient in generating a transverse flow as
compared to super-hydrophobic stripes.
