Is time travel possible? What is Einstein's theory of relativity
mathematically predicting in that regard? Is time travel related to the
so-called clock 'paradoxes' of relativity and if so how? Is there any accurate
experimental evidence of the phenomena regarding the different flow of time
predicted by General Relativity and is there any possible application of the
temporal phenomena predicted by relativity to our everyday life? Which temporal
phenomena are predicted in the vicinities of a rotating body and of a
mass-energy current, and do we have any experimental test of the occurrence of
these phenomena near a rotating body? In this paper, we address and answer some
of these questions.
