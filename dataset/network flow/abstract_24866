We study the real-time dynamics of a two-dimensional Anderson--Hubbard model
using nonequilibrium self-consistent perturbation theory within the second-Born
approximation. When compared with exact diagonalization performed on small
clusters, we demonstrate that for strong disorder this technique approaches the
exact result on all available timescales, while for intermediate disorder, in
the vicinity of the many-body localization transition, it produces
quantitatively accurate results up to nontrivial times. Our method allows for
the treatment of system sizes inaccessible by any numerically exact method and
for the complete elimination of finite size effects for the largest times
considered. We show that for a sufficiently strong disorder the system becomes
nonergodic, while for intermediate disorder strengths and for all accessible
time scales transport in the system is strictly subdiffusive. We argue that
these results are incompatible with a simple percolation picture. Our results
are consistent with the heuristic random resistor network model where
subdiffusion may be observed for long times until a crossover to diffusion
occurs. The prediction of a broad subdiffusive regime in a two-dimensional
interacting and disordered system can be directly verified in future cold atoms
experiments.
