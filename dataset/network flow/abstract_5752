The evaluation of the number of attractors in Kauffman networks by Samuelsson
and Troein is generalized to critical networks with one input per node and to
networks with two inputs per node and different probability distributions for
update functions. A connection is made between the terms occurring in the
calculation and between the more graphic concepts of frozen, nonfrozen and
relevant nodes, and relevant components. Based on this understanding, a
phenomenological argument is given that reproduces the dependence of the
attractor numbers on system size.
