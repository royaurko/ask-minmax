Discrepancies of range between the Space Surveillance Network radars and the
Deep Space Network in tracking the 1998 earth flyby of NEAR, and between ESA's
Doppler and range data in Rosetta's 2009 flyby, reveal a consistent excess
delay, or lag, equal to instantaneous one-way travel time in the telemetry
signals. These lags readily explain all details of the flyby anomaly, and are
shown to be symptoms of chirp d'Alembertian travelling wave solutions, relating
to traditional sinusoidal waves by a rotation of the spectral decomposition due
to the clock acceleration caused by the Doppler rates during the flybys. The
lags thus relate to special relativity, but yield distance proportional shifts
like those of cosmology at short range.
