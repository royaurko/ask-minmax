A lossy data compression scheme for uniformly biased Boolean messages is
investigated via statistical mechanics techniques. We utilize tree-like
committee machine (committee tree) and tree-like parity machine (parity tree)
whose transfer functions are non-monotonic. The scheme performance at the
infinite code length limit is analyzed using the replica method. Both committee
and parity treelike networks are shown to saturate the Shannon bound. The AT
stability of the Replica Symmetric solution is analyzed, and the tuning of the
non-monotonic transfer function is also discussed.
