We study admission control mechanisms for wireless access networks where (i)
each user has a minimum service requirement, (ii) the capacity of the access
network is limited, and (iii) the access point is not allowed to use monetary
mechanisms to guarantee that users do not lie when disclosing their minimum
service requirements. To guarantee truthfulness, we use auction theory to
design a mechanism where users compete to be admitted into the network. We
propose admission control mechanisms under which the access point intelligently
allocates resources based on the announced minimum service requirements to
ensure that users have no incentive to lie and the capacity constraint is
fulfilled. We also prove the properties that any feasible mechanism should
have.
