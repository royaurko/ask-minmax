Recently much attention has been devoted to the construction of phylogenetic
networks which generalize phylogenetic trees in order to accommodate complex
evolutionary processes. Here we present an efficient, practical algorithm for
reconstructing level-1 phylogenetic networks - a type of network slightly more
general than a phylogenetic tree - from triplets. Our algorithm has been made
publicly available as the program LEV1ATHAN. It combines ideas from several
known theoretical algorithms for phylogenetic tree and network reconstruction
with two novel subroutines. Namely, an exponential-time exact and a greedy
algorithm both of which are of independent theoretical interest. Most
importantly, LEV1ATHAN runs in polynomial time and always constructs a level-1
network. If the data is consistent with a phylogenetic tree, then the algorithm
constructs such a tree. Moreover, if the input triplet set is dense and, in
addition, is fully consistent with some level-1 network, it will find such a
network. The potential of LEV1ATHAN is explored by means of an extensive
simulation study and a biological data set. One of our conclusions is that
LEV1ATHAN is able to construct networks consistent with a high percentage of
input triplets, even when these input triplets are affected by a low to
moderate level of noise.
