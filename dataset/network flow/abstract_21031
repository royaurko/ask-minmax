In this note we present numerical simulations of binary mixtures and we find
indications for a thermodynamic transition to a glassy phase. We find that
below the transition point the off equilibrium correlation functions and
response functions seems to be asymptotically compatible with the relations
that were originally derived Cugliandolo Kurchan for generalized spin glasses.
