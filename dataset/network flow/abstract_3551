There are many indexes (measures or metrics) in Social Network Analysis
(SNA), like density, cohesion, etc. We have defined a new SNA index called
"comfortability". In this paper, core comfortable team of a social network is
defined based on graph theoretic concepts and some of their structural
properties are analyzed.
  Comfortability is one of the important attributes (characteristics) for a
successful team work. So, it is necessary to find a comfortable and successful
team in any given social network.
  It is proved that forming core comfortable team in any network is NP-Complete
using the concepts of domination in graph theory. Next, we give two
polynomial-time approximation algorithms for finding such a core comfortable
team in any given network with performance ratio O(ln \Delta), where \Delta is
the maximum degree of a given network (graph). The time complexity of the
algorithm is proved to be O(n^{3}), where n is the number of persons (vertices)
in the network (graph). It is also proved that the algorithms give good results
in scale-free networks.
