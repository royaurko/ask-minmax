We have explored the behaviour of some improved actions based on a
nonperturbative renormalization group (RG) analysis in coupling space. We
calculate the RG flow in two-coupling space $(\boneone,\bonetwo)$ and examine
the restoration of rotational invariance and the scaling of physical quantities
$(T_c/\sqrt{\sigma})$.
