A gene regulatory network is a central concept in Systems Biology. It links
the expression levels of a set of genes via regulatory controls that gene
products exert on one another. There have been numerous suggestions for models
of gene regulatory networks, with varying degrees of expressivity and ease of
analysis. Perhaps the simplest model is the Boolean network, introduced by
Kauffman several decades ago: expression levels take a Boolean value, and
regulation of expression is expressed by Boolean functions. Even for this
simple formulation, the problem of fitting a given model to an expression
dataset is NP-Complete. In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm for this
problem that makes use of sampling in order to handle large datasets. In order
to demonstrate its performance we test it on multiple large in-silico datasets
with several levels and types of noise. Our results support the notion that
network analysis is applicable to large datasets, and that the production of
such datasets is desirable for the study of gene regulatory networks.
