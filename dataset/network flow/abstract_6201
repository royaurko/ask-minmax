We study large-scale coherent motion in our universe using the existing Type
IA supernovae data. If the recently observed bulk flow is real, then some
imprint must be left on supernovae motion. We run a series of Monte Carlo
Markov Chain runs in various redshift bins and find a sharp contrast between
the z < 0.05 and z > 0.05 data. The$z < 0.05 data are consistent with the bulk
flow in the direction (l,b)=({290^{+39}_{-31}}^{\circ},
{20^{+32}_{-32}}^{\circ}) with a magnitude of v_bulk = 188^{+119}_{-103} km/s
at 68% confidence. The significance of detection (compared to the null
hypothesis) is 95%. In contrast, z > 0.05 data (which contains 425 of the 557
supernovae in the Union2 data set) show no evidence for bulk flow. While the
direction of the bulk flow agrees very well with previous studies, the
magnitude is significantly smaller. For example, the Kashlinsky, et al.'s
original bulk flow result of v_bulk > 600 km/s is inconsistent with our
analysis at greater than 99.7% confidence level. Furthermore, our best-fit bulk
flow velocity is consistent with the expectation for the \Lambda CDM model,
which lies inside the 68% confidence limit.
