We present the STAR measurements of directed flow, v1, for {\pi}{\pm},
K{\pm}, protons and antiprotons, as well as for all detected charged particles
in Au + Au collisions at {\surd}sNN = 7.7, 11.5 and 39 GeV as a function of
transverse momentum, rapidity and centrality. Results are compared to the
predictions from transport models.
