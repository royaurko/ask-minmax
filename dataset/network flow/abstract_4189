Instead of investigating the Willmore flow for two-dimensional, closed
immersed surfaces directly we turn to its inversion. We give a lower bound on
the lifespan of this inverse Willmore flow, depending on the concentration of
curvature in space and the extension of the initial surface, as well as a
characterization of its breakdown, which might occur in finite time.
