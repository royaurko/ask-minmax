Ceramic superconductors (cuprates, pnictides, ...) exhibit universal features
in both Tcmax and in their planar lattice disordering measured by EXAFS, as
reflected by three phase transitions. The two highest temperature transitions
are known to be associated with formation of pseudogaps and superconductive
gaps, with corresponding Landau order parameters, but no new gap is associated
with the third transition below Tc. It is argued that the third transition is a
dopant glass transition, which is remarkably similar to transitions previously
observed in chalcogenide and oxide alloy network glasses (like window glass).
