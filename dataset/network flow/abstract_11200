We consider the random linear precoder at the source node as a secure network
coding. We prove that it is strongly secure in the sense of Harada and Yamamoto
and universal secure in the sense of Silva and Kschischang, while allowing
arbitrary small but nonzero mutual information to the eavesdropper. Our
security proof allows statistically dependent and non-uniform multiple secret
messages, while all previous constructions of weakly or strongly secure network
coding assumed independent and uniform messages, which are difficult to be
ensured in practice.
