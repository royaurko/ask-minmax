The design of modulation schemes for the physical layer network-coded two way
relaying scenario is considered with the protocol which employs two phases:
Multiple access (MA) Phase and Broadcast (BC) phase. It was observed by
Koike-Akino et al. that adaptively changing the network coding map used at the
relay according to the channel conditions greatly reduces the impact of
multiple access interference which occurs at the relay during the MA phase. In
other words, the set of all possible channel realizations (the complex plane)
is quantized into a finite number of regions, with a specific network coding
map giving the best performance in a particular region. We highlight the issues
associated with the scheme proposed by Koike-Akino et al. and propose a scheme
which solves these issues. We obtain a quantization of the set of all possible
channel realizations analytically for the case when $M$-PSK (for $M$ any power
of 2) is the signal set used during the MA phase. It is shown that the complex
plane can be classified into two regions: a region in which any network coding
map which satisfies the so called exclusive law gives the same best performance
and a region in which the choice of the network coding map affects the
performance, which is further quantized based on the choice of the network
coding map which optimizes the performance. The quantization thus obtained
analytically, leads to the same as the one obtained using computer search for
4-PSK signal set by Koike-Akino et al., when specialized for $M=4.$
