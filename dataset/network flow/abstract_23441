We perform a reanalysis of the production of CNO elements in a standard Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis scenario. The CNO yields in BBN are suppressed by the low
density of the plasma, Coulomb barrier effects and the short time scales
involved. Yet, the inclusion of nuclides and reactions traditionally
disregarded may lead to an increase relevant enough to affect the pristine
Population III stars. After a critical reanalysis and upgrade of the nuclear
network our results show no major discrepancies with the ones obtained using a
smaller nuclear network. The robustness of the standard predictions-the early
generation of star developed in a metal-free environment-is confirmed.
