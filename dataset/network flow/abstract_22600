In this contribution we summarize recent results on the transport properties
of strongly correlated dilute Fermi gases. We discuss the hydrodynamic
equations in the normal phase and present new results on the structure of
second order terms in the gradient expansion. We also discuss predictions from
kinetic theory, and show how these predictions can be tested using experimental
data on elliptic flow. We summarize current constraints on the shear viscosity
to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$.
