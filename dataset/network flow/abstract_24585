This paper explores the feasibility, advantages, and challenges of an
ICN-based approach in the Internet of Things. We report on the first NDN
experiments in a life-size IoT deployment, spread over tens of rooms on several
floors of a building. Based on the insights gained with these experiments, the
paper analyses the shortcomings of CCN applied to IoT. Several interoperable
CCN enhancements are then proposed and evaluated. We significantly decreased
control traffic (i.e., interest messages) and leverage data path and caching to
match IoT requirements in terms of energy and bandwidth constraints. Our
optimizations increase content availability in case of IoT nodes with
intermittent activity. This paper also provides the first experimental
comparison of CCN with the common IoT standards 6LoWPAN/RPL/UDP.
