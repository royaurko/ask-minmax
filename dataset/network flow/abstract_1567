A microstructural theory of dense granular materials is presented, based on
two main ideas. Firstly, that macroscopic shear results form activated local
rearrangements at a mesoscopic scale. Secondly, that the update frequency of
microscopic processes is determined by granular temperature. In a shear cell,
the resulting constitutive equations account for Bagnold's scaling and for the
existence of a Coulomb criterion of yield. In the case of a granular flow down
an inclined plane, they account for the rheology observed in recent experiments
and for the temperature and velocity profiles measured numerically.
