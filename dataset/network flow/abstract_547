To comprehend the multipartite organization of large-scale biological and
social systems, we introduce a new information theoretic approach that reveals
community structure in weighted and directed networks. The method decomposes a
network into modules by optimally compressing a description of information
flows on the network. The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights
the regularities in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the
method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation
patterns of more than 6000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization
with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the
network of science. Along the backbone of the network -- including physics,
chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine -- information flows
bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation from the
applied fields to the basic sciences.
