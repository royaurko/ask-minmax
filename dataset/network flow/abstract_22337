Stokes waves are steady periodic water waves on the free surface of an
infinitely deep irrotational two dimensional flow under gravity without surface
tension. They can be described in terms of solutions of the Euler-Lagrange
equation of a certain functional. This allows one to define the Morse index of
a Stokes wave. It is well known that if the Morse indices of the elements of a
set of non-singular Stokes waves are bounded, then none of them is close to a
singular one. The paper presents a quantitative variant of this result.
