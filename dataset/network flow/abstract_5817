Motivated by recent experiments showing nonlinear elasticity of in vitro
networks of the biopolymer actin cross-linked with filamin, we present an
effective medium theory of flexibly cross-linked stiff polymer networks. We
model such networks by randomly oriented elastic rods connected by flexible
connectors to a surrounding elastic continuum, which self-consistently
represents the behavior of the rest of the network. This model yields a
crossover from a linear elastic regime to a highly nonlinear elastic regime
that stiffens in a way quantitatively consistent with experiment.
