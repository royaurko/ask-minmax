Consider the causal effect that one individual's treatment may have on
another individual's outcome when the outcome is contagious, with specific
application to the effect of vaccination on an infectious disease outcome. The
effect of one individual's vaccination on another's outcome can be decomposed
into two different causal effects, called the "infectiousness" and "contagion"
effects. We present identifying assumptions and estimation or testing
procedures for infectiousness and contagion effects in two different settings:
(1) using data sampled from independent groups of observations, and (2) using
data collected from a single interdependent social network. The methods that we
propose for social network data require fitting generalized linear models
(GLMs). GLMs and other statistical models that require independence across
subjects have been used widely to estimate causal effects in social network
data, but, because the subjects in networks are presumably not independent, the
use of such models is generally invalid, resulting in inference that is
expected to be anticonservative. We introduce a way to ensure that GLM
residuals are uncorrelated across subjects despite the fact that outcomes are
non-independent. This simultaneously demonstrates the possibility of using GLMs
and related statistical models for network data and highlights their
limitations.
