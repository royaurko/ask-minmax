The formalism of local maximization for entropy gradient producing the
evolution and dynamical equations for closed systems. It eliminates the
inconsistency between the reversibilty of time in dynamical equations and the
strict direction of irreversible evolution for complex systems, causality
contradictions and ambiguity of time flow in different systems. Independently
it leads to basic principles of special relativity.
