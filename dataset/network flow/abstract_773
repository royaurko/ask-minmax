A characteristic particle method for the simulation of first order
macroscopic traffic models on road networks is presented. The approach is based
on the method "particleclaw", which solves scalar one dimensional hyperbolic
conservations laws exactly, except for a small error right around shocks. The
method is generalized to nonlinear network flows, where particle approximations
on the edges are suitably coupled together at the network nodes. It is
demonstrated in numerical examples that the resulting particle method can
approximate traffic jams accurately, while only devoting a few degrees of
freedom to each edge of the network.
