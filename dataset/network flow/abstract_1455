Time evolution of diluted neural networks with a nonmonotonic transfer
function is analitically described by flow equations for macroscopic variables.
The macroscopic dynamics shows a rich variety of behaviours: fixed-point,
periodicity and chaos. We examine in detail the structure of the strange
attractor and in particular we study the main features of the stable and
unstable manifolds, the hyperbolicity of the attractor and the existence of
homoclinic intersections. We also discuss the problem of the robustness of the
chaos and we prove that in the present model chaotic behaviour is fragile
(chaotic regions are densely intercalated with periodicity windows), according
to a recently discussed conjecture. Finally we perform an analysis of the
microscopic behaviour and in particular we examine the occurrence of damage
spreading by studying the time evolution of two almost identical initial
configurations. We show that for any choice of the parameters the two initial
states remain microscopically distinct.
