We prove that the category of flows cannot be the underlying category of a
model category whose corresponding homotopy types are the flows up to weak
dihomotopy. Some hints are given to overcome this problem. In particular, a new
approach of dihomotopy involving simplicial presheaves over an appropriate
small category is proposed. This small category is obtained by taking a full
subcategory of a locally presentable version of the category of flows.
