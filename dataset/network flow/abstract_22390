A study of the gas dynamics of a dilute collection of the inelastically
colliding hard spheres is presented. When diffusive processes are neglected the
gas density blows up in a finite time. The blowup is the mathematical
expression for one of the possible mechanisms for cluster formation in
dissipative gases. The way diffusive processes smoothen the singularity has
been studied. Exact localized soliton-type solutions of the gas dynamics when
heat diffusion balances non-linear cooling are obtained. The presented results
generalize previous findings for planar flows.
