In this paper we study backward Ricci flow of locally homogeneous geometries
of $4$-manifolds which admit compact quotients. We describe the long-term
behavior of each class and show that many of the classes exhibit the same
behavior near the singular time. In most cases, these manifolds converge to a
sub-Riemannian geometry after suitable rescaling.
