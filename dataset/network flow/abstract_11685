We consider a broad class of walk-based, parameterized node centrality
measures for network analysis. These measures are expressed in terms of
functions of the adjacency matrix and generalize various well-known centrality
indices, including Katz and subgraph centrality. We show that the parameter can
be "tuned" to interpolate between degree and eigenvector centrality, which
appear as limiting cases. Our analysis helps explain certain correlations often
observed between the rankings obtained using different centrality measures, and
provides some guidance for the tuning of parameters. We also highlight the
roles played by the spectral gap of the adjacency matrix and by the number of
triangles in the network. Our analysis covers both undirected and directed
networks, including weighted ones. A brief discussion of PageRank is also
given.
