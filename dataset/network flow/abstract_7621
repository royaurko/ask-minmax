Recent PHOBOS measurements of the excitation function for the pseudo-rapidity
dependence of elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at RHIC, have posed a
significant theoretical challenge. We show here that these data are described
by the Buda-Lund model. A universal scaling curve, predicted by the Buda-Lund
hydro model, describes not only PHOBOS data, but also recent, detailed PHENIX
and STAR elliptic flow data. This is a consequence of perfect fluid
hydrodynamics as implemented in the Buda-Lund hydro model.
