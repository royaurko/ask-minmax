This paper outlines how an aerial telecommunications network can optimally
meet the stringent needs of emergency relief and recovery operations. We
propose a novel architecture, made of an integrated and highly dynamic
multi-purpose aerial telecommunications infrastructure that can be contextually
extended with fast-deploying high or low altitude platforms. In particular, we
analyze the interest and challenges of adapting core concepts from substitution
networks and controlled mobility mechanisms, so that a base network can be
seamlessly augmented, both in terms of capacity and functions. We give an
estimation of the emergency traffic supported by the lower altitude platforms
in an example scenario and discuss the challenges posed by this architecture,
notably in terms of disaster resilience and ability to efficiently provide
sustained first responder communications.
