Adhoc networks enable communication between distributed, mobile wireless
nodes without any supporting infrastructure. In the absence of centralized
control, such networks require node interaction, and are inherently based on
cooperation between nodes. In this paper, we use social and behavioral trust of
nodes to form a flow allocation optimization problem. We initialize trust using
information gained from users' social relationships (from social networks) and
update the trusts metric over time based on observed node behaviors. We conduct
analysis of social trust using real data sets and used it as a parameter for
performance evaluation of our frame work in ns-3. Based on our approach we
obtain a significant improvement in both detection rate and packet delivery
ratio using social trust information when compared to behavioral trust alone.
Further, we observe that social trust is critical in the event of mobility and
plays a crucial role in bootstrapping the computation of trust.
