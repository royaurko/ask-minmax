We calculate the Fisher zeros for $SU(3)$ gauge theory with different $N_f$
flavors of staggered fermions for various values of the fermion mass. We
discuss the finite-size scaling near the end point of the line of discontinuity
of $\bar{\psi} \psi$ in the beta-mass plane and in the larger beta-lower mass
region. We discuss possible interpretations of these results in terms of
Wilsonian RG flows and their possible relevance to construct composite Higgs
models.
