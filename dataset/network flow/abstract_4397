We propose a method of characterizing radial networks based on a partition
function associated with the structural triangulation of the network. The
internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, and entropy derived from the partition
function are used to group similar networks together and to interrogate the
history of their development. We illustrate our methodology for a model for
optimal transport in tree leaves.
