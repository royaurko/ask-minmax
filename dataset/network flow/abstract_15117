We extend previous work on injectivity in chemical reaction networks to
general interaction networks. Matrix- and graph-theoretic conditions for
injectivity of these systems are presented. A particular signed, directed,
labelled, bipartite multigraph, termed the ``DSR graph'', is shown to be a
useful representation of an interaction network when discussing questions of
injectivity. A graph-theoretic condition, developed previously in the context
of chemical reaction networks, is shown to be sufficient to guarantee
injectivity for a large class of systems. The graph-theoretic condition is
simple to state and often easy to check. Examples are presented to illustrate
the wide applicability of the theory developed.
