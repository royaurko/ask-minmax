A dozen most luminous galaxies at distances up to 10 Mpc from the Local Group
are moving away from the group forming the local expansion flow of giants. We
use recent Hubble Space Telescope data on the local giants and their numerous
fainter companions to study the dynamical structure and evolutionary trends of
the flow. It is demonstrated that the dynamics of the flow is dominated by
local dark energy.
