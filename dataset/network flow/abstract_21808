Bidirected graphs (earlier studied by Edmonds, Johnson and, in equivalent
terms of skew-symmetric graphs, by Tutte, Goldberg, Karzanov, and others)
proved to be a useful unifying language for describing both flow and matching
problems. In this paper we extend the notion of ear decomposition to the class
of strongly connected bidirected graphs. In particular, our results imply Two
Ear Theorem on matching covered graphs of Lov\'asz and Plummer. The proofs
given here are self-contained except for standard Barrier Theorem on
skew-symmetric graphs.
