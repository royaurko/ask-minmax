We discuss the influence of fluctuations on thermodynamics near the chiral
phase transition within Polyakov loop extended quark--meson model based on the
functional renormalization group (FRG) method. We include the gluon fields in
the FRG flow equation self-consistently on the mean-field level. We focus on
the properties of the phase diagram and net-baryon number fluctuations.
