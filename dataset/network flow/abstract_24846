This paper considers proportional fairness amongst ACs in an EDCA WLAN for
provision of distinct QoS requirements and priority parameters. A detailed
theoretical analysis is provided to derive the optimal station attempt
probability which leads to a proportional fair allocation of station
throughputs. The desirable fairness can be achieved using a centralised
adaptive control approach. This approach is based on multivariable statespace
control theory and uses the Linear Quadratic Integral (LQI) controller to
periodically update CWmin till the optimal fair point of operation. Performance
evaluation demonstrates that the control approach has high accuracy performance
and fast convergence speed for general network scenarios. To our knowledge this
might be the first time that a closed-loop control system is designed for EDCA
WLANs to achieve proportional fairness.
