We propose a generalized perspective on the behavior of high-order derivative
moments in turbulent shear flows by taking account of the roles of small-scale
intermittency and mean shear, in addition to the Reynolds number. Two
asymptotic regimes are discussed with respect to shear effects. By these means,
some existing disagreements on the Reynolds number dependence of derivative
moments can be explained. That odd-order moments of transverse velocity
derivatives tend not vanish as expected from elementary scaling considerations
does not necessarily imply that small-scale anisotropy persists at all Reynolds
numbers.
