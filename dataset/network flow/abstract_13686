In this paper we investigate the yield condition in the mobilization of
yield-stress materials in distensible tubes. We discuss the two possibilities
for modeling the yield-stress materials prior to yield: solid-like materials
and highly-viscous fluids and identify the logical consequences of these two
approaches on the yield condition. As part of this investigation we derive an
analytical expression for the pressure field inside a distensible tube with a
Newtonian flow using a one-dimensional Navier-Stokes flow model in conjunction
with a pressure-area constitutive relation based on elastic tube wall
characteristics.
