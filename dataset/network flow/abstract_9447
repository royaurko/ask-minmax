Wireless access through a large distributed network of low-complexity
infrastructure nodes empowered with cooperation and coordination capabilities,
is an emerging radio architecture, candidate to deal with the mobile data
capacity crunch. In the 3GPP evolutionary path, this is known as the Cloud-RAN
paradigm for future radio. In such a complex network, distributed MIMO
resources optimization is of paramount importance, in order to achieve capacity
scaling. In this paper, we investigate efficient strategies towards optimizing
the pairing of access nodes with users as well as linear precoding designs for
providing fair QoS experience across the whole network, when data sharing is
limited due to complexity and overhead constraints. We propose a method for
obtaining the exact optimal spatial resources allocation solution which can be
applied in networks of limited scale, as well as an approximation algorithm
with bounded polynomial complexity which can be used in larger networks. The
particular algorithm outperforms existing user-oriented clustering techniques
and achieves quite high quality-of-service levels with reasonable complexity.
