Living systems often exhibit internal driving: active, molecular processes
drive nonequilibrium phenomena such as metabolism or migration. Active gels
constitute a fascinating class of internally driven matter, where molecular
motors exert localized stresses inside polymer networks. There is evidence that
network crosslinking is required to allow motors to induce macroscopic
contraction. Yet a quantitative understanding of how network connectivity
enables contraction is lacking. Here we show experimentally that myosin motors
contract crosslinked actin polymer networks to clusters with a scale-free size
distribution. This critical behavior occurs over an unexpectedly broad range of
crosslink concentrations. To understand this robustness, we develop a
quantitative model of contractile networks that takes into account network
restructuring: motors reduce connectivity by forcing crosslinks to unbind.
Paradoxically, to coordinate global contractions, motor activity should be low.
Otherwise, motors drive initially well-connected networks to a critical state
where ruptures form across the entire network.
