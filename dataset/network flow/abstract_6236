Many social, technological, biological, and economical systems are best
described by weighted networks, whose properties and dynamics depend not only
on their structures but also on the connection weights among their nodes.
However, most existing research work on complex network models are concentrated
on network structures, with connection weights among their nodes being either 1
or 0. In this paper, we propose a new weighted evolving network model.
Numerical simulations indicate that this network model yields three power-law
distributions of the node degrees, connection weights and node strengths.
Particularly, some other properties of the distributions, such as the
droop-head and heavy-tail effects, can also be reflected by this model.
