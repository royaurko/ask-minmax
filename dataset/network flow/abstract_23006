A first principles analysis of an open system thermodynamical Carnot cycle is
provided, and the results are compared to those proposed by Gibbs for open
systems. The Kelvin-Clausius statement concerning heat transfer for reversible
cycles is taken as an axiom, from which several rigorous theorems are proven.An
equation is derived that resembles a Gibbs-Duhem relation relating convected
entropies, from which two distinguishable forms of entropy are proven to exist
for such systems, which questions prevailing developments which presume a
singular or characteristic entropic form which couple all work and heat flows,
such as in Onsager first order thermodynamics. In particular, a closed path
undergone by the system does not return to the environment to the initial state
for one of these entropic forms. The Biot assertion that the entropy
contribution due to diathermal heat transfer does not form a state function is
therefore contradicted and a local entropy is shown to exist. Several other new
composite state functions for work and heat flow are shown to exist for open
systems. From Gibbs' results, it is suggested that the ensuing chemical
potentials used routinely may possibly ignore heat effects. The functions
developed here are suitable for application since the functions are proven to
exist, rather than presumed to exist.
