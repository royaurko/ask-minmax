In this paper we investigate the problem of interpolating a B-spline curve
network, in order to create a surface satisfying such a constraint and
belonging to the space of bivariate $C^1$ quadratic splines on criss-cross
triangulations. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the surface, providing
a constructive algorithm for its generation. We also present numerical and
graphical results and comparisons with other methods.
