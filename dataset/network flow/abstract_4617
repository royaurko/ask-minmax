The giant galaxies located at the centers of cluster cooling flows are
frequently sites of vigorous star formation. In some instances, star formation
appears to have been triggered by the galaxy's radio source. The colors and
spectral indices of the young populations are generally consistent with short
duration bursts or continuous star formation for durations much less than 1
Gyr, which is less than the presumed ages of cooling flows. The star formation
properties are inconsistent with fueling by a continuously accreting cooling
flow, although the prevalence of star formation is consistent with repeated
bursts and periodic refueling. Star formation may be fueled, in some cases, by
cold material stripped from neighboring cluster galaxies.
