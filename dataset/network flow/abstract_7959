In this paper, we establish an $\epsilon$-regularity criterion for any weak
solution $(u,d)$ to the nematic liquid crystal flow (1.1) such that $(u,\nabla
d)\in L^p_tL^q_x$ for some $p\ge 2$ and $q\ge n$ satisfying the condition
(1.2). As consequences, we prove the interior smoothness of any such a solution
when $p>2$ and $q>n$. We also show that uniqueness holds for the class of weak
solutions $(u,d)$ the Cauchy problem of the nematic liquid crystal flow (1.1)
that satisfy $(u,\nabla d)\in L^p_tL^q_x$ for some $p>2$ and $q>n$ satisfying
(1.2).
