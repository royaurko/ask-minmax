We consider a continuous supply chain network consisting of buffering queues
and processors first articulated by Armbruster et al. (2006) and analyzed
subsequently by Armbruster et al. (2007) and Armbruster et al. (2006). A model
was proposed for such network by Gottlich et al. (2005) using a system of
coupling partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. In
this article, we propose an alternative approach based on a variational method
to formulate the network dynamics. We also derive, based on the variational
method, an algorithm that guarantees numerical stability, allows for rigorous
error estimates, and facilitates efficient computations. A class of network
flow optimization problems are formulated as mixed integer programs (MIP). The
proposed numerical algorithm and the corresponding MIP are compared
theoretically and numerically with existing ones (Fugenschuh et al., 2008;
Gottlich et al., 2005), which demonstrates the modeling and computational
advantages of the variational approach.
