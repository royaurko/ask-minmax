The TexSol is a composite geomaterial : a sand matrix and a wire network
reinforcement. For small strains a thermodynamical continuous model of the
TexSol including the unilaterality of the wire network is postulated. This
model is described by two potentials which depend on some internal variables
and a state variable either strain or stress tensor (the choice of this last
one gives two different ways of identification). The TexSol continuous model is
implemented in a finite element code to recover the mechanical behaviour given
by discrete elements numerical experiments.
