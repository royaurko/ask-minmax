In this paper, we consider the short time strong solution to a simplified
hydrodynamic flow modeling the compressible, nematic liquid crystal materials
in dimension three. We establish a criterion for possible breakdown of such
solutions at ?finite time in terms of the temporal integral of both the maximum
norm of the deformation tensor of velocity gradient and the square of maximum
norm of gradient of liquid crystal director ?field.
