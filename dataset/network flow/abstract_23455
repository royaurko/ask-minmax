We explore and calculate the rich scaling behavior of copolymer networks in
solution by renormalization group methods. We establish a field theoretic
description in terms of composite operators. Our 3rd order resummation of the
spectrum of scaling dimensions brings about remarkable features: The special
convexity properties of the spectra allow for a multifractal interpretation
while preserving stability of the theory. This behavior could not be found for
power of field operators of usual $\phi^4$ field theory. The 2D limit of the
mutually avoiding walk star apparently corresponds to results of a conformal
Kac series. Such a classification seems not possible for the 2D limit of other
copolymer stars. We furthermore provide a consistency check of two
complementary renormalization schemes: epsilon expansion and renormalization at
fixed dimension, calculating a large collection of independent exponents in
both approaches.
