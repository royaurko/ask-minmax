The Comment by Ha et al. [cond-mat/0603787] criticizes our recent result
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 038701 (2006)] that the contact process (CP) on
uncorrelated scale-free (SF) networks does not behave according to
heterogeneous mean-field (MF) theory. This claim is based in Gaussian ansatz
that reproduces previously reported density fluctuations and numerical
simulations for a particular value of the degree exponent $\gamma$ that seem to
fit the MF prediction for the density decay exponent $\theta$ and a conjecture
of the contributors of the comment for the finite-size scaling exponente
$\alpha=\beta/ \nu_\perp$. By means of extensive simulations of the CP on
random neighbors (RN) SF networks we show that the MF prediction for $\theta4
is incorrect for small degree exponents, while the contributor's conjecture for
$\alpha$ is at best only approximately valid for the unphysical case of
uncorrelated networks with cut-off $k_c \sim N^{1/(\gamma-1)}$, which can only
be constructed in the RN version of SF networks. Therefore, the main conclusion
of our paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 038701 (2006)], the invalidity of MF theory
for real uncorrelated SF networks, remains unchallenged.
