The index coding problem is a fundamental transmission problem arising in
content distribution and wireless networks. Traditional approach to solve this
problem is to find heuristic/ approximation minimum clique partition solution
on an appropriately mapped graph of the index coding problem. In this paper we
study index code for unicast data flow for which we propose updated clique
index coding (UCIC) scheme, UCIC piggybacks additional information in the coded
symbol such that an unsatisfied client can update its cache. We show that UCIC
has higher coding gain than previously proposed index coding schemes, and it is
optimal for those instances where index code of minimum length is known.
