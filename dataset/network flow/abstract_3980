Network dynamics are typically presented as a time series of network
properties captured at each period. The current approach examines the dynamical
properties of transmission via novel measures on an integrated, temporally
extended network representation of interaction data across time. Because it
encodes time and interactions as network connections, static network measures
can be applied to this "temporal web" to reveal features of the dynamics
themselves. Here we provide the technical details and apply it to agent-based
implementations of the well-known SEIR and SEIS epidemiological models.
