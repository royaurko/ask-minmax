Applications such as traffic engineering and network provisioning can greatly
benefit from knowing, in real time, what is the largest input rate at which it
is possible to transmit on a given path without causing congestion. We consider
a probabilistic formulation for available bandwidth where the user specifies
the probability of achieving an output rate almost as large as the input rate.
We are interested in estimating and tracking the network-wide probabilistic
available bandwidth (PAB) on multiple paths simultaneously with minimal
overhead on the network. We propose a novel framework based on chirps, Bayesian
inference, belief propagation and active sampling to estimate the PAB. We also
consider the time evolution of the PAB by forming a dynamic model and designing
a tracking algorithm based on particle filters. We implement our method in a
lightweight and practical tool that has been deployed on the PlanetLab network
to do online experiments. We show through these experiments and simulations
that our approach outperforms block-based algorithms in terms of input rate
cost and probability of successful transmission.
