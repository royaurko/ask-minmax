Upper bounds are derived on the total variation distance between the
invariant distributions of two stochastic matrices differing on a subset W of
rows. Such bounds depend on three parameters: the mixing time and the minimal
expected hitting time on W for the Markov chain associated to one of the
matrices; and the escape time from W for the Markov chain associated to the
other matrix. These results, obtained through coupling techniques, prove
particularly useful in scenarios where W is a small subset of the state space,
even if the difference between the two matrices is not small in any norm.
Several applications to large-scale network problems are discussed, including
robustness of Google's PageRank algorithm, distributed averaging and consensus
algorithms, and interacting particle systems.
