In this paper, a new routing algorithm based on a flooding method is
introduced. Flooding techniques have been used previously, e.g. for
broadcasting the routing table in the ARPAnet [1] and other special purpose
networks [3][4][5]. However, sending data using flooding can often saturate the
network [2] and it is usually regarded as an inefficient broadcast mechanism.
Our approach is to flood a very short packet to explore an optimal route
without relying on a pre-established routing table, and an efficient flood
control algorithm to reduce the signalling traffic overhead. This is an
inherently robust mechanism in the face of a network configuration change,
achieves automatic load sharing across alternative routes and has potential to
solve many contemporary routing problems. An earlier version of this mechanism
was originally developed for virtual circuit establishment in the experimental
Caroline ATM LAN [6][7] at Monash University.
