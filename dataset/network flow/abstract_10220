We consider the convected Helmholtz equation modeling linear acoustic
propagation at a fixed frequency in a subsonic flow around a scattering object.
The flow is supposed to be uniform in the exterior domain far from the object,
and potential in the interior domain close to the object. Our key idea is the
reformulation of the original problem using the Prandtl--Glauert transformation
on the whole flow domain, yielding (i) the classical Helmholtz equation in the
exterior domain and (ii) an anisotropic diffusive PDE with skew-symmetric
first-order perturbation in the interior domain such that its transmission
condition at the coupling boundary naturally fits the Neumann condition from
the classical Helmholtz equation. Then, efficient off-the-shelf tools can be
used to perform the BEM-FEM coupling, leading to two novel variational
formulations for the convected Helmholtz equation. The first formulation
involves one surface unknown and can be affected by resonant frequencies, while
the second formulation avoids resonant frequencies and involves two surface
unknowns. Numerical simulations are presented to compare the two formulations.
