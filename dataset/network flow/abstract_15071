We numerically study a dynamical system model of an idiotypic immune network
with a small number of degrees of freedom. The model was originally introduced
by Varela et.al., and describes antibodies interacting in a body in order to
prepare for the invasion of external antigens.
  The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the direction of change in
the network system when antigens invade it. We investigate three models,
original model, a modified model and a modified model with a threshold of
concentration over which each antibody can recognize other antibodies. In all
these models, both chaotic and periodic states exist. In particular, we find
peculiar states organized in the network, the clustering state.
