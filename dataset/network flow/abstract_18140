Human collective intelligence has proved itself as an important factor in a
society's ability to accomplish large-scale behavioral feats. As societies have
grown in population-size, individuals have seen a decrease in their ability to
activeily participate in the problem-solving processes of the group.
Representative decision-making structures have been used as a modern solution
to society's inadequate information-processing infrastructure. With computer
and network technologies being further embedded within the fabric of society,
the implementation of a general-purpose societal-scale human-collective
problem-solving engine is envisioned as a means of furthering the
collective-intelligence potential of society. This paper provides both a novel
framework for creating collective intelligence systems and a method for
implementing a representative and expertise system based on social-network
theory.
