We report the rectification of a constant wave radio frequency (RF) current
by using a single-layer magnetic nanowire; a direct-current voltage is
resonantly generated when the RF current flows through the nanowire. The
mechanism of the rectification is discussed in terms of the spin torque diode
effect reported for magnetic tunnel junction devices and the rectification is
shown to be direct attributable to resonant spin wave excitation by the RF
current.
