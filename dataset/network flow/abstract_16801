We study the problem of buffer management in QoS-enabled network switches in
the bounded delay model where each packet is associated with a weight and a
deadline. We consider the more realistic situation where the network switch has
a finite buffer size. A 9.82-competitive algorithm is known for the case of
multiple buffers (Azar and Levy, SWAT'06). Recently, for the case of a single
buffer, a 3-competitive deterministic algorithm and a 2.618-competitive
randomized algorithm was known (Li, INFOCOM'09). In this paper we give a simple
deterministic 2-competitive algorithm for the case of a single buffer.
