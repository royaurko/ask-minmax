This paper explores the relationships between migration and trade using a
complex-network approach. We show that: (i) both weighted and binary versions
of the networks of international migration and trade are strongly correlated;
(ii) such correlations can be mostly explained by country economic/demographic
size and geographical distance; (iii) pairs of countries that are more central
in the international-migration network trade more.
