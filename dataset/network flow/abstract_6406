Positional and relational perspectives on network data have led to two
different research traditions in textual analysis and social network analysis,
respectively. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) focuses on the latent dimensions
in textual data; social network analysis (SNA) on the observable networks. The
two coupled topographies of information-processing in the network space and
meaning-processing in the vector space operate with different (nonlinear)
dynamics. The historical dynamics of information processing in observable
networks organizes the system into instantiations; the systems dynamics,
however, can be considered as self-organizing in terms of fluxes of
communication along the various dimensions that operate with different codes.
The development over time adds evolutionary differentiation to the historical
integration; a richer structure can process more complexity.
