This paper discusses the systematic use of product feedback information to
support life-cycle design approaches and provides guidelines for developing a
design at both the product and the system levels. Design activities are
surveyed in the light of the product life cycle, and the design information
flow is interpreted from a semiotic perspective. The natural evolution of a
design is considered, the notion of design expectations is introduced, and the
importance of evaluation of these expectations in dynamic environments is
argued. Possible strategies for reconciliation of the expectations and
environmental factors are described. An Internet-enabled technology is proposed
to monitor product functionality, usage, and operational environment and supply
the designer with relevant information. A pilot study of assessing design
expectations of a refrigerator is outlined, and conclusions are drawn.
