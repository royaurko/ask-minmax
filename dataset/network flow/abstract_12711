A modification of Koetter-Kschischang codes for random networks is presented
(these codes were also studied by Wang et al. in the context of authentication
problems). The new codes have higher information rate, while maintaining the
same error-correcting capabilities. An efficient error-correcting algorithm is
proposed for these codes.
