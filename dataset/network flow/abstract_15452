This paper describes the deployment of a large-scale study designed to
measure human interactions across a variety of communication channels, with
high temporal resolution and spanning multiple years - the Copenhagen Networks
Study. Specifically, we collect data on face-to-face interactions,
telecommunication, social networks, location, and background information
(personality, demographic, health, politics) for a densely connected population
of 1,000 individuals, using state-of-art smartphones as social sensors. Here we
provide an overview of the related work and describe the motivation and
research agenda driving the study. Additionally the paper details the
data-types measured, and the technical infrastructure in terms of both backend
and phone software, as well as an outline of the deployment procedures. We
document the participant privacy procedures and their underlying principles.
The paper is concluded with early results from data analysis, illustrating the
importance of multi-channel high-resolution approach to data collection.
