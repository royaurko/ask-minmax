Analyses of Chandra's first images of cooling flow clusters find smaller
cooling rates than previously thought. Cooling may be occurring preferentially
near regions of star formation in central cluster galaxies, where the local
cooling and star formation rates agree to within factors of a few. The radio
sources in central cluster galaxies are interacting with and are often
displacing the hot, intracluster gas. X-ray ``bubbles'' seen in Chandra images
are used to measure the amount of energy radio sources deposit into their
surroundings, and they may survive as fossil records of ancient radio activity.
The bubbles are vessels that transport magnetic fields from giant black holes
to the outskirts of clusters.
