We study the journey planning problem in public transit networks. Developing
efficient preprocessing-based speedup techniques for this problem has been
challenging: current approaches either require massive preprocessing effort or
provide limited speedups. Leveraging recent advances in Hub Labeling, the
fastest algorithm for road networks, we revisit the well-known time-expanded
model for public transit. Exploiting domain-specific properties, we provide
simple and efficient algorithms for the earliest arrival, profile, and
multicriteria problems, with queries that are orders of magnitude faster than
the state of the art.
