As technology scales, low power design has become a significant requirement
for SOC designers. Among the existing techniques, Multiple-Supply Voltage (MSV)
is a popular and effective method to reduce both dynamic and static power.
Besides, level shifters consume area and delay, and should be considered during
floorplanning. In this paper, we present a new floorplanning system, called
MVLSAF, to solve multi-voltage and level shifter assignment problem. We use a
convex cost network flow algorithm to assign arbitrary number of legal working
voltages and a minimum cost flow algorithm to handle level-shifter assignment.
The experimental results show MVLSAF is effective.
