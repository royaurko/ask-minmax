EcoTRADE is a multi player network game of a virtual biodiversity credit
market. Each player controls the land use of a certain amount of parcels on a
virtual landscape. The biodiversity credits of a particular parcel depend on
neighboring parcels, which may be owned by other players. The game can be used
to study the strategies of players in experiments or classroom games and also
as a communication tool for stakeholders participating in credit markets that
include spatially interdependent credits.
