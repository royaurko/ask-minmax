Mathematical modeling at the level of the full cardiovascular system requires
the numerical approximation of solutions to a one-dimensional nonlinear
hyperbolic system describing flow in a single vessel. This model is often
simulated by computationally intensive methods like finite elements and
discontinuous Galerkin, while some recent applications require more efficient
approaches (e.g. for real-time clinical decision support, phenomena occurring
over multiple cardiac cycles, iterative solutions to optimization/inverse
problems, and uncertainty quantification). Further, the high speed of pressure
waves in blood vessels greatly restricts the time step needed for stability in
explicit schemes. We address both cost and stability by presenting an efficient
and unconditionally stable method for approximating solutions to diagonal
nonlinear hyperbolic systems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given
along with a comparison of our method to a discontinuous Galerkin
implementation. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed method by
implementing it on small and large arterial networks of vessels whose elastic
and geometrical parameters are physiologically relevant.
