We define and study the noncommutative spectral flow for paths of regular
selfadjoint Fredholm operators on a countably generated Hilbert C*-module. We
give an axiomatic description and discuss some applications. One of them is the
definition of a noncommutative Maslov index for paths of Lagrangians which
appears in a splitting formula for the spectral flow. Analogously we study the
spectral flow for odd operators on a graded module.
