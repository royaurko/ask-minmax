In this paper we prove the following topological classification result for
flows on real projective space induced by linear flows on Euclidean space: Two
flows on the projective space P(V) of a finite-dimensional real vector space V,
induced by endomorphisms A and B of V, are topologically conjugate if and only
if the Jordan structures of A and B coincide except for the real parts of the
eigenvalues whose values may differ but whose order and multiplicities must
agree. Our proof is mainly based on ideas of Kuiper who considered the
discrete-time analogue of this classification problem. We also correct a
mistake in Kuiper's proof.
