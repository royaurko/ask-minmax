We consider the electronic transport in multi-terminal mesoscopic networks of
weakly disordered metallic wires. After a brief description of the classical
transport, we analyze the weak localisation (WL) correction to the
four-terminal resistances, which involves an integration of the Cooperon over
the wires with proper weights. We provide an interpretation of these weights in
terms of classical transport properties. We illustrate the formalism on
examples and show that weak localisation to four-terminal conductances may
become large in some situations. In a second part, we study the correlations of
four-terminal resistances and show that integration of Diffuson and Cooperon
inside the network involves the same weights as the WL. The formulae are
applied to multiconnected wire geometries.
