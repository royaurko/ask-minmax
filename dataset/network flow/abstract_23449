We study two dimensional triangular elastic lattices in a background of point
disorder, excluding dislocations (tethered network). Using both (replica
symmetric) static and (equilibrium) dynamic renormalization group for the
corresponding $N=2$ component model, we find a transition to a glass phase for
$T < T_g$, described by a plane of perturbative fixed points. The growth
of displacements is found to be asymptotically isotropic with $u_T^2 \sim u_L^2
\sim A_1 \ln^2 r$, with universal subdominant anisotropy $u_T^2 - u_L^2 \sim
A_2 \ln r$. where $A_1$ and $A_2$ depend continuously on temperature and the
Poisson ratio $\sigma$. We also obtain the continuously varying dynamical
exponent $z$. For the Cardy-Ostlund $N=1$ model, a particular case of the above
model, we point out a discrepancy in the value of $A_1$ with other published
results in the litterature. We find that our result reconciles the order of
magnitude of the RG predictions with the most recent numerical simulations.
