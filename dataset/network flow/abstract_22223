We propose a simple dynamic model of polymers under shear with an anisotropic
mobility tensor. We calculate the shear viscosity, the rheo-dielectric response
function, and the parallel relaxation modulus under shear flow deduced from our
model. We utilize recently developed linear response theories for
nonequilibrium systems to calculate linear response functions. Our results are
qualitatively consistent with experimental results. We show that our
anisotropic mobility model can reproduce essential dynamical nature of polymers
under shear qualitatively. We compare our model with other models or theories
such as the convective constraint release model or nonequilibrium linear
response theories.
