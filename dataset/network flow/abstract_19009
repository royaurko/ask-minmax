With the rapid development of high-speed railway (HSR), how to provide the
passengers with multimedia services has attracted increasing attention. A key
issue is to develop an effective scheduling algorithm for multiple services
with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we
investigate the downlink service scheduling problem in HSR network taking
account of end-to-end deadline constraints and successfully packet delivery
ratio requirements. Firstly, by exploiting the deterministic high-speed train
trajectory, we present a time-distance mapping in order to obtain the highly
dynamic link capacity effectively. Next, a novel service model is developed for
deadline constrained services with delivery ratio requirements, which enables
us to turn the delivery ratio requirement into a single queue stability
problem. Based on the Lyapunov drift, the optimal scheduling problem is
formulated and the corresponding scheduling service algorithm is proposed by
stochastic network optimization approach. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional schemes in terms of QoS
requirements.
