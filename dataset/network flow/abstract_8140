We study transport of a weakly diffusive pollutant (a passive scalar) by
thermoconvective flow in a fluid-saturated horizontal porous layer heated from
below under frozen parametric disorder. In the presence of disorder (random
frozen inhomogeneities of the heating or of macroscopic properties of the
porous matrix), spatially localized flow patterns appear below the convective
instability threshold of the system without disorder. Thermoconvective flows
crucially effect the transport of a pollutant along the layer, especially when
its molecular diffusion is weak. The effective (or eddy) diffusivity also
allows to observe the transition from a set of localized currents to an almost
everywhere intense "global" flow. We present results of numerical calculation
of the effective diffusivity and discuss them in the context of localization of
fluid currents and the transition to a "global" flow. Our numerical findings
are in a good agreement with the analytical theory we develop for the limit of
a small molecular diffusivity and sparse domains of localized currents. Though
the results are obtained for a specific physical system, they are relevant for
a broad variety of fluid dynamical systems.
