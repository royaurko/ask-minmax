We compare the bulk flow of the SMAC sample to the predictions of popular
cosmological models and to other recent large-scale peculiar velocity surveys.
Both analyses account for aliasing of small-scale power due to the sparse and
non-uniform sampling of the surveys. We conclude that the SMAC bulk flow is in
marginal conflict with flat COBE-normalized Lambda-CDM models which fit the
cluster abundance constraint. However, power spectra which are steeper
shortward of the peak are consistent with all of the above constraints. When
recent large-scale peculiar velocity surveys are compared, we conclude that all
measured bulk flows (with the possible exception of that of Lauer & Postman)
are consistent with each other given the errors, provided the latter allow for
`cosmic covariance'. A rough estimate of the mean bulk flow of all surveys
(except Lauer & Postman) is ~400 km/s towards l=270, b=0.
