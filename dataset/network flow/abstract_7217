The use of RFID tag which identifies a thing and an object will be expanded
with progress of ubiquitous society, and it is necessary to study how to
construct RFID network system as a social infrastructure like the Internet.
First, this paper proposes the virtualization method of RFID tag network system
to enable the same physical RFID network system to be used by multiple
different service systems. The system virtualization not only reduces the
system cost but also can dramatically reduce the installation space of physical
readers and the operation cost. It is proposed that all equipments in the RFID
network system except RFID tag could be shared with the conventional virtual
technologies. Then, this paper proposes the conditional tag ID processing and
the efficient tag ID transmission method which can greatly reduce the
processing time and processing load in RFID tag Infrastructure network The
conditional tag ID processing allows that tag ID is valid only at a certain
time zone of day or in a certain area. The efficient tag ID transmission method
uses the virtual network address of the service center as a part of the ID of
an RF tag, which allows the direct ID forwarding to the service center.
