We study aggregation as a mechanism for the creation of complex networks. In
this evolution process vertices merge together, which increases the number of
highly connected hubs. We study a range of complex network architectures
produced by the aggregation. Fat-tailed (in particular, scale-free)
distributions of connections are obtained both for networks with a finite
number of vertices and growing networks. We observe a strong variation of a
network structure with growing density of connections and find the phase
transition of the condensation of edges. Finally, we demonstrate the importance
of structural correlations in these networks.
