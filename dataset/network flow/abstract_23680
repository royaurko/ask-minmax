The mechanism of propulsion of host bacteria under the action of actin gel
networks is examined by means of a continuum model of the dynamics of F-actin
concentration. The model includes the elasticity of the network, its attachment
to the host and the polymerization at the interface with it. A formula for the
cruise velocity is derived wherefrom the contributions of elasticity and
polymerization are made explicit.
  The velocity is proportional to the size of the active portion of the gel,
and in turn it elongates its shape. It is shown how a finite latency time is
needed for the onset of motion: the related threshold condition is explicitly
given. It is numerically found that at steady state the velocity has a
pulsating behavior, with sudden decelerations and subsequent recoveries: this
unveils the dominant role of the elastic forces in propulsion.
