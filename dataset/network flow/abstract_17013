In this chapter, concepts related to information and computation are reviewed
in the context of human computation. A brief introduction to information theory
and different types of computation is given. Two examples of human computation
systems, online social networks and Wikipedia, are used to illustrate how these
can be described and compared in terms of information and computation.
