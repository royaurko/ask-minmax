Mesoscopic correlations are observed in the polarization of microwave
radiation transmitted through a random waveguide. These measurements, supported
by diagrammatic theory, permit the unambiguous identification of short, long,
and infinite range components in the intensity correlation function, as well as
an additional frequency-independent component.
