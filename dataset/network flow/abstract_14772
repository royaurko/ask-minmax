We consider renormalization group flows between conformal field theories in
five (six) dimensions with a string (M-theory) dual. By compactifying on a
circle (torus) with appropriate boundary conditions, we obtain continuous
families of confining four-dimensional theories parametrized by the ratio
$\Lambda_{\rm {\tiny flow}}/\Lambda_{\rm \tiny{QCD}}$, with $\Lambda_{\rm
\tiny{flow}}$ the scale at which the flow between fixed points takes place and
$\Lambda_{\rm \tiny{QCD}}$ the confinement scale. We construct the dual
geometries explicitly and compute the spectrum of scalar bound states
(glueballs). We find a `universal' subset of states common to all the models.
We comment on the modifications of these models, and the corresponding
fine-tuning, required for a parametrically light `dilaton' state to be present.
We also comment on some aspects of these theories as probed by extended objects
such as strings and branes.
