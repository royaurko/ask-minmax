It is a well known fact that metastable states of very high throughput and hysteresis effects exist in traffic flow, which the simple cellular automaton model of traffic flow and its continuous generalization fail to reproduce. It is shown that the model can be generalized to give a one-parametric family of models, a part of which reproduces the metastable states and the hysteresis. The models that have that property and those that do not that are separated by a transition that can be clearly identified. Received 17 October 1996
