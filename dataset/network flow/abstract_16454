Quasisymmetric stellarators are a type of optimized stellarators for which
flows are undamped to lowest order in an expansion in the normalized Larmor
radius. However, perfect quasisymmetry is impossible. Since large flows may be
desirable as a means to reduce turbulent transport, it is important to know
when a stellarator can be considered to be sufficiently close to quasisymmetry.
The answer to this question depends strongly on the size of the spatial
gradients of the deviation from quasisymmetry and on the collisionality regime.
Recently, formal criteria for closeness to quasisymmetry have been derived in a
variety of situations. In particular, the case of deviations with large
gradients was solved in the $1/\nu$ regime. Denoting by $\alpha$ a parameter
that gives the size of the deviation from quasisymmetry, it was proven that
particle fluxes do not scale with $\alpha^{3/2}$, as typically claimed, but
with $\alpha$. It was also shown that ripple wells are not necessarily the main
cause of transport. This paper reviews those works and presents a new result in
another collisionality regime, in which particles trapped in ripple wells are
collisional and the rest are collisionless.
