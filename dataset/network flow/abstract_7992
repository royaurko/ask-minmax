We consider a fluid dynamo model generated by the flow on both sides of a
moving layer. The magnetic permeability of the layer is larger than that of the
flow. We show that there exists an optimum value of magnetic permeability for
which the critical magnetic Reynolds number for dynamo onset is smaller than
for a nonmagnetic material and also smaller than for a layer of infinite
magnetic permeability. We present a mechanism that provides an explanation for
recent experimental results. A similar effect occurs when the electrical
conductivity of the layer is large.
