We show that the infinite percolating cluster (with density P_inf) of
central-force networks is composed of: a fractal stress-bearing backbone (Pb)
and; rigid but unstressed ``dangling ends'' which occupy a finite
volume-fraction of the lattice (Pd). Near the rigidity threshold pc, there is
then a first-order transition in P_inf = Pd + Pb, while Pb is
second-order with exponent Beta'. A new mean field theory shows
Beta'(mf)=1/2, while simulations of triangular lattices give Beta'_tr = 0.255
+/- 0.03.
