RHIC data have shown robust collective flows, strong jet and charm quenching,
and charm flow.
  Recently ``conical flows'' from damped jets were seen. Non-Abelian classical
strongly coupled plasmas were introduced and studied via molecular dynamics,
with first results for its transport (diffusion and viscosity) reported.
  Quantum-mechanical studies reveal the survival for $T>T_c$ of the lowest
binary states, including colored ones, and also of some manybody ones such as
baryons. ``Polymeric chains'' $\bar q.g.g... q$ are also bound in some range of
$T$, perhaps the progenitors of the QCD strings.
  AdS/CFT applications advanced to a completely new level of detail: they now
include studies of thermal heavy quark motion, jet quenching and even conical
flow. Confinement is however still beyond simply strong coupling: its de-facto
inclusion the so called AdS/QCD approach is so far added as a model, while true
understanding may probably only come from further insights into the monopole
dynamics.
