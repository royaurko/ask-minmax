We study renormalization group flows among three dimensional superconformal
gauge theories which closely resemble the renowned Klebanov-Witten flow in four
dimensions. In the large N limit, each theory appearing in the flow is
holographically dual to M-theory on AdS4 times a toric Sasaki-Einstein
seven-manifold. The theories are obtained through the so-called flavoring
method, which adds some fundamental matter fields to the dimensionally reduced
Klebanov-Witten theories. We reconfirm the matching between the gauge theories
and the dual geometries by comparing the chiral ring structure. As a more
refined test of the flows, we compute the three-sphere partition function of
the gauge theories. The square of the free energy, inversely proportional to
the volume of the seven-manifold, decreases by a universal ratio 16/27 for all
flows considered in this paper.
