In the normal one-temperature plasma the motion of ions is usually neglected
when calculating the Bremsstrahlung radiation of the plasma. Here we calculate
the Bremsstrahlung radiation of a two-temperature plasma by taking into account
of the motion of ions. Our results show that the total radiation power is
always lower if the motion of ions is considered. We also apply the
two-temperature Bremsstrahlung radiation mechanism for an analytical
Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) model; we find the two-temperature
correction to the total Bremsstrahlung radiation for ADAF is negligible.
