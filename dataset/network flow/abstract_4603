Data transfer in opportunistic Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) must rely on
unscheduled sporadic meetings between nodes. The main challenge in these
networks is to develop a mechanism based on which nodes can learn to make
nearly optimal forwarding decision rules despite having no a-priori knowledge
of the network topology. The forwarding mechanism should ideally result in a
high delivery probability, low average latency and efficient usage of the
network resources. In this paper, we propose both centralized and decentralized
single-copy message forwarding algorithms that, under relatively strong
assumptions about the networks behaviour, minimize the expected latencies from
any node in the network to a particular destination. After proving the
optimality of our proposed algorithms, we develop a decentralized algorithm
that involves a recursive maximum likelihood procedure to estimate the meeting
rates. We confirm the improvement that our proposed algorithms make in the
system performance through numerical simulations on datasets from synthetic and
real-world opportunistic networks.
