We obtain explicit solutions of the mean curvature flow in some submanifolds
of the Euclidean space. We give particularly an explicit solution of the flow
of a hypersurface in the Lagrangian self-expander $L$ which is constructed in
the article of Joyce, Lee and Tsui and show that it converge to a minimal one.
