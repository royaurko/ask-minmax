We investigate steam condensation induced water hammer (CIWH) phenomena and
present new theoretical results. We use the WAHA3 model based on two-phase flow
six first-order partial differential equations that present one dimensional,
surface averaged mass, momentum and energy balances. A second order accurate
high-resolution shock-capturing numerical scheme was applied with different
kind of limiters in the numerical calculations. The applied two-fluid model
shows some similarities to Relap5 which is widely used in the nuclear industry
to simulate nuclear power plant accidents. This model was validated with
different CIWH experiments which were performed in the PMK-2 facility, which is
a full-pressure thermo-hydraulic model of the nuclear power plant of
VVER-440/312 type in the Energy Research Center of the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences in Budapest and in the Rosa facility in Japan. In our recent study we
show the first part of a planned large database which will give us the upper
and lower flooding mass flow rates for various pipe geometries where CIWH can
happen. Such a reliable database would be a great help for future reactor
constructions and scheming.
