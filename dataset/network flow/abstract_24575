Spectrum sensing is a fundamental component of cognitive radio. How to
promptly sense the presence of primary users is a key issue to a cognitive
radio network. The time requirement is critical in that violating it will cause
harmful interference to the primary user, leading to a system-wide failure. The
motivation of our work is to provide an effective spectrum sensing method to
detect primary users as soon as possible. In the language of streaming based
real-time data processing, short-time means small-sized data. In this paper, we
propose a cumulative spectrum sensing method dealing with limited sized data. A
novel method of covariance matrix estimation is utilized to approximate the
true covariance matrix. The theoretical analysis is derived based on
concentration inequalities and random matrix theory to support the claims of
detection performance. Comparisons between the proposed method and other
traditional approaches, judged by the simulation using a captured digital TV
signal, show that this proposed method can operate either using smaller-sized
data or working under lower SNR environment.
