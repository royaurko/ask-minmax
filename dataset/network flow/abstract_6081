Average trapping time (ATT) is central in the trapping problem since it is a
key indicator characterizing the efficiency of the problem. Previous research
has provided the scaling of a lower bound of the ATT for random walks in
general networks with a deep trap. However, it is still not well understood in
which networks this minimal scaling can be reached. Particularly, explicit
quantitative results for ATT in such networks, even in a specific network, are
lacking, in spite that such networks shed light on the design for optimal
networks with the highest trapping efficiency. In this paper, we study the
trapping problem taking place on a hierarchical scale-free network with a
perfect trap. We focus on four representative cases with the immobile trap
located at the root, a peripheral node, a neighbor of the root with a single
connectivity, and a farthest node from the root, respectively. For all the four
cases, we obtain the closed-form formulas for the ATT, as well as its leading
scalings. We show that for all the four cases of trapping problems, the
dominating scalings of ATT can reach the predicted minimum scalings. This work
deepens the understanding of behavior of trapping in scale-free networks, and
is helpful for designing networks with the most efficient transport process.
