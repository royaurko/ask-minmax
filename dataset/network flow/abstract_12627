We consider a spectrum sharing scenario, where a secondary network coexists
with a primary network of multiple transceivers. The secondary network consists
of an energy-constrained decode-and-forward secondary relay which assists the
communication between a secondary transmitter and a destination in the presence
of the interference from multiple primary transmitters. The secondary relay
harvests energy from the received radio-frequency signals, which include the
information signal from the secondary transmitter and the primary interference.
The harvested energy is then used to decode the secondary information and
forward it to the secondary destination. At the relay, we adopt a time
switching policy due to its simplicity that switches between the energy
harvesting and information decoding over time. Specifically, we derive a
closed-form expression for the secondary outage probability under the primary
outage constraint and the peak power constraint at both secondary transmitter
and relay. In addition, we investigate the effect of the number of primary
transceivers on the optimal energy harvesting duration that minimizes the
secondary outage probability. By utilizing the primary interference as a useful
energy source in the energy harvesting phase, the secondary network achieves a
better outage performance.
