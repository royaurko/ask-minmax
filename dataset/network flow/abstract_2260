We consider the sizing of network buffers in 802.11 based networks. Wireless
networks face a number of fundamental issues that do not arise in wired
networks. We demonstrate that the use of fixed size buffers in 802.11 networks
inevitably leads to either undesirable channel under-utilization or unnecessary
high delays. We present two novel dynamic buffer sizing algorithms that achieve
high throughput while maintaining low delay across a wide range of network
conditions. Experimental measurements demonstrate the utility of the proposed
algorithms in a production WLAN and a lab testbed.
