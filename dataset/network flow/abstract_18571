There is a trend of applying machine learning algorithms to cognitive radio.
One fundamental open problem is to determine how and where these algorithms are
useful in a cognitive radio network. In radar and sensing signal processing,
the control of degrees of freedom (DOF)---or dimensionality---is the first
step, called pre-processing. In this paper, the combination of dimensionality
reduction with SVM is proposed apart from only applying SVM for classification
in cognitive radio. Measured Wi-Fi signals with high signal to noise ratio
(SNR) are employed to the experiments. The DOF of Wi-Fi signals is extracted by
dimensionality reduction techniques. Experimental results show that with
dimensionality reduction, the performance of classification is much better with
fewer features than that of without dimensionality reduction. The error rates
of classification with only one feature of the proposed algorithm can match the
error rates of 13 features of the original data. The proposed method will be
further tested in our cognitive radio network testbed.
