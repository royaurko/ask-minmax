We derive variational equations to analyze the stability of synchronization
for coupled near-identical oscillators. To study the effect of parameter
mismatch on the stability in a general fashion, we define master stability
equations and associated master stability functions, which are independent of
the network structure. In particular, we present several examples of coupled
near-identical Lorenz systems configured in small networks (a ring graph and
sequence networks) with a fixed parameter mismatch and a large Barabasi-Albert
scale-free network with random parameter mismatch. We find that several
different network architectures permit similar results despite various mismatch
patterns.
