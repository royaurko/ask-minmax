Scores of on-going microlensing events are now announced yearly by the
microlensing discovery teams OGLE, MACHO and EROS. These early warning systems
have allowed other international microlensing networks to focus considerable
resources on intense photometric - and occasionally spectroscopic - monitoring
of microlensing events. Early results include: metallicity measurements of main
sequence Galactic bulge stars; limb darkening determinations for stars in the
Bulge and Small Magellanic Cloud; proper motion measurements that constrain
microlens identity; and constraints on Jovian-mass planets orbiting (presumably
stellar) lenses. These results and auxiliary science such as variable star
studies and optical identification of gamma ray bursts are reviewed.
