By direct Monte-Carlo simulations it is shown that the anisotropic flows can
be successfully described in the colour string picture with fusion and
percolation provided anisotropy of particle emission from the fused string is
taken into account. Quenching of produced particles in the strong colour field
of the string is the basic mechanism for this anisotropy. The concrete
realization of this mechanism is borrowed from the QED. Due to dependence of
this mechanism on the external field strength the found flows grow with energy,
with values for $v_2$ at LHC energies greater by ~15% than at RHIC energies.
