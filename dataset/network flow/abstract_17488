We define the metamagnetic phase transition of itinerant electrons controlled
by the spin injection mechanism. The current flow between a ferromagnetic metal
and a metamagnetic metal produces the non-equilibrium shift of chemical
potential for spin up and spin down electrons that acts as an effective
magnetic field driving the metamagnetic transition.
