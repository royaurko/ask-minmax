The linear non-modal kinetic theory of the kinetic drift-Alfven instability
of plasma shear flows reveals the temporal non-modal growth with growing with
time growth rate. The turbulent scattering of the sheared modes on ions
accelerates this growth. The instability ceases its growth when the coupling of
the drift and Alfven waves violates due to the changing with time frequencies
of the drift and Alfven waves in shear flow.
