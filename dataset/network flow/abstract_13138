Supersonic flow of Bose-Einstein condensate past macroscopic obstacles is
studied theoretically. It is shown that in the case of large obstacles the
Cherenkov cone transforms into a stationary spatial shock wave which consists
of a number of spatial dark solitons. Analytical theory is developed for the
case of obstacles having a form of a slender body. This theory explains
qualitatively the properties of such shocks observed in recent experiments on
nonlinear dynamics of condensates of dilute alkali gases.
