We have obtained a Halpha position-velocity cube from Fabry-Perot
interferometric observations of the HH 110 flow. We analyze the results in
terms of anisotropic wavelet transforms, from which we derive the spatial
distribution of the knots as well as their characteristic sizes (along and
across the outflow axis). We then study the spatial behaviour of the line width
and the central radial velocity. The results are interpreted in terms of a
simple ``mean flow+turbulent eddy'' jet/wake model. We find that most of the
observed kinematics appear to be a direct result of the mean flow, on which are
superposed low amplitude (35 km/s) turbulent velocities.
