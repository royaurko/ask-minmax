In this paper, we first introduce the weighted forward reduced volume of
Ricci flow. The weighted forward reduced volume, which related to expanders of
Ricci flow, is well-defined on noncompact manifolds and monotone non-increasing
under Ricci flow. Moreover, we show that, just the same as the Perelman's
reduced volume, the weighted reduced volume entropy has the value
$(4\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}}$ if and only if the Ricci flow is the trivial flow on
flat Euclidean space.
