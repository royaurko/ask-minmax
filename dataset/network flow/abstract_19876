It is shown that the dependence of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) on mean
arterial blood pressure (MABP) can be described with a simple model having the
following assumptions. Below certain MABP (denoted as MABP1) there are no
autoregulatory or feedback mechanisms influencing CBF. Between MABP1 and MABP2
(MABP at which breakthrough accurs) there is a linear (on MABP) dependent
feedback with a sloap depending very much on the individual considered. The
classical autoregulation model with a plateau in between MABP1 and MABP2 is a
particular case of this model. The model describes well the experiments
performed on dogs (Harper 1966), for which the individual feedback sloap
parameter varied to great extent, indicating the importance of mesurments on
individuals against averaged mesurments (or measurments on diffent individuals)
which superficially support the classical autoregulation. New effect of
decreased CBF, while increasing MABP, was observed.
