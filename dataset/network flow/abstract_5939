In this paper we present an original approach for community detection in
complex networks. The approach belongs to the family of seed-centric
algorithms. However, instead of expanding communities around selected seeds as
most of existing approaches do, we explore here applying an ensemble clustering
approach to different network partitions derived from ego-centered communities
computed for each selected seed. Ego-centered communities are themselves
computed applying a recently proposed ensemble ranking based approach that
allow to efficiently combine various local modularities used to guide a greedy
optimisation process. Results of first experiments on real world networks for
which a ground truth decomposition into communities are known, argue for the
validity of our approach.
