We study the vulnerability of dominating sets against random and targeted
node removals in complex networks. While small, cost-efficient dominating sets
play a significant role in controllability and observability of these networks,
a fixed and intact network structure is always implicitly assumed. We find that
cost-efficiency of dominating sets optimized for small size alone comes at a
price of being vulnerable to damage; domination in the remaining network can be
severely disrupted, even if a small fraction of dominator nodes are lost. We
develop two new methods for finding flexible dominating sets, allowing either
adjustable overall resilience, or dominating set size, while maximizing the
dominated fraction of the remaining network after the attack. We analyze the
efficiency of each method on synthetic scale-free networks, as well as real
complex networks.
