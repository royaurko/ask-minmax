Exact queueing analysis of erasure networks with network coding in a finite
buffer regime is an extremely hard problem due to the large number of states in
the network. In such networks, packets are lost due to either link erasures or
due to blocking due to full buffers. In this paper, a block-by-block random
linear network coding scheme with feedback on the links is selected for
reliability and more importantly guaranteed decoding of each block. We propose
a novel method that iteratively estimates the performance parameters of the
network and more importantly reduces the computational complexity compared to
the exact analysis. The proposed framework yields an accurate estimate of the
distribution of buffer occupancies at the intermediate nodes using which we
obtain analytical expressions for network throughput and delay distribution of
a block of packets.
