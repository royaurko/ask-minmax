Energy-efficiency, high data rates and secure communications are essential
requirements of the future wireless networks. In this paper, optimizing the
secrecy energy efficiency is considered. The optimal beamformer is designed for
a MISO system with and without considering the minimum required secrecy rate.
Further, the optimal power control in a SISO system is carried out using an
efficient iterative method, and this is followed by analyzing the trade-off
between the secrecy energy efficiency and the secrecy rate for both MISO and
SISO systems.
