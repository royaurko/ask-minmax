Pedestrian dynamics exhibits various collective phenomena. Here we study
bidirectional pedestrian flow in a floor field cellular automaton model. Under
certain conditions, lane formation is observed. Although it has often been
studied qualitatively, e.g., as a test for the realism of a model, there are
almost no quantitative results, neither empirically nor theoretically. As basis
for a quantitative analysis we introduce an order parameter which is adopted
from the analysis of colloidal suspensions. This allows to determine a phase
diagram for the system where four different states (free flow, disorder, lanes,
gridlock) can be distinguished. Although the number of lanes formed is
fluctuating, lanes are characterized by a typical density. It is found that the
basic floor field model overestimates the tendency towards a gridlock compared
to experimental bounds. Therefore an anticipation mechanism is introduced which
reduces the jamming probability.
