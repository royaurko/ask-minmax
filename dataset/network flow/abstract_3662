In this talk I concentrate on two topics closely related to the understanding
of the energy and the system size dependence of the elliptic flow:
determination of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) ``free'' from the effects of
non-flow and flow fluctuations, and the role of fluctuations in the initial
eccentricity of the overlap region. I introduce a new approach for the analysis
of the distribution in flow vector, $dP/dq_n$, namely, I propose to use the
Bessel Transform of this ditribution. I show that the Bessel Transform method
is similar to the Lee-Yang Zeroes method, and is very transparent in its
meaning and applications.
