In near future, anticipated large number of mobile users may introduce very
large centralized databases and increase end-to-end delays in location
registration and call delivery on HLR-VLR database and will become infeasible.
After observing several problems we propose some guidelines. Multitree
distributed database, high throughput index structure, memory oriented database
organization are used. Location management guidelines for moving user in
overlapping network, neighbor discovery protocol (NDP), and global roaming rule
are adopted. Analytic model and examples are presented to evaluate the
efficiency of proposed guidelines.
