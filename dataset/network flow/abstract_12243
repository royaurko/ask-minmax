In this paper we focus on one critical issue in mobile ad hoc networks that
is multicast routing and propose a mesh based on demand multicast routing
protocol for Ad-Hoc networks with QoS (quality of service) support. Then a
model was presented which is used for create a local recovering mechanism in
order to joining the nodes to multi sectional groups at the minimized time and
method for security in this protocol we present .
