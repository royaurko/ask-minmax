We study plasma flows above pulsar polar caps using time-dependent
simulations of plasma particles in the self-consistent electric field. The flow
behavior is controlled by the dimensionless parameter alpha=(j/c rho_GJ) where
j is the electric current density and rho_GJ is the Goldreich-Julian charge
density. The region of the polar cap where 0<alpha<1 is a "dead zone" --- in
this zone particle acceleration is inefficient and pair creation is not
expected even for young, rapidly rotating pulsars. Pulsars with polar caps near
the rotation axis are predicted to have a hollow-cone structure of radio
emission, as the dead zone occupies the central part of the polar cap. Our
results apply to charge-separated flows of electrons (j<0) or ions (j>0). In
the latter case, we consider the possibility of a mixed flow consisting of
different ion species, and observe the development of two-stream instability.
The dead zone at the polar cap is essential for the development of an outer gap
near the null surface rho_GJ=0.
