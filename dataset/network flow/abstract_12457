We study a graph-theoretic property known as robustness, which plays a key
role in certain classes of dynamics on networks (such as resilient consensus,
contagion and bootstrap percolation). This property is stronger than other
graph properties such as connectivity and minimum degree in that one can
construct graphs with high connectivity and minimum degree but low robustness.
However, we show that the notions of connectivity and robustness coincide on
common random graph models for complex networks (Erdos-Renyi, geometric random,
and preferential attachment graphs). More specifically, the properties share
the same threshold function in the Erdos-Renyi model, and have the same values
in one-dimensional geometric graphs and preferential attachment networks. This
indicates that a variety of purely local diffusion dynamics will be effective
at spreading information in such networks. Although graphs generated according
to the above constructions are inherently robust, we also show that it is
coNP-complete to determine whether any given graph is robust to a specified
extent.
