We study the elliptic flow coefficient v_2(eta,b) in Au+Au collisions at
sqrt(s)=200 A GeV as a function of pseudorapidity eta and impact parameter b.
Using a hybrid approach which combines early ideal fluid dynamical evolution
with late hadronic rescattering, we demonstrate strong dissipative effects from
the hadronic rescattering stage on the elliptic flow. With Glauber model
initial conditions, hadronic dissipation is shown to be sufficient to fully
explain the differences between measured v_2 values and ideal hydrodynamic
predictions. Initial conditions based on the Color Glass Condensate model
generate larger elliptic flow and seem to require additional dissipation during
the early quark-gluon plasma stage in order to achieve agreement with
experiment.
