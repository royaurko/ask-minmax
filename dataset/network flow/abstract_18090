We calculate the mean neighboring degree function $\bar k_{\rm{nn}}(k)$ and
the mean clustering function $C(k)$ of vertices with degree $k$ as a function
of $k$ in finite scale-free random networks through the static model. While
both are independent of $k$ when the degree exponent $\gamma \geq 3$, they show
the crossover behavior for $2 < \gamma < 3$ from $k$-independent behavior for
small $k$ to $k$-dependent behavior for large $k$. The $k$-dependent behavior
is analytically derived. Such a behavior arises from the prevention of
self-loops and multiple edges between each pair of vertices. The analytic
results are confirmed by numerical simulations. We also compare our results
with those obtained from a growing network model, finding that they behave
differently from each other.
