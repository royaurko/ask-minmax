We show that the European airspace can be represented as a multi-scale
traffic network whose nodes are airports, sectors, or navigation points and
links are defined and weighted according to the traffic of flights between the
nodes. By using a unique database of the air traffic in the European airspace,
we investigate the architecture of these networks with a special emphasis on
their community structure. We propose that unsupervised network community
detection algorithms can be used to monitor the current use of the airspaces
and improve it by guiding the design of new ones. Specifically, we compare the
performance of three community detection algorithms, also by using a null model
which takes into account the spatial distance between nodes, and we discuss
their ability to find communities that could be used to define new control
units of the airspace.
