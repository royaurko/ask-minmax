In this work, we investigate a model of an adaptive networked dynamical
system, where the coupling strengths among phase oscillators coevolve with the
phase states. It is shown that in this model the oscillators can spontaneously
differentiate into two dynamical groups after a long time evolution. Within
each group, the oscillators have similar phases, while oscillators in different
groups have approximately opposite phases. The network gradually converts from
the initial random structure with a uniform distribution of connection
strengths into a modular structure which is characterized by strong intra
connections and weak inter connections. Furthermore, the connection strengths
follow a power law distribution, which is a natural consequence of the
coevolution of the network and the dynamics. Interestingly, it is found that if
the inter connections are weaker than a certain threshold, the two dynamical
groups will almost decouple and evolve independently. These results are helpful
in further understanding the empirical observations in many social and
biological networks.
