The last decade has seen the parallel emergence in computational neuroscience
and machine learning of neural network structures which spread the input signal
randomly to a higher dimensional space; perform a nonlinear activation; and
then solve for a regression or classification output by means of a mathematical
pseudoinverse operation. In the field of neuromorphic engineering, these
methods are increasingly popular for synthesizing biologically plausible neural
networks, but the "learning method" - computation of the pseudoinverse by
singular value decomposition - is problematic both for biological plausibility
and because it is not an online or an adaptive method. We present an online or
incremental method of computing the pseudoinverse, which we argue is
biologically plausible as a learning method, and which can be made adaptable
for non-stationary data streams. The method is significantly more
memory-efficient than the conventional computation of pseudoinverses by
singular value decomposition.
