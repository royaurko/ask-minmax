We show that the recently constructed holographic duals of conformal
non-relativistic theories behave hydrodynamically at long distances, and
construct the gravitational dual of fluid flows in a long-wavelength
approximation. We compute the thermal conductivity of the holographic conformal
non-relativistic fluid. The corresponding Prandtl number is equal to one.
