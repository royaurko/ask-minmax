This paper presents a secure communication application called
DiscoverFriends. Its purpose is to communicate to a group of online friends
while bypassing their respective social networking servers under a mobile ad
hoc network environment. DiscoverFriends leverages Bloom filters and a hybrid
encryption technique with a self-organized public-key management scheme to
securely identify friends and provide authentication. Firstly, Bloom filters
provide a space-efficient means of security for friend discovery. Secondly, a
combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryptions algorithms utilizes both
benefits to provide increased security at lower computational cost. Thirdly, a
self-organized public-key management scheme helps authenticate users using a
trust graph in an infrastructureless setting. With the use of Wi-Fi Direct
technology, an initiator is able to establish an ad hoc network where friends
can connect to within the application. DiscoverFriends was analyzed under two
threat models: replay attacks and eavesdropping by a common friend. Finally,
the paper evaluates the application based on storage usage and processing.
