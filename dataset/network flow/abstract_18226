We explore the interplay between the protein-protein interactions network and
the expression of the interacting proteins. It is shown that interacting
proteins are expressed in significantly more similar cellular concentrations.
This is largely due to interacting pairs which are part of protein complexes.
We solve a generic model of complex formation and show explicitly that
complexes form most efficiently when their members have roughly the same
concentrations. Therefore, the observed similarity in interacting protein
concentrations could be attributed to optimization for efficiency of complex
formation.
