Many complex networks show signs of modular structure, uncovered by community
detection. Although many methods succeed in revealing various partitions, it
remains difficult to detect at what scale some partition is significant. This
problem shows foremost in multi-resolution methods. We here introduce an
efficient method for scanning for resolutions in one such method. Additionally,
we introduce the notion of "significance" of a partition, based on subgraph
probabilities. Significance is independent of the exact method used, so could
also be applied in other methods, and can be interpreted as the gain in
encoding a graph by making use of a partition. Using significance, we can
determine "good" resolution parameters, which we demonstrate on benchmark
networks. Moreover, optimizing significance itself also shows excellent
performance. We demonstrate our method on voting data from the European
Parliament. Our analysis suggests the European Parliament has become
increasingly ideologically divided and that nationality plays no role.
