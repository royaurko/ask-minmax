Nowadays it is very important to maintain a high level security to ensure
safe and trusted communication of information between various organizations.
But secured data communication over internet and any other network is always
under threat of intrusions and misuses. So Intrusion Detection Systems have
become a needful component in terms of computer and network security. There are
various approaches being utilized in intrusion detections, but unfortunately
any of the systems so far is not completely flawless. So, the quest of
betterment continues. In this progression, here we present an Intrusion
Detection System (IDS), by applying genetic algorithm (GA) to efficiently
detect various types of network intrusions. Parameters and evolution processes
for GA are discussed in details and implemented. This approach uses evolution
theory to information evolution in order to filter the traffic data and thus
reduce the complexity. To implement and measure the performance of our system
we used the KDD99 benchmark dataset and obtained reasonable detection rate.
