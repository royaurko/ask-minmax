In this paper, we experimentally investigate the effect of fast moving object
on the RSSI in the wireless sensor networks in presence of the ground effect
and antenna orientation in elevation direction. In experimental setup, MICAz
mote pair was placed on the ground, where one mote acts as a transmitter and
the other as a receiver. The trans- mitter mote's antenna was oriented in
elevation direction with respect to the receiver mote's antenna. The fast
moving object i.e. car, was passed between the motes and the fluctuations in
the RSSI are observed. The experimental results show some sequential pattern in
RSSI fluctuations when car moves at some relatively slow speed. However, some
irregu- larities were also observed when antenna was oriented at 45 and 90 in
elevation direction.
