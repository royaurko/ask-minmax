Given any continuous, lower bounded and $\kappa$-convex function $V$ on a
metric measure space $(X,d,m)$ which is infinitesimally Hilbertian and
satisfies some synthetic lower bound for the Ricci curvature in the sense of
Lott-Sturm-Villani, we prove existence and uniqueness for the (downward)
gradient flow for $V$. Moreover, we prove Lipschitz continuity of the flow
w.r.t. the starting point $d(x_t,x'_t)\le e^{-\kappa\, t} d(x_0,x_0').$
