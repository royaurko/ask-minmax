The scalability and exibility of Resource Description Framework(RDF) model
make it ideally suited for representing online social networks(OSN). One basic
operation in OSN is to ?nd chains of relations,such as k-Hop friends. Property
path query in SPARQL can express this type of operation, but its implementation
su?ers from performance problem considering the ever growing data size and
complexity of OSN.In this paper, we present a main memory/disk based hybrid RDF
data management framework for efficient property path query. In this hybrid
framework, we realize an efficient in-memory algebra operator for property path
query using graph traversal, and estimate the cost of this operator to
cooperate with existing cost-based optimization. Experiments on benchmark and
real dataset demonstrated that our approach can achieve a good tradeoff between
data load expense and online query performance.
