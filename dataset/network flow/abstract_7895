We propose a flexible framework that can be easily customized to enforce a
large variety of information flow properties. Our framework combines the ideas
of secure multi-execution and map-reduce computations. The information flow
property of choice can be obtained by simply changes to a map (or reduce)
program that control parallel executions.
  We present the architecture of the enforcement mechanism and its
customizations for non-interference (NI) (from Devriese and Piessens) and some
properties proposed by Mantel, such as removal of inputs (RI) and deletion of
inputs (DI), and demonstrate formally soundness and precision of enforcement
for these properties.
