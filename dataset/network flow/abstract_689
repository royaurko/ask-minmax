This paper presents an iterated local search for the fixed-charge
uncapacitated network design problem with user-optimal flow (FCNDP-UOF), which
concerns routing multiple commodities from its origin to its destination by
signing a network through selecting arcs, with an objective of minimizing the
sum of the fixed costs of the selected arcs plus the sum of variable costs
associated to the flows on each arc. Besides that, since the FCNDP-UOF is a
bi-level problem, each commodity has to be transported through a shortest path,
concerning the edges length, in the built network. The proposed algorithm
generate a initial solution using a variable fixing heuristic. Then a local
branching strategy is applied to improve the quality of the solution. At last,
an efficient perturbation strategy is presented to perform cycle-based moves to
explore different parts of the solution space. Computational experiments shows
that the proposed solution method consistently produces high-quality solutions
in reasonable computational times.
