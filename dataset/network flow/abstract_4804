We present a density functional based closure of the pair Smoluchowski
equation for Brownian particles under shear flow. Given an equilibrium free
energy functional as input the theory provides first-principles predictions for
the flow-distorted pair correlation function and associated rheological
quantities over a wide range of volume fractions and flow rates. Taking
two-dimensional hard-disks under shear flow as an illustrative model we
calculate the pair correlation function, viscosity and normal stress difference
under both steady and start-up shear.
