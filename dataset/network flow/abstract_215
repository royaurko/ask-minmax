We study a family of deterministic models for highway traffic flow which
generalize cellular automaton rule 184. This family is parametrized by the
speed limit $m$ and another parameter $k$ that represents a ``degree of
aggressiveness'' in driving, strictly related to the distance between two
consecutive cars. We compare two driving strategies with identical maximum
throughput: ``conservative'' driving with high speed limit and ``aggressive''
driving with low speed limit. Those two strategies are evaluated in terms of
accident probability. We also discuss fundamental diagrams of generalized
traffic rules and examine limitations of maximum achievable throughput.
Possible modifications of the model are considered.
