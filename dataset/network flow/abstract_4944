We demonstrate an unexpected connection between isotropic turbulence and
wall-bounded shear flows. We perform direct numerical simulations of isotropic
turbulence forced at large scales at moderate Reynolds numbers and observe
sudden transitions from chaotic dynamics to a spatially simple flow, analogous
to the laminar state in wall-bounded shear flows. We find that the survival
probabilities of turbulence are exponential and the typical lifetimes increase
super-exponentially with the Reynolds number. Our results suggest that both
isotropic turbulence and wall-bounded shear flows share the same phase-space
dynamics.
