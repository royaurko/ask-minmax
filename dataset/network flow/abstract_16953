This article describes an approach to designing a distributed and modular
neural classifier. This approach introduces a new hierarchical clustering that
enables one to determine reliable regions in the representation space by
exploiting supervised information. A multilayer perceptron is then associated
with each of these detected clusters and charged with recognizing elements of
the associated cluster while rejecting all others. The obtained global
classifier is comprised of a set of cooperating neural networks and completed
by a K-nearest neighbor classifier charged with treating elements rejected by
all the neural networks. Experimental results for the handwritten digit
recognition problem and comparison with neural and statistical nonmodular
classifiers are given.
