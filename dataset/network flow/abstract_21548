We use lattice Boltzmann simulations of the Beris--Edwards formulation of
nematodynamics to probe the response of a nematic liquid crystal with
conflicting anchoring at the boundaries under shear and Poiseuille flow. The
geometry we focus on is that of the hybrid aligned nematic (HAN) cell, common
in devices. In the nematic phase, backflow effects resulting from the elastic
distortion in the director field render the velocity profile strongly
non-Newtonian and asymmetric. As the transition to the isotropic phase is
approached, these effects become progressively weaker. If the fluid is heated
just above the transition point, however, another asymmetry appears, in the
dynamics of shear band formation.
