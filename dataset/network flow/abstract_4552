Energy efficiency is gaining importance in wireless communication networks
which have nodes with limited energy supply and signal processing capabilities.
We present a numerical study of cooperative communication scenarios based on
simple local rules. This is in contrast to most of the approaches in the
literature which enforce cooperation by using complex algorithms and require
strategic complexity of the network nodes. The approach is motivated by recent
results in evolutionary biology which suggest that, if certain mechanism is at
work, cooperation can be favoured by natural selection, i. e. even selfish
actions of the individual nodes can lead to emergence of cooperative behaviour
in the network. The results of the simulations in the context of wireless
communication networks verify these observations and indicate that
uncomplicated local rules, followed by simple fitness evaluation, can generate
network behaviour which yields global energy efficiency.
