A discrete conformality for polyhedral metrics on surfaces is introduced in
this paper which generalizes earlier work on the subject. It is shown that each
polyhedral metric on a surface is discrete conformal to a constant curvature
polyhedral metric which is unique up to scaling. Furthermore, the constant
curvature metric can be found using a discrete Yamabe flow with surgery.
