The citation impact of Environment and Planning B can be visualized using its
citation relations with journals in its environment as the links of a network.
The size of the nodes is varied in correspondence to the relative citation
impact in this environment. Additionally, one can correct for the effect of
within-journal "self"-citations. The network can be partitioned and clustered
using algorithms from social network analysis. After transposing the matrix in
terms of rows and columns, the citing patterns can be mapped analogously.
Citing patterns reflect the activity of the community of contributors who publish in
the journal, while being cited indicates reception. Environment and Planning B
is cited across the interface between the social sciences and the natural
sciences, but its contributors cite almost exclusively from the domain of the Social
Science Citation Index.
