We derive mostly analytically the scaling behavior of the number of nonfrozen
and relevant nodes in critical Kauffman networks (with two inputs per node) in
the thermodynamic limit. By defining and analyzing a stochastic process that
determines the frozen core we can prove that the mean number of nonfrozen nodes
scales with the network size N as N^{2/3}, with only N^{1/3} nonfrozen nodes
having two nonfrozen inputs. We also show the probability distributions for the
numbers of these nodes. Using a different stochastic process, we determine the
scaling behavior of the number of relevant nodes. Their mean number increases
for large N as N^{1/3}, and only a finite number of relevant nodes have two
relevant inputs. It follows that all relevant components apart from a finite
number are simple loops, and that the mean number and length of attractors
increases faster than any power law with network size.
