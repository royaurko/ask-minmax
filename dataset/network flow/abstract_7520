We present a rigorous derivation of the flow at arbitrary time in a
deterministic cellular automaton model of traffic flow. The derivation employs
regularities in preimages of blocks of zeros, reducing the problem of preimage
enumeration to a well known lattice path counting problem. Assuming infinite
lattice size and random initial configuration, the flow can be expressed in
terms of generalized hypergeometric function. We show that the steady state
limit agrees with previously published results.
