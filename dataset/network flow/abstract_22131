We show that recent paper by Flayac et al. [Phys. Rev. B 81, 045318 (2010)
and arXiv:0911.1650] is misleading. We demonstrate the existence of static
half-quantum vortices in exciton-polariton condensates and calculate the
warping of their polarization texture produced by TE-TM splitting of polariton
band.
