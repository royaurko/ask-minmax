In this article we intoduce a novel stochastic Hebb-like learning rule for
neural networks that is neurobiologically motivated. This learning rule
combines features of unsupervised (Hebbian) and supervised (reinforcement)
learning and is stochastic with respect to the selection of the time points
when a synapse is modified. Moreover, the learning rule does not only affect
the synapse between pre- and postsynaptic neuron, which is called homosynaptic
plasticity, but effects also further remote synapses of the pre- and
postsynaptic neuron. This more complex form of synaptic plasticity has recently
come under investigations in neurobiology and is called heterosynaptic
plasticity. We demonstrate that this learning rule is useful in training neural
networks by learning parity functions including the exclusive-or (XOR) mapping
in a multilayer feed-forward network. We find, that our stochastic learning
rule works well, even in the presence of noise. Importantly, the mean learning
time increases with the number of patterns to be learned polynomially,
indicating efficient learning.
