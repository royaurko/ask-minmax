2010 has witnessed many public consultations around the world concerning Net
neutrality. A second legislative phase that may follow, could involve various
structural changes in the Internet. The status that the Internet access has in
Europe as a universal service evolves as the level of quality of service (QoS)
to be offered improves. If guarantees on QoS are to be imposed, as requested by
several economic actors, it would require introducing new indicators of quality
of services, as well as regulation legislation and monitoring of the offered
levels of QoS. This tendency in Europe may change the nature of the Internet
from a best effort network to, perhaps, a more expensive one, that offers
guaranteed performance. This paper presents an overview of the above issues as
well as an overview of recent research on net-neutrality, with an emphasis on
game theoretical approaches.
