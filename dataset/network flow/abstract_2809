An analysis of axisymmetric equilibria with arbitrary incompressible flow and
finite resistivity is presented. It is shown that with large aspect ratio
approximation or vanishing poloidal current, a uniform conductivity profile is
consistent with equilibrium flows. Also a comment made on coexistence of both
toroidal and poloidal flows in an axisymmetric field-reversed configuration.
