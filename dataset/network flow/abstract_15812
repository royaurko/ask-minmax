We show how coupling of local optimization processes can lead to better
solutions than multi-start local optimization consisting of independent runs.
This is achieved by minimizing the average energy cost of the ensemble, subject
to synchronization constraints between the state vectors of the individual
local minimizers. From an augmented Lagrangian which incorporates the
synchronization constraints both as soft and hard constraints, a network is
derived wherein the local minimizers interact and exchange information through
the synchronization constraints. From the viewpoint of neural networks, the
array can be considered as a Lagrange programming network for continuous
optimization and as a cellular neural network (CNN). The penalty weights
associated with the soft state synchronization constraints follow from the
solution to a linear program. This expresses that the energy cost of the
ensemble should maximally decrease. In this way successful local minimizers can
implicitly impose their state to the others through a mechanism of master-slave
dynamics resulting into a cooperative search mechanism. Improved information
spreading within the ensemble is obtained by applying the concept of
small-world networks. This work suggests, in an interdisciplinary context, the
importance of information exchange and state synchronization within ensembles,
towards issues as evolution, collective behaviour, optimality and intelligence.
