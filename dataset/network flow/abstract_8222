There are at least four well known Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI)
networks that provide open access to astronomers around the world. These
include the EVN, VLBA, CMVA and APT/LBA. In this paper I have chosen to focus
on a sub-set of these facilities, in particular the European VLBI Network, both
in stand-alone mode but also as a major component of a Global VLBI Network,
involving MERLIN and the VLBA.
