A recent first-principles approach to the non-linear rheology of dense
colloidal suspensions is evaluated and compared to simulation results of
sheared systems close to their glass transitions. The predicted scenario of a
universal transition of the structural dynamics between yielding of glasses and
non-Newtonian (shear-thinning) fluid flow appears well obeyed, and calculations
within simplified models rationalize the data over variations in shear rate and
viscosity of up to 3 decades.
