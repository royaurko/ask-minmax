We provide in this article a new proof of the uniqueness of the flow solution
to ordinary differential equations with $BV$ vector-fields that have divergence
in $L^\infty$ (or in $L^1$) and that are nearly incompressible (see the text
for the definition of this term). The novelty of the proof lies in the fact it
does not use the associated transport equation.
