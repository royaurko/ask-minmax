We present the optimal relay-subset selection and transmission-time for a
decode-and-forward, half-duplex cooperative network of arbitrary size. The
resource allocation is obtained by maximizing over the rates obtained for each
possible subset of active relays, and the unique time allocation for each set
can be obtained by solving a linear system of equations. We also present a
simple recursive algorithm for the optimization problem which reduces the
computational load of finding the required matrix inverses, and reduces the
number of required iterations. Our results, in terms of outage rate, confirm
the benefit of adding potential relays to a small network and the diminishing
marginal returns for a larger network. We also show that optimizing over the
channel resources ensures that more relays are active over a larger SNR range,
and that linear network constellations significantly outperform grid
constellations. Through simulations, the optimization is shown to be robust to
node numbering.
