The ability to seamlessly switch between the macro networks and femtocell
networks is a key driver for femtocell network deployment. The handover
procedures for the integrated femtocell/macrocell networks differ from the
existing handovers. Some modifications of existing network and protocol
architecture for the integration of femtocell networks with the existing
macrocell networks are also essential. These modifications change the signal
flow for handover procedures due to different 2-tier cell (macrocell and
femtocell) environment. The handover between two networks should be performed
with minimum signaling. A frequent and unnecessary handover is another problem
for hierarchical femtocell/macrocell network environment that must be
minimized. This work studies the details mobility management schemes for small
and medium scale femtocell network deployment. To do that, firstly we present
two different network architectures for small scale and medium scale WCDMA
femtocell deployment. The details handover call flow for these two network
architectures and CAC scheme to minimize the unnecessary handovers are proposed
for the integrated femtocell/macrocell networks. The numerical analysis for the
proposed M/M/N/N queuing scheme and the simulation results of the proposed CAC
scheme demonstrate the handover call control performances for femtocell
environment.
