The Ribosome Flow Model (RFM) describes the unidirectional movement of
interacting particles along a one-dimensional chain of sites. As a site becomes
fuller, the effective entry rate into this site decreases. The RFM has been
used to model and analyze mRNA translation, a biological process in which
ribosomes (the particles) move along the mRNA molecule (the chain), and decode
the genetic information into proteins.
  Here we propose the RFM as an analytical framework for modeling and analyzing
linear communication networks. In this context, the moving particles are
data-packets, the chain of sites is a one dimensional set of ordered buffers,
and the decreasing entry rate to a fuller buffer represents a kind of
decentralized backpressure flow control. For an RFM with homogeneous link
capacities, we provide closed-form expressions for important network metrics
including the throughput and end-to-end delay. We use these results to analyze
the hop length and the transmission probability (in a contention access mode)
that minimize the end-to-end delay in a multihop linear network, and provide
closed-form expressions for the optimal parameter values.
