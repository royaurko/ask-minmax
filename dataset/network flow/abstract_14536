Production and elliptic flow of heavy quarks are investigated in
nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC within the Boltzmann Approach of
MultiParton Scatterings (BAMPS). The initial heavy quark yield is estimated
with the leading order mini-jet model and compared to PYTHIA for several parton
distribution functions. Secondary production of heavy quarks in the quark-gluon
plasma is examined within the full 3+1 dimensional BAMPS simulation of heavy
ion collisions. At RHIC this yield is negligible, but for LHC charm production
in the QGP plays a significant role. In addition, we study the elliptic flow of
charm quarks at RHIC with the result that leading order processes are not
sufficient to describe the experimental data.
