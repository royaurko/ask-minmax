A phenomenological model for the dissipation of scalar fluctuations due to
the straining by the fluid motion is proposed in this letter. An explicit
equation is obtained for the time evolution of the probability distribution
function of a coarse-grained scalar concentration. The model relies on a
self-convolution process. We first present this model in the Batchelor regime
and then extend empirically our result to the turbulent case. The inclusion of
this model in more general transport equations, including spatial gradients, is
discussed in relation with 2D turbulence and stratified flows.
