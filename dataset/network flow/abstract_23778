The use of advanced sequential paging algorithms has been suggested as a
means to reduce the signaling cost in future mobile cellular networks. In a
proposed algorithm (Koukoutsidis and Theologou, 2003), the system can use the
additional information of the last interaction cell combined with a mobility
model to predict the short-term location probabilities at the time of an
incoming call arrival. The short-term location probabilities reduce the
uncertainty in mobile user position and thus greatly improve the search. In
this paper, an analytical model is derived that allows for a general
distribution of cell residence times. By considering a Gamma distribution, we
study the effect of the variance of cell residence times and derive useful
results on the performance of the algorithm.
