Gaussian graphical modeling has been widely used to explore various network
structures, such as gene regulatory networks and social networks. We often use
a penalized maximum likelihood approach with the $L_1$ penalty for learning a
high-dimensional graphical model. However, the penalized maximum likelihood
procedure is sensitive to outliers. To overcome this problem, we introduce a
robust estimation procedure based on the $\gamma$-divergence. The parameter
estimation procedure is constructed using the Majorize-Minimization algorithm,
which guarantees that the objective function monotonically decreases at each
iteration. Extensive simulation studies showed that our procedure performed
much better than the existing methods, in particular, when the contamination
rate was large. Two real data analyses were carried out to illustrate the
usefulness of our proposed procedure.
