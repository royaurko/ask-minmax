The sound inventories of the world's languages self-organize themselves
giving rise to similar cross-linguistic patterns. In this work we attempt to
capture this phenomenon of self-organization, which shapes the structure of the
consonant inventories, through a complex network approach. For this purpose we
define the occurrence and co-occurrence networks of consonants and
systematically study some of their important topological properties. A crucial
observation is that the occurrence as well as the co-occurrence of consonants
across languages follow a power law distribution. This property is arguably a
consequence of the principle of preferential attachment. In order to support
this argument we propose a synthesis model which reproduces the degree
distribution for the networks to a close approximation. We further observe that
the co-occurrence network of consonants show a high degree of clustering and
subsequently refine our synthesis model in order to incorporate this property.
Finally, we discuss how preferential attachment manifests itself through the
evolutionary nature of language.
