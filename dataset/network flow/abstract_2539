Recent years have seen the world become a closely connected society with the
emergence of different types of social networks. Online social networks have
provided a way to bridge long distances and establish numerous communication
channels which were not possible earlier. These networks exhibit interesting
behavior under intentional attacks and random failures where different
structural properties influence the resilience in different ways.
  In this paper, we perform two sets of experiments and draw conclusions from
the results pertaining to the resilience of social networks. The first
experiment performs a comparative analysis of four different classes of
networks namely small world networks, scale free networks, small world-scale
free networks and random networks with four semantically different social
networks under different attack strategies. The second experiment compares the
resilience of these semantically different social networks under different
attack strategies. Empirical analysis reveals interesting behavior of different
classes of networks with different attack strategies.
