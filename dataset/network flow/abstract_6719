This paper investigates the throughput for wireless network with full-duplex
radios using stochastic geometry. Full-duplex (FD) radios can exchange data
simultaneously with each other. On the other hand, the downside of FD
transmission is that it will inevitably cause extra interference to the network
compared to half-duplex (HD) transmission. Moreover, the residual
self-interference has negative effects on the network throughput. In this
paper, we focus on a wireless network of nodes with both HD and FD capabilities
and derive and optimize the throughput in such a network. Our analytical result
shows that if the network is adapting an ALOHA protocol, the maximal throughput
is achieved by scheduling all concurrently transmitting nodes to work in either
FD mode or HD mode depending on one simple condition. Moreover, the effects of
imperfect self-interference cancellation on the signal-to-interference ratio
(SIR) loss and throughput are also analyzed based on our mathematical model. We
rigorously quantify the impact of imperfect self-interference cancellation on
the throughput gain, transmission range, and other metrics, and we establish
the minimum amount of self-interference suppression needed for FD to be
beneficial.
