We study the stability of network communication after removal of $q=1-p$
links under the assumption that communication is effective only if the shortest
path between nodes $i$ and $j$ after removal is shorter than $a\ell_{ij}
(a\geq1)$ where $\ell_{ij}$ is the shortest path before removal. For a large
class of networks, we find a new percolation transition at
$\tilde{p}_c=(\kappa_o-1)^{(1-a)/a}$, where $\kappa_o\equiv < k^2>/< k>$ and
$k$ is the node degree. Below $\tilde{p}_c$, only a fraction $N^{\delta}$ of
the network nodes can communicate, where $\delta\equiv a(1-|\log
p|/\log{(\kappa_o-1)}) < 1$, while above $\tilde{p}_c$, order $N$ nodes can
communicate within the limited path length $a\ell_{ij}$. Our analytical results
are supported by simulations on Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and scale-free network
models. We expect our results to influence the design of networks, routing
algorithms, and immunization strategies, where short paths are most relevant.
