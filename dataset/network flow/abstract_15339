Graphene flakes are prepared on freshly cleaved mica by exfoliation and
studied by scanning tunneling microscopy in ultra high vacuum. On few-layer
graphene, a triangular network of partial dislocations separating ABC stacked
and ABA stacked graphene was found similar to the networks occasionally visible
on freshly cleaved HOPG. We found differences in the electronic structure of
ABC and ABA stacked areas by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, i.e., a
pronounced peak at 0.25 eV above the Fermi level exclusively in the ABA areas,
which is shown to be responsible for the different apparent heights observed in
STM images.
