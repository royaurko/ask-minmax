In wireless ad-hoc networks, forwarding data through intermediate relays
extends the coverage area and enhances the network throughput. We consider a
general wireless multiuser multihop transmission, where each data flow is
subject to a constraint on the end-to-end buffering delay and the associated
packet drop rate as a quality of service (QoS) requirement. The objective is to
maximize the weighted sum-rate between source destination pairs, while the
corresponding QoS requirements are satisfied. We introduce two new distributed
cross-layer dynamic route selection schemes in this setting that are designed
involving physical, MAC, and network layers. In the proposed opportunistic
cross-layer dynamic route selection scheme, routes are assigned dynamically
based on the state of network nodes' buffers and the instantaneous state of
fading channels. In the same setting, the proposed time division cross layer
dynamic route selection scheme utilizes the average quality of channels instead
for more efficient implementation. Detailed results and comparisons are
provided, which demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
cross-layer dynamic route selection schemes.
