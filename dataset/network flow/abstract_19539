We consider the ordering kinetics of a nonconserved scalar field advected by
a uniform shear flow. Using the Ohta-Jasnow-Kawasaki approximation, modified to
allow for shear-induced anisotropy, we calculate the asymptotic time dependence
of the characteristic length scales, L_parallel and L_perp, that describe the
growth of order parallel and perpendicular to the mean domain orientation. In
space dimension d=3 we find, up to constants, L_parallel = gamma t^{3/2},
L_perp = t^{1/2}, where gamma is the shear rate, while for d = 2 we find
L_parallel = gamma^{1/2} t (ln t)^{1/4}, L_perp = gamma^{-1/2}(ln t)^{-1/4} .
Our predictions for d=2 can be tested by experiments on twisted nematic liquid
crystals.
