We study the use of linear codes for network computing in single-receiver
networks with various classes of target functions of the source messages. Such
classes include reducible, injective, semi-injective, and linear target
functions over finite fields. Computing capacity bounds and achievability are
given with respect to these target function classes for network codes that use
routing, linear coding, or nonlinear coding.
