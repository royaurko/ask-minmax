We define a quantitative notion of shear for limit cycles of flows. We prove
that strange attractors and SRB measures emerge when systems exhibiting limit
cycles with sufficient shear are subjected to periodic pulsatile drives. The
strange attractors possess a number of precisely-defined dynamical properties
that together imply chaos that is both sustained in time and physically
observable.
