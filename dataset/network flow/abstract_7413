We have used particle tracking methods to study the dynamics of individual
balls comprising a granular flow in a small-angle two-dimensional funnel. We
statistically analyze many ball trajectories to examine the mechanisms of shock
propagation. In particular, we study the creation of, and interactions between,
shock waves. We also investigate the role of granular temperature and draw
parallels to traffic flow dynamics.
