Deep learning methods have predominantly been applied to large artificial
neural networks. Despite their state-of-the-art performance, these large
networks typically do not generalize well to datasets with limited sample
sizes. In this paper, we take a different approach by learning multiple layers
of kernels. We combine kernels at each layer and then optimize over an estimate
of the support vector machine leave-one-out error rather than the dual
objective function. Our experiments on a variety of datasets show that each
layer successively increases performance with only a few base kernels.
