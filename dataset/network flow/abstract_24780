Schelling's model of segregation, first described in 1969, has become one of
the best known models of self-organising behaviour. While Schelling's explicit
concern was to understand the mechanisms underlying racial segregation in large
cities from a game theoretic perspective, the model should be seen as one of a
family, arising in fields as diverse as statistical mechanics, neural networks
and the social sciences, and which are concerned with interacting populations
situated on network structures. Despite extensive study, however, the
(unperturbed) Schelling model has largely resisted rigorous analysis, prior
results in the literature generally pertaining to variants of the model in
which noise is introduced into the dynamics of the system, the resulting model
then being amenable to standard techniques from statistical mechanics or
stochastic evolutionary game theory. A series of recent papers (one by Brandt,
Immorlica, Kamath, and Kleinberg, and two by the contributors), has seen the first
rigorous analysis of the one dimensional version of the unperturbed model. Here
we provide the first rigorous analysis of the two and three dimensional
unperturbed models, establishing most of the phase diagram, and answering a
challenge from a recent paper by Brandt, Immorlica, Kamath, and Kleinberg.
