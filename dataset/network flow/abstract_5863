We investigate the dependence of river network scaling on the relative
dominance of slope vs. noise in initial conditions, using an erosion model.
Increasing slope causes network patterns to transition from dendritic to
parallel and results in a breakdown of simple power-law scaling. This provides
an example of how natural deviations from scaling might originate. Similar
network patterns in leaves suggest such deviations may be widespread. Simple
power-law scaling in river networks may require a combination of dynamics,
initial conditions, and perturbations over time.
