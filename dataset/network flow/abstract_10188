In an oblique section of a paraxial beam with angular momentum, the beam
center of gravity (CG) is shifted with respect to its position in the normal
cross section. We relate this shift with the internal energy redistribution
occurring on the passage between the normal and oblique sections. The
transverse orbital flow explains the effect for scalar beams, similar
incorporation of the spin flow enables explanation of the CG shift in oblique
sections of the elliptically polarized beams. Role of the special properties of
the position-sensitive detector placed in the oblique beam section is
discussed.
