Flexible chains (linear or branched) can be forced to enter into a narrow
capillary by using a hydrodynamic flow. Here, we correct our earlier
description of this problem by considering the progressive nature of the
suction process. We find that the critical current for penetration, $J\_c$, is
controlled by the entry of a single blob of the capillary size, and that its
scaling structure is the same for branched and linear chains.
