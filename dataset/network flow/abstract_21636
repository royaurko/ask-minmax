The scale hierarchy of wavelets provides a natural frame for renormalization.
Expanding the order parameter of the Landau-Ginzburg/$\Phi^4$ model in a basis
of compact orthonormal wavelets explicitly exhibits the coupling between scales
that leads to non-trivial behavior. The locality properties of Daubechies'
wavelets enable us to derive the qualitative renormalization flow of the
Landau-Ginzburg model from Gaussian fluctuations in wavelet space.
