We theoretically derive the amplitude equations for a self-propelled droplet
driven by Marangoni flow. As advective flow driven by surface tension gradient
is enhanced, the stationary state becomes unstable and the droplet starts to
move. The velocity of the droplet is determined from a cubic nonlinear term in
the amplitude equations. The obtained critical point and the characteristic
velocity are well supported by numerical simulations.
