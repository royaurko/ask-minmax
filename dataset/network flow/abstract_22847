Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an important noninvasive, nonhazardous
technology for functional brain mapping, measuring the magnetic fields due to
the intracellular neuronal current flow in the brain. However, the inherent
level of noise in the data collection process is large enough to obscure the
signal(s) of interest most often. In this paper, a practical denoising
technique based on the wavelet transform and the multiresolution signal
decomposition technique is presented. The proposed technique is substantiated
by the application results using three different mother wavelets on the
recorded MEG signal.
