This note discusses basic properties of vorticity in groundwater flow theory.
An evolution equation for the vorticity vector is derived to demonstrate that,
when present, vorticity decreases very rapidly. In addition, it is shown how
vorticity affects, though very little, the hydraulic head directional variation
in the vicinity of a point.
