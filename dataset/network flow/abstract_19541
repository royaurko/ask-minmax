A compressible flow characterized by a velocity field $u_x(x,t)=ax/(1+at)$ is
analyzed by means of the Boltzmann equation and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook
kinetic model. The sign of the control parameter (the longitudinal deformation
rate $a$) distinguishes between an expansion ($a>0$) and a condensation ($a<0$)
phenomenon. The temperature is a decreasing function of time in the former
case, while it is an increasing function in the latter. The non-Newtonian
behavior of the gas is described by a dimensionless nonlinear viscosity
$\eta^*(a^*)$, that depends on the dimensionless longitudinal rate $a^*$. The
Chapman-Enskog expansion of $\eta^*$ in powers of $a^*$ is seen to be only
asymptotic (except in the case of Maxwell molecules). The velocity distribution
function is also studied. At any value of $a^*$, it exhibits an algebraic
high-velocity tail that is responsible for the divergence of velocity moments.
For sufficiently negative $a^*$, moments of degree four and higher may diverge,
while for positive $a^*$ the divergence occurs in moments of degree equal to or
larger than eight.
