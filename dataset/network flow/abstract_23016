A new variational principle - extremizing the fixed frame kinetic energy
under constant relative enstrophy - for a coupled barotropic flow - rotating
solid sphere system is introduced with the following consequences. In
particular, angular momentum is transfered between the fluid and the solid
sphere through a modelled torque mechanism. The fluid's angular momentum is
therefore not fixed but only bounded by the relative enstrophy, as is required
of any model that supports super-rotation.
  The main results are: At any rate of spin $\Omega $ and relative enstrophy,
the unique global energy maximizer for fixed relative enstrophy corresponds to
solid-body super-rotation; the counter-rotating solid-body flow state is a
constrained energy minimum provided the relative enstrophy is small enough,
otherwise, it is a saddle point.
  For all energy below a threshold value which depends on the relative
enstrophy and solid spin $\Omega $, the constrained energy extremals consist of
only minimizers and saddles in the form of counter-rotating states$.$ Only when
the energy exceeds this threshold value can pro-rotating states arise as global
maximizers.
  Unlike the standard barotropic vorticity model which conserves angular
momentum of the fluid, the counter-rotating state is rigorously shown to be
nonlinearly stable only when it is a local constrained minima. The global
constrained maximizer corresponding to super-rotation is always nonlinearly
stable.
