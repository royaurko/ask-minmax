We derive an exact expression for entropy production during effusion of an
ideal gas driven by momentum transfer in addition to energy and particle flux.
Following the treatment in Phys. Rev. E Vol. 74, 021117 (2006), we construct a
master equation formulation of the process and explicitly verify the
thermodynamic fluctuation theorem, thereby directly exhibiting its extended
applicability to particle flows and hence to hydrodynamic systems.
