In this letter, we present non linear structures resulting from the
saturation of a large scale instability in rotating stratified fluids with
small scale forced turbulence which we found in \cite{[1]}. These structures
are of helical kinks type. The different solutions that we plotted correspond
to solutions linking two different stationnary points for different values of
the Rayleigh and the Taylor numbers.
