Epidemics have so far been mostly studied in undirected networks. However,
many real-world networks, such as the social network Twitter and the WWW
networks, upon which information, emotion or malware spreads, are shown to be
directed networks, composed of both unidirectional links and bidirectional
links. We define the directionality as the percentage of unidirectional links.
The epidemic threshold for the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic
has been proved to be 1/lambda_{1} in directed networks by N-intertwined
Mean-field Approximation, where lambda_{1}, also called as spectral radius, is
the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. Here, we propose two algorithms
to generate directed networks with a given degree distribution, where the
directionality can be controlled. The effect of directionality on the spectral
radius lambda_{1}, principal eigenvector x_{1}, spectral gap
lambda_{1}-|lambda_{2}|) and algebraic connectivity |mu_{N-1}| is studied.
Important findings are that the spectral radius lambda_{1} decreases with the
directionality, and the spectral gap and the algebraic connectivity increase
with the directionality. The extent of the decrease of the spectral radius
depends on both the degree distribution and the degree-degree correlation
rho_{D}. Hence, the epidemic threshold of directed networks is larger than that
of undirected networks, and a random walk converges to its steady-state faster
in directed networks than in undirected networks with degree distribution.
