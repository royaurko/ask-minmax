We introduce a technique that is capable to filter out information from
complex systems, by mapping them to networks, and extracting a subgraph with
the strongest links. This idea is based on the Minimum Spanning Tree, and it
can be applied to sets of graphs that have as links different sets of
interactions among the system's elements, which are described as network nodes.
It can also be applied to correlation-based graphs, where the links are
weighted and represent the correlation strength between all pairs of nodes. We
applied this method to the European scientific collaboration network, which is
composed of all the projects supported by the European Framework Program FP6,
and also to the correlation-based network of the 100 highest capitalized stocks
traded in the NYSE. For both cases we identified meaningful structures, such as
a strongly interconnected community of countries that play important role in
the collaboration network, and clusters of stocks belonging to different
sectors of economic activity, which gives significant information about the
investigated systems.
