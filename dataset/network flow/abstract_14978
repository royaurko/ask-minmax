We apply the linear response theory developed in \cite{Ruelle} to analyze how
a periodic signal of weak amplitude, superimposed upon a chaotic background, is
transmitted in a network of non linearly interacting units. We numerically
compute the complex susceptibility and show the existence of specific poles
(stable resonances) corresponding to the response to perturbations transverse
to the attractor. Contrary to the poles of correlation functions they depend on
the pair emitting/receiving units. This dynamic differentiation, induced by non
linearities, exhibits the different ability that units have to transmit a
signal in this network.
