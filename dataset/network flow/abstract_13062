We present a proof due to Duistermaat that the gradient flow of the norm
squared of the moment map defines a deformation retract of the appropriate
piece of the manifold onto the zero level set of the moment map. Duistermaat's
proof is an adaptation of Lojasiewicz's argument for analytic functions to
functions which are locally analytic.
