The central result of this paper is the analysis of an optimization problem
which allows one to assess the limiting performance of a team of two agents who
coordinate their actions. One agent is fully informed about the past and future
realizations of a random state which affects the common payoff of the agents
whereas the other agent has no knowledge about the state. The informed agent
can exchange his knowledge with the other agent only through his actions. This
result is applied to the problem of distributed power allocation in a
two-transmitter $M-$band interference channel, $M\geq 1$, in which the
transmitters (who are the agents) want to maximize the sum-rate under the
single-user decoding assumption at the two receivers; in such a new setting,
the random state is given by the global channel state and the sequence of power
vectors used by the informed transmitter is a code which conveys information
about the channel to the other transmitter.
