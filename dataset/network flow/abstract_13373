A novel discrete growth model in 2+1 dimensions is presented in three
equivalent formulations: i) directed motion of zigzags on a cylinder, ii)
interacting interlaced TASEP layers, and iii) growing heap over 2D substrate
with a restricted minimal local height gradient. We demonstrate that the
coarse-grained behavior of this model is described by the two-dimensional
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. The coefficients of different terms in this
hydrodynamic equation can be derived from the steady state flow-density curve,
the so called `fundamental' diagram. A conjecture concerning the analytical
form of this flow-density curve is presented and is verified numerically.
