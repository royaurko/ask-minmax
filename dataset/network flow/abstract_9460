Social network structure is very important for understanding human
information diffusing, cooperating and competing patterns. It can bring us with
some deep insights about how people affect each other. As a part of complex
networks, social networks have been studied extensively. Many important
universal properties with which we are quite familiar have been recovered, such
as scale free degree distribution, small world, community structure,
self-similarity and navigability. According to some empirical investigations,
we conclude that our social network also possesses another important universal
property. The spatial structure of social network is scale invariable. The
distribution of geographic distance between friendship is about $Pr(d)\propto
d^{-1}$ which is harmonious with navigability. More importantly, from the
perspective of searching information, this kind of property can benefit
individuals most.
