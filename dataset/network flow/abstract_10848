It was suggested that the relativistic jets in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are
powered via the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism or the annihilation of
neutrinos and anti-neutrinos from a neutrino cooling-dominated accretion flow
(NDAF). The advection and diffusion of the large-scale magnetic field of a NDAF
is calculated, and the external magnetic field is found to be dragged inward
efficiently by the accretion flow for a typical magnetic Prandtl number P_m=1.
The maximal BZ jet power can be ~10^53-10^54 erg/sec for an extreme Kerr black
hole, if an external magnetic field with 10^14 Gauss is advected by the NDAF.
This is roughly consistent with the field strength of the disk formed after a
tidal disrupted magnetar. The accretion flow near the black hole horizon is
arrested by the magnetic field if the accretion rate is below than a critical
value for a given external field. The arrested accretion flow fails to drag the
field inward and the field strength decays, and then the accretion re-starts,
which leads to oscillating accretion. The typical timescale of such episodic
accretion is in an order of one second. This can qualitatively explain the
observed oscillation in the soft extend emission of short-type GRBs.
