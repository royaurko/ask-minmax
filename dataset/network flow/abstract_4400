Due to notable discoveries in the fast evolving field of complex networks,
recent research in software engineering has also focused on representing
software systems with networks. Previous work has observed that these networks
follow scale-free degree distributions and reveal small-world phenomena, while
we here explore another property commonly found in different complex networks,
i.e. community structure. We adopt class dependency networks, where nodes
represent software classes and edges represent dependencies among them, and
show that these networks reveal a significant community structure,
characterized by similar properties as observed in other complex networks.
However, although intuitive and anticipated by different phenomena, identified
communities do not exactly correspond to software packages. We empirically
confirm our observations on several networks constructed from Java and various
third party libraries, and propose different applications of community
detection to software engineering.
