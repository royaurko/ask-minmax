In this paper, we study the coding delay and the average coding delay of
random linear network codes (dense codes) over line networks with deterministic
regular and Poisson transmission schedules. We consider both lossless networks
and networks with Bernoulli losses. The upper bounds derived in this paper,
which are in some cases more general, and in some other cases tighter, than the
existing bounds, provide a more clear picture of the speed of convergence of
dense codes to the min-cut capacity of line networks.
