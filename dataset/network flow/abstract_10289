We study the spectral properties of Galactic transient black hole candidate H
1743-322 during its early phase of 2010 outburst with Two Component Advective
Flow (TCAF) model, after its inclusion in spectral analysis software package
XSPEC as a local model. For the analysis, spectral data from RXTE/PCA
instrument in 2.5-25 keV energy band are used. From the spectral fit, accretion
flow parameters such as Keplerian (disk) rate, sub-Keplerian (halo) rate,
location of the shock and strength of the shock are directly extracted. QPO
frequencies are predicted from the TCAF model spectral fitted shock parameters,
`closely' matches with the observed frequencies.
