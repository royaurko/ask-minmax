Community structure is one of the most important properties of networks. Most
community algorithms are not suitable for large networks because of their time
consuming. In fact there are lots of networks with millons even billons of
nodes. In such case, most algorithms running in time O(n2logn) or even larger
are not practical. What we need are linear or approximately linear time
algorithm. Rising in response to such needs, we propose a quick methods to
evaluate community structure in networks and then put forward a local community
algorithm with nearly linear time based on random walks. Using our community
evaluating measure, we could find some difference results from measures used
before, i.e., the Newman Modularity. Our algorithm are effective in small
benchmark networks with small less accuracy than more complex algorithms but a
great of advantage in time consuming for large networks, especially super large
networks.
