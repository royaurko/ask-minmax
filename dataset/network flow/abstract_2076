Human mobility and activity patterns mediate contagion on many levels,
including the spatial spread of infectious diseases, diffusion of rumors, and
emergence of consensus. These patterns however are often dominated by specific
locations and recurrent flows and poorly modeled by the random diffusive
dynamics generally used to study them. Here we develop a theoretical framework
to analyze contagion within a network of locations where individuals recall
their geographic origins. We find a phase transition between a regime in which
the contagion affects a large fraction of the system and one in which only a
small fraction is affected. This transition cannot be uncovered by continuous
deterministic models due to the stochastic features of the contagion process
and defines an invasion threshold that depends on mobility parameters,
providing guidance for controlling contagion spread by constraining mobility
processes. We recover the threshold behavior by analyzing diffusion processes
mediated by real human commuting data.
