In this paper, we are concerned with the global existence and stability of a
smooth supersonic flow with vacuum state at infinity in a 3-D infinitely long
divergent nozzle. The flow is described by a 3-D steady potential equation,
which is multi-dimensional quasilinear hyperbolic (but degenerate at infinity)
with respect to the supersonic direction, and whose linearized part admits the
form $\p_t^2-\ds\f{1}{(1+t)^{2(\g-1)}}(\p_1^2+\p_2^2)+\ds\f{2(\g-1)}{1+t}\p_t$
for $1<\g<2$. From the physical point of view, due to the expansive geometric
property of the divergent nozzle and the mass conservation of gas, the moving
gas in the nozzle will gradually become rarefactive and tends to a vacuum state
at infinity, which implies that such a smooth supersonic flow should be
globally stable for small perturbations since there are no strong resulting
compressions in the motion of the flow. We will confirm such a global stability
phenomena by rigorous mathematical proofs and further show that there do not
exist vacuum domains in any finite part of the nozzle.
