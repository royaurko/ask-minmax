We address the problem of optimizing the throughput of network coded traffic
in mobile networks operating in challenging environments where connectivity is
intermittent and locally available memory space is limited. Random linear
network coding (RLNC) is shown to be equivalent (across all possible initial
conditions) to a random message selection strategy where nodes are able to
exchange buffer occupancy information during contacts. This result creates the
premises for a tractable analysis of RLNC packet spread, which is in turn used
for enhancing its throughput under broadcast. By exploiting the similarity
between channel coding and RLNC in intermittently connected networks, we show
that quite surprisingly, network coding, when not used properly, is still
significantly underutilizing network resources. We propose an enhanced
forwarding protocol that increases considerably the throughput for practical
cases, with negligible additional delay.
