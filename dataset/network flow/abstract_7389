The results of a CO line survey in central cluster galaxies with cooling
flows are presented. Cold molecular gas is detected with the IRAM 30m
telescope, through CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission lines in 6-10 among 32
galaxies. The corresponding gas masses are between 3.10^8 and 4.10^10 Msol.
These results are in agreement with recent CO detections by Edge (2001). A
strong correlation between the CO emission and the Halpha luminosity is also
confirmed. Cold gas exists in the center of cooling flow clusters and these
detections may be interpreted as an evidence of the long searched very cold
residual of the hot cooling gas.
