We perform social network analysis on 53 students split over three semesters
and 13 groups, using conventional measures like eigenvector centrality,
betweeness centrality, and degree centrality, as well as defining a variant of
the Abelian Sandpile Model (ASM) with the intention of modeling stress
propagation in the college classroom. We correlate the results of these
analyses with group project grades received; due to a small or poorly collected
dataset, we are unable to conclude that any of these network measures relates
to those grades. However, we are successful in using this dataset to define a
discrete, recursive, and more generalized variant of the ASM. Abelian Sandpile
