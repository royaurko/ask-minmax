We propose and study a hierarchical algorithm to generate graphs having a
predetermined distribution of cliques, the fully connected subgraphs. The
construction mechanism may be either random or incorporate preferential
attachment. We evaluate the statistical properties of the graphs generated,
such as the degree distribution and network diameters, and compare them to some
real-world graphs.
