Many topological and dynamical properties of complex networks are defined by
assuming that most of the transport on the network flows along the shortest
paths. However, there are different scenarios in which non-shortest paths are
used to reach the network destination. Thus the consideration of the shortest
paths only does not account for the global communicability of a complex
network. Here we propose a new measure of the communicability of a complex
network, which is a broad generalization of the concept of the shortest path.
According to the new measure, most of real-world networks display the largest
communicability between the most connected (popular) nodes of the network
(assortative communicability). There are also several networks with the
disassortative communicability, where the most "popular" nodes communicate very
poorly to each other. Using this information we classify a diverse set of
real-world complex systems into a small number of universality classes based on
their structure-dynamic correlation. In addition, the new communicability
measure is able to distinguish finer structures of networks, such as
communities into which a network is divided. A community is unambiguously
defined here as a set of nodes displaying larger communicability among them
than to the rest of nodes in the network.
