We study the diffusion process through an ideal polymer network, using
numerical methods. Polymers are modeled by random walks on the bonds of a
two-dimensional square lattice. Molecules occupy the lattice cells and may jump
to the nearest-neighbor cells, with probability determined by the occupation of
the bond separating the two cells. Subjected to a concentration gradient across
the system, a constant average current flows in the steady state. Its behavior
appears to be a non-trivial function of polymer length, mass density and
temperature, for which we offer qualitative explanations.
