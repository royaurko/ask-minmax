Many papers have been proposed in order to increase the wireless sensor
networks performance; This kind of network has limited resources, where the
energy in each sensor came from a small battery that sometime is hard to be
replaced or recharged. Transmission energy is the most concern part where the
higher energy consumption takes place. Clustered hierarchy has been proposed in
many papers; in most cases, it provides the network with better performance
than other protocols. In our paper, first we discuss some of techniques,
relates to this protocol, that have been proposed for energy efficiency; some
of them were proposed to provide the network with more security level. Our
proposal then suggests some modifications to some of these techniques to
provide the network with more energy saving that should lead to high
performance; also we apply our technique on an existing one that proposed to
increase the security level of cluster sensor networks.
