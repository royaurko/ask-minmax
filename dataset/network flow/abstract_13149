In this talk some of the latest data on directed sideward, elliptic, radial,
and longitudinal flow at AGS energies will be reviewed. A method to identify
the reaction plane event by event and the measurement of its resolution will be
discussed. The distributions of global observables (transverse energy E_T and
charged particle multiplicity N_c), as well as those of identified particles
will be shown. Finally, the data will be put in context with measurements at
other beam energies. These systematics will then be discussed in terms of
possible signatures of the QCD phase transition.
