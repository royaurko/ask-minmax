The flow equations or exact RG equations for the Higgs Top System are solved
to leading order in $1/N_c$. This allows to relate arbitrary bare actions with
this field content continuously to effective low energy theories, and we find
the flow converging towards general renormalizable models. The assumption of a
bare action of the generalized Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type does not restrict the
parameters of the low energy theory.
