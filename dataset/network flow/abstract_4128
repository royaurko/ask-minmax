The metric on the moduli space of one abelian Higgs vortex on a surface has a
natural geometrical evolution as the Bradlow parameter, which determines the
vortex size, varies. It is shown by various arguments, and by calculations in
special cases, that this geometrical flow has many similarities to Ricci flow.
