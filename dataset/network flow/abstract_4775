This paper presents a reconfigurable parallel data flow architecture. This
architecture uses the concepts of multi-agent paradigm in reconfigurable
hardware systems. The utilization of this new paradigm has the potential to
greatly increase the flexibility, efficiency, expandability of data flow
systems and to provide an attractive alternative to the current set of disjoint
approaches that are currently applied to this problem domain. The ability of
methodology to implement data flow type processing with different models is
presented in this paper.
