High-resolution x-ray scattering, in the presence of an applied current, has
been used for studying the stability of the charge ordered phase of manganese
oxides upon current biasing. We find that the charge ordered structure is
unchanged when a current is flowing in the sample. Such a result indicates that
the non-linear conduction observed in charge ordered manganites can not be
ascribed to a current-induced destabilisation of charge ordering.
