Closed-loop control of an amplifier flow is experimentally investigated. A
feed-forward algorithm is implemented to control the flow downstream a
backward-facing step. Upstream and downstream data are extracted from real-time
velocity fields to compute an ARMAX model used to effect actuation. This work,
done at Reynolds number 430 investigates the practical feasibility of this
approach which has shown great promise in a recent numerical study by Herv\'e
et al (2012). The linear nature of the regime is checked, 2D upstream
perturbations are introduced, and the degree to which the flow can be
controlled is quantified. The resulting actuation is able to effectively reduce
downstream energy levels and fluctuations. The limitations and difficulties of
applying such an approach to an experiment are also emphasized.
