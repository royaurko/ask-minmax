In this paper we initiate an approach that deals with the problem of
calculating average properties of messages traveling on networks, by employing
concepts and methods that are used for the study of the many-body problem in
the field of physics. We set up a framework that simplifies enormously the
problem and, through a concrete example, we show how it can be applied to a
broad class of networks and protocols.
