The formation and collective expansion of the fireball formed in
ultrarelativistic p-A and d-A collisions is discussed. Predictions of the
hydrodynamic model are compared to recent experimental results. The presence of
strong final state interaction effects in the small dense systems is consistent
with the observed azimuthal anisotropy of the flow and with the mass dependence
of the average transverse momentum and of the elliptic flow. This raises the
question of the mechanism explaining such a rapid build up of the collective
flow and the large degree of local equilibration needed to justify this
scenario.
