Based on a recently proposed non-equilibrium mechanism for spatial pattern
formation [cond-mat/0312366] we study how morphogenesis can be controlled by
locally coupled discrete dynamical networks, similar to gene regulation
networks of cells in a developing multicellular organism. As an example we
study the developmental problem of domain formation and proportion regulation
in the presence of noise and cell flow. We find that networks that solve this
task exhibit a hierarchical structure of information processing and are of
similar complexity as developmental circuits of living cells. A further focus
of this paper is a detailed study of noise-induced dynamics, which is a major
ingredient of the control dynamics in the developmental network model. A master
equation for domain boundary readjustments is formulated and solved for the
continuum limit. Evidence for a first order phase transition in equilibrium
domain size at vanishing noise is given by finite size scaling. A second order
phase transition at increased cell flow is studied in a mean field
approximation. Finally, we discuss potential applications.
