Empirical temporal networks display strong heterogeneities in their dynamics,
which profoundly affect processes taking place on these networks, such as rumor
and epidemic spreading. Despite the recent wealth of data on temporal networks,
little work has been devoted to the understanding of how such heterogeneities
can emerge from microscopic mechanisms at the level of nodes and links. Here we
show that long-term memory effects are present in the creation and
disappearance of links in empirical networks. We thus consider a simple
generative modeling framework for temporal networks able to incorporate these
memory mechanisms. This allows us to study separately the role of each of these
mechanisms in the emergence of heterogeneous network dynamics. In particular,
we show analytically and numerically how heterogeneous distributions of contact
durations, of inter-contact durations and of numbers of contacts per link
emerge. We also study the individual effect of heterogeneities on dynamical
processes, such as the paradigmatic Susceptible-Infected epidemic spreading
model. Our results confirm in particular the crucial role of the distributions
of inter-contact durations and of the numbers of contacts per link.
