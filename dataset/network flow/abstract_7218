Malicious mobile phone worms spread between devices via short-range Bluetooth
contacts, similar to the propagation of human and other biological viruses.
Recent work has employed models from epidemiology and complex networks to
analyse the spread of malware and the effect of patching specific nodes. These
approaches have adopted a static view of the mobile networks, i.e., by
aggregating all the edges that appear over time, which leads to an approximate
representation of the real interactions: instead, these networks are inherently
dynamic and the edge appearance and disappearance is highly influenced by the
ordering of the human contacts, something which is not captured at all by
existing complex network measures. In this paper we first study how the
blocking of malware propagation through immunisation of key nodes (even if
carefully chosen through static or temporal betweenness centrality metrics) is
ineffective: this is due to the richness of alternative paths in these
networks. Then we introduce a time-aware containment strategy that spreads a
patch message starting from nodes with high temporal closeness centrality and
show its effectiveness using three real-world datasets. Temporal closeness
allows the identification of nodes able to reach most nodes quickly: we show
that this scheme can reduce the cellular network resource consumption and
associated costs, achieving, at the same time, a complete containment of the
malware in a limited amount of time.
