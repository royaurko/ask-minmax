The three-dimensional equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamic
isentropic flows are considered. An initial-boundary value problem is studied
in a bounded domain with large data. The existence and large-time behavior of
global weak solutions are established through a three-level approximation,
energy estimates, and weak convergence for the adiabatic exponent
$\gamma>\frac32$ and constant viscosity coefficients.
