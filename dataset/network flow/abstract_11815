The effectiveness and simple implementation of physical layer jammers make
them an essential threat for wireless networks. In a multihop wireless network,
where jammers can interfere with the transmission of user messages at every
intermediate nodes along the path, one can employ jamming oblivious routing and
then employ physical-layer techniques (e.g. spread spectrum) to suppress
jamming. However, whereas these approaches can provide significant gains, the
residual jamming can still severely limit system performance. This motivates
the consideration of routing approaches that account for the differences in the
jamming environment between different paths. First, we take a straightforward
approach where an equal outage probability is allocated to each of the links
along the path and develop a minimum energy routing solution. Next, we
demonstrate the shortcomings of this approach and then consider the optimal
outage allocation along paths by employing an approximation to the link outage
probability. This yields an efficient and effective routing algorithm that only
requires knowledge of the measured jamming at each node. Numerical results
demonstrate that the amount of energy saved by the proposed methods with
respect to standard shortest path routing, especially for parameters
appropriate for terrestrial wireless networks, is substantial.
