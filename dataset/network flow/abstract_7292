We simulate the prisoner's dilemma and hawk-dove games on a real social
acquaintance network. Using a discrete analogue of replicator dynamics, we show
that surprisingly high levels of cooperation can be achieved, contrary to what
happens in unstructured mixing populations. Moreover, we empirically show that
cooperation in this network is stable with respect to invasion by defectors.
