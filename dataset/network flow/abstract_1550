This paper reports on the detailed rp-process reaction flow on an accreting
neutron star and the resulting ashes of a type I X-ray burst. It is obtained by
coupling a 298 isotope reaction network to a self-consistent one-dimensional
model calculation with a constant accretion rate of dM/dt=1.0e17g/s (0.09
Eddington).
