We report a new phenomenon occurring in field-responsive suspensions:
shear-induced anomalous stresses. Competition between a rotating field and a
shear flow originates a multiplicity of anomalous stress behaviors in
suspensions of bounded dimers constituted by induced dipoles. The great variety
of stress regimes includes non-monotonous behaviors, multi-resonances, negative
viscosity effect and blockades. The reversibility of the transitions between
the different regimes and the self-similarity of the stresses make this
phenomenon controllable and therefore applicable to modify macroscopic
properties of soft condensed matter phases
