With an increasing emphasis on network security, much more attention has been
attracted to the vulnerability of complex networks. The multi-scale evaluation
of vulnerability is widely used since it makes use of combined powers of the
links' betweenness and has an effective evaluation to vulnerability. However,
how to determine the coefficient in existing multi-scale evaluation model to
measure the vulnerability of different networks is still an open issue. In this
paper, an improved model based on the fractal dimension of complex networks is
proposed to obtain a more reasonable evaluation of vulnerability with more
physical significance. Not only the structure and basic physical properties of
networks is characterized, but also the covering ability of networks, which is
related to the vulnerability of the network, is taken into consideration in our
proposed method. The numerical examples and real applications are used to
illustrate the efficiency of our proposed method.
