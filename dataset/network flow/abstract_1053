We present results of a survey of public transport networks (PTNs) of
selected 14 major cities of the world with PTN sizes ranging between 2000 and
46000 stations and develop an evolutionary model of these networks. The
structure of these PTNs is revealed in terms of a set of neighbourhood
relations both for the routes and the stations. The networks defined in this
way display distinguishing properties due to the constraints of the embedding
2D geographical space and the structure of the cities. In addition to the
standard characteristics of complex networks like the number of nearest
neighbours, mean path length, and clustering we observe features specific to
PTNs. While other networks with real-world links like cables or neurons
embedded in two or three dimensions often show similar behavior, these can be
studied in detail in our present case. Geographical data for the routes reveal
surprising self-avoiding walk properties that we relate to the optimization of
surface coverage. We propose and simulate an evolutionary growth model based on
effectively interacting self-avoiding walks that reproduces the key features of
PTN.
