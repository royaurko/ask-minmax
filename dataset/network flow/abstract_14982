We study the statistics of growing networks in which each link carries a
weight (k_i k_j)^theta, where k_i and k_j are the node degrees at the endpoints
of link ij. Network growth is governed by preferential attachment in which a
newly-added node attaches to a node of degree k with rate A_k=k+lambda. For
general values of theta and lambda, we compute the total weight of a network as
a function of the number of nodes N and the distribution of link weights.
Generically, the total weight grows as N for lambda>theta-1, and super-linearly
otherwise. The link weight distribution is predicted to have a power law form
that is modified by a logarithmic correction for the case lambda=0. We also
determine the node strength, defined as the sum of the weights of the links
that attach to the node, as function of k. Using known results for degree
correlations, we deduce the scaling of the node strength on k and N.
