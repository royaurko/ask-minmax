We study pair dispersion in a three-dimensional incompressible high Reynolds
number turbulent flow generated by Fourier transforming the dynamics of the
Gledzer-Ohkitani-Yamada (GOY) shell model into real space. We show that GOY
shell model can successfully reproduce both the Batchelor and the
Richardson-Obukhov regimes of turbulent relative dispersion. We also study how
the crossover time scales with the initial separations of a particle pair and
compare it to the prediction by Batchelor.
