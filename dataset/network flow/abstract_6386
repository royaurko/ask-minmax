We study the resilience of complex networks against attacks in which nodes
are targeted intelligently, but where disabling a node has a cost to the
attacker which depends on its degree. Attackers have to meet these costs with
limited resources, which constrains their actions. A network's integrity is
quantified in terms of the efficacy of the process that it supports. We
calculate how the optimal attack strategy and the most attack-resistant network
degree statistics depend on the node removal cost function and the attack
resources. The resilience of networks against intelligent attacks is found to
depend strongly on the node removal cost function faced by the attacker. In
particular, if node removal costs increase sufficiently fast with the node
degree, power law networks are found to be more resilient than Poissonian ones,
even against optimized intelligent attacks.
