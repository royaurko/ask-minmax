We study those Lagrangian surfaces in complex Euclidean space which are
foliated by circles or by straight lines. The former, which we call cyclic,
come in three types, each one being described by means of, respectively, a
planar curve, a Legendrian curve of the 3-sphere or a Legendrian curve of the
anti de Sitter 3-space. We also describe ruled Lagrangian surfaces. Finally we
characterize those cyclic and ruled Lagrangian surfaces which are solutions to
the self-similar equation of the Mean Curvature Flow. Finally, we give a
partial result in the case of Hamiltonian stationary cyclic surfaces.
