We prove strong spectral estimates for Ruelle transfer operators for
arbitrary $C^2$ contact Anosov flows in any dimension. For such flows some of
the consequences of the main result are: (a) exponential decay of correlations
for H\"older continuous observables with respect to any Gibbs measure; (b)
existence of a non-zero analytic continuation of the Ruelle zeta function with
a pole at the entropy in a vertical strip containing the entropy in its
interior; (c) a Prime Orbit Theorem with an exponentially small error. All
these results apply for example to geodesic flows on arbitrary compact Riemann
manifolds of negative curvature.
