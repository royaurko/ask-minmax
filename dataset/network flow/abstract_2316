Rayleigh showed that inviscid flow is unstable if the velocity profile has an
inflection point in parallel flows. However, whether viscous flows is unstable
or not is still not proved so far when there is an inflection point in the
velocity profile. Fluid viscosity has showed dual role to the flow instability.
In this paper, it is demonstrated for the first time that viscous parallel flow
with inflectional velocity profile is sufficient for flow instability.
