Redundant sensing capabilities are often required in sensor network
applications due to various reasons, e.g. robustness, fault tolerance, or
increased accuracy. At the same time high sensor redundancy offers the
possibility of increasing network lifetime by scheduling sleep intervals for
some sensors and still providing continuous service with help of the remaining
active sensors. In this paper centralized and distributed algorithms are
proposed to solve the k-coverage sensing problem and maximize network lifetime.
When physically possible, the proposed robust Controlled Greedy Sleep Algorithm
provides guaranteed service independently of node and communication errors in
the network. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated and compared to
results of a random solution by simulation examples.
