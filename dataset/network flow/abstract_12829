PKS 0745-191 is a powerful radio source with one of the largest known cooling
flows (De Grandi, Molendi 1999). A fraction of the cool gas could accumulate
into small molecular clouds. We studied the minimum temperature which can be
reached by sub-clouds (resulting from the fragmentation of bigger clouds) in
the cooling flow region.
