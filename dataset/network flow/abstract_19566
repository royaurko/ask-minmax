We propose a traffic flow model in which the vehicles are filed from their
maximal velocities, the fast cars run with $Vmax{1}$, whereas the slow ones run
with $Vmax{2}$. Using new overtaking rules which deals with deterministic NaSch
model, it is found that the fundamental diagram exhibits three new topologies,
depending on the fractions $f_{fast}$ and $f_{slow}$ of fast and slow vehicles
respectively, in which the current profile displays two branches with negative
slopes and two branches with positive ones. Moreover, in the second branch of
the fundamental diagram, the model exhibits an absorbing phase transitions in
which the behaviour of the order parameter $f_{d}$ and the current J is
described by the power laws. In this case, it'is found that the system present
a universel scaling law. On the other hand, a simple change in the rule of
overtaking induce the metastability which depends on the state of the chain
instead of external parameters \cite{4,5,6}. Furthermore, in the case of random
fractions of vehicles, the fundamental diagrams are similar to the experiments
results \cite{7,8}} .
