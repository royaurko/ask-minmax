We use mean field theory to study the response properties of a simple
randomly-connected model cortical network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons
with balanced excitation and inhibition. The formulation permits arbitrary
temporal variation of the input to the network and takes exact account of
temporal firing correlations. We find that neuronal firing statistics depend
sensitively on the firing threshold. In particular, spike count variances can
be either significantly greater than or significantly less than those for a
Poisson process. These findings may help in understanding the variability
observed experimentally in cortical neuronal responses.
