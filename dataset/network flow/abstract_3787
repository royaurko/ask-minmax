In a previous article, we have proposed that the large scale structure
network generated by large scale magnetic fields could consist of a network of
octahedra only contacting at their vertexes. Assuming such a network could
arise at different scales producing a fractal geometry, we study here its
properties, and in particular how a sub-octahedron network can be inserted
within an octahedron of the large network. We deduce that the scale of the
fractal structure would range from $\approx$100 Mpc, i.e. the scale of the
deepest surveys, down to about 10 Mpc, as other smaller scale magnetic fields
were probably destroyed in the radiation dominated Universe.
