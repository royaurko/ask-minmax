In cellular systems using frequency division duplex, growing Internet
services cause unbalance of uplink and downlink traffic, resulting in poor
uplink spectrum utilization. Addressing this issue, this paper considers
overlaying an ad hoc network onto a cellular uplink network for improving
spectrum utilization and spatial reuse efficiency. Transmission capacities of
the overlaid networks are analyzed, which are defined as the maximum densities
of the ad hoc nodes and mobile users under an outage constraint. Using tools
from stochastic geometry, the capacity tradeoff curves for the overlaid
networks are shown to be linear. Deploying overlaid networks based on frequency
separation is proved to achieve higher network capacities than that based on
spatial separation. Furthermore, spatial diversity is shown to enhance network
capacities.
