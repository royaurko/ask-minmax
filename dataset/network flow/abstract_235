We study some basic problems of translating solitons: the volume growth,
generalized maximum principle, Gauss maps and certain functions related to the
Gauss maps, finally we carry out point-wise estimates and integral estimates
for the squared norm of the second fundamental form. Those estimates give
rigidity theorems for translating solitons in the Euclidean space in higher
codimension.
