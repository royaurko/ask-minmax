The paper describes a simple setup of Oersted experiment. A planar coil of
wires has been used to deflect vigorously the magnetic needle (more than 80
angular degrees) when a current of up to 1 A flows along it. Based on
theoretical analysis the torque on the magnetic field is analytically expressed
taking into account the inhomogeneity of the field and the needle shape. What
is more, a procedure to measure the Earth's magnetic component is implied and
implemented and its magnitude has been estimated following the same steps.
