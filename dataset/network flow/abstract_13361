We use plate drag to study the response of granular media to localized
forcing as a function of volume fraction, $\phi$. A bifurcation in the force
and flow occurs at the onset of dilatancy, $\phi_c.$ Below $\phi_c$ rapid
fluctuations in the drag force, $F_D,$ are observed. Above $\phi_c$
fluctuations in $F_D$ are periodic and increase with $\phi$. Velocity field
measurements indicate that the bifurcation in $F_D$ results from the formation
of stable shear bands above $\phi_c$ which are created and destroyed
periodically during drag. A friction-based model captures the dynamics for
$\phi>\phi_c$.
