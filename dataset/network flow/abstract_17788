We consider a pseudo-Riemannian metric that changes signature along a smooth
curve on a surface, called the discriminant curve. The discriminant curve
separates the surface locally into a Riemannian and a Lorentzian domain. We
study the local behaviour and properties of geodesics at a point on the
discriminant where the isotropic direction is tangent to the discriminant
curve.
