Despite of remarkable successes the theory of superfluidity, until now we
have no a physical explanation of an opportunity of existence of viscousless
flow of liquid helium in viscous medium. The existence of superfluid flow
becomes possible due to occurence of flicker noise and appropriate residual
temporary correlations of the superfluid velocity fluctuations.
