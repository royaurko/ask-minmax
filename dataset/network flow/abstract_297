This paper studies the problem of optimal flow control in dynamic inventory
systems. A dynamic optimal distribution problem, including time-varying supply
and demand, capacity constraints on the transportation lines, and convex flow
cost functions of Legendre-type, is formalized and solved. The time-varying
optimal flow is characterized in terms of the time-varying dual variables of a
corresponding network optimization problem. A dynamic feedback controller is
proposed that regulates the flows asymptotically to the optimal flows and
achieves in addition a balancing of all storage levels.
