The concept of a nested canalizing Boolean function has been studied over the
last decade in the context of understanding the regulatory logic of molecular
interaction networks, such as gene regulatory networks. Such networks are
predominantly governed by nested canalizing functions. Derrida values are
frequently used to analyze the robustness of a Boolean network to
perturbations. This paper introduces closed formulas for the calculation of
Derrida values of networks governed by Boolean nested canalizing functions,
which previously required extensive simulations. Recently, the concept of
nested canalizing functions has been generalized to include multistate
functions, and a recursive formula has been derived for their number, as a
function of the number of variables. This paper contains a detailed analysis of
the class of nested canalizing functions over an arbitrary finite field. In
addition, the concept of nested canalization is further generalized and closed
formulas for the number of such generalized functions, as well as for the
number of equivalence classes under permutation of variables, are derived. The
latter is motivated by the fact that two nested canalizing functions that
differ only by a permutation of the variables share many important properties.
