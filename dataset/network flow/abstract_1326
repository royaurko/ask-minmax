We investigate the fair channel assignment and access design problem for
cognitive radio ad hoc network in this paper. In particular, we consider a
scenario where ad hoc network nodes have hardware constraints which allow them
to access at most one channel at any time. We investigate a fair channel
allocation problem where each node is allocated a subset of channels which are
sensed and accessed periodically by their owners by using a MAC protocol.
Toward this end, we analyze the complexity of the optimal brute-force search
algorithm which finds the optimal solution for this NP-hard problem. We then
develop low-complexity algorithms that can work efficiently with a MAC protocol
algorithm, which resolves the access contention from neighboring secondary
nodes. Also, we develop a throughput analytical model, which is used in the
proposed channel allocation algorithm and for performance evaluation of its
performance. Finally, we present extensive numerical results to demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed algorithms in achieving fair spectrum sharing among
traffic flows in the network.
