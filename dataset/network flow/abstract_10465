We present for the first time a complex network approach to the study of the
electrical properties of single protein devices. In particular, we consider an
electronic nanobiosensor based on a G-protein coupled receptor. By adopting a
coarse grain description, the protein is modeled as a complex network of
elementary impedances. The positions of the alpha-carbon atoms of each amino
acid are taken as the nodes of the network. The amino acids are assumed to
interact electrically among them. Consequently, a link is drawn between any
pair of nodes neighboring in space within a given distance and an elementary
impedance is associated with each link. The value of this impedance can be
related to the physical and chemical properties of the amino acid pair and to
their relative distance. Accordingly, the conformational changes of the
receptor induced by the capture of the ligand, are translated into a variation
of its electrical properties. Stochastic fluctuations in the value of the
elementary impedances of the network, which mimic different physical effects,
have also been considered. Preliminary results concerning the impedance
spectrum of the network and its fluctuations are presented and discussed for
different values of the model parameters.
