We study the ability of magnetic helicity expulsion to alleviate catastrophic
$\alpha$-quenching in mean field dynamos in two--dimensional spherical wedge
domains. Motivated by the physical state of the outer regions of the Sun, we
consider $\alpha^2\Omega$ mean field models with a dynamical $\alpha$
quenching. We include two mechanisms which have the potential to facilitate
helicity expulsion, namely advection by a mean flow ("solar wind") and
meridional circulation. We find that a wind alone can prevent catastrophic
quenching, with the field saturating at finite amplitude. In certain parameter
ranges, the presence of a large-scale meridional circulation can reinforce this
alleviation. However, the saturated field strengths are typically below the
equipartition field strength. We discuss possible mechanisms that might
increase the saturated field.
