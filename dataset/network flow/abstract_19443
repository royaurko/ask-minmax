Motivated by the low-collisionality of gas accreted onto black holes in Sgr
A* and other nearby galactic nuclei, we study a family of 2D advective
accretion solutions with thermal conduction. While we only impose global
inflow, the accretion flow spontaneously develops bipolar outflows. The role of
conduction is key in providing the extra degree of freedom (latitudinal energy
transport) necessary to launch these rotating thermal outflows. The sign of the
Bernoulli constant does not discriminate between inflowing and outflowing
regions. Our parameter survey covers mass outflow rates from ~ 0 to 13% of the
net inflow rate, outflow velocities from ~0 to 11% of the local Keplerian
velocity and outflow opening angles from ~ 0 to 60 degs. As the magnitude of
conduction is increased, outflows can adopt a conical geometry, pure inflow
solutions emerge, and the limit of 2D non-rotating Bondi-like solutions is
eventually reached. These results confirm that radiatively-inefficient, hot
accretion flows have a hydrodynamical propensity to generate bipolar thermal
outflows.
