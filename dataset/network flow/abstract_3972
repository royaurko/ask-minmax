What can we learn from the collective dynamics of a complex network about its
interaction topology? Taking the perspective from nonlinear dynamics, we
briefly review recent progress on how to infer structural connectivity (direct
interactions) from accessing the dynamics of the units. Potential applications
range from interaction networks in physics, to chemical and metabolic
reactions, protein and gene regulatory networks as well as neural circuits in
biology and electric power grids or wireless sensor networks in engineering.
Moreover, we briefly mention some standard ways of inferring effective or
functional connectivity.
