Controlling the flow of energy in a random medium is a research frontier with
a wide range of applications. As recently demonstrated, the effect of disorder
on the transmission of optical beams, may be partially compensated by wavefront
shaping, but losing control over individual light paths. Here we report on a
novel physical effect whereby energy is spatially and spectrally transferred
inside a disordered active medium by the coupling between individual lasing
modes. We show that is possible to transmit an optical resonance to a remote
point by employing specific control over optical excitations. The observed
nonlinear transport bears some analogies to a field-effect transistor for
light, which acts as a switch and as an amplifier.
