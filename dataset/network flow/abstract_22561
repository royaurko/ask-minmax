We investigate the holographic renormalization group flows and the classical
phase transitions that occur in two dimensional QFT model dual to the New
Massive 3D Gravity coupled to scalar matter. Specific matter self-interactions
generated by quadratic superpotential are considered. The off-critical
$AdS_3/CFT_2$ correspondence determines the exact form of the $ QFT_2$ 's
$\beta$ -function and the singular part of the reduced free energy. The
corresponding scaling laws and critical exponents characterizing the RG fixed
points as well as the values of the mass gaps in the massive phases are
obtained.
