We announce a new proof of the uniform estimate on the curvature of solutions
to the Ricci flow on a compact K\"ahler manifold $M^n$ with positive
bisectional curvature. In contrast to the recent work of X. Chen and G. Tian,
our proof of the uniform estimate does not rely on the exsitence of
K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on $M^n$, but instead on the first contributor's Harnack
inequality for the K\"ahler-Ricc flow, and a very recent local injectivity
radius estimate of Perelman for the Ricci flow.
