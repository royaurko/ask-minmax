We develop an analytical model of information dissemination for a gossiping
protocol that combines both pull and push approaches. With this model we
analyse how fast an item is replicated through a network, and how fast the item
spreads in the network, and how fast the item covers the network. We also
determine the optimal size of the exchange buffer, to obtain fast replication.
Our results are confirmed by large-scale simulation experiments.
