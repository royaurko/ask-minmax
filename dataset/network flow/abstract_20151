We define an ending lamination for a Weil-Petersson geodesic ray. Despite the
lack of a natural visual boundary for the Weil-Petersson metric, these ending
laminations provide an effective boundary theory that encodes much of its
asymptotic CAT(0) geometry. In particular, we prove an ending lamination
theorem (Theorem 1.1) for the full-measure set of rays that recur to the thick
part, and we show that the association of an ending lamination embeds asymptote
classes of recurrent rays into the Gromov-boundary of the curve complex. As an
application, we establish fundamentals of the topological dynamics of the
Weil-Petersson geodesic flow, showing density of closed orbits and topological
transitivity.
