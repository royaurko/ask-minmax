Studies of community structure and evolution in large social networks require
a fast and accurate algorithm for community detection. As the size of analyzed
communities grows, complexity of the community detection algorithm needs to be
kept close to linear. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) has the benefits of
nearly-linear running time and easy implementation, thus it forms a good basis
for efficient community detection methods. In this paper, we propose new update
rule and label propagation criterion in LPA to improve both its computational
efficiency and the quality of communities that it detects. The speed is
optimized by avoiding unnecessary updates performed by the original algorithm.
This change reduces significantly (by order of magnitude for large networks)
the number of iterations that the algorithm executes. We also evaluate our
generalization of the LPA update rule that takes into account, with varying
strength, connections to the neighborhood of a node considering a new label.
Experiments on computer generated networks and a wide range of social networks
show that our new rule improves the quality of the detected communities
compared to those found by the original LPA. The benefit of considering
positive neighborhood strength is pronounced especially on real-world networks
containing sufficiently large fraction of nodes with high clustering
coefficient.
