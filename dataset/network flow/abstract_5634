We have, in recent years, witnessed an increased interest towards enabling a
Smart Grid which will be a corner stone to build sustainable energy efficient
communities. An integral part of the future Smart Grid will be the
communications infrastructure which will make real time control of the grid
components possible. Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is thought to be a
key enabler for monitoring and controlling the customer loads. %RPL is a
connectivity enabling mechanism for low power and lossy networks currently
being standardized by the IETF ROLL working group. RPL is deemed to be a
suitable candidate for AMI networks where the meters are connected to a
concentrator over multi hop low power and lossy links. This paper proposes an
efficient cooperative anycasting approach for wireless mesh networks with the
aim of achieving reduced traffic and increased utilisation of the network
resources. The proposed cooperative anycasting has been realised as an
enhancement on top of the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks
(RPL), a connectivity enabling mechanism in wireless AMI mesh networks. In this
protocol, smart meter nodes utilise an anycasting approach to facilitate
efficient transport of metering data to the concentrator node. Moreover, it
takes advantage of a distributed approach ensuring scalability.
