Growing interest is being given to transport of ultra-cold atomic gases
through optical lattices generated by the interference of laser beams. In this
connection we evaluate the phase-coherent transport of a spin-polarized gas of
fermionic atoms along linear structures made from potential wells set in four
alternative types of sequence. These are periodic chains of either identical
wells or pairs of different wells, and chains of pairs of wells arranged in
either a Fibonacci quasi-periodic sequence or a random sequence. The
transmission coefficient of fermionic matter is evaluated in a T-matrix
scattering approach by describing each array through a tight-binding
Hamiltonian and by reducing it to an effective dimer by means of a
decimation/renormalization method. The results are discussed in comparison with
those pertaining to transport by Fermi-surface electrons coupled to an outgoing
lead and by an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. Main attention is given to (i)
Bloch oscillations and their mapping into alternating-current flow through a
Josephson junction; (ii) interference patterns that arise on period doubling
and their analogy with beam splitting in optical interferometry; (iii)
localization by quasi-periodic disorder inside a Fibonacci-ordered structure of
double wells; and (iv) Anderson localization in a random structure of double
wells.
