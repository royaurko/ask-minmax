Correlations are known to play a crucial role in determining the structure of
complex networks. Here we study how their presence affects the computation of
the percolation threshold in random hypergraphs. In order to mimic the
correlation in real network, we build hypergraphs from a generalized hidden
variable ensembles and we study the percolation transition by mapping this
problem to the fully connected Potts model with heterogeneous couplings.
