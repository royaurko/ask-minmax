In random networks decorated with Ising spins, an increase of the density of
frustrations reduces the transition temperature of the spin-glass ordering.
This result is in contradiction to the Bethe theory. Here we investigate if
this effect depends on the small-world property of the network. The results on
the specific heat and the spin susceptibility indicate that the effect appears
also in spatial networks.
