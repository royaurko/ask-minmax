We investigate the flow of various non-Newtonian fluids through
three-dimensional disordered porous media by direct numerical simulation of
momentum transport and continuity equations. Remarkably, our results for
power-law (PL) fluids indicate that the flow, when quantified in terms of a
properly modified permeability-like index and Reynolds number, can be
successfully described by a single (universal) curve over a broad range of
Reynolds conditions and power-law exponents. We also study the flow behavior of
Bingham fluids described in terms of the Herschel-Bulkley model. In this case,
our simulations reveal that the interplay of ({\it i}) the disordered geometry
of the pore space, ({\it ii}) the fluid rheological properties, and ({\it iii})
the inertial effects on the flow is responsible for a substantial enhancement
of the macroscopic hydraulic conductance of the system at intermediate Reynolds
conditions. This anomalous condition of ``enhanced transport'' represents a
novel feature for flow in porous materials.
