We describe fluctuations in finite-size networks with a complex distribution
of connections, $P(k)$. We show that the spectrum of fluctuations of the number
of vertices with a given degree is Poissonian. These mesoscopic fluctuations
are strong in the large-degree region, where $P(k) \lesssim 1/N$ ($N$ is the
total number of vertices in a network), and are important in networks with
fat-tailed degree distributions.
