In this paper, we introduce a distributed dynamic routing algorithm for
secondary users (SUs) to minimize their interference with the primary users
(PUs) in multi-hop cognitive radio (CR) networks. We use the medial axis with a
relaxation factor as a reference path which is contingent on the states of the
PUs. Along the axis, we construct a hierarchical structure for multiple sources
to reach cognitive pilot channel (CPC) base stations. We use a temporal and
spatial dynamic non-cooperative game to model the interactions among SUs as
well as their influences from PUs in the multi-hop structure of the network. A
multi-stage fictitious play learning is used for distributed routing in
multi-hop CR networks. We obtain a set of mixed (behavioral) Nash equilibrium
strategies of the dynamic game in closed form by backward induction. The
proposed algorithm minimizes the overall interference and the average packet
delay along the routing path from SU nodes to CPC base stations in an optimal
and distributed manner
