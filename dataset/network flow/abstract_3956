In various applications involving complex networks, network measures are
employed to assess the relative importance of network nodes. However, the
robustness of such measures in the presence of link inaccuracies has not been
well characterized. Here we present two simple stochastic models of false and
missing links and study the effect of link errors on three commonly used node
centrality measures: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and dynamical
importance. We perform numerical simulations to assess robustness of these
three centrality measures. We also develop an analytical theory, which we
compare with our simulations, obtaining very good agreement.
