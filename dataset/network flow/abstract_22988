The time-evolution of jets in hadronic e+e- events at LEP is investigated in
both position- and momentum-space, with emphasis on effects due to color flow
and particle correlations. We address dynamical aspects of the four
simultanously-evolving, cross-talking parton cascades that appear in the
reaction e+e- -> gamma/Z0 -> W+W- -> q1 q~2 q3 q~4, and compare with the
familiar two-parton cascades in e+e- -> Z0 -> q1 q~2. We use a QCD statistical
transport approach, in which the multiparticle final state is treated as an
evolving mixture of partons and hadrons, whose proportions are controlled by
their local space-time geography via standard perturbative QCD parton shower
evolution and a phenomenological model for non-perturbative parton-cluster
formation followed by cluster decays into hadrons. Our numerical simulations
exhibit a characteristic `inside-outside' evolution simultanously in position
and momentum space. We compare three different model treatments of color flow,
and find large effects due to cluster formation by the combination of partons
from different W parents. In particular, we find in our preferred model a shift
of several hundred MeV in the apparent mass of the W, which is considerably
larger than in previous model calculations. This suggests that the
determination of the W mass at LEP2 may turn out to be a sensitive probe of
spatial correlations and hadronization dynamics.
