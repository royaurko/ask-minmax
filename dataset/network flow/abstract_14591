A simple - yet plausible - model for B-type vortex breakdown flows is
postulated; one that is based on the immersion of a pair of slender coaxial
vortex rings in a swirling flow of an ideal fluid rotating around the axis of
symmetry of the rings. It is shown that this model exhibits in the advection of
passive fluid particles (kinematics) just about all of the characteristics that
have been observed in what is now a substantial body of published research on
the phenomenon of vortex breakdown. Moreover, it is demonstrated how the very
nature of the fluid dynamics in axisymmetric breakdown flows can be predicted
and controlled by the choice of the initial ring configurations and their
vortex strengths. The dynamic intricacies produced by the two ring + swirl
model are illustrated with several numerical experiments.
