We investigate the effect of line addition on the linear stability of radial
electric networks. Using a simple model we show that, depending on the position
of the line addition, four possible scenarios may occur, corresponding to
enhanced or reduced network stability as well as increased or decreased power
flows. In the framework of our model we derive an analytical criterion
specifying whether a given line addition worsens or enhances the operating
conditions of the network. The applicability of our theory to a realistic
transmission network is numerically illustrated.
