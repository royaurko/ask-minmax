We propose an entropic geometrical model of crowd behavior dynamics (with
dissipative crowd kinematics), using Feynman action--amplitude formalism that
operates on three synergetic levels: macro, meso and micro. The intent is to
explain the dynamics of crowds simultaneously and consistently across these
three levels, in order to characterize their geometrical properties
particularly with respect to behavior regimes and the state changes between
them. Its most natural statistical descriptor (order parameter) is crowd
entropy $S$ that satisfies the Prigogine's extended second law of
thermodynamics, $\partial_t S\geq 0$ (for any nonisolated multi-component
system). Qualitative similarities and superpositions between individual and
crowd configuration manifolds motivate our claim that \emph{goal-directed crowd
movement} operates under entropy conservation, $\partial_t S = 0$, while
\emph{naturally chaotic crowd dynamics} operates under (monotonically)
increasing entropy function, $\partial_t S > 0$. Between these two distinct
topological phases lies a phase transition with a chaotic inter-phase. Both
inertial crowd dynamics and its dissipative kinematics represent diffusion
processes on the crowd manifold governed by the Ricci flow.
