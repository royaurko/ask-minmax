The retrieval behavior and thermodynamic properties of symmetrically diluted
Q-Ising neural networks are derived and studied in replica-symmetric mean-field
theory generalizing earlier works on either the fully connected or the
symmetrical extremely diluted network. Capacity-gain parameter phase diagrams
are obtained for the Q=3, Q=4 and $Q=\infty$ state networks with uniformly
distributed patterns of low activity in order to search for the effects of a
gradual dilution of the synapses. It is shown that enlarged regions of
continuous changeover into a region of optimal performance are obtained for
finite stochastic noise and small but finite connectivity. The de
Almeida-Thouless lines of stability are obtained for arbitrary connectivity,
and the resulting phase diagrams are used to draw conclusions on the behavior
of symmetrically diluted networks with other pattern distributions of either
high or low activity.
