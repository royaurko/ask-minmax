In modern biology, one of the most important research problems is to
understand how protein sequences fold into their native 3D structures. To
investigate this problem at a high level, one wishes to analyze the protein
landscapes, i.e., the structures of the space of all protein sequences and
their native 3D structures. Perhaps the most basic computational problem at
this level is to take a target 3D structure as input and design a fittest
protein sequence with respect to one or more fitness functions of the target 3D
structure. We develop a toolbox of combinatorial techniques for protein
landscape analysis in the Grand Canonical model of Sun, Brem, Chan, and Dill.
The toolbox is based on linear programming, network flow, and a linear-size
representation of all minimum cuts of a network. It not only substantially
expands the network flow technique for protein sequence design in Kleinberg's
seminal work but also is applicable to a considerably broader collection of
computational problems than those considered by Kleinberg. We have used this
toolbox to obtain a number of efficient algorithms and hardness results. We
have further used the algorithms to analyze 3D structures drawn from the
Protein Data Bank and have discovered some novel relationships between such
native 3D structures and the Grand Canonical model.
