Recent researches have shown that grid resources can be accessed by client
on-demand, with the help of virtualization technology in the Cloud. The virtual
machines hosted by the hypervisors are being utilized to build the grid network
within the cloud environment. The aim of this study is to survey some concepts
used for the on-demand grid provisioning using Infrastructure as a Service
Cloud and the taxonomy of its related components. This paper, discusses the
different approaches for on-demand grid using infrastructural Cloud, the issues
it tries to address and the implementation tools. The paper also, proposed an
extended classification for the virtualization technology used and a new
classification for the Grid-Cloud integration which was based on the
architecture, communication flow and the user demand for the Grid resources.
This survey, tools and taxonomies presented here will contribute as a guide in
the design of future architectures for further researches.
