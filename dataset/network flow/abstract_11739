We define and propose a resource allocation architecture for cellular
networks. The architecture combines content-aware, time-aware and
location-aware resource allocation for next generation broadband wireless
systems. The architecture ensures content-aware resource allocation by
prioritizing real-time applications users over delay-tolerant applications
users when allocating resources. It enables time-aware resource allocation via
traffic-dependent pricing that varies during different hours of day (e.g. peak
and off-peak traffic hours). Additionally, location-aware resource allocation
is integrable in this architecture by including carrier aggregation of various
frequency bands. The context-aware resource allocation is an optimal and
flexible architecture that can be easily implemented in practical cellular
networks. We highlight the advantages of the proposed network architecture with
a discussion on the future research directions for context-aware resource
allocation architecture. We also provide experimental results to illustrate a
general proof of concept for this new architecture.
