The response of the living tissue to the effects of strong heating or cooling
can cause the blood flow rate to vary by an order of magnitude. A mathematical
model for the freezing of living tissue is formulated which takes into account
the nonlocal temperature dependence of the blood flow rate when the temperature
distribution in the tissue is substantially nonuniform, as in cryosurgery.
