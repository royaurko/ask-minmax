In a recent paper, Marr, Muller-Linow and Hutt [Phys. Rev. E 75, 041917
(2007)] investigate an artificial dynamic system on metabolic networks. They
find a less complex time evolution of this dynamic system in real networks,
compared to networks of reference models. The contributors argue that this suggests
that metabolic network structure is a major factor behind the stability of
biochemical steady states. We reanalyze the same kind of data using a dynamic
system modeling actual reaction kinetics. The conclusions about stability, from
our analysis, are inconsistent with those of Marr et al. We argue that this
issue calls for a more detailed type of modeling.
