Vehicular networks are used to coordinate actions among vehicles in traffic
by the use of wireless transceivers (pairs of transmitters and receivers).
Unfortunately, the wireless communication among vehicles is vulnerable to
security threats that may lead to very serious safety hazards. In this work, we
propose a viable solution for coping with Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
Conventionally, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is utilized for a secure
communication with the pre-certified public key. However, a secure
vehicle-to-vehicle communication requires additional means of verification in
order to avoid impersonation attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work that proposes to certify both the public key and out-of-band
sense-able static attributes to enable mutual authentication of the
communicating vehicles. Vehicle owners are bound to preprocess (periodically) a
certificate for both a public key and a list of fixed unchangeable attributes
of the vehicle. Furthermore, the proposed approach is shown to be adaptable
with regards to the existing authentication protocols. We illustrate the
security verification of the proposed protocol using a detailed proof in Spi
calculus.
