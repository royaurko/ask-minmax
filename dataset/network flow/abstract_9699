Next generation high-performance RDMA-capable networks will require a
fundamental rethinking of the design and architecture of modern distributed
DBMSs. These systems are commonly designed and optimized under the assumption
that the network is the bottleneck: the network is slow and "thin", and thus
needs to be avoided as much as possible. Yet this assumption no longer holds
true. With InfiniBand FDR 4x, the bandwidth available to transfer data across
network is in the same ballpark as the bandwidth of one memory channel, and it
increases even further with the most recent EDR standard. Moreover, with the
increasing advances of RDMA, the latency improves similarly fast. In this
paper, we first argue that the "old" distributed database design is not capable
of taking full advantage of the network. Second, we propose architectural
redesigns for OLTP, OLAP and advanced analytical frameworks to take better
advantage of the improved bandwidth, latency and RDMA capabilities. Finally,
for each of the workload categories, we show that remarkable performance
improvements can be achieved.
