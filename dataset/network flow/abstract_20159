We investigate the chemical interaction between Saturn's corotating plasma
and Enceladus' volcanic plumes. We evolve plasma as it passes through a
prescribed H2O plume using a physical chemistry model adapted for water-group
reactions. The flow field is assumed to be that of a plasma around an
electrically-conducting obstacle centered on Enceladus and aligned with
Saturn's magnetic field, consistent with Cassini magnetometer data. We explore
the effects on the physical chemistry due to: (1) a small population of hot
electrons; (2) a plasma flow decelerated in response to the pickup of fresh
ions; (3) the source rate of neutral H2O. The model confirms that charge
exchange dominates the local chemistry and that H3O+ dominates the water-group
composition downstream of the Enceladus plumes. We also find that the amount of
fresh pickup ions depends heavily on both the neutral source strength and on
the presence of a persistent population of hot electrons.
