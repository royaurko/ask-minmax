The added value of Device-to-Device (D2D) communication amounts to an
efficient content discovery mechanism that enables users to steer their
requests toward the node most likely to satisfy them. In this paper, we address
the implementation of content-centric routing in a D2D architecture for Android
devices based on WiFi Direct, a protocol recently standardised by the Wi-Fi
Alliance. After discussing the creation of multiple D2D groups, we introduce
novel paradigms featuring intra- and inter-group bidirectional communication.
We then present the primitives involved in content advertising and requesting
among members of the multi-group network. Finally, we evaluate the performance
of our architecture in a real testbed involving Android devices in different
group configurations. We also compare the results against the ones achievable
exploiting Bluetooth technologies.
