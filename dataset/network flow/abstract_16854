We review models and approaches for error-control in order to prevent the
buildup of noise when gates for digital chemical and biomolecular computing
based on (bio)chemical reaction processes are utilized to realize stable,
scalable networks for information processing. Solvable rate-equation models
illustrate several recently developed methodologies for gate-function
optimization. We also survey future challenges and possible new research
avenues.
