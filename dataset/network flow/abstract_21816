An efficient matrix formalism for finding power series solutions to boundary
value problems typical for technological plasticity is developed. Hyperbolic
system of two first order quasilinear PDEs that models two-dimensional plastic
flow of von Mises material is converted to the telegraph equation by the
hodograph transformation. Solutions to the boundary value problems are found in
terms of hypergeometric functions. Convergence issue is also addressed. The
method is illustrated by two test problems of metal forming.
