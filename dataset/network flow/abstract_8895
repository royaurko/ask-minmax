In this article, we briefly review recent progress on hydrodynamic modeling
and its implementations to relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the
LHC. The related topics include: 1) initial state fluctuations, final state
correlations and event-by-event hydrodynamics, 2) extracting the QGP shear
viscosity from flow data, 3) flow and hydrodynamics in 5.02 A TeV p+Pb
collisions.
