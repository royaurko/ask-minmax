We present a mathematical model for communication subject to both network
interference and noise. We introduce a framework where the interferers are
scattered according to a spatial Poisson process, and are operating
asynchronously in a wireless environment subject to path loss, shadowing, and
multipath fading. We consider both cases of slow and fast-varying interferer
positions. The paper is comprised of two separate parts. In Part I, we
determine the distribution of the aggregate network interference at the output
of a linear receiver. We characterize the error performance of the link, in
terms of average and outage probabilities. The proposed model is valid for any
linear modulation scheme (e.g., M-ary phase shift keying or M-ary quadrature
amplitude modulation), and captures all the essential physical parameters that
affect network interference. Our work generalizes the conventional analysis of
communication in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise and fast fading,
allowing the traditional results to be extended to include the effect of
network interference. In Part II of the paper, we derive the capacity of the
link when subject to network interference and noise, and characterize the
spectrum of the aggregate interference.
