The eddy viscosity for a turbulent compressible fluid with a relativistic
equation of state is derived. Compressibility allows for sound modes, but the
eddy viscosity in the shear mode is found to be the same as for incompressible
fluids. For two space dimensions (which is the relevant case for the dynamics
of relativistic heavy-ion collisions) the eddy viscosity in the shear mode is
negative, reducing the effective viscosity below its microscopic value. This
could explain the tiny viscosity found at RHIC. Implications for the
experimentally accessible elliptic flow coefficient at the LHC are speculated
on.
