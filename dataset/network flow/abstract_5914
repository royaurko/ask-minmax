We discuss our outreach efforts to introduce school students to network
science and explain why networks researchers should be involved in such
outreach activities. We provide overviews of modules that we have designed for
these efforts, comment on our successes and failures, and illustrate the
potentially enormous impact of such outreach efforts.
