We consider an elastic-plastic medium whose motion equations are isomorphic
to Maxwell's equations. Electrical charges are modeled by pressure centers of
the medium. The electric interaction is shown to be concerned with the
conservation law in the torsion field of the medium. The Lorentz force may
correspond to the Coriolis driving force due to the entrainment of the pressure
center in the medium's flow.
