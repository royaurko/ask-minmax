We summarize recent work on a frustrated periodic long-range Josephson array
in a parameter regime where its dynamical behavior is identical to that of the
$p=4$ disordered spherical model. We also discuss the physical requirements
imposed by the theory on the experimental realization of this superconducting
network.
