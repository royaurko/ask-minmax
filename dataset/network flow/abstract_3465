The aim of this work is to make available to the community a large collection
of mass-action reaction networks of a given size for further research. The set
is limited to what can be computed on a modern multi-core desktop in reasonable
time (< 20 days). We have currently generated over 47 million unique reaction
networks. All currently generated sets of networks are available and as new
sets are completed they will also be made available. Also provided are programs
for translating them into different formats, along with documentation and
examples. Source code and binaries for all the programs are included. These can
be downloaded from (http://www.sys-bio.org/networkenumeration). This library of
networks will allow for thorough studies of the reaction network space.
Additionally, these methods serve as an example for future work on enumerating
other types of biological networks, such as genetic regulatory networks and
mass-action networks that include regulation.
