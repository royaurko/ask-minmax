The wireless mobile ad hoc network (MANET) architecture is one consisting of
a set of mobile hosts capable of communicating with each other without the
assistance of base stations. This has made possible creating a mobile
distributed computing environment and has also brought several new challenges
in distributed protocol design. In this paper, we study a very fundamental
problem, the fault tolerance problem, in a MANET environment and propose a
minimum process coordinated checkpointing scheme. Since potential problems of
this new environment are insufficient power and limited storage capacity, the
proposed scheme tries to reduce the amount of information saved for recovery.
The MANET structure used in our algorithm is hierarchical based. The scheme is
based for Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) which belongs to a class of
Hierarchical Reactive routing protocols. The protocol proposed by us is
nonblocking coordinated checkpointing algorithm suitable for ad hoc
environments. It produces a consistent set of checkpoints; the algorithm makes
sure that only minimum number of nodes in the cluster are required to take
checkpoints; it uses very few control messages. Performance analysis shows that
our algorithm outperforms the existing related works and is a novel idea in the
field. Firstly, we describe an organization of the cluster. Then we propose a
minimum process coordinated checkpointing scheme for cluster based ad hoc
routing protocols.
