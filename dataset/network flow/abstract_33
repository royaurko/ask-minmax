We measure the axisymmetric transport of magnetic flux on the Sun by
cross-correlating narrow strips of data from line-of-sight magnetograms
obtained at a 96-minute cadence by the MDI instrument on the ESA/NASA SOHO
spacecraft and then averaging the flow measurements over each synodic rotation
of the Sun. Our measurements indicate that the axisymmetric flows vary
systematically over the solar cycle. The differential rotation is weaker at
maximum than at minimum. The meridional flow is faster at minimum and slower at
maximum. The meridional flow speed on the approach to the Cycle 23/24 minimum
was substantially faster than it was at the Cycle 22/23 minimum. The average
latitudinal profile is largely a simple sinusoid that extends to the poles and
peaks at about $35\degr$ latitude. As the cycle progresses a pattern of
in-flows toward the sunspot zones develops and moves equatorward in step with
the sunspot zones. These in-flows are accompanied by the torsional
oscillations. This association is consistent with the effects of the Coriolis
force acting on the in-flows. The equatorward motions associated with these
in-flows are identified as the source of the decrease in net poleward flow at
cycle maxima. We also find polar counter-cells (equatorward flow at high
latitudes) in the south from 1996 to 2000 and in the north from 2002 to 2010.
We show that these measurements of the flows are not affected by the
non-axisymmetric diffusive motions produced by supergranulation.
