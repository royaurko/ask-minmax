The influence of the basic rotation on anisotropic and inhomogeneous
turbulence is discussed in the context of differential rotation theory. An
improved representation for the original turbulence leads to a $\Lam$-effect
which complies with the results of 3D numerical simulations. The resulting
rotation law and meridional flow agree well with both the surface observations
($\partial\Om/\partial r<0$ and meridional flow towards the poles) and with the
findings of helioseismology. The computed equatorward flow at the bottom of
convection zone has an amplitude of about 10 m/s and may be significant for the
solar dynamo. The depth of the meridional flow penetration into the radiative
zone is proportional to $\nu^{0.5}_\mathrm{core}$, where $\nu_\mathrm{core}$ is
the viscosity beneath the convection zone. The penetration is very small if the
tachocline is laminar.
