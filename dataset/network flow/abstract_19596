It has already been shown that the energy flow distributions in tagged events
disagree with those predicted by QCD models, generating serious systematic
errors in the unfolding of the photon structure function $F_{2}^{\gamma}$. This
new analysis uses the jet structure in the hadronic final state to identify the
class of events which is in worst agreement with the models. A cone jet finder
is used to select events with 0,1 or 2 jets whose transverse energy is greater
than 3 GeV. Tagged electrons are detected in the OPAL forward detector at
angles between 60 and 120 milliradians. As well as the QCD-based Monte Carlo
models, HERWIG and PYTHIA, the simple F2GEN program is used to give a
comparison sample of events with purely pointlike photon-quark coupling.
