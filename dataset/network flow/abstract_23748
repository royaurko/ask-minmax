In wireless data networks, communication is particularly susceptible to
eavesdropping due to its broadcast nature. Security and privacy systems have
become critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper
considers the problem of secret communication over a Gaussian broadcast
channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential
messages to two users with \emph{information-theoretic secrecy}. That is, each
user would like to obtain its own confidential message in a reliable and safe
manner. This communication model is referred to as the multi-antenna Gaussian
broadcast channel with confidential messages (MGBC-CM). Under this
communication scenario, a secret dirty-paper coding scheme and the
corresponding achievable secrecy rate region are first developed based on
Gaussian codebooks. Next, a computable Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy
capacity region is provided for the MGBC-CM. Furthermore, the Sato-type outer
bound proves to be consistent with the boundary of the secret dirty-paper
coding achievable rate region, and hence, the secrecy capacity region of the
MGBC-CM is established. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates that both
users can achieve positive rates simultaneously under the information-theoretic
secrecy requirement.
