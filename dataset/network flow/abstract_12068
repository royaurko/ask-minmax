W3C's XML-Query language offers a powerful instrument for information
retrieval on XML repositories. This article describes an implementation of this
retrieval in a real world's scenario. Distributed XML-Query processing reduces
load on every single attending node to an acceptable level. The network allows
every participant to control their computing load themselves. Furthermore
XML-repositories may stay at the rights holder, so every Data-Provider can
decide, whether to process critical queries or not. If Data-Providers keep
redundant information, this distributed network improves reliability of
information with duplicates removed.
