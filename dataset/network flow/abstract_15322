This work develops novel algorithms for high-performance networking in the
presence of obstacles based on a method for communicating via ultrasonic rays
reflected at the obstacles. The rays are curves determined by the variable
speed of sound and initial conditions and we develop ultrasonic ray models
based on a system of differential equations. We present new parallel algorithms
and software for shape and trajectory reconstruction of moving obstacles and
show how the reconstructed reflection point of a ray at an obstacle is a
natural router for messages between the ray's transmitter and receiver and
discuss the advantages of the new architecture. We discuss how the new
algorithms and software improve the performance and properties of the network
architecture.
