We explore possible applications of the Lattice-Boltzmann Method for the
simulation of geophysical flows. This fluid solver, while successful in other
fields, is still rarely used for geotechnical applications. We show how the
standard method can be modified to represent free-surface realization of
mudflows, debris flows, and in general any plastic flow, through the
implementation of a Bingham constitutive model. The chapter is completed by an
example of a full-scale simulation of a plastic fluid flowing down an inclined
channel and depositing on a flat surface. An application is given, where the
fluid interacts with a vertical obstacle in the channel.
