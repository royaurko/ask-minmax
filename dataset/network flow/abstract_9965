Extending the earlier results for analytic curve segments, in this article we
describe the asymptotic behaviour of evolution of a finite segment of a
C^n-smooth curve under the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of a finite
volume hyperbolic n-manifold. In particular, we show that if the curve
satisfies certain natural geometric conditions, the pushforward of the
parameter measure on the curve under the geodesic flow converges to the
normalized canonical Riemannian measure on the tangent bundle in the limit. We
also study the limits of geodesic evolution of shrinking segments.
  We use Ratner's classification of ergodic invariant measures for unipotent
flows on homogeneous spaces of SO(n,1), and an observation relating local
growth properties of smooth curves and dynamics of linear SL(2,R)-actions.
