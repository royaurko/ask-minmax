In a bi-directional relay channel, a pair of nodes wish to exchange
independent messages over a shared wireless half-duplex channel with the help
of relays. Recent work has mostly considered information theoretic limits of
the bi-directional relay channel with two terminal nodes (or end users) and one
relay. In this work we consider bi-directional relaying with one base station,
multiple terminal nodes and one relay, all of which operate in half-duplex
modes. We assume that each terminal node communicates with the base-station in
a bi-directional fashion through the relay and do not place any restrictions on
the channels between the users, relays and base-stations; that is, each node
has a direct link with every other node.
  Our contributions are three-fold: 1) the introduction of four new temporal
protocols which fully exploit the two-way nature of the data and outperform
simple routing or multi-hop communication schemes by carefully combining
network coding, random binning and user cooperation which exploit over-heard
and own-message side information, 2) derivations of inner and outer bounds on
the capacity region of the discrete-memoryless multi-pair two-way network, and
3) a numerical evaluation of the obtained achievable rate regions and outer
bounds in Gaussian noise which illustrate the performance of the proposed
protocols compared to simpler schemes, to each other, to the outer bounds,
which highlight the relative gains achieved by network coding, random binning
and compress-and-forward-type cooperation between terminal nodes.
