Segmentation in arthropod embryogenesis represents a well-known example of
body plan diversity. Striped patterns of gene expression that lead to the
future body segments appear simultaneously or sequentially in long and short
germ-band development, respectively. Regulatory genes relevant for stripe
formation are evolutionarily conserved among arthropods, therefore the
differences in the observed traits are thought to have originated from how the
genes are wired. To reveal the basic differences in the network structure, we
have numerically evolved hundreds of gene regulatory networks that produce
striped patterns of gene expression. By analyzing the topologies of the
generated networks, we show that the characteristics of stripe formation in
long and short germ-band development are determined by Feed-Forward Loops
(FFLs) and negative Feed-Back Loops (FBLs) respectively. Network architectures,
gene expression patterns and knockout responses exhibited by the artificially
evolved networks agree with those reported in the fly Drosophila melanogaster
and the beetle Tribolium castaneum. For other arthropod species, principal
network architectures that remain largely unknown are predicted.
