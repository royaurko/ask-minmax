Indoor multpropagation channel is modeled by the Kaiser electromagnetic
wavelet. A method for channel characterization is proposed by modeling all the
reflections of indoor propagation in a kernel function instead of its impulse
response. This lead us to consider a fractal modulation scheme in which Kaiser
wavelets substitute the traditional sinusoidal carrier.
