Security of Wireless sensor network (WSN) becomes a very important issue with
the rapid development of WSN that is vulnerable to a wide range of attacks due
to deployment in the hostile environment and having limited resources.
Intrusion detection system is one of the major and efficient defensive methods
against attacks in WSN. A particularly devastating attack is the sleep
deprivation attack, where a malicious node forces legitimate nodes to waste
their energy by resisting the sensor nodes from going into low power sleep
mode. The goal of this attack is to maximize the power consumption of the
target node, thereby decreasing its battery life. Existing works on sleep
deprivation attack have mainly focused on mitigation using MAC based protocols,
such as S-MAC, T-MAC, B-MAC, etc. In this article, a brief review of some of
the recent intrusion detection systems in wireless sensor network environment
is presented. Finally, we propose a framework of cluster based layered
countermeasure that can efficiently mitigate sleep deprivation attack in WSN.
Simulation results on MATLAB exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model in
detecting sleep-deprivation attacks.
