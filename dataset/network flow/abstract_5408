Complex networks provide us a new view for investigation of immune systems.
In this paper we collect data through STRING database and present a model with
cooperation network theory. The cytokine-protein network model we consider is
constituted by two kinds of nodes, one is immune cytokine types which can act
as acts, other one is protein type which can act as actors. From act degree
distribution that can be well described by typical SPL -shifted power law
functions, we find that
HRAS.TNFRSF13C.S100A8.S100A1.MAPK8.S100A7.LIF.CCL4.CXCL13 are highly
collaborated with other proteins. It reveals that these mediators are important
in cytokine-protein network to regulate immune activity. Dyad act degree
distribution is another important property to generalized collaboration
network. Dyad is two proteins and they appear in one cytokine collaboration
relationship. The dyad act degree distribution can be well described by typical
SPL functions. The length of the average shortest path is 1.29. These results
show that this model could describe the cytokine-protein collaboration
preferably
