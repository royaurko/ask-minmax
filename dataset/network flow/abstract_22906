The present study gives an account of the effect of Li2O on the ease of phase
formation and superconducting properties of Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10+x (Tl-2223)
material. Li substitution only slightly decreases the superconducting
transition temperature, while the optimal concentration of 20% doping improves
the critical current density (Jc) by ~ two fold. We found substantial effects
on the synthesis temperature, microstructure and normal state transport
properties of Tl-2223 with Li2O addition. Short-time thermal annealing under
flowing Ar+4%H2 (1 hr.) further improves the superconducting volume fractions,
as well as Jc.
