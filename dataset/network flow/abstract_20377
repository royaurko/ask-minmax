A new method to extract information from the pp data is proposed. The
approach is based on the use of the event structure variables: sphericity and
spherocity, to split the data into enhanced soft and hard processes samples
corresponding to events with large and low numbers of multi-parton
interactions, respectively. The present study was developed in the framework of
Pythia 8.180 for inelastic pp collisions at sqrt(s) =7 TeV. As an application
of the method, a study of the identified particle transverse momentum spectra
and their ratios; is presented for soft (isotropic) and hard (jetty-like)
events. The flow-like effect on these observables due to multi-parton
interactions and color reconnection is relevant for soft events suggesting that
partons inside the jet do not feel color reconnection and its flow-like
consequences.
