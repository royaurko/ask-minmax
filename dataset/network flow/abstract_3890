In this paper we develop an integrated model for request mechanism and data
transmission in multi-channel wireless local area networks. We calculated the
performance parameters for single and multi-channel wireless networks when the
channel is noisy. The proposed model is general it can be applied to different
wireless networks such as IEEE802.11x, IEEE802.16, CDMA operated networks and
Hiperlan\2.
