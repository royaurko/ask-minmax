In 1990, Hitchin's proved a component of the space of representations of a
surface group in SL(n,R) is homeomorphic to a ball. For n=2,3 this component
has been identified with the holonomies of geometric structures (hyperbolic for
n=2, or real projective for n=3). In the preprint "Anosov flows, Surface groups
and Curves in Projective Space", we extend this interpretation to higher
dimension and show every representation in Hitchin's component is attached to a
(special) curve in projective space, thus giving a geometric interpretation of
these representations. We also prove these representations are faithful,
discrete and purely loxodromic (or hyperbolic)
