We study the spectral properties of a low angular momentum flow as a function
of the shock strength, compression ratio, accretion rate and flow geometry. In
the absence of a satisfactory description of magnetic fields inside the
advective disk, we consider the presence of only stochastic fields and use the
ratio of the field energy to the gravitational energy density as a parameter.
We not only include `conventional' synchrotron emission and Comptonization by
Maxwell-Bolzmann electrons in the gas, but we also compute these effects due to
power-law electrons. For strong shocks, a bump is produced due to the
post-shock flow. A power-law spectral components due to the thermal and
non-thermal electrons appear after this bump.
