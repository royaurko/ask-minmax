We give a pedagogical introduction to Affleck and Ludwig's g-theorem,
distinguishing its applications in field theory vs string theory. We clarify
the recent proposal that the vacuum degeneracy $g$ of a noncompact worldsheet
sigma model with a continuous spectrum of scaling dimensions is lowered under
renormalization group flow while preserving the central charge. As an
illustration we argue that the IR stable endpoint of the relevant flow of the
worldsheet RG induced by a thermal tachyon in the type II string is the
noncompact supersymmetric vacuum with lower $g$. Note Added (Sep 2005).
