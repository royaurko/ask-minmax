The observation data for artificial celestial body 43096, which had been
obtained during 2006-2012 within the framework of international project "The
Scientific Network of Optical Instruments for Astrometric and Photometric
Observations" - International Scientific Optical Network (ISON), were
processed. The Keplerian elements and state vector as of 24 November 2006
01:55:50.76 UTC were determined. The numerical integration of the motion
equations was performed accounting for the perturbations due to the polar
flattening of the Earth, Moon and Sun, as well as the solar radiation pressure.
Based on the numerical model of a motion in the near-Earth space that accounts
for only the most powerful perturbations, a new method for de-orbiting
artificial celestial bodies from high altitudes is suggested. For the first
time such a considerable amount of data over long time intervals was gathered
for the objects with high area-to-mass ratio that enabled to determine their
specific characteristics.
