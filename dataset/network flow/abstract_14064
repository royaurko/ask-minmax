Spherical shock waves of variable energy produced due to a strong explosion
are investigated through the gas-particle two-phase flows. The power series
solutions are obtained for one-dimensional, adiabatic flow of a dusty gas
behind a strong spherical shock front. The dusty gas is assumed to be a mixture
of a perfect gas and small solid particles, in which solid particles are
continuously distributed. The analysis explores to what extent the flow-field
between shock front and inner expanding surface is influenced by small dust
particles. The effects due to an increase in (i) the propagation distance from
the inner expanding surface, (ii) the mass concentration of solid particles in
the mixture and (iii) the ratio of the density of the solid particles to the
initial density of the gas, on the velocity of mixture, pressure of mixture,
density of mixture, speed of sound, adiabatic compressibility of mixture and
change-in-entropy behind the strong spherical shock front are investigated. The
shock profile as well as the flow-field is investigated in detail with power
series solution. The results are compared with the previous investigations for
a perfect gas and are included as limiting cases. Thus, the present analysis:
power series solutions will be constructive for investigating the actual
explosion phenomena.
