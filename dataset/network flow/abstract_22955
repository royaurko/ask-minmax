We review the phenomenon of ultra-compact H II regions (UCHIIs) as a key
phase in the early lives of massive stars. This most visible manifestation of
massive star formation begins when the Lyman continuum output from the massive
young stellar object becomes sufficient to ionize the surroundings from which
it was born. Knowledge of this environment is gained through an understanding
of the morphologies of UCHII regions and we examine the latest developments in
deep radio and mid-IR imaging. SPITZER data from the GLIMPSE survey are an
important new resource in which PAH emission and the ionizing stars can be
seen. We review the role played by strong stellar winds from the central stars
in sweeping out central cavities and causing the limb-brightened appearance. A
range of evidence from velocity structure, proper motions, the molecular
environment and recent hydrodynamical modeling indicates that cometary UCHII
regions require a combination of champagne flow and bow shock motion. Finally,
we discuss the class of hyper-compact H II regions or broad recombination line
objects. They are likely to mark the transition soon after the breakout of the
Lyman continuum radiation from the young star. Models for these objects are
presented, including photo-evaporating disks and ionized accretion flows that
are gravitationally trapped. Evolutionary scenarios tracing young massive stars
passage through these ionized phases are discussed.
