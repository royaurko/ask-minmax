The work of Avestimehr et al. '07 has recently proposed a deterministic model
for wireless networks and characterized the unicast capacity C of such networks
as the minimum rank of the adjacency matrices describing all possible
source-destination cuts. Amaudruz & Fragouli first proposed a polynomial-time
algorithm for finding the unicast capacity of a linear deterministic wireless
network in their 2009 paper. In this work, we improve upon Amaudruz &
Fragouli's work and further reduce the computational complexity of the
algorithm by fully exploring the useful combinatorial features intrinsic in the
problem. Our improvement applies generally with any size of finite fields
associated with the channel model. Comparing with other algorithms on solving
the same problem, our improved algorithm is very competitive in terms of
complexity.
