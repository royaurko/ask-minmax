We provide an automated graph theoretic method for identifying individual
users' trusted networks of friends in cyberspace. We routinely use our social
networks to judge the trustworthiness of outsiders, i.e., to decide where to
buy our next car, or to find a good mechanic for it. In this work, we show that
an email user may similarly use his email network, constructed solely from
sender and recipient information available in the email headers, to distinguish
between unsolicited commercial emails, commonly called "spam", and emails
associated with his circles of friends. We exploit the properties of social
networks to construct an automated anti-spam tool which processes an individual
user's personal email network to simultaneously identify the user's core
trusted networks of friends, as well as subnetworks generated by spams. In our
empirical studies of individual mail boxes, our algorithm classified
approximately 53% of all emails as spam or non-spam, with 100% accuracy. Some
of the emails are left unclassified by this network analysis tool. However, one
can exploit two of the following useful features. First, it requires no user
intervention or supervised training; second, it results in no false negatives
i.e., spam being misclassified as non-spam, or vice versa. We demonstrate that
these two features suggest that our algorithm may be used as a platform for a
comprehensive solution to the spam problem when used in concert with more
sophisticated, but more cumbersome, content-based filters.
