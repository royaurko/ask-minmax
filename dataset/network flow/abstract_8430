We collected mobility traces of 84,208 avatars spanning 22 regions over two
months in Second Life, a popular networked virtual environment. We analyzed the
traces to characterize the dynamics of the avatars mobility and behavior, both
temporally and spatially. We discuss the implications of the our findings to
the design of peer-to-peer networked virtual environments, interest management,
mobility modeling of avatars, server load balancing and zone partitioning,
client-side caching, and prefetching.
