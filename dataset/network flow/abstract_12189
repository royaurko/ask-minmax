Regulatory dynamics in biology is often described by continuous rate
equations for continuously varying chemical concentrations. Binary
discretization of state space and time leads to Boolean dynamics. In the
latter, the dynamics has been called unstable if flip perturbations lead to
damage spreading. Here we find that this stability classification strongly
differs from the stability properties of the original continuous dynamics under
small perturbations of the state vector. In particular, random networks of
nodes with large sensitivity yield stable dynamics under small perturbations.
