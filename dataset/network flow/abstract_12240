This paper presents a novel approach to network coding for distribution of
large files. Instead of the usual approach of splitting packets into disjoint
classes (also known as generations) we propose the use of overlapping classes.
The overlapping allows the decoder to alternate between Gaussian elimination
and back substitution, simultaneously boosting the performance and reducing the
decoding complexity. Our approach can be seen as a combination of fountain
coding and network coding. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate
the promise of our approach.
