Closeness is a global measure of centrality in networks, and a proxy for how
influential actors are in social networks. In most network models, and many
empirical networks, closeness is strongly correlated with degree. However, in
social networks there is a cost of maintaining social ties. This leads to a
situation (that can occur in the professional social networks of executives,
lobbyists, diplomats and so on) where agents have the conflicting objectives of
aiming for centrality while simultaneously keeping the degree low. We
investigate this situation in an adaptive network-evolution model where agents
optimize their positions in the network following individual strategies, and
using only local information. The strategies are also optimized, based on the
success of the agent and its neighbors. We measure and describe the time
evolution of the network and the agents' strategies.
