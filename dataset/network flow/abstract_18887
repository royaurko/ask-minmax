Internet crimes are now increasing. In a row with many crimes using
information technology, in particular those using Internet, some crimes are
often carried out in the form of attacks that occur within a particular agency
or institution. To be able to find and identify the types of attacks, requires
a long process that requires time, human resources and utilization of
information technology to solve these problems. The process of identifying
attacks that happened also needs the support of both hardware and software as
well. The attack happened in the Internet network can generally be stored in a
log file that has a specific data format. Clustering technique is one of
methods that can be used to facilitate the identification process. Having
grouped the data log file using K-means clustering technique, then the data is
grouped into three categories of attack, and will be continued with the
forensic process that can later be known to the source and target of attacks
that exist in the network. It is concluded that the framework proposed can help
the investigator in the trial process.
