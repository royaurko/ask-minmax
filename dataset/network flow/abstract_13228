In the above paper an analysis has been carried out to obtain results in the
Couette flow of a Newtonian fluid with viscous dissipation and temperature
dependent viscosity. The fluid viscosity is an exponential function of
temperature. Exact analytical solutions are obtained for the calculation of
velocity and temperature. However, there are some fundamental errors in this
paper which are presented herein.
