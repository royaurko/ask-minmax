A systematic study of energy spectra for light particles emitted at midrapidity
from Au+Au collisions at E=0.25-1.15 A GeV reveals a significant non-thermal
component consistent with a collective radial flow. This component is evaluated
as a function of bombarding energy and event centrality. Comparisons to Quantum
Molecular Dynamics (QMD) and Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) models are made
for different equations of state.
