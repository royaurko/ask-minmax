We introduce a random intersection graph process aimed at modeling sparse
evolving affiliation networks that admit tunable (power law) degree
distribution and assortativity and clustering coefficients. We show the
asymptotic degree distribution and provide explicit asymptotic formulas for
assortativity and clustering coefficients.
