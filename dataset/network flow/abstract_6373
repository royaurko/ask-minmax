Given a spatio-temporal network (ST network) where edge properties vary with
time, a time-sub-interval minimum spanning tree (TSMST) is a collection of
minimum spanning trees of the ST network, where each tree is associated with a
time interval. During this time interval, the total cost of tree is least among
all the spanning trees. The TSMST problem aims to identify a collection of
distinct minimum spanning trees and their respective time-sub-intervals under
the constraint that the edge weight functions are piecewise linear. This is an
important problem in ST network application domains such as wireless sensor
networks (e.g., energy efficient routing). Computing TSMST is challenging
because the ranking of candidate spanning trees is non-stationary over a given
time interval. Existing methods such as dynamic graph algorithms and kinetic
data structures assume separable edge weight functions. In contrast, we propose
novel algorithms to find TSMST for large ST networks by accounting for both
separable and non-separable piecewise linear edge weight functions. The
algorithms are based on the ordering of edges in edge-order-intervals and
intersection points of edge weight functions.
