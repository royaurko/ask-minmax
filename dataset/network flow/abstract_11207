In this paper, we study the performance of greedy scheduling in multihop
wireless networks, where the objective is aggregate utility maximization.
Following standard approaches, we consider the dual of the original
optimization problem. The dual can be solved optimally, only with the knowledge
of the maximal independent sets in the network. But computation of maximal
independent sets is known to be NP-hard. Motivated by this, we propose a
distributed greedy heuristic to address the problem of link scheduling. We
evaluate the effect of the distributed greedy heuristic on aggregate utility
maximization in detail, for the case of an arbitrary graph. We provide some
insights into the factors affecting aggregate utility maximization in a
network, by providing bounds on the same. We give simulation results for the
approximate aggregate utility maximization achieved under distributed
implementation of the greedy heuristic and find them close to the maximum
aggregate utility obtained using optimal scheduling.
