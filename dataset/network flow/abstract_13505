This work presents fluid dynamics videos obtained via numerical (CFD)
calculations using ComSol (finite elements method) software, showing the
evaporation of HFE7100 (3M company refrigerant) into a nitrogen gas flow along
the liquid interface. The overall temperature evolution and liquid motion,
which is caused by surface-tension (Marangoni) and buoyancy (Rayleigh)
instability mechanisms, are shown as well. Flow behavior in the liquid caused
by the aforementioned instability mechanisms can be nicely seen. Finally, these
observations are made for three liquid thicknesses in order to appreciate the
qualitative influence of confinement.
