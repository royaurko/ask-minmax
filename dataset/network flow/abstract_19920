Many systems in nature exhibit transitions between fluid-like states and
solid-like states, or "jamming transitions". There is a strong theoretical
foundation for understanding equilibrium phase transitions that involve
solidification, or jamming. Other jamming transitions, such as the glass
transition, are less well-understood. The jamming phase diagram has been
proposed to unify the description of equilibrium phase transitions, the glass
transitions, and other non-equilibrium jamming transitions. As with equilibrium
phase transitions, which can either be first order (discontinuous in a relevant
order parameter) or second order (continuous), one would expect that
generalized jamming transitions can be continuous or discontinuous. In studies
of flow in complex fluids, there is a wide range of evidence for discontinuous
transitions, mostly in the context of shear localization, or shear banding. In
this paper, I review the experimental evidence for discontinuous transitions. I
focus on systems in which there is a discontinuity in the rate of strain
between two, coexisting states: one in which the material is flowing and the
other in which it is solid-like.
