Summary: Founded upon diffusion with damping, ITM Probe is an application for
modeling information flow in protein interaction networks without prior
restriction to the sub-network of interest. Given a context consisting of
desired origins and destinations of information, ITM Probe returns the set of
most relevant proteins with weights and a graphical representation of the
corresponding sub-network. With a click, the user may send the resulting
protein list for enrichment analysis to facilitate hypothesis formation or
confirmation.
