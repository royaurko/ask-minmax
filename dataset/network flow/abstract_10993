We propose a simple dynamical model that generates networks with power-law
degree distributions with the exponent 2 through rewiring only. At each time
step, two nodes, i and j, are randomly selected, and one incoming link to i is
redirected to j with the rewiring probability R, determined only by degrees of
two nodes, k_i and k_j, while giving preference to high-degree nodes. To take
the structure of networks into account, we also consider what types of networks
are of interest, whether links are directed or not, and how we choose a
rewiring link out of all incoming links to i, as a result, specifying 24
different cases of the model. We then observe numerically that networks will
evolve to steady states with power-law degree distributions when parameters of
the model satisfy certain conditions.
