Network coding has been successfully used in the past for efficient
broadcasting in wireless multi-hop networks. Two coding approaches are suitable
for mobile networks; Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) and XOR-based coding.
In this work, we make the observation that RLNC provides increased resilience
to packet losses compared to XOR-based coding. We develop an analytical model
that justifies our intuition. However, the model also reveals that combining
RLNC with probabilistic forwarding, which is the approach taken in the
literature, may significantly impact RLNC's performance. Therefore, we take the
novel approach to combine RLNC with a deterministic broadcasting algorithm in
order to prune transmissions. More specifically, we propose a Connected
Dominating Set (CDS) based algorithm that works in synergy with RLNC on the
"packet generation level". Since managing packet generations is a key issue in
RLNC, we propose a distributed scheme, which is also suitable for mobile
environments and does not compromise the coding efficiency. We show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms XOR-based as well as RLNC-based schemes even
when global knowledge is used for managing packet generations.
