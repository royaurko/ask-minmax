We introduce NetworKit, an open-source software package for high-performance
analysis of large complex networks. Complex networks are equally attractive and
challenging targets for data mining, and novel algorithmic solutions as well as
parallelization are required to handle data sets containing billions of
connections. Our goal for NetworKit is to package results of our algorithm
engineering efforts and put them into the hands of domain experts. NetworKit is
a hybrid combining the performance of kernels written in C++ with a convenient
interactive interface written in Python. The package supports shared-memory
parallelism and scales from notebooks to compute servers. In comparison with
related software, we propose NetworKit as a package geared towards large
networks and satisfying three important criteria: High performance, interactive
workflows and integration into an ecosystem of tested tools for data analysis
and scientific computation. The current feature set includes analytics kernels
such as degree distribution, connected components, clustering coefficients,
community detection, k-core decomposition, degree assortativity and multiple
centrality indices. Moreover, NetworKit comes with a collection of graph
generators. With the current release, we present and open up the project to a
community of both algorithm engineers and domain experts
