In this paper, we provide an essentially self-contained and detailed account
of the fundamental works of Hamilton and the recent breakthrough of Perelman on
the Ricci flow and their application to the geometrization of three-manifolds.
In particular, we give a detailed exposition of a complete proof of the
Poincar\'e conjecture due to Hamilton and Perelman.
