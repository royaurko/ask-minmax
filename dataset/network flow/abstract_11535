This technical report considers the design of a social network that would
address the shortcomings of the current ones, and identifies user privacy,
security, and service availability as strong motivations that push the
architecture of the proposed design to be distributed. We describe our design
in detail and identify the property of resiliency as a key objective for the
overall design philosophy.
  We define the system goals, threat model, and trust model as part of the
system model, and discuss the challenges in adapting such distributed
frameworks to become highly available and highly resilient in potentially
hostile environments. We propose a distributed solution to address these
challenges based on a trust-based friendship model for replicating user
profiles and disseminating messages, and examine how this approach builds upon
prior work in distributed Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks.
