Water is abundantly present in the Universe. It is the main component of
interstellar ice mantles and a key ingredient for life. Water in space is
mainly formed through surface reactions. Three formation routes have been
proposed in the past: hydrogenation of surface O, O2, and O3. In a previous
paper [Ioppolo et al., Astrophys. J., 2008, 686, 1474] we discussed an
unexpected non-standard zeroth-order H2O2 production behaviour in O2
hydrogenation experiments, which suggests that the proposed reaction network is
not complete, and that the reaction channels are probably more interconnected
than previously thought. In this paper we aim to derive the full reaction
scheme for O2 surface hydrogenation and to constrain the rates of the
individual reactions. This is achieved through simultaneous H-atom and O2
deposition under ultra-high vacuum conditions for astronomically relevant
temperatures. Different H/O2 ratios are used to trace different stages in the
hydrogenation network. The chemical changes in the forming ice are followed by
means of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). New reaction
paths are revealed as compared to previous experiments. Several reaction steps
prove to be much more efficient (H + O2) or less efficient (H + OH and H2 + OH)
than originally thought. These are the main conclusions of this work and the
extended network concluded here will have profound implications for models that
describe the formation of water in space.
