The statistical properties of velocity gradients in a wall-bounded turbulent
channel flow are discussed on the basis of three-dimensional direct numerical
simulations. Our analysis is concentrated on the trend of the statistical
properties of the local enstrophy ${\bm \omega}^2({\bm x},t)$ and the energy
dissipation rate $\epsilon({\bm x},t)$ with increasing distance from the wall.
We detect a sensitive dependence of the largest amplitudes of both fields
(which correspond with the tail of the distribution) on the spectral
resolution. The probability density functions of each single field as well as
their joint distribution vary significantly with increasing distance from the
wall. The largest fluctuations of the velocity gradients are found in the
logarithmic layer. This is in agreement with recent experiments which observe a
bursting of hairpin vortex packets into the logarithmic region.
