Heterogeneous small cell network has attracted much attention to satisfy
users' explosive data traffic requirements. Heterogeneous cloud small cell
network (HCSNet), which combines cloud computing and heterogeneous small cell
network, will likely play an important role in 5G mobile communication
networks. However, with massive deployment of small cells, co-channel
interference and handover management are two important problems in HCSNet,
especially for cell edge users. In this article, we examine the problems of
cooperative interference mitigation and handover management in HCSNet. A
network architecture is described to combine cloud radio access network with
small cells. An effective coordinated multi-point (CoMP) clustering scheme
using affinity propagation is adopted to mitigate cell edge users'
interference. A low complexity handover management scheme is presented, and its
signaling procedure is analyzed in HCSNet. Numerical results show that the
proposed network architecture, CoMP clustering scheme and handover management
scheme can significantly increase the capacity of HCSNet while maintaining
users' quality of service.
