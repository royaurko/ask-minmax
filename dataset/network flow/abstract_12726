In this paper, we give some results concerning the dynamics of double Boolean
automata circuits (dbac's for short), namely, networks associated to
interaction graphs composed of two side-circuits that share a node. More
precisely, we give formulas for the number of attractors of any period, as well
as the total number of attractors of these networks.
