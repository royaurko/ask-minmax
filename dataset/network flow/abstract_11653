The analysis of the structure of chemical reaction networks is crucial for a
better understanding of chemical processes. Such networks are well described as
hypergraphs. However, due to the available methods, analyses regarding network
properties are typically made on standard graphs derived from the full
hypergraph description, e.g.\ on the so-called species and reaction graphs.
However, a reconstruction of the underlying hypergraph from these graphs is not
necessarily unique. In this paper, we address the problem of reconstructing a
hypergraph from its species and reaction graph and show NP-completeness of the
problem in its Boolean formulation. Furthermore we study the problem
empirically on random and real world instances in order to investigate its
computational limits in practice.
