We describe hot, optically-thin solutions for one-temperature accretion disks
around black holes. We include cooling by synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and
Comptonization. Our solutions are thermally and viscously stable, with gas
temperatures on the order of $T \sim 10^9-10^{10.7}$K. The thermal stability is
a direct result of the inclusion of synchrotron cooling.
 The new solution branch is related to the advection-dominated solution for a
two-temperature gas described by Narayan \& Yi (1995b). It is present only for
mass accretion rates less than some critical $\dot{M}_{crit}$ which depends on
the radius $R$ and viscosity parameter $\alpha$. The solutions are
advection-dominated for extremely low values of $\dot{M}$. However, for a range
of intermediate accretion rates, the new solutions are both hot ($T \sim
10^{10}$K) and cooling-dominated. Because of this new feature, one-temperature
solutions are significantly more luminous than the corresponding two
temperature solutions.
 The radial profile of the new solutions is unusual. The inner parts of the
flow are cooling-dominated and have a disk-like geometry, while the outer parts
are fully advection-dominated and nearly quasi-spherical.
