Initial eccentricity of the interacting volume of QCD matter created in
collisions of prolate and oblate nuclei is studied using optical Glauber
simulation. Collisions of prolate 165-Ho + 165-Ho nuclei and Au+Au nuclei are
investigated (assuming oblate ground-state deformation for 197-Au nucleus).
Qualitative predictions are obtained for RHIC energies.
