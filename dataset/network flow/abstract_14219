The pattern dynamics of the one-way coupled logistic lattice which can serve
as a phenomenological model for open flow is investigated and shown to be
extremely rich. For medium and large coupling strengths, we find spatially
periodic, quasiperiodic and chaotic patterns with temporal periodicity and
analyze their stability with the help of a newly introduced spatial map.
Criteria are established for predicting the down-flow bifurcation behavior of
the coupled map lattice, and for selecting attractors through modulation of the
boundary. For smaller coupling strengths we find a novel regime in which
chaotic defects form a periodic lattice that is shown to be the result of a
boundary crisis.
