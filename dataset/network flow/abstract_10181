We present results of numerical simulations of the effect of driver behavior
on spatiotemporal congested traffic patterns that result from traffic breakdown
at an on-ramp bottleneck. The simulations are made with the Kerner-Klenov
stochastic traffic flow model in the framework of three-phase traffic theory.
Different diagrams of congested patterns at the bottleneck associated with
different driver behavioral characteristics are found and compared each other.
An adaptive cruise control (ACC) in the framework of three-phase traffic theory
introduced by the contributor (called a "driver alike ACC" (DA-ACC)) is discussed.
The effect of DA-ACC-vehicles on traffic flow, in which without the
DA-ACC-vehicles traffic congestion occurs at the bottleneck, is numerically
studied. We show that DA-ACC-vehicles improve traffic flow considerably without
any reduction in driving comfort. It is found that there is a critical
percentage of DA-ACC-vehicles in traffic flow: If the percentage of the
DA-ACC-vehicle exceeds the critical one no traffic breakdown occurs at the
bottleneck. A criticism of a recent "criticism of three-phase traffic theory"
is presented
