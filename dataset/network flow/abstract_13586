We prove the global-in-time existence of weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes
equations of compressible isentropic flow in three space dimensions with
adiabatic exponent $\gamma\ge1$. Initial data and solutions are small in $L^2$
around a non-constant steady state with densities being positive and
essentially bounded. No smallness assumption is imposed on the external forces
when $\gamma=1$. A great deal of information about partial regularity and
large-time behavior is obtained.
