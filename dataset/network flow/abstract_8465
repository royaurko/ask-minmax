Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is one of the most challenging research area in the
field of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, in this research We propose a flexible,
simple, and scalable design for VANET certificates, and new methods for
efficient certificate management, which will Reduce channel overhead by
eliminating the use of CRL, and make Better certificate Revocation Management.
Also it will increase the security of the network and helps in identifying the
adversary vehicle.
