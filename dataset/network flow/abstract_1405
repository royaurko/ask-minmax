Reaction fronts evolving in a porous medium exhibit a rich dynamical
behaviour. In presence of an adverse flow, experiments show that the front
slows down and eventually gets pinned, displaying a particular sawtooth shape.
Extensive numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic equations confirm the
experimental observations. Here we propose a stylized model, predicting two
possible outcomes of the experiments for large adverse flow: either the front
develops a sawtooth shape, or it acquires a complicated structure with islands
and overhangs. A simple criterion allows to distinguish between the two
scenarios and its validity is reproduced by direct hydrodynamical simulations.
Our model gives a better understanding of the transition and is relevant in a
variety of domains, when the pinning regime is strong and only relies on a
small number of sites.
