Recent studies have shown that the majority of today's internet traffic is
related to Peer to Peer (P2P) traffic. The study of bandwidth in P2P networks
is very important. Because it helps us in more efficient capacity planning and
QoS provisioning when we would like to design a large scale computer networks.
In this paper motivated by the behavior of peers (sources or seeds) that is
modeled by Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OU) process, we propose a model for bandwidth in
P2P networks. This model is represented with a stochastic integral. We also
model the bandwidth when we have multiple downloads or uploads. The
autocovariance structure of bandwidth in either case is studied and the
statistical parameters such as mean, variance and autocovariance are obtained.
We then study the queue length behavior of the bandwidth model. The methods for
generating synthetic bandwidth process and estimation of the bandwidth
parameters using maximum likehood estimation are presented.
