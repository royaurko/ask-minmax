In this article, we consider the Angenent-Caputo-Knopf's Ricci Flow through
neckpinch singularities. We will explain how one can see the A-C-K's Ricci flow
through a neckpinch singularity as a flow of integral current spaces. We then
prove the continuity of this weak flow with respect to the Sormani-Wenger
Intrinsic Flat (SWIF) distance.
