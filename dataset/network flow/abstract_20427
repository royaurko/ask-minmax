In this paper we consider the problem of scheduling jobs on parallel
identical machines, where the processing times of jobs are uncertain: only
interval bounds of processing times are known. The optimality criterion of a
schedule is the total flow time. In order to cope with uncertainty we make use
of the robust optimization framework: we seek a schedule which performs well
under all possible instantiations of processing times. Consequently, the goal
is to minimize the maximum regret value of solution. Although the deterministic
version of this problem is solvable in polynomial time, the minmax regret
version is known to be weakly NP-hard even for a single machine, and strongly
NP-hard for parallel unrelated machines. In this paper we show that the problem
is strongly NP-hard also in the case of parallel identical machines.
