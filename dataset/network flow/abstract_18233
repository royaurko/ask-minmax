Vascular and non-vascular cells often form an interconnected network in
vitro, similar to the early vascular bed of warm blooded embryos. Our
time-lapse recordings show that the network forms by extending sprouts, i.e.,
multicellular linear segments. To explain the emergence of such structures, we
propose a simple model of preferential attraction to stretched cells. Numerical
simulations reveal that the model evolves into a quasi-stationary pattern
containing linear segments, which interconnect above the critical volume
fraction of 0.2. In the quasi-stationary state the generation of new branches
offset the coarsening driven by surface tension. In agreement with empirical
data, the characteristic size of the resulting polygonal pattern is
density-independent within a wide range of volume fractions.
