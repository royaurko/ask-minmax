Many complex systems, from power grids and the internet, to the brain and
society, can be modeled using modular networks. Modules, densely interconnected
groups of elements, often overlap due to elements that belong to multiple
modules. The elements and modules of these networks perform individual and
collective tasks such as generating and consuming electrical load, transmitting
data, or executing parallelized computations. We study the robustness of these
systems to the failure of random elements. We show that it is possible for the
modules themselves to become isolated or uncoupled (non-overlapping) well
before the network falls apart. When modular organization is critical to
overall functionality, networks may be far more vulnerable than expected.
