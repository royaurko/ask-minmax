This paper is a thorough study of a digital broadcasting system adapted to
the small mountainous island of Mauritius. A digital LAN was designed with
MPEG-2 signals. The compressed signals were transmitted using DVB-T and QAM
modulators. QAM-16 and QAM-64 modulators were designed and tested with a
simulator under critical conditions of AWGN and phase noises. Results obtained
from simulation have shown that Digital video broadcast with a single frequency
network (SFN) is possible in Mauritius with QAM-64 and QAM-16 modulators
applying COFDM mode of transmission. However, this study has also shown that
QAM-16 modulator had a better performance at low AWGN values (less than 12 dB)
and can be adopted for Mauritius Island, provided that the number of
transmitted channels is not high enough.
