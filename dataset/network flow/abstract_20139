Alfvenic waves are thought to play an important role in coronal heating and
solar wind acceleration. Here we investigate the dissipation of standing Alfven
waves due to phase mixing at the presence of steady flow and sheared magnetic
field in the stratified atmosphere of solar spicules. The transition region
between chromosphere and corona has also been considered. The initial flow is
assumed to be directed along spicule axis, and the equilibrium magnetic field
is taken 2-dimensional and divergence-free. It is determined that in contrast
to propagating Alfven waves, standing Alfven waves dissipate in time rather
than in space. Density gradients and sheared magnetic fields can enhance
damping due to phase mixing. Damping times deduced from our numerical
calculations are in good agreement with spicule lifetimes. Since spicules are
short living and transient structures, such a fast dissipation mechanism is
needed to transport their energy to the corona.
