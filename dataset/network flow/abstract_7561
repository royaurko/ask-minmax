Howard's conjecture, which states that in the linear instability problem of
inviscid heterogeneous parallel shear flow growth rate of an arbitrary unstable
wave must approach zero as the wave length decreases to zero, is established in
a mathematically rigorous fashion for plane parallel heterogeneous shear flows
with negligible buoyancy force $g\beta \ll 1$ (Miles J W, {\it J. Fluid Mech.}
{\bf 10} (1961) 496--508), where $\beta$ is the basic heterogeneity
distribution function).
