In this paper we consider the polyharmonic heat flow of a closed curve in the
plane. Our main result is that closed initial data with initially small
normalised oscillation of curvature and isoperimetric defect flows
exponentially fast in the C^infty-topology to a simple circle. Our results
yield a characterisation of the total amount of time during which the flow is
not strictly convex, quantifying in a sense the failure of the maximum
principle.
