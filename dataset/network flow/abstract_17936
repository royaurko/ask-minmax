This paper presents a forecasting model designed using WSNs (Wireless Sensor
Networks) to predict flood in rivers using simple and fast calculations to
provide real-time results and save the lives of people who may be affected by
the flood. Our prediction model uses multiple variable robust linear regression
which is easy to understand and simple and cost effective in implementation, is
speed efficient, but has low resource utilization and yet provides real time
predictions with reliable accuracy, thus having features which are desirable in
any real world algorithm. Our prediction model is independent of the number of
parameters, i.e. any number of parameters may be added or removed based on the
on-site requirements. When the water level rises, we represent it using a
polynomial whose nature is used to determine if the water level may exceed the
flood line in the near future. We compare our work with a contemporary
algorithm to demonstrate our improvements over it. Then we present our
simulation results for the predicted water level compared to the actual water
level.
