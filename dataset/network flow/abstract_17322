We systematically investigate the effect of blockage sites in a cellular
automaton model for traffic flow. Different scheduling schemes for the blockage
sites are considered. None of them returns a linear relationship between the
fraction of ``green'' time and the throughput. We use this information for a
fast implementation of traffic in Dallas.
