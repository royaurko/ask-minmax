Recent research [1] has suggested that coreness, and not degree, constitutes
a better topological descriptor to identifying influential spreaders in complex
networks. This hypothesis has been verified in the context of disease
spreading. Here, we instead focus on rumor spreading models, which are more
suited for social contagion and information propagation. To this end, we
perform extensive computer simulations on top of several real-world networks
and find opposite results. Namely, we show that the spreading capabilities of
the nodes do not depend on their $k$-core index, which instead determines
whether or not a given node prevents the diffusion of a rumor to a system-wide
scale. Our findings are relevant both for sociological studies of contagious
dynamics and for the design of efficient commercial viral processes.
