High Reynolds numbers Navier-Stokes equations are believed to break
self-similarity concerning both spatial and temporal properties: correlation
functions of different orders exhibit distinct decorrelation times and
anomalous spatial scaling properties. Here, we present a systematic attempt to
measure multi-time and multi-scale correlations functions, by using high
Reynolds numbers numerical simulations of fully homogeneous and isotropic
turbulent flow. The main idea is to set-up an ensemble of probing stations
riding the flow, i.e. measuring correlations in a reference frame centered on
the trajectory of distinct fluid particles (the quasi-Lagrangian reference
frame introduced by Belinicher & L'vov, Sov. Phys. JETP 66, 303 (1987)). In
this way we reduce the large-scale sweeping and measure the non-trivial
temporal dynamics governing the turbulent energy transfer from large to small
scales. We present evidences of the existence of dynamic multiscaling:
multi-time correlation functions are characterized by an infinite set of
characteristic times.
