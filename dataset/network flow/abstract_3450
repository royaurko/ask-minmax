Precisely quantifying the heterogeneity or disorder of a network system is
very important and desired in studies of behavior and function of the network
system. Although many degree-based entropies have been proposed to measure the
heterogeneity of real networks, heterogeneity implicated in the structure of
networks can not be precisely quantified yet. Hence, we propose a new structure
entropy based on automorphism partition to precisely quantify the structural
heterogeneity of networks. Analysis of extreme cases shows that entropy based
on automorphism partition can quantify the structural heterogeneity of networks
more precisely than degree-based entropy. We also summarized symmetry and
heterogeneity statistics of many real networks, finding that real networks are
indeed more heterogenous in the view of automorphism partition than what have
been depicted under the measurement of degree based entropies; and that
structural heterogeneity is strongly negatively correlated to symmetry of real
networks.
