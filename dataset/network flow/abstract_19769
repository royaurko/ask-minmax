The article provides an analytical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations
for the case of the steady flow of an incompressible fluid between two
uniformly co-rotating disks. The solution is derived from the asymptotical
evolution of unknown components of velocity and pressure in a radial
direction--in contrast to the Briter-Pohlhausen analytical solution, which is
supported by simplified Navier-Stokes equations. The obtained infinite system
of ordinary differential equations forms recurrent relations from which unknown
functions can be calculated successively. The first and second approximations
of solution are solved analytically and the third and fourth approximations of
solutions are solved numerically. The numerical example demonstrates agreements
with results obtained by other contributors using different methods.
