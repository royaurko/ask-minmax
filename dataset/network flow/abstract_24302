We present the modification of natural visibility graph (NVG) algorithm used
for the mapping of the time series to the complex networks (graphs). We propose
the parametric natural visibility graph (PNVG) algorithm. The PNVG consists of
NVG links, which satisfy an additional constraint determined by a newly
introduced continuous parameter - the view angle. The alteration ofview angle
modifiesthe PNVG and its properties such as the average node degree, average
link length of the graph as well as cluster quantity of built graph etc.
Wecalculated and analyzed different PNVG properties depending on the view angle
for different types of the time series such as the random (uncorrelated,
correlated and fractal) and cardiac rhythm time series for healthy and ill
patients. Investigation of different PNVG properties shows that the view angle
gives a new approach to characterize the structure of the time series that are
invisible in the conventional version of the algorithm. It is also shown that
the PNVG approach allows to distinguish, identify and describe in detail
various time series.
