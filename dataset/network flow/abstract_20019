The characteristic formulation of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations
(Donat et al 1998 J. Comput. Phys. 146 58), which has been implemented in many
relativistic hydro-codes that make use of Godunov-type methods, has to be
slightly modified in the case of evolving barotropic flows. For a barotropic
equation of state, a removable singularity appears in one of the eigenvectors.
The singularity can be avoided by means of a simple renormalization which makes
the system of eigenvectors well defined and complete. An alternative strategy
for the particular case of barotropic flows is discussed.
