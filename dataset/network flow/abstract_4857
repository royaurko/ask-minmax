The conditions for the development of a Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI)
for the Quark-gluon Plasma (QGP) flow in a peripheral heavy-ion collision is
investigated. The projectile and target side particles are separated by an
energetically motivated hypothetical surface, characterized with a
phenomenological surface tension. In such a view, a classical potential flow
approximation is considered and the onset of the KHI is studied. The growth
rate of the instability is computed as function of phenomenological parameters
characteristic for the QGP fluid: viscosity, surface tension and flow layer
thickness.
