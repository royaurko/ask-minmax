In this paper, we analyze the quality of a large class of simple dynamic
resource allocation (DRA) strategies which we name priority planning. Their aim
is to control an undesired diffusion process by distributing resources to the
contagious nodes of the network according to a predefined priority-order. In
our analysis, we reduce the DRA problem to the linear arrangement of the nodes
of the network. Under this perspective, we shed light on the role of a
fundamental characteristic of this arrangement, the maximum cutwidth, for
assessing the quality of any priority planning strategy. Our theoretical
analysis validates the role of the maximum cutwidth by deriving bounds for the
extinction time of the diffusion process. Finally, using the results of our
analysis, we propose a novel and efficient DRA strategy, called Maximum
Cutwidth Minimization, that outperforms other competing strategies in our
simulations.
