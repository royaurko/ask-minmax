Interesting landforms created by an ancient network of earthworks are shown,
using Google satellite imagery enhanced by an image processing. This network
covers a large part of the land near the Titicaca Lake. Satellite images
clearly display the slopes of hills criss-crossed with terrace walls and the
surfaces of the plains covered with raised fields, indicating that this was
once a highly productive agricultural place for the south central Andes. Some
of the landforms are rather remarkable, having a clear symbolic function. Among
them, there are structures which seem to represent birds, where ponds are their
eyes.
