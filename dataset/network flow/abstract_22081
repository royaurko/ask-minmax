A hydrodynamic model coupled to the statistical hadronization code
Therminator is used to study a set of observables in the soft sector at RHIC. A
satisfactory description of the pT-spectra and elliptic flow is obtained,
similarly to other hydrodynamic models. With the Gaussian initial conditions
the transverse femtoscopic radii are also reproduced, providing a possible
solution of the RHIC HBT puzzle.
