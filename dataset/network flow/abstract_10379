In this paper we investigate the numerical approximation of a variant of the
mean curvature flow. We consider the evolution of hypersurfaces with normal
speed given by $H^k$, $k \ge 1$, where $H$ denotes the mean curvature. We use a
level set formulation of this flow and discretize the regularized level set
equation with finite elements. In a previous paper we proved an a priori
estimate for the approximation error between the finite element solution and
the solution of the original level set equation. We obtained an upper bound for
this error which is polynomial in the discretization parameter and the
reciprocal regularization parameter. The aim of the present paper is the
numerical study of the behavior of the evolution and the numerical verification
of certain convergence rates. We restrict the consideration to the case that
the level set function depends on two variables, i.e. the moving hypersurfaces
are curves. Furthermore, we confirm for specific initial curves and different
values of $k$ that the flow improves the isoperimetrical deficit.
