This paper studies the problem of computing Nash equilibrium in wireless
networks modeled by Weighted Timed Automata. Such formalism comes together with
a logic that can be used to describe complex features such as timed energy
constraints. Our contribution is a method for solving this problem using
Statistical Model Checking. The method has been implemented in UPPAAL model
checker and has been applied to the analysis of Aloha CSMA/CD and IEEE 802.15.4
CSMA/CA protocols.
