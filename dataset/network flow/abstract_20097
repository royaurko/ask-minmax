We present measurements of pion elliptic flow ($v_2$) in Au+Au collisions at
$\sNN =$ 200, 62.4, 39, 27 and 19.6 GeV, as a function of event-by-event charge
asymmetry ($A_{\pm}$), based on data from the STAR experiment at RHIC. We find
that $\pi^-$ ($\pi^+$) elliptic flow linearly increases (decreases) with charge
asymmetry for most centrality bins and for all the beam energies under study.
The slope parameter ($r$) from $v_2(A_\pm)$ difference between $\pi^-$ and
$\pi^+$ shows a centrality dependency similar with the calculations with Chiral
Magnetic Wave. The measurements of charge separation with respect to the
reaction plane in search of Local Parity Violation and Chiral Magnetic Effect
are also presented for Au+Au collisions at $\sNN =$ 200, 62.4, 39, 27, 19.6,
11.5 and 7.7 GeV, and for U+U collisions at 193 GeV.
