We present the derivation of heavy quark energy loss in a viscous QCD plasma
using kinetic theory. Shear flow changes both boson and fermion distribution
functions which eventually modify heavy quark energy loss. Due to presence of
non-zero flow gradient in the medium all the bath particles here are out of
equilibrium. In these types of plasmas we show that without plasma screening
effects heavy quark energy loss suffers similar type of infrared divergence as
one encounters in non-viscous plasma. The screening effects are incorporated
consistently through Hard Thermal Loop resummation perturbation theory in the
small-momentum-transfer region to obtain finite leading order result in
$\eta/s$. We also quantify the importance of the result and demonstrate that
shear flow has significant effect on the heavy quark energy loss.
