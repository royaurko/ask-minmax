The first part of the present paper is devoted to a systematic construction
of continuous-time finite-dimensional integrable systems arising from the
rational su(2) Gaudin model through certain contraction procedures. In the
second part, we derive an explicit integrable Poisson map discretizing a
particular Hamiltonian flow of the rational su(2) Gaudin model. Then, the
contraction procedures enable us to construct explicit integrable
discretizations of the continuous systems derived in the first part of the
paper.
