In this paper, we propose a methodology for estimating the statistics of the
intercell interference power in the downlink of a multicellular network. We
first establish an analytical expression for the probability law of the
interference power when only Rayleigh multipath fading is considered. Next,
focusing on a propagation environment where small-scale Rayleigh fading as well
as large-scale effects, including attenuation with distance and lognormal
shadowing, are taken into consideration, we elaborate a semi-analytical method
to build up the histogram of the interference power distribution. From the
results obtained for this combined small- and large-scale fading context, we
then develop a statistical model for the interference power distribution. The
interest of this model lies in the fact that it can be applied to a large range
of values of the shadowing parameter. The proposed methods can also be easily
extended to other types of networks.
