Breadth First Search (BFS) and other graph traversal techniques are widely
used for measuring large unknown graphs, such as online social networks. It has
been empirically observed that an incomplete BFS is biased toward high degree
nodes. In contrast to more studied sampling techniques, such as random walks,
the precise bias of BFS has not been characterized to date. In this paper, we
quantify the degree bias of BFS sampling. In particular, we calculate the node
degree distribution expected to be observed by BFS as a function of the
fraction of covered nodes, in a random graph $RG(p_k)$ with a given degree
distribution $p_k$. Furthermore, we also show that, for $RG(p_k)$, all commonly
used graph traversal techniques (BFS, DFS, Forest Fire, and Snowball Sampling)
lead to the same bias, and we show how to correct for this bias. To give a
broader perspective, we compare this class of exploration techniques to random
walks that are well-studied and easier to analyze. Next, we study by simulation
the effect of graph properties not captured directly by our model. We find that
the bias gets amplified in graphs with strong positive assortativity. Finally,
we demonstrate the above results by sampling the Facebook social network, and
we provide some practical guidelines for graph sampling in practice.
