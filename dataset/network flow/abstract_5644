Defining an optimal protection strategy against viruses, spam propagation or
any other kind of contamination process is an important feature for designing
new networks and architectures. In this work, we consider decentralized optimal
protection strategies when a virus is propagating over a network through a SIS
epidemic process. We assume that each node in the network can fully protect
itself from infection at a constant cost, or the node can use recovery
software, once it is infected.
  We model our system using a game theoretic framework and find pure, mixed
equilibria, and the Price of Anarchy (PoA) in several network topologies.
Further, we propose both a decentralized algorithm and an iterative procedure
to compute a pure equilibrium in the general case of a multiple communities
network. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms and give numerical illustrations
of all our results.
