We propose two schemes to achieve fast realizations of spatially correlated
percolation models. The schemes are shown to be efficient in complementary
regimes of correlation phase space. They are combined with a generalized
Newman-Ziff algorithm to numerically determine the percolation thresholds of
two-dimensional lattices in the presence of correlations. It is found that the
spatial correlations affect only a relatively small part of phase space.
