We first proved a compactness theorem of the K\"ahler metrics, which confirms
a prediction of Chen. Then we prove several eigenvalue estimates along the
Calabi flow. Combining the compactness theorem and these eigenvalue estimates,
we generalize the method developed by Chen-Li-Wang to prove the small energy
theorems of the Calabi flow.
