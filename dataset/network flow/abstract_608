We have studied the dynamics of avalanching wet granular media in a rotating
drum apparatus. Quantitative measurements of the flow velocity and the granular
flux during avalanches allow us to characterize novel avalanche types unique to
wet media. We also explore the details of viscoplastic flow (observed at the
highest liquid contents) in which there are lasting contacts during flow,
leading to coherence across the entire sample. This coherence leads to a
velocity independent flow depth at high rotation rates and novel robust pattern
formation in the granular surface.
