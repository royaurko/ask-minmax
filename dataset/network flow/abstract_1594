We discuss the validity and the outcome of a scaling hypothesis proposed by
us some years ago, according to which the influence of the density on the
slowing down of flow and relaxation in glassforming liquids and polymers is
described trough a single effective interaction energy Einf(rho). We stress the
formal consequences and the physical meaning of the scaling.
