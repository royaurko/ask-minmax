This chapter presents joint interference suppression and power allocation
algorithms for DS-CDMA and MIMO networks with multiple hops and
amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols. A scheme for joint
allocation of power levels across the relays and linear interference
suppression is proposed. We also consider another strategy for joint
interference suppression and relay selection that maximizes the diversity
available in the system. Simulations show that the proposed cross-layer
optimization algorithms obtain significant gains in capacity and performance
over existing schemes.
