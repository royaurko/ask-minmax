This paper introduces the concept of choreography with respect to
inter-organizational innovation networks, as they constitute an attractive
environment to create innovation in different sectors. We argue that
choreography governs behaviours by shaping the level of connectivity and
cohesion among network members. It represents a valid organizational system
able to sustain some activities and to reach effects generating innovation
outcomes. This issue is tackled introducing a new framework in which we propose
a network model as prerequisite for our hypothesis. The analysis is focused on
inter-organizational innovation networks characterized by the presence of hubs,
semi-peripheral and peripheral members lacking hierarchical contributority. We
sustain that the features of a network, bringing to synchronization phenomena,
are extremely similar to those existing in innovation network characterized by
the emergence of choreography. The effectiveness of our model is verified by
providing a real case study that gives preliminary empirical hints on the
network aptitude to perform choreography. Indeed, the innovation network
analysed in the case study reveals characteristics causing synchronization and
consequently the establishment of choreography.
