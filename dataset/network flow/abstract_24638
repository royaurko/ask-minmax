With the fast development of high-speed railways, a call for fulfilling the
notion of communication at "anytime, anywhere" for high-speed train passengers
in the Train Operating Control System is on the way. In order to make a
realization of that, new railway wireless communication networks are needed.
The most promising one is the Long Term Evolution for Railway which will
provide broadband access, fast handover, and reliable communication for high
mobility users. However, with the increase of speed, the system is subjected to
high bit error rate, Doppler frequency shift and handover failure just like
other system does. This paper is trying to solve these problems by employing
MIMO technique. Specifically, the goal is to provide higher data rate, higher
reliability, less delay, and other relative quality of services for passengers.
MIMO performance analysis, resource allocation, and access control for handover
and various services in a two-hop model are proposed in this paper. Analytical
results and simulation results show that the proposed model and schemes perform
well in improving the system performances.
