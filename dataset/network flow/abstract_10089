We give a definition of the spectral flow for paths of bounded essentially
hyperbolic operators on a Banach space. The spectral flow induces a group
homomorphism on the fundamental group of every connected component of the space
of essentially hyperbolic operators. We prove that this homomorphism completes
the exact homotopy sequence of a Serre fibration. This allows us to
characterise its kernel and image and to produce examples of spaces where it is
not injective or not surjective, unlike what happens for Hilbert spaces. For a
large class of paths, namely the essentially splitting, the spectral flow of $
A $ coincides with $ -\ind(F_A) $, the Fredholm index of the differential
operator $ F_A (u) = u' - A u $.
