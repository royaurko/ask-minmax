We simplify and improve the curvature estimates in the paper: On the
conditions to extend Ricci flow(II). Furthermore, we develop some volume
estimates for the Ricci flow with bounded scalar curvature. These estimates can
be applied to study the singularities of the Ricci flow and convergence
properties of the K\"ahler Ricci flow.
