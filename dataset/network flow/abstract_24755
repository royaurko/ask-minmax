Deep learning can achieve outstanding results in various fields. However, it
requires so significant computational power that graphics processing units
(GPUs) and/or numerous computers are often required for the practical
application. We have developed a new distributed calculation framework called
"Sashimi" that allows any computer to be used as a distribution node only by
accessing a website. We have also developed a new JavaScript neural network
framework called "Sukiyaki" that uses general purpose GPUs with web browsers.
Sukiyaki performs 30 times faster than a conventional JavaScript library for
deep convolutional neural networks (deep CNNs) learning. The combination of
Sashimi and Sukiyaki, as well as new distribution algorithms, demonstrates the
distributed deep learning of deep CNNs only with web browsers on various
devices. The libraries that comprise the proposed methods are available under
