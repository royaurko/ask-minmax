The AC power flow equations underlie all operational aspects of power
systems. They are solved routinely in operational practice using the
Newton-Raphson method and its variants. These methods work well given a good
initial "guess" for the solution, which is always available in normal system
operations. However, with the increase in levels of intermittent generation,
the assumption of a good initial guess always being available is no longer
valid. In this paper, we solve this problem using the theory of monotone
operators. We show that it is possible to compute (using an offline
optimization) a "monotonicity domain" in the space of voltage phasors. Given
this domain, there is a simple efficient algorithm that will either find a
solution in the domain, or provably certify that no solutions exist in it. We
validate the approach on several IEEE test cases and demonstrate that the
offline optimization can be performed tractably and the computed "monotonicity
domain" includes all practically relevant power flow solutions.
