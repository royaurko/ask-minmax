The dependence of the statistics of energy dissipation on the Reynolds number
is investigated in an experimental jet flow. In a range of about one decade of
$Re_{\lambda}$ (from about 200 to 2000) the adimensional mean energy
dissipation is found to be independent on $Re_{\lambda}$, while the higher
moments of dissipation show a power-law dependence. The scaling exponents are
found to be consistent with a simple prediction based on the multifractal model
for inertial range structure functions. This is an experimental confirmation of
the connection between inertial range quantities and dissipation statistics
predicted by the multifractal approach.
