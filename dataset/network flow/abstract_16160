We present an updated version of the Multicolor Light Curve Shape method to
measure distances to type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), incorporating new procedures
for K-correction and extinction corrections. We also develop a simple model to
disentangle intrinsic color variations and reddening by dust, and expand the
method to incorporate U-band light curves and to more easily accommodate prior
constraints on any of the model parameters. We apply this method to 133 nearby
SN Ia, including 95 objects in the Hubble flow (cz >= 2500 km/s), which give an
intrinsic dispersion of less than 7% in distance. The Hubble flow sample, which
is of critical importance to all cosmological uses of SN Ia, is the largest
ever presented with homogeneous distances. We find the Hubble flow supernovae
with Hd >= 7400 km/s yield an expansion rate that is 6.5 +/- 1.8% lower than
the rate determined from supernovae within that distance, and this can have a
large effect on measurements of the dark energy equation of state with SN Ia.
Peculiar velocities of SN Ia host galaxies in the rest frame of the Local Group
are consistent with the dipole measured in the Cosmic Microwave Background.
Direct fits of SN Ia that are significantly reddened by dust in their host
galaxies suggest their mean extinction law may be described by R_V ~= 2.7, but
optical colors alone provide weak constraints on R_V.
