Charged particle directed flow at midrapidity, |eta|<0.8, and forward
rapidity, 1.7 < |eta|<5.1, is measured in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt{s_NN} = 2.76
TeV with ALICE at the LHC. Directed flow is reported as a function of collision
centrality, charged particle transverse momentum, and pseudo-rapidity. Results
are compared to measurements at RHIC and recent model calculations for LHC
energies.
