This paper evaluates and classifies existing and emerging energy-control
technologies for computer networks based on their relative value functions.
Using formal decision analysis methods, we demonstrate the impact of
risk-benefit dimensions on technology certain equivalent and deployment
perspective. We demonstrate how energy control solutions can be cost-effective
or unsustainable depending on network type and operator risk tolerance.
