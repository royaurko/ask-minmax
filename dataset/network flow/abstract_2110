The deployment of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) along major roadways
has been a favoured strategy of insurgents in recent war zones, both for the
ability to cause damage to targets along roadways at minimal cost, but also as
a means of controlling the flow of traffic and causing additional expense to
opposing forces. Among other related approaches (which we discuss), the
adversarial problem has an analogue in the Canadian Traveller Problem, wherein
a stretch of road is blocked with some independent probability, and the state
of the road is only discovered once the traveller reaches one of the
intersections that bound this stretch of road. We discuss the implementation of
ideas from social network analysis, namely the notion of "betweenness
centrality", and how this can be adapted to the notion of deployment of IEDs
with the aid of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs): namely, how we can model the
probability of an IED deployment in terms of the increased effort due to
Canadian betweenness, how we can include expert judgement on the probability of
a deployment, and how we can extend the approach to estimation and updating
over several time steps.
