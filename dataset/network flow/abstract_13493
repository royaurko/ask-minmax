We investigate an oblivious routing scheme, amenable to distributed
computation and resilient to graph changes, based on electrical flow. Our main
technical contribution is a new rounding method which we use to obtain a bound
on the L1->L1 operator norm of the inverse graph Laplacian. We show how this
norm reflects both latency and congestion of electric routing.
