A recursive computation of scattering amplitudes including Majorana fermions
requires a consistent definition of the fermion flow, which is introduced by
Denner et al. in a diagrammatic setting. A systematic treatment in the
off-shell current formalism is proposed, which involves explicit reversal of
fermion currents.
