We give an account of the finite predictable constraint condition. This
condition is closely linked with the projection formula, but also linked with
the martingale representation property. Actually, if the martingale
representation property holds, the representation processes always satisfy the
finite predictable constraint condition. Consequently, there exists always a
representation process which is locally bounded and has pathwisely orthogonal
components outside of a predictable thin set. These results will be then
applied to study the viability problem caused by an expansion of market
information flow. It will be proved, with the martingale representation
property, that, to have a fully viable market expansion, the drift operator
$\Gamma$ satisfies necessarily the drift multiplier assumption, i.e., the
formula $ \Gamma(X)=\ ^\top\!\!\varphi \centerdot[N,X]^{\mathbb{F}\cdot p}. $
