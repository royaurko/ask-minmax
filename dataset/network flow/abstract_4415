The inference of the interactions between organisms in an ecosystem from
observational data is an important problem in ecology. This paper presents a
mathematical inference method, originally developed for the inference of
biochemical networks in molecular biology, adapted for the inference of
networks of ecological interactions. The method is applied to a network of
invertebrate families (taxa) in a rice field.
