We present a Hamiltonian approach for the wellknown Eigen model of the Darwin
selection dynamics. Hamiltonization is carried out by means of the embedding of
the population variable space, describing behavior of the system, into the
space of doubled dimension by introducing additional dynamic variables. Besides
the study of the formalism, we try to interpret its basic elements (phase
space, Hamiltonian, geometry of solutions) in terms of the theoretical biology.
A geometric treatment is given for the considered system dynamics in terms of
the geodesic flows in the Euclidean space where the population variables serve
as curvilinear coordinates. The evolution of the distribution function is found
for arbitrary distributed initial values of the population variables.
