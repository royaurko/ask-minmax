We introduce the concept of a semigroup coupled cell network and show that
the collection of semigroup network vector fields forms a Lie algebra. This
implies that near a dynamical equilibrium the local normal form of a semigroup
network is a semigroup network itself. Networks without the semigroup property
will support normal forms with a more general network architecture, but these
normal forms nevertheless possess the same symmetries and synchronous solutions
as the original network. We explain how to compute Lie brackets and normal
forms of coupled cell networks and we characterize the SN-decomposition that
determines the normal form symmetry. This paper concludes with a generalization
to nonhomogeneous networks with the structure of a semigroupoid.
