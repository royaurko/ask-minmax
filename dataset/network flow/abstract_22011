This paper presents a design flow for an improved selective
multi-threshold(Selective-MT) circuit. The Selective-MT circuit is improved so
that plural MT-cells can share one switch transistor. We propose the design
methodology from RTL(Register Transfer Level) to final layout with optimizing
switch transistor structure.
