We investigate the effect of small suction Reynolds number and permeability
parameter on the stability of Poiseuille fluid flow in a porous medium between
two parallel horizontal stationary porous plates . We have shown that the
perturbed flow is governed by an equation named modified Orr-Sommerfeld
equation. We find also that the normalization of the wall-normal velocity with
characteristic small suction (or small injection) velocity is important for a
perfect command of porous medium fluid flow stability analysis. The stabilizing
effect of the parameters in general and small suction Reynolds number and
permeability parameters in particular on the linear stability are found.
