Motivated by recent experiments where interference patterns behind a grating
are obtained by accumulating single photon events, here we provide an
electromagnetic energy flow-line description to explain the emergence of such
patterns. We find and discuss an analogy between the equation describing these
energy flow lines and the equation of Bohmian trajectories used to describe the
motion of massive particles.
