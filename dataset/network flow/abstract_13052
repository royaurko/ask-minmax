The mathematical properties of a nonlinear parabolic equation arising in the
modelling of non-newtonian flows are investigated. The peculiarity of this
equation is that it may degenerate into a hyperbolic equation (in fact a linear
advection equation). Depending on the initial data, at least two situations can
be encountered: the equation may have a unique solution in a convenient class,
or it may have infinitely many solutions.
