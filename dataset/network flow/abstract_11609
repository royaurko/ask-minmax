The emulation of wireless nodes spatial position is a practice used by
deployment engineers and network planners to analyze the characteristics of a
network. In particular, nodes geolocation will directly impact factors such as
connectivity, signals fidelity, and service quality. In literature, in addition
to typical homogenous scattering, normal distribution is frequently used to
model mobiles concentration in a cellular system. Moreover, Gaussian dropping
is often considered as an effective placement method for airborne sensor
deployment. Despite the practicality of this model, getting the network channel
loss distribution still relies on exhaustive Monte Carlo simulation. In this
paper, we argue the need for this inefficient approach and hence derived a
generic and exact closed-form expression for the path-loss distribution density
between a base-station and a network of nodes. Simulation was used to reaffirm
the validity of the theoretical analysis using values from the new IEEE 802.20
standard.
