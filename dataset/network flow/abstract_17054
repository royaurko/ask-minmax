Key predistribution schemes for distributed sensor networks have received
significant attention in the recent literature. In this paper we propose a new
construction method for these schemes based on combinations of duals of
standard block designs. Our method is a broad spectrum one which works for any
intersection threshold. By varying the initial designs, we can generate various
schemes and this makes the method quite flexible. We also obtain explicit
algebraic expressions for the metrics for local connectivity and resiliency.
These schemes are quite efficient with regard to connectivity and resiliency
and at the same time they allow a straightforward shared-key discovery.
