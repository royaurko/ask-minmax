The linear noise approximation is commonly used to obtain intrinsic noise
statistics for biochemical networks. These estimates are accurate for networks
with large numbers of molecules. However it is well known that many biochemical
networks are characterized by at least one species with a small number of
molecules. We here describe version 0.3 of the software intrinsic Noise
Analyzer (iNA) which allows for accurate computation of noise statistics over
wide ranges of molecule numbers. This is achieved by calculating the next order
corrections to the linear noise approximation's estimates of variance and
covariance of concentration fluctuations. The efficiency of the methods is
significantly improved by automated just-in-time compilation using the LLVM
framework leading to a fluctuation analysis which typically outperforms that
obtained by means of exact stochastic simulations. iNA is hence particularly
well suited for the needs of the computational biology community.
