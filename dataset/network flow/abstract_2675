We introduce notions of suspension and flow equivalence on one-sided
topological Markov shifts, which we call one-sided suspension and one-sided
flow equivalence, respectively. We prove that one-sided flow equivalence is
equivalent to continuous orbit equivalence on one-sided topological Markov
shifts. We also show that the zeta function of the flow on a one-sided
suspension is a dynamical zeta function with some potential function and that
the set of certain dynamical zeta functions is invariant under one-sided flow
equivalence of topological Markov shifts.
