Recently, there has been a growing interest in network scenarios where
selfish agents are able to communicate, bargain and form coalitions, i.e., play
a cooperative game, in order to overcome the inefficiency of noncooperative
equilibria. We study such coalitional games under worst-case conditions in the
fundamental load-balancing setting of routing over parallel links.
Specifically, we investigate fundamental solution concepts of the considered
cooperative game, namely the (Inner) Core and the min-max fair Nucleolus. Most
notably we prove that under certain conditions they contain the system optimum.
