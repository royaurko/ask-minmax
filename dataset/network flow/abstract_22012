Successful applications of the Kruskal-Segur approach to interfacial pattern
formation have remained limited due to the necessity of an integral formulation
of the problem. This excludes nonlinear bulk equations, rendering convection
intractable. Combining the method with Zauderer's asymptotic decomposition
scheme, we are able to strongly extend its scope of applicability and solve
selection problems based on free boundary formulations in terms of partial
differential equations alone. To demonstrate the technique, we give the first
analytic solution of the problem of velocity selection for dendritic growth in
a forced potential flow.
