Thermodynamics have been applied to astronomy, biology, psychology, some
social systems and so on. But, various evolutions from astronomy to biology and
social systems cannot be only increase of entropy. When fluctuations are
magnified due to internal interactions, the statistical independence and the
second law of the thermodynamics are not hold. The existence of internal
interactions is necessary condition of decrease of entropy in isolated system.
We calculate quantitatively the entropy of plasma. Then we discuss the
thermodynamics of biology, and obtain a mathematical expression on moderate
degree of input negative entropy flow, which is a universal scientific law.
Further, the thermodynamics of physiology and psychology, and the thought field
are introduced. Qigong and various religious practices are related to these
states of order, in which decrease of entropy is shown due to internal
interactions of the isolated systems. Finally we discuss possible decrease of
entropy in some social systems.
