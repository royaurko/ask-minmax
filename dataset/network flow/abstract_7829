Globular CW-complexes and flows are both geometric models of concurrent
processes which allow to model in a precise way the notion of dihomotopy.
Dihomotopy is an equivalence relation which preserves computer-scientific
properties like the presence or not of deadlock. One constructs an embedding
from globular CW-complexes to flows and one proves that two globular
CW-complexes are dihomotopic if and only if the corresponding flows are
dihomotopic. This note is the first one presenting some of the results of
math.AT/0201252.
