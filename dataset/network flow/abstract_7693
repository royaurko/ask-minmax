A slip model for gas flows in micro/nano-channels induced by external body
forces is derived based on Maxwell's collision theory between gas molecules and
the wall. The model modifies the relationship between slip velocity and
velocity gradient at the walls by introducing a new parameter in addition to
the classic Tangential Momentum Accommodation Coefficient. Three-dimensional
Molecular Dynamics simulations of helium gas flows under uniform body force
field between copper flat walls with different channel height are used to
validate the model and to determine this new parameter.
