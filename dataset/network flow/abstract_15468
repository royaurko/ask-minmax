Social media is an area where users often experience censorship through a
variety of means such as the restriction of search terms or active and
retroactive deletion of messages. In this paper we examine the feasibility of
automatically detecting censorship of microblogs. We use a network growing
model to simulate discussion over a microblog follow network and compare two
censorship strategies to simulate varying levels of message deletion. Using
topological features extracted from the resulting graphs, a classifier is
trained to detect whether or not a given communication graph has been censored.
The results show that censorship detection is feasible under empirically
measured levels of message deletion. The proposed framework can enable
automated censorship measurement and tracking, which, when combined with
aggregated citizen reports of censorship, can allow users to make informed
decisions about online communication habits.
