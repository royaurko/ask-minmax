Stochastic stability for centralized time-varying Kalman filtering over a
wireles ssensor network with correlated fading channels is studied. On their
route to the gateway, sensor packets, possibly aggregated with measurements
from several nodes, may be dropped because of fading links. To study this
situation, we introduce a network state process, which describes a finite set
of configurations of the radio environment. The network state characterizes the
channel gain distributions of the links, which are allowed to be correlated
between each other. Temporal correlations of channel gains are modeled by
allowing the network state process to form a (semi-)Markov chain. We establish
sufficient conditions that ensure the Kalman filter to be exponentially
bounded. In the one-sensor case, this new stability condition is shown to
include previous results obtained in the literature as special cases. The
results also hold when using power and bit-rate control policies, where the
transmission power and bit-rate of each node are nonlinear mapping of the
network state and channel gains.
