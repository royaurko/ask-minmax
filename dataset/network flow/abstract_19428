We calculate the X-ray emission from the shocked fast wind blown by the
central stars of planetary nebulae (PNs) and compare with observations. Using
spherically symmetric self similar solutions, we calculate the flow structure
and X-ray temperature for a fast wind slamming into a previously ejected slow
wind. We find that the observed X-ray emission of six PNs can be accounted for
by shocked wind segments that were expelled during the early PN phase, if the
fast wind speed is moderate, v_2~400-600 km/sec, and the mass loss rate is a
few times 10^{-7} Mo/year. We find, as proposed previously, that the morphology
of the X-ray emission is in the form of a narrow ring inner to the optical
bright part of the nebula. The bipolar X-ray morphology of several observed
PNs, which indicates an important role of jets rather than a spherical fast
wind, cannot be explained by the flow studied here.
