We consider collisions of particles advected in a fluid. As already pointed
out by Smoluchowski [Z. f. physik. Chemie XCII, 129-168, (1917)], macroscopic
motion of the fluid can significantly enhance the frequency of collisions
between the suspended particles. This effect was invoked by Saffman and Turner
[J. Fluid Mech. 1, 16-30, (1956)] to estimate collision rates of small water
droplets in turbulent rain clouds, the macroscopic motion being caused by
turbulence. Here we show that the Saffman-Turner theory is unsatisfactory
because it describes an initial transient only. The reason for this failure is
that the local flow in the vicinity of a particle is treated as if it were a
steady hyperbolic flow, whereas in reality it must fluctuate. We derive exact
expressions for the steady-state collision rate for particles suspended in
rapidly fluctuating random flows and compute how this steady state is
approached. For incompressible flows, the Saffman-Turner expression is an upper
bound.
