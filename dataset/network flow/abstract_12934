We investigate the mechanical response of an aqueous foam, and its relation
to the microscopic rearrangement dynamics of the bubble-packing structure. At
rest, even though the foam is coarsening, the rheology is demonstrated to be
linear. Under flow, shear-induced rearrangements compete with
coarsening-induced rearrangements. The macroscopic consequences are captured by
a novel rheological method in which a step-strain is superposed on an otherwise
steady flow.
