We use a combined phase-field/lattice-Boltzmann scheme [D. Medvedev, K.
Kassner, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 72}, 056703 (2005)] to simulate non-facetted crystal
growth from an undercooled melt in external flows. Selected growth parameters
are determined numerically.
  For growth patterns at moderate to high undercooling and relatively large
anisotropy, the values of the tip radius and selection parameter plotted as a
function of the Peclet number fall approximately on single curves. Hence, it
may be argued that a parallel flow changes the selected tip radius and growth
velocity solely by modifying (increasing) the Peclet number. This has
interesting implications for the availability of current selection theories as
predictors of growth characteristics under flow.
  At smaller anisotropy, a modification of the morphology diagram in the plane
undercooling versus anisotropy is observed. The transition line from dendrites
to doublons is shifted in favour of dendritic patterns, which become faster
than doublons as the flow speed is increased, thus rendering the basin of
attraction of dendritic structures larger.
  For small anisotropy and Prandtl number, we find oscillations of the tip
velocity in the presence of flow. On increasing the fluid viscosity or
decreasing the flow velocity, we observe a reduction in the amplitude of these
oscillations.
