Vortex flow in driven type II superconductors shows strong memory and history
dependent effects. Here, we study a schematic microscopic model of driven
vortices to propose a scenario for a broad set of these kind of phenomena
ranging from ``rejuvenation'' and ``stiffening'' of the system response, to
``memory'' and ``irreversibility'' in I-V characteristics.
