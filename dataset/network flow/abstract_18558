We apply bio-inspired methods for the analysis of different dynamic
bibliometric networks (linking papers by citation, contributors, and keywords,
respectively). Biological species are clusters of individuals defined by widely
different criteria and in the biological perspective it is natural to (1) use
different categorizations on the same entities (2) to compare the different
categorizations and to analyze the dissimilarities, especially as they change
over time. We employ the same methodology to comparisons of bibliometric
classifications. We constructed them as analogs of three species concepts:
cladistic or lineage based, similarity based, and "biological species" (based
on co-reproductive ability). We use the Rand and Jaccard indexes to compare
classifications in different time intervals. The experiment is aimed to address
the classic problem of science mapping, as to what extent the various
techniques based on different bibliometric indicators, such as citations,
keywords or contributors are able to detect convergent structures in the
litrerature, that is, to identify coherent specialities or research directions
and their dynamics.
