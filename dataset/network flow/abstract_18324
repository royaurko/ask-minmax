Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have gained researchers' attention in the
last several years. Small sensors powered by miniaturized microprocessors are
capable of supporting several applications for civil and military domains.
Determining the location of sensors is a basic and essential knowledge for most
WSN algorithms and protocols including data tagging, routing, node
identification, among others. This paper surveys the different algorithms that
have been proposed to securely determine the location of a sensor node. By
"secure", we mean that adversaries cannot easily affect the accuracy of the
localized sensors. In other words, the localization algorithm must be robust
under several attacks. We provide a taxonomy for classifying different secure
localization schemes and describe possible attacks that can harm localization.
In addition, we survey different secure localization schemes and show how they
map to the proposed taxonomy. We also give a comparison between the different
schemes, showing the attacks addressed by each.
