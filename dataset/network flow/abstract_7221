When network and graph theory are used in the study of complex systems, a
typically finite set of nodes of the network under consideration is frequently
either explicitly or implicitly considered representative of a much larger
finite or infinite region or set of objects of interest. The selection
procedure, e.g., formation of a subset or some kind of discretization or
aggregation, typically results in individual nodes of the studied network
representing quite differently sized parts of the domain of interest. This
heterogeneity may induce substantial bias and artifacts in derived network
statistics. To avoid this bias, we propose an axiomatic scheme based on the
idea of node splitting invariance to derive consistently weighted variants of
various commonly used statistical network measures. The practical relevance and
applicability of our approach is demonstrated for a number of example networks
from different fields of research, and is shown to be of fundamental importance
in particular in the study of spatially embedded functional networks derived
from time series as studied in, e.g., neuroscience and climatology.
