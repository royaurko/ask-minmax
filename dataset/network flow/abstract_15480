In Wireless Sensor Networks, sensed data are reported to the sink by the
available nodes in the communication range. The sensed data should be reported
to the sink with the frequency expected by the sink. In order to have a
communication between source and sink, Link based routing is used. Link based
routing aims to achieve an energy efficient and reliable routing path. This
mechanism considers the status (current energy level in terms of Joules) of
each node, link condition (number of transmissions that the Cluster Head
(CH)and the Gateway (GW) candidates conducts) and the transmit power (power
required for transmission in terms of Joules). A metric called Predicted
Transmission Count (PTX) for each node is calculated using its status, link
condition and transmit power. The node which has highest PTX will have the
highest priority and it will be the potential candidate to act as CH or GW.
Thus the selection of proper CH or GW reduces the energy consumption, and the
network lifetime is increased.
