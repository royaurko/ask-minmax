We present and study a probabilistic neural automaton in which the fraction
of simultaneously-updated neurons is a parameter, rho (0, 1) . For small rho,
there is relaxation towards one of the attractors and a great sensibility to
external stimuli and, for rho >= rho_c, itinerancy among attractors. Tuning rho
in this regime, oscillations may abruptly change from regular to chaotic and
vice versa, which allows one to control the efficiency of the searching
process. We argue on the similarity of the model behavior with recent
observations and on the possible role of chaos in neurobiology.
