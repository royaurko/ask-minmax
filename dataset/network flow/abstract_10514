The analysis of non-equilibrium steady states of biochemical reaction
networks relies on finding the configurations of fluxes and chemical potentials
satisfying stoichiometric (mass balance) and thermodynamic (energy balance)
constraints. Efficient methods to explore such states are crucial to predict
reaction directionality, calculate physiologic ranges of variability, estimate
correlations, and reconstruct the overall energy balance of the network from
the underlying molecular processes. While different techniques for sampling the
space generated by mass balance constraints are currently available,
thermodynamics is generically harder to incorporate. Here we introduce a method
to sample the free energy landscape of a reaction network at steady state. In
its most general form, it allows to calculate distributions of fluxes and
concentrations starting from trial functions that may contain prior biochemical
information. We apply our method to the human red blood cell's metabolic
network, whose space of mass-balanced flux states has been sampled extensively
in recent years. Specifically, we profile its thermodynamically feasible flux
configurations, characterizing in detail how fluctuations of fluxes and
potentials are correlated. Based on this, we derive the cell's energy balance
in terms of entropy production, chemical work done and thermodynamic
efficiency.
