Despite many works on collaborative networked organizations (CNOs), CSCW,
groupware, workflow systems and social networks, computer support for virtual
teams is still insufficient, especially support for agility, i.e. the
capability of virtual team members to rapidly and cost efficiently adapt the
way they interact to changes. In this paper, requirements for computer support
for agile virtual teams are presented. Next, an extension of the concept of
social protocol is proposed as a novel model supporting agile interactions
within virtual teams. The extended concept of social protocol consists of an
extended social network and a workflow model.
