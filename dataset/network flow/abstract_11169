We derive an expression for the accuracy with which sources can be localized
using a network of gravitational wave detectors. The result is obtained via
triangulation, using timing accuracies at each detector and is applicable to a
network with any number of detectors. We use this result to investigate the
ability of advanced gravitational wave detector networks to accurately localize
signals from compact binary coalescences. We demonstrate that additional
detectors can significantly improve localization results and illustrate our
findings with networks comprised of the advanced LIGO, advanced Virgo and LCGT.
In addition, we evaluate the benefits of relocating one of the advanced LIGO
detectors to Australia.
