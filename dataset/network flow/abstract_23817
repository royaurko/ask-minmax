In this paper, motivated by network inference and tomography applications, we
study the problem of compressive sensing for sparse signal vectors over graphs.
In particular, we are interested in recovering sparse vectors representing the
properties of the edges from a graph. Unlike existing compressive sensing
results, the collective additive measurements we are allowed to take must
follow connected paths over the underlying graph. For a sufficiently connected
graph with $n$ nodes, it is shown that, using $O(k \log(n))$ path measurements,
we are able to recover any $k$-sparse link vector (with no more than $k$
nonzero elements), even though the measurements have to follow the graph path
constraints. We further show that the computationally efficient $\ell_1$
minimization can provide theoretical guarantees for inferring such $k$-sparse
vectors with $O(k \log(n))$ path measurements from the graph.
