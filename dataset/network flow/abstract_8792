A summary of the optimization of the SiD detector is given. To optimize its
performance in terms of Particle Flow Algorithms (PFA), five basic detector
parameters have been varied and the impact on the obtained energy resolution
using Particle Flow Algorithms has been studied using di-jets events. Finally
the optimized detector used for the Letter of Intent (LoI) is briefly
summarized as a result from these studies.
