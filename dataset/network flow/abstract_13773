The bulk flow velocity for the cluster of interstellar cloudlets within about
30 pc of the Sun is determined from optical and ultraviolet absorption line
data, after omitting from the sample stars with circumstellar disks or variable
emission lines and the active variable HR 1099. Ninety-six velocity components
towards the remaining 60 stars yield a streaming velocity through the local
standard of rest of -17.0+/-4.6 km/s, with an upstream direction of l=2.3 deg,
b=-5.2 deg (using Hipparcos values for the solar apex motion). The velocity
dispersion of the interstellar matter (ISM) within 30 pc is consistent with
that of nearby diffuse clouds, but present statistics are inadequate to
distinguish between a Gaussian or exponential distribution about the bulk flow
velocity. The upstream direction of the bulk flow vector suggests an origin
associated with the Loop I supernova remnant. Groupings of component velocities
by region are seen, indicating regional departures from the bulk flow velocity
or possibly separate clouds. The absorption components from the cloudlet
feeding ISM into the solar system form one of the regional features. The
nominal gradient between the velocities of upstream and downstream gas may be
an artifact of the Sun's location near the edge of the local cloud complex. The
Sun may emerge from the surrounding gas-patch within several thousand years.
