This study focuses on the mobile video delivery from a video server to a
multi-homed client with a network of heterogeneous wireless. Joint
Source-Channel Coding is effectively used to transmit video over
bandwidth-limited, noisy wireless networks. But most existing JSCC methods only
consider single path video transmission of the server and the client network.
The problem will become more complicated when consider multi-path video
transmission, because involving low-bandwidth, high-drop-rate or high-latency
wireless network will only reduce the video quality. To solve this critical
problem, we propose a novel Path Adaption JSCC (PA-JSCC) method that contain
below characters: (1) path adaption, and (2) dynamic rate allocation. We use
Exata to evaluate the performance of PA-JSCC and Experiment show that PA-JSCC
has a good results in terms of PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio).
