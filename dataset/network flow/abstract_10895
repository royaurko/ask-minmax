In the vicinity of their glass transition, dense colloidal suspensions
acquire elastic properties over experimental timescales. We investigate the
possibility of a visco-elastic flow instability in curved geometry for such
materials. To this end, we first present a general strategy extending a
first-principles approach based on projections onto slow variables (so far
restricted to strictly homogeneous flow) in order to handle inhomogeneities. In
particular, we separate the advection of the microstructure by the flow, at the
origin of a fluctuation advection term, from the intrinsic dynamics. On account
of the complexity of the involved equations, we then opt for a drastic
simplification of the theory, in order to establish its potential to describe
instabilities. These very strong approximations lead to a constitutive equation
of the White-Metzner class, whose parameters are fitted with experimental
measurements of the macroscopic rheology of a glass-forming colloidal
dispersion. The model properly accounts for the shear-thinning properties of
the dispersions, but, owing to the approximations, the description is not fully
quantitative. Finally, we perform a linear stability analysis of the flow in
the experimentally relevant cylindrical (Taylor-Couette) geometry and provide
evidence that shear-thinning strongly stabilises the flow, which can explain
why visco-elastic instabilities are not observed in dense colloidal
suspensions.
