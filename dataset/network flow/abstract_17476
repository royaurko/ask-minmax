We review the construction of multi-centered black hole solutions through
dimensional reduction over time. This method does not rely on Killing spinor
equations or gradient flow equations, but on solving the second order field
equations in terms of harmonic functions. The black hole attractor equations
are obtained directly from the field equations.
