Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection is studied and quantitative comparisons are
made, where possible, between theory and experiment by performing numerical
simulations of the Boussinesq equations for a variety of experimentally
realistic situations. Rectangular and cylindrical geometries of varying aspect
ratios for experimental boundary conditions, including fins and spatial ramps
in plate separation, are examined with particular attention paid to the role of
the mean flow. A small cylindrical convection layer bounded laterally either by
a rigid wall, fin, or a ramp is investigated and our results suggest that the
mean flow plays an important role in the observed wavenumber. Analytical
results are developed quantifying the mean flow sources, generated by amplitude
gradients, and its effect on the pattern wavenumber for a large-aspect-ratio
cylinder with a ramped boundary. Numerical results are found to agree well with
these analytical predictions. We gain further insight into the role of mean
flow in pattern dynamics by employing a novel method of quenching the mean flow
numerically. Simulations of a spiral defect chaos state where the mean flow is
suddenly quenched is found to remove the time dependence, increase the
wavenumber and make the pattern more angular in nature.
