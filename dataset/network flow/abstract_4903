We present an extension of the multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics
(MRxMHD) equilibrium model that includes pressure anisotropy and general plasma
flows. This anisotropic extension to our previous isotropic model is motivated
by Sun and Finn's model of relaxed anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic equilibria.
We prove that as the number of plasma regions becomes infinite, our anisotropic
extension of MRxMHD reduces to anisotropic ideal MHD with flow. The
continuously nested flux surface limit of our MRxMHD model is the first
variational principle for anisotropic plasma equilibria with general flow
fields.
