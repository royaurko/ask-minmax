The study of community structure has been a hot topic of research over the
last years. But, while successfully applied in several areas, the concept lacks
of a general and precise notion. Facts like the hierarchical structure and
heterogeneity of complex networks make it difficult to unify the idea of
community and its evaluation. The global functional known as modularity is
probably the most used technique in this area. Nevertheless, its limits have
been deeply studied. Local techniques as the ones by Lancichinetti et al. and
Palla et al. arose as an answer to the resolution limit and degeneracies that
modularity has.
  Here we start from the algorithm by Lancichinetti et al. and propose a unique
growth process for a fitness function that, while being local, finds a
community partition that covers the whole network, updating the scale parameter
dynamically. We test the quality of our results by using a set of benchmarks of
heterogeneous graphs. We discuss alternative measures for evaluating the
community structure and, in the light of them, infer possible explanations for
the better performance of local methods compared to global ones in these cases.
