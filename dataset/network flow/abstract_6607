Many Information Centric Networking (ICN) proposals use a network of caches
to bring the contents closer to the consumers, reduce the load on producers and
decrease the unnecessary retransmission for ISPs. Nevertheless, the existing
cache management scheme for the network of caches obtain poor performance. The
main reason for performance degradation in a network of caches is the filter
effect of the replacement policy. A cache serves the requests that generate
cache-hits and forwards the requests that generate cache-misses. This filtering
changes the pattern of requests and leads to decreased hit ratios in the
subsequent caches. In this paper, we propose a coordinated caching scheme to
solve the filter effect problem by introducing the selection policy. This
policy manages a cache such that: i) the cache obtains a high hit ratio ii) the
missed requests from the cache can be used by subsequent caches to obtain a
high hit ratio. Our coordinated selection scheme achieves an overall hit ratio
of a network of caches equivalent to that of edge routers with big caches.
Moreover, our scheme decreases the average number of evictions per cache slot
by four order of magnitude compared to the LRU universal caching.
