In this note we construct Nadel multiplier ideal sheaves using the Ricci flow
on Fano manifolds. This extends a result of Phong, Sesum and Sturm. These
sheaves, like their counterparts constructed by Nadel for the continuity
method, can be used to obtain an existence criterion for Kahler-Einstein
metrics.
