The collective behavior of dislocations in jerky flow is studied in Al-Mg
polycrystalline samples subjected to constant strain rate tests. Complementary
dynamical, statistical and multifractal analyses are carried out on the
stress-time series recorded during jerky flow to characterize the distinct
spatio-temporal dynamical regimes. It is shown that the hopping type B and the
propagating type A bands correspond to chaotic and self-organized critical
states respectively. The crossover between these types of bands is identified
by a large spread in the multifractal spectrum. These results are interpreted
on the basis of competing scales and mechanisms.
