The recently introduced hierarchical regular networks HN3 and HN4 are
analyzed in detail. We use renormalization group arguments to show that HN3, a
3-regular planar graph, has a diameter growing as \sqrt{N} with the system
size, and random walks on HN3 exhibit super-diffusion with an anomalous
exponent d_w = 2 - \log_2\phi = 1.306..., where \phi = (\sqrt{5} + 1)/2 =
1.618... is the "golden ratio." In contrast, HN4, a non-planar 4-regular graph,
has a diameter that grows slower than any power of N, yet, fast than any power
of \ln N . In an annealed approximation we can show that diffusive transport on
HN4 occurs ballistically (d_w = 1). Walkers on both graphs possess a first-
return probability with a power law tail characterized by an exponent \mu = 2
-1/d_w . It is shown explicitly that recurrence properties on HN3 depend on the
starting site.
