We consider operators in the domains with the boundaries and derive sharp
spectral asymptotics (containing non-Weyl correction) in the case when
Hamiltonian flow is periodic.
  Even if operator is scalar but not second order (or even second-order but
there is an inner boundary with both refraction and reflection present)
Hamiltonian flow is branching on the boundary and the notion of periodicity
becomes more complicated.
