The existence or not of a percolation threshold on power law correlated
graphs is a fundamental question for which a general criterion is lacking. In
this work we investigate the problems of site and bond percolation on graphs
with degree correlations and their connection with spreading phenomena. We
obtain some general expressions that allow the computation of the transition
thresholds or their bounds. Using these results we study the effects of
assortative and disassortative correlations on the resilience to damage of
networks.
