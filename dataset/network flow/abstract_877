Relying on random and purposive moving agents, we simulated human movement in
large street networks. We found that aggregate flow, assigned to individual
streets, is mainly shaped by the underlying street structure, and that human
moving behavior (either random or purposive) has little effect on the aggregate
flow. This finding implies that given a street network, the movement patterns
generated by purposive walkers (mostly human beings) and by random walkers are
the same. Based on the simulation and correlation analysis, we further found
that the closeness centrality is not a good indicator for human movement, in
contrast to a long standing view held by space syntax researchers. Instead we
suggest that Google's PageRank, and its modified version - weighted PageRank,
betweenness and degree centralities are all better indicators for predicting
aggregate flow.
