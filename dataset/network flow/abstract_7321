In this paper we propose an augmented smoothing function for nonlinear L1
-norm minimization problem and consider a global stability of a gradient-based
neural network model to minimize the smoothing function. The numerical
simulations show that our smoothing neural network finds successfully the
global solution of the L1 -norm minimization problems considered in the
simulation.
