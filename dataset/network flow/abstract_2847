This article describes the fluid dynamics video: "Turbulent Bubbly Channel
Flow: Role of Bubble Deformability." The effect of bubble deformability on the
flow rate of bubbly upflow in a turbulent vertical channel is examined using
direct numerical simulations. A series of simulations with bubbles of
decreasing deformability shows a transition from flow where deformable bubbles
remain in the middle of the channel to a situation where nearly spherical
bubbles slide along the walls.
