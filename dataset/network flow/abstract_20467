In this article we investigate the structure of the four-point functions of
the $AdS_3$-WZNW model. We consider the integral expression for the unflowed
four-point correlator involving at least one state in the discrete part of the
spectrum derived by analytic continuation from the $H_3^+$-WZNW model and we
show that the conformal blocks can be obtained from those with an
extremal-weight state by means of an intertwining operator. We adapt the
procedure for dealing with correlators with a single unit of spectral flow
charge and we get a factorized integral expression for the corresponding
four-point function. We finally transform the formulas back to the space-time
picture.
