The Ca II K filtergrams from Kodaikanal Solar Observatory have been used to
study the solar activity. The images are dominated by the chromospheric network
and plages. Programs have been developed to obtain the network and plage
indices from the daily images as functions of solar latitude and time.
Preliminary results from the analysis are reported here. The network and plage
indices were found to follow the sunspot cycle. A secondary peak is found
during the declining activity period in both the indices. A comparison of
network indices from the northern and the southern hemispheres shows that the
former is more active than latter. However such an asymmetry is not clearly
seen in the case of plage index.
