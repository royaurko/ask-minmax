We investigate numerically in spherical geometry the interaction of
stratification with precession. Both stable stratification and unstable
stratification are studied. In the parameter regime we are concerned with,
stable stratification suppresses the precessional instability, whereas unstable
stratification and precession can either stablise or destablise each other at
the different precession rates.
