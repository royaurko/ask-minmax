Lattice Boltzmann simulations are used to investigate spinodal decomposition
in a two-dimensional binary fluid with equilibrium lamellar and droplet phases.
We emphasise the importance of hydrodynamic flow to the phase separation
kinetics. For mixtures slightly asymmetric in composition the fluid phase
separates into bulk and lamellar phases with the lamellae forming distinctive
spiral structures to minimise their elastic energy.
