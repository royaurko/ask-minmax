A model of Boolean agents competing in a market is presented where each agent
bases his action on information obtained from a small group of other agents.
The agents play a competitive game that rewards those in the minority. After a
long time interval, the poorest player's strategy is changed randomly, and the
process is repeated. Eventually the network evolves to a stationary but
intermittent state where random mutation of the worst strategy can change the
behavior of the entire network, often causing a switch in the dynamics between
attractors of vastly different lengths.
