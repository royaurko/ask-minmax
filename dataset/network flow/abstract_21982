It is shown that the factorization relation on simple Lie groups with
standard Poisson Lie structure restricted to Coxeter symplectic leaves gives an
integrable dynamical system. This system can be regarded as a discretization of
the Toda flow. In case of $SL_n$ the integrals of the factorization dynamics
are integrals of the relativistic Toda system. A substantial part of the paper
is devoted to the study of symplectic leaves in simple complex Lie groups, its
Borel subgroups and their doubles.
