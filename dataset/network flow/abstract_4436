In a multihop wireless network, wireless interference is crucial to the
maximum multiflow (MMF) problem, which studies the maximum throughput between
multiple pairs of sources and sinks. In this paper, we observe that network
coding could help to decrease the impacts of wireless interference, and propose
a framework to study the MMF problem for multihop wireless networks with
network coding. Firstly, a network model is set up to describe the new conflict
relations modified by network coding. Then, we formulate a linear programming
problem to compute the maximum throughput and show its superiority over one in
networks without coding. Finally, the MMF problem in wireless network coding is
shown to be NP-hard and a polynomial approximation algorithm is proposed.
