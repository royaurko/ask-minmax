We once more specify an universality of a phase transition from smectic-A to
nematic phase in the crosslinked polymer network with a smectic liquid crystal,
basing on the X-ray and $^1H$-NMR spectroscopy experiments. Comparing the
superconducting 3D XY gauge theory and typical spin-glass models for such
systems, it is possible to clarify a type of a phase transition, which might be
the reason of percolation.
