The chemical and photometric evolution of star forming disk galaxies is
investigated. Numerical simulations of the complex gasdynamical flows are based
on our own coding of the Chemo - Dynamical Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamical (CD
- SPH) approach, which incorporates the effects of star formation. As a first
application, the model is used to describe the chemical and photometric
evolution of a disk galaxy like the Milky Way.
