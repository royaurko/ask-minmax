The advent of social media expands our ability to transmit information and
connect with others instantly, which enables us to behave as "social sensors."
Here, we studied concurrent bursty behavior of Twitter users during major
sporting events to determine their function as social sensors. We show that the
degree of concurrent bursts in tweets (posts) and retweets (re-posts) works as
a good indicator of winning or losing a game. More specifically, our tweet
analysis of Japanese professional baseball games in 2013 revealed that social
sensors can immediately show reactions to positive and negative events through
bursts of tweets, but that positive events are more likely to induce a
subsequent burst of retweets. These findings were also confirmed in an analysis
of the 2014 FIFA World Cup final. We further show active interactions among
social sensors by constructing retweet networks during a baseball game. The
resulting networks commonly exhibited user clusters depending on the baseball
team, with a scale-free connectedness that is indicative of a substantial
difference in user popularity as an information source. While previous studies
have mainly focused on either bursts of tweets or retweets as a simple
indicator of a real-world event, the temporal correlation between these two
imply unique aspects to social sensors, offering new insights into human
behavior in a highly connected world.
