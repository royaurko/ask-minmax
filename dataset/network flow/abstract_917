We investigate the problem of designing a minimum cost flow network
interconnecting n sources and a single sink, each with known locations in a
normed space and with associated flow demands. The network may contain any
finite number of additional unprescribed nodes from the space; these are known
as the Steiner points. For concave increasing cost functions, a minimum cost
network of this sort has a tree topology, and hence can be called a Minimum
Gilbert Arborescence (MGA). We characterise the local topological structure of
Steiner points in MGAs, showing, in particular, that for a wide range of
metrics, and for some typical real-world cost-functions, the degree of each
Steiner point is 3.
