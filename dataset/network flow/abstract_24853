This paper proposes a methodology for generating a stopword list from online
social network (OSN) corpora in Egyptian Dialect(ED). The aim of the paper is
to investigate the effect of removingED stopwords on the Sentiment Analysis
(SA) task. The stopwords lists generated before were on Modern Standard Arabic
(MSA) which is not the common language used in OSN. We have generated a
stopword list of Egyptian dialect to be used with the OSN corpora. We compare
the efficiency of text classification when using the generated list along with
previously generated lists of MSA and combining the Egyptian dialect list with
the MSA list. The text classification was performed using Na\"ive Bayes and
Decision Tree classifiers and two feature selection approaches, unigram and
bigram. The experiments show that removing ED stopwords give better performance
than using lists of MSA stopwords only.
