Community detection in networks has drawn much attention in diverse fields,
especially social sciences. Given its significance, there has been a large body
of literature with approaches from many fields. Here we present a statistical
framework that is representative, extensible, and that yields an estimator with
good properties. Our proposed approach considers a stochastic blockmodel based
on a logistic regression formulation with node correction terms. We follow a
Bayesian approach that explicitly captures the community behavior via prior
specification. We further adopt a data augmentation strategy with latent
Polya-Gamma variables to obtain posterior samples. We conduct inference based
on a principled, canonically mapped centroid estimator that formally addresses
label non-identifiability and captures representative community assignments. We
demonstrate the proposed model and estimation on real-world as well as
simulated benchmark networks and show that the proposed model and estimator are
more flexible, representative, and yield smaller error rates when compared to
the MAP estimator from classical degree-corrected stochastic blockmodels.
