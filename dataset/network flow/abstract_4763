We study the transverse flow throughout the mass asymmetry range as a
function of the impact parameter, keeping the total mass of the system fixed.We
find that the geometry of vanishing flow (GVF) i.e. the impact parameter at
which flow vanishes and its mass dependence is quite sensitive to the mass
asymmetry of the reaction. With increase in the mass asymmetry, the value of
GVF decreases, while its mass dependence increases. Our results indicate the
sizable role of mass asymmetry on GVF as on balance energy.
