We show stability of spherical caps (SCs) lying on a flat surface, where the
motion is governed by the volume-preserving Mean Curvature Flow (MCF).
Moreover, we introduce a dynamic boundary condition that models a line tension
effect on the boundary. The proof is based on the generalized principle of
linearized stability
