Recently, the abundance of digital data enabled the implementation of graph
based ranking algorithms that provide system level analysis for ranking
publications and contributors. Here we take advantage of the entire Physical Review
publication archive (1893-2006) to construct contributors' networks where weighted
edges, as measured from opportunely normalized citation counts, define a proxy
for the mechanism of scientific credit transfer. On this network we define a
ranking method based on a diffusion algorithm that mimics the spreading of
scientific credits on the network. We compare the results obtained with our
algorithm with those obtained by local measures such as the citation count and
provide a statistical analysis of the assignment of major career awards in the
area of Physics. A web site where the algorithm is made available to perform
customized rank analysis can be found at the address
