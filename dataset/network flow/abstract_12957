The rheological properties for dilute and moderately dense granular binary
mixtures of smooth, inelastic hard disks/spheres under uniform shear flow in
steady state conditions are reported. The results are based on the Enskog
kinetic theory, numerically solved by a dense gas extension of the Direct
Simulation Monte Carlo method for dilute gases. These results are confronted to
the ones also obtained by performing molecular dynamics simulations with very
good agreement for the lower densities and higher coefficients of restitution.
It appears that the range of densities for which the Enskog equation applies
decreases with increasing dissipation.
