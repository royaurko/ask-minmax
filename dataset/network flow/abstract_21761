We study solutions of type IIB supergravity with an SU(3) structure group and
four dimensional Poincare invariance and present relations among the bosonic
fields which follow from the supersymmetry variations. We make explicit some
results which also follow from the more general case of an SU(2) structure and
give some short comments applicable to general supersymmetric solutions. We
also provide simplified relations appropriate for duals of gauge theory
renormalization group flows, and use these to derive the supergravity solution
for a bound state of (p,q)5-branes and D3-branes.
