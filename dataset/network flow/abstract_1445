We consider supervised learning problems where the features are embedded in a
graph, such as gene expressions in a gene network. In this context, it is of
much interest to automatically select a subgraph with few connected components;
by exploiting prior knowledge, one can indeed improve the prediction
performance or obtain results that are easier to interpret. Regularization or
penalty functions for selecting features in graphs have recently been proposed,
but they raise new algorithmic challenges. For example, they typically require
solving a combinatorially hard selection problem among all connected subgraphs.
In this paper, we propose computationally feasible strategies to select a
sparse and well-connected subset of features sitting on a directed acyclic
graph (DAG). We introduce structured sparsity penalties over paths on a DAG
called "path coding" penalties. Unlike existing regularization functions that
model long-range interactions between features in a graph, path coding
penalties are tractable. The penalties and their proximal operators involve
path selection problems, which we efficiently solve by leveraging network flow
optimization. We experimentally show on synthetic, image, and genomic data that
our approach is scalable and leads to more connected subgraphs than other
regularization functions for graphs.
