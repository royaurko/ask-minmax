We have developed a Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automata model for
describing of vehicular traffic flow at a single intersection. A set of traffic
lights operating either in fixed-time or traffic adaptive scheme controls the
traffic flow. Closed boundary condition is applied to the streets each of which
conduct a uni-directional flow. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are carried
out to find the model characteristics. In particular, we investigate the
dependence of the flows on the signalisation parameters.
