A new complex network model is proposed which is founded on growth with new
connections being established proportionally to the current dynamical activity
of each node, which can be understood as a generalization of the
Barabasi-Albert static model. By using several topological measurements, as
well as optimal multivariate methods (canonical analysis and maximum likelihood
decision), we show that this new model provides, among several other
theoretical types of networks including Watts-Strogatz small-world networks,
the greatest compatibility with three real-world cortical networks.
