We give the modification of formulas for $p_{\perp}$-broadening and energy
loss which are necessary to calculate parton interactions in a medium with
flow. Arguments are presented leading to the conclusion that for large
$p_{\perp}$-spectra observed in heavy ion collisions at RHIC, the influence of
transverse flow on the determination of the "quenching power" of the produced
medium is small. This leaves open the question of the interpretation of data in
a consistent perturbative framework.
