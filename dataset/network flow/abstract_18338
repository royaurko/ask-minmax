User online behavior and interests will play a central role in future mobile
networks. We introduce a systematic method for large-scale multi-dimensional
analysis of online activity for thousands of mobile users across 79 buildings
over a variety of web domains. We propose a modeling approach based on
self-organizing maps (SOM) for discovering, organizing and visualizing
different mobile users' trends from billions of WLAN records. We find
surprisingly that users' trends based on domains and locations can be
accurately modeled using a self-organizing map with clearly distinct
characteristics. We also find many non-trivial correlations between different
types of web domains and locations. Based on our analysis, we introduce a
mixture model as an initial step towards realistic simulation of wireless
network usage.
