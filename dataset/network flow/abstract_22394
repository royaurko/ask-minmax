A lagrangian approach to Burgers turbulence is carried out along the lines of
the field theoretical Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism of stochastic hydrodynamics.
We derive, from an analysis based on the hypothesis of unbroken galilean
invariance, the asymptotic form of the probability distribution function of
negative velocity-differences. The origin of Burgers intermittency is found to
rely on the dynamical coupling between shocks, identified to instantons, and
non-coherent background fluctuations, which, then, cannot be discarded in a
consistent statistical description of the flow.
