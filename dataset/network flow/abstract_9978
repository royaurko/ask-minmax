We discuss the sensitivity of the three-particle azimuthal cumulant method
for a search and study of conical emission in central relativistic $A+A $
collisions. Our study is based on a multi-component Monte Carlo model which
include flow background, Gaussian mono-jets, jet-flow, and Gaussian conical
signals. We find the observation of conical emission is hindered by the
presence of flow harmonics of fourth order ($v_4 $) but remains feasible even
in the presence of a substantial background. We consider the use of probability
cumulants for the suppression of 2$^{nd}$ order flow harmonics. We find that
while probability cumulant significantly reduce $v_2^2$ contributions, they
also complicate the cumulant of jets, and conical emission. The use of
probability cumulants is therefore not particularly advantageous in searches
for conical emission. We find the sensitivity of the (density) cumulant method
depends inextricably on strengths of
  $v_2 $, $v_4 $, background and non-Poisson character of particle production.
It thus cannot be expressed in a simple form, and without specific assumptions
about the values of these parameters.
