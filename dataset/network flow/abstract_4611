Knowledge of fundamental traffic flow characteristics of traffic simulation
models is an essential requirement when using these models for the planning,
design, and operation of transportation systems. In this paper we discuss the
following: a description of how features relevant to traffic flow are currently
under implementation in the TRANSIMS microsimulation, a proposition for
standardized traffic flow tests for traffic simulation models, and the results
of these tests for two different versions of the TRANSIMS microsimulation.
