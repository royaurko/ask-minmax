A new class of 3D anisotropic analytic solutions of relativistic
hydrodynamics with constant pressure is found. We analyse, in particular,
solutions corresponding to ellipsoidally symmetric expansion of finite systems
into vacuum. They can be utilized for relativistic description of the system
evolution in thermodynamic region near the softest point and at the final stage
of the hydrodynamic expansion in A+A collisions. The solutions can be used also
for testing of numerical hydrodynamic codes solving relativistic hydrodynamic
equations for anisotropic expansion of finite systems
