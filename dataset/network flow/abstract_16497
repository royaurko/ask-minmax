We summarize three recent efforts to constrain the first few moments of
cosmic creation before and during the epoch of inflation. We consider two means
to explain a slight dip in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave
background for multipoles in the range of $\ell= 10-30$ from both the {\it
Planck} and {\it WMAP} data. We show that such a dip could be the result of
resonant creation of a massive particle that couples to the inflaton field. For
best-fit models, the epoch of resonant particle creation reenters the horizon
at wave numbers of $k_* \sim 0.00011 \pm 0.0004 $ ($h$ Mpc$^{-1}$). The
amplitude and location of these features correspond to the creation of a number
of degenerate fermion species of mass $\sim 15/\lambda^{3/2} $ $m_{pl}$ during
inflation where $\lambda$ is the coupling constant between the inflaton field
and the created fermion species. Alternatively, one can explain the existence
of such a dip as due to a jump in the inflation generating potential. We show
that such a jump can also resolve the excessively large dark flow predicted
from the M-theory landscape. Finally, we summarize our efforts to quantify
constraints on the cosmic dark flow from a new analysis of the Type Ia
supernova distance-redshift relation.
