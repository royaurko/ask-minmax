We consider a solvable model of the decay of scalar variance in a
single-scale random velocity field. We show that if there is a separation
between the flow scale k_flow^{-1} and the box size k_box^{-1}, the decay rate
lambda ~ (k_box/k_flow)^2 is determined by the turbulent diffusion of the
box-scale mode. Exponential decay at the rate lambda is preceded by a transient
powerlike decay (the total scalar variance ~ t^{-5/2} if the Corrsin invariant
is zero, t^{-3/2} otherwise) that lasts a time t~1/\lambda. Spectra are sharply
peaked at k=k_box. The box-scale peak acts as a slowly decaying source to a
secondary peak at the flow scale. The variance spectrum at scales intermediate
between the two peaks (k_box<<k<<k_flow) is ~ k + a k^2 + ... (a>0). The mixing
of the flow-scale modes by the random flow produces, for the case of large
Peclet number, a k^{-1+delta} spectrum at k>>k_flow, where delta ~ lambda is a
small correction. Our solution thus elucidates the spectral make up of the
``strange mode,'' combining small-scale structure and a decay law set by the
largest scales.
