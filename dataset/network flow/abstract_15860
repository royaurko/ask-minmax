Transmission capacity (TC) is a performance metric for wireless networks that
measures the spatial intensity of successful transmissions per unit area,
subject to a constraint on the permissible outage probability (where outage
occurs when the SINR at a receiver is below a threshold). This volume gives a
unified treatment of the TC framework that has been developed by the contributors
and their collaborators over the past decade. The mathematical framework
underlying the analysis (reviewed in Ch. 2) is stochastic geometry: Poisson
point processes model the locations of interferers, and (stable) shot noise
processes represent the aggregate interference seen at a receiver. Ch. 3
presents TC results (exact, asymptotic, and bounds) on a simple model in order
to illustrate a key strength of the framework: analytical tractability yields
explicit performance dependence upon key model parameters. Ch. 4 presents
enhancements to this basic model --- channel fading, variable link distances,
and multi-hop. Ch. 5 presents four network design case studies well-suited to
TC: i) spectrum management, ii) interference cancellation, iii) signal
threshold transmission scheduling, and iv) power control. Ch. 6 studies the TC
when nodes have multiple antennas, which provides a contrast vs. classical
results that ignore interference.
