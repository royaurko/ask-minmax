A co-contributorship network of scientists at a university is an archetypical
example of a complex evolving network. Collaborative R&D networks are
self-organized products of partner choice between scientists. Modern science
is, due to the immanent imperative of newness, strongly interdisciplinary.
Crossovers between the different scientific disciplines and organizational
units are observable on a daily basis. Since collaborative research has become
the dominant and most promising way to produce high-quality output,
collaboration structures are also a target for research and management design.
  We study co-contributorship covered by the Citation Index within University
College Dublin, a large Irish university. We focus especially on collaborations
between organizational units, such as schools or colleges. We compare the
centrality of the brokerage individuals within their organizational units. The
network of co-contributorship is analyzed with standard network measures, with
typical features for complex networks observed. We use the bipartite network of
contributors and papers for the identification of communities of collaborators and
clusters of papers. The observed communities are compared to the formal
organizational units of the university.
