Given a general pseudo-Anosov flow in a three manifold, the orbit space of
the lifted flow to the universal cover is homeomorphic to an open disk. We
compactify this orbit space with an ideal circle boundary. If there are no
perfect fits between stable and unstable leaves and the flow is not
topologically conjugate to a suspension Anosov flow, we then show: The ideal
circle of the orbit space has a natural quotient space which is a sphere and is
a dynamical systems ideal boundary for a compactification of the universal
cover of the manifold. The main result is that the fundamental group acts on
the flow ideal boundary as a uniform convergence group. Using a theorem of
Bowditch, this yields a proof that the fundamental group of the manifold is
Gromov hyperbolic and it shows that the action of the fundamental group on the
flow ideal boundary is conjugate to the action on the Gromov ideal boundary.
This implies that pseudo-Anosov flows without perfect fits are quasigeodesic
flows and we show that the stable/unstable foliations of these flows are
quasi-isometric. Finally we apply these results to foliations: if a foliation
is R-covered or with one sided branching in an atoroidal three manifold then
the results above imply that the leaves of the foliation in the universal cover
extend continuously to the sphere at infinity.
