The deployment of urban infrastructure is very important for urban sensor
applications. In this paper, we studied and introduced the deployment strategy
of wireless on-street parking sensor networks. We defined a multiple-objective
problem with four objectives, and solved them with real street parking map. The
results show two sets of Pareto Front with the minimum energy consumption,
sensing information delay and the amount of deployed routers and gateways. The
result can be considered to provide urban service roadside unit or be taken
into account while designing a deployment algorithm.
