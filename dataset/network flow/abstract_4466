We study the structural characteristics of complex networks using the
representative eigenvectors of the adjacent matrix. The probability
distribution function of the components of the representative eigenvectors are
proposed to describe the localization on networks where the Euclidean distance
is invalid. Several quantities are used to describe the localization properties
of the representative states, such as the participation ratio, the structural
entropy, and the probability distribution function of the nearest neighbor
level spacings for spectra of complex networks. Whole-cell networks in the real
world and the Watts-Strogatz small-world and Barabasi-Albert scale-free
networks are considered. The networks have nontrivial localization properties
due to the nontrivial topological structures. It is found that the
ascending-order-ranked series of the occurrence probabilities at the nodes
behave generally multifractally. This characteristic can be used as a
structural measure of complex networks.
