A minimal model for coherent transport through a donor/acceptor molecular
junction is presented. The two donor and acceptor sites are described by single
levels energetically separated by an intramolecular tunnel barrier. In the
limit of strong coupling to the electrodes a current rectification for
different bias voltage polarities occurs. Contacts with recent experiments of
molecular rectification are also given.
