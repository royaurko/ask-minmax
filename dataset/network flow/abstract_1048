we demonstrate a technology "Release and bond-back of layers (REBOLA)" that
exploits the deterministic wrinkling of a semiconductor layer to create
well-defined and versatile nanochannel networks. In linear networks, the
periodicity of branch channels as a function of etch-width was analyzed and
compared with theoretical calculations. A self-similar folding phenomenon of
wrinkles near a fixed boundary was revealed by autocorrelation analysis. The
formation of branch channels within circular networks was studied on different
length scales and was controlled by the size of the etched circular network and
the shape of the initial pattern. To elucidate the usefulness of REBOLA, we
exemplified nanofluidic transport as well as femto-litre filling and emptying
of individual wrinkles on a standard semiconductor substrate, in which corner
flow played an important role.
