We show that when a single vortex convected by a flowing background collides
with an oblique dark soliton in defocusing Kerr-type medium, it passes through
the oblique soliton, but this process is accompanied by a considerable vertical
shift of the vortex that grows with decrease of the inclination angle of the
dark soliton with respect to the direction of the flow and decreases with
increase of the flow (or collision) velocity. In the parameter range where the
interaction with a vortex does not lead to drastic deformations of the shape of
the oblique dark soliton, this shift can be estimated analytically under the
assumption that vortex soliton moves along the "stream lines" that exhibit
vertical shift in the vicinity of oblique dark soliton. Similar effect was
observed upon collision of dark solitons with moving vortex dipoles or rotating
pairs of vortices with equal topological charges.
