Surface transport of inertial particles is investigated by means of the
perturbative approach, introduced by Maxey (J. Fluid Mech. 174, 441 (1987)),
which is valid in the case the deflections induced on the particle trajectories
by the fluid flow can be considered small. We consider a class of compressible
random velocity fields, in which the effect of recirculations is modelled by an
oscillatory component in the Eulerian time correlation profile. The main issue
we address here is whether fluid velocity fluctuations, in particular the
effect of recirculation, may produce nontrivial corrections to the streaming
particle velocity. Our result is that a small (large) degree of recirculation
is associated with a decrease (increase) of streaming with respect to a
quiescent fluid. The presence of this effect is confirmed numerically, away
from the perturbative limit. Our approach also allows us to calculate the
explicit expression for the eddy diffusivity, and to compare the efficiency of
diffusive and ballistic transport.
