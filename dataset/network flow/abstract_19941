A new method based on Shannon-Happ formula to calculate transfer function
from Signal Flow Graph (SFG) is presented. The algorithm provides an explicit
approach to get the transfer function in a format with both numerical and
symbolic expressions. The adoption of the symbolic variable in SFG, which could
represent the nonlinear item or the independent sub-system, is achieved by
variable separation approach. An investigation is given for the solutions of
several special conditions of SFG. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm,
a new technique combined with Johnson method for generating the combinations of
the non-touching loops is developed. It uses the previous combinations in lower
order to get the ones in higher order. There is an introduction about the
visualization of SFG and the subroutines for system performance analysis in the
software, AVANT.
