This letter studies synchronization conditions for distributed dynamic
networks with different types of leaders. The role of a leader specifying a
desired global state trajectory through local interactions (the power leader)
has long been recognized and modeled. This paper introduces the complementary
notion of a knowledge leader holding information on the target dynamics, which
is propagated to the entire network through local adaptation mechanisms.
Knowledge-based leader-followers networks have many analogs in biology, e.g.,
in evolutionary processes and disease propagation. Different types of leaders
can co-exist in the same network.
