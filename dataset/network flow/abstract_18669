Reduced energy consumption in sensor nodes is one of the major challenges in
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) deployment. In this regard, Error Control
Coding (ECC) is one of techniques used for energy optimization in WSNs.
Similarly, critical distance is another term being used for energy efficiency,
when used with ECC provides better results of energy saving. In this paper
three different critical distance values are used against different coding
gains for sake of energy saving. If distance lies below critical distance
values then particular encoders are selected with respect to their particular
coding gains. Coding gains are used for critical distances estimation of all
encoders. This adaptive encoder and transmit power selection scheme with
respect to their coding gain results in a significant energy saving in WSNs
environment. Simulations provide better results of energy saving achieved by
using this adaptive scheme.
