We present simulation results for long ($N\leq 4000$) self-avoiding walks in
four dimensions. We find definite indications of logarithmic corrections, but
the data are poorly described by the asymptotically leading terms. Detailed
comparisons are presented with renormalization group flow equations derived in
direct renormalization and with results of a field theoretic calculation.
