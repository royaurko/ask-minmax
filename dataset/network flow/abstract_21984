We investigate numerically the dynamically generated plastic deformations of
a 3D vortex lattice (VL) driven through a disorder potential with isolated,
strong pinning centers (point-like or extended along the field direction). We
find that the VL exhibits a very peculiar dynamical behavior in the plastic
flow regime, in particular, topological excitations consisting of three or four
entangled vortices are formed. We determine the critical current density $j_c$
and the activation energy for depinning $U_c$ in the presence of a finite
density of strong pinning centers.
