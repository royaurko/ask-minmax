TBecause of limited energy of nodes, an important issue for sensor network is
efficient use of the energy. The clustering technique reduces energy
consumption as cluster head sends sensed information to a sink node. Because of
such character of clustering technique, electing cluster head is an important
element for networks. This paper proposes RCFT (ReClustering Formation
Technique) that reconstruct clusters in hierarchical sensor networks. RCFT is a
protocol that reconstructed clusters considering position of a cluster head and
nodes in randomly constructed clusters. And this paper demonstrated that
clusters are composed evenly through simulation, accordingly this simulation
shows the result reducing energy consumption.
