A type of super-hydrophobic surface consists of a solid plane boundary with
an array of grooves which, due to the effect of surface tension, prevent a
complete wetting of the wall. The effect is greatest when the grooves are
aligned with the flow. The pressure difference between the liquid and the gas
in the grooves causes a curvature of the liquid surface resisted by surface
tension. The effects of this surface deformation are studied in this paper. The
corrections to the effective slip length produced by the curvature are analyzed
theoretically and a comparison with available data and related mathematical
models is presented.
