We model a system of networking agents that seek to optimize their centrality
in the network while keeping their cost, the number of connections they are
participating in, low. Unlike other game-theory based models for network
evolution, the success of the agents is related only to their position in the
network. The agents use strategies based on local information to improve their
chance of success. Both the evolution of strategies and network structure are
investigated. We find a dramatic time evolution with cascades of strategy
change accompanied by a change in network structure. On average the network
self-organizes to a state close to the transition between a fragmented state
and a state with a giant component. Furthermore, with increasing system size
both the average degree and the level of fragmentation decreases. We also
observe that the network keeps on actively evolving, although it does not have
to, thus suggesting a Red Queen-like situation where agents have to keep on
networking and responding to the moves of the others in order to stay
successful.
