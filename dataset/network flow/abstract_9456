We propose a new model for peer-to-peer networking which takes the network
bottlenecks into account beyond the access. This model can cope with key
features of P2P networking like degree or locality constraints together with
the fact that distant peers often have a smaller rate than nearby peers. Using
a network model based on rate functions, we give a closed form expression of
peers download performance in the system's fluid limit, as well as
approximations for the other cases. Our results show the existence of realistic
settings for which the average download time is a decreasing function of the
load, a phenomenon that we call super-scalability.
