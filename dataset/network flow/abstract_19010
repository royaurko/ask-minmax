This article proposes a design and implementation of a low cost two-tier
architecture model for high availability cluster combined with load-balancing
and shared storage technology to achieve desired scale of three-tier
architecture for application load balancing e.g. web servers. The research work
proposes a design that physically omits Network File System (NFS) server nodes
and implements NFS server functionalities within the cluster nodes, through Red
Hat Cluster Suite (RHCS) with High Availability (HA) proxy load balancing
technologies. In order to achieve a low-cost implementation in terms of
investment in hardware and computing solutions, the proposed architecture will
be beneficial. This system intends to provide steady service despite any system
components fails due to uncertainly such as network system, storage and
applications.
