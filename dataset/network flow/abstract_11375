We propose a new method for quantitative characterization of spatial
network-like patterns with loops, such as surface fracture patterns, leaf vein
networks and patterns of urban streets. Such patterns are not well
characterized by purely topological estimators: also patterns that both look
different and result from different morphogenetic processes can have similar
topology. A local geometric cue -the angles formed by the different branches at
junctions- can complement topological information and allow to quantify the
large scale spatial coherence of the pattern. For patterns that grow over time,
such as fracture lines on the surface of ceramics, the rank assigned by our
method to each individual segment of the pattern approximates the order of
appearance of that segment. We apply the method to various network-like
patterns and we find a continuous but sharp dichotomy between two classes of
spatial networks: hierarchical and homogeneous. The first class results from a
sequential growth process and presents large scale organization, the latter
presents local, but not global organization.
