Using properties of isospectral flows we introduce a class of equations
useful to represent signed complex networks free continuous time evolution
Jammed and balanced states are obtained introducing a class of link potentials
breaking isospectral invariance of the network. Applications to conflict
dynamics in social and international relations networks are discussed.
