Accurate localization for mobile nodes has been an important and fundamental
problem in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). The detection
information returned from a mobile node is meaningful only if its location is
known. In this paper, we propose two localization algorithms based on color
filtering technology called PCFL and ACFL. PCFL and ACFL aim at collaboratively
accomplishing accurate localization of underwater mobile nodes with minimum
energy expenditure. They both adopt the overlapping signal region of task
anchors which can communicate with the mobile node directly as the current
sampling area. PCFL employs the projected distances between each of the task
projections and the mobile node, while ACFL adopts the direct distance between
each of the task anchors and the mobile node. Also the proportion factor of
distance is proposed to weight the RGB values. By comparing the nearness
degrees of the RGB sequences between the samples and the mobile node, samples
can be filtered out. And the normalized nearness degrees are considered as the
weighted standards to calculate coordinates of the mobile nodes. The simulation
results show that the proposed methods have excellent localization performance
and can timely localize the mobile node. The average localization error of PCFL
can decline by about 30.4% than the AFLA method.
