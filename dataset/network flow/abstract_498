In this paper, we investigate some properties on capacity factors, which were
proposed to investigate the link failure problem from network coding. A
capacity factor (CF) of a network is an edge set, deleting which will cause the
maximum flow to decrease while deleting any proper subset will not. Generally,
a $k$-CF is a minimal (not minimum) edge set which will cause the network
maximum flow decrease by $k$.
  Under point to point acyclic scenario, we characterize all the edges which
are contained in some CF, and propose an efficient algorithm to classify. And
we show that all edges on some $s$-$t$ path in an acyclic point-to-point
acyclic network are contained in some 2-CF. We also study some other properties
of CF of point to point network, and a simple relationship with CF in multicast
network.
  On the other hand, some computational hardness results relating to capacity
factors are obtained. We prove that deciding whether there is a capacity factor
of a cyclic network with size not less a given number is NP-complete, and the
time complexity of calculating the capacity rank is lowered bounded by solving
the maximal flow. Besides that, we propose the analogous definition of CF on
vertices and show it captures edge capacity factors as a special case.
