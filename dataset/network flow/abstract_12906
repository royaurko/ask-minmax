We show that a magnetic dipole in a shear flow under the action of an
oscillating magnetic field displays stochastic resonance in the linear response
regime. To this end, we compute the classical quantifiers of stochastic
resonance, i.e. the signal to noise ratio, the escape time distribution, and
the mean first passage time. We also discuss limitations and role of the linear
response theory in its applications to the theory of stochastic resonance.
