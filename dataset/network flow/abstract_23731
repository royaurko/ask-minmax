Any secured system can be modeled as a capability-based access control system
in which each user is given a set of secret keys of the resources he is granted
access to. In some large systems with resource-constrained devices, such as
sensor networks and RFID systems, the design is sensitive to memory or key
storage cost. With a goal to minimize the maximum users' key storage, key
compression based on key linking, that is, deriving one key from another
without compromising security, is studied. A lower bound on key storage needed
for a general access structure with key derivation is derived. This bound
demonstrates the theoretic limit of any systems which do not trade off security
and can be treated as a negative result to provide ground for designs with
security tradeoff. A concrete, provably secure key linking scheme based on
pseudorandom functions is given. Using the key linking framework, a number of
key pre-distribution schemes in the literature are analyzed.
