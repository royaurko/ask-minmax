We propose a method for human pose estimation based on Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs). The pose estimation is formulated as a DNN-based regression problem
towards body joints. We present a cascade of such DNN regressors which results
in high precision pose estimates. The approach has the advantage of reasoning
about pose in a holistic fashion and has a simple but yet powerful formulation
which capitalizes on recent advances in Deep Learning. We present a detailed
empirical analysis with state-of-art or better performance on four academic
benchmarks of diverse real-world images.
