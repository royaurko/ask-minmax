We investigate the vorticity dynamics in a turbulent vortex using scattering
of acoustic waves. Two ultrasonic beams are adjusted to probe simultaneously
two spatial scales in a given volume of the flow, thus allowing a dual channel
recording of the dynamics of coherent vorticity structures. Our results show
that this allows to measure the average energy transfer time between different
spatial length scales, and that such transfer goes faster at smaller scales.
