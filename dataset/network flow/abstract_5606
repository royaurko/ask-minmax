Function computation of arbitrarily correlated discrete sources over Gaussian
networks with orthogonal components is studied. Two classes of functions are
considered: the arithmetic sum function and the type function. The arithmetic
sum function in this paper is defined as a set of multiple weighted arithmetic
sums, which includes averaging of the sources and estimating each of the
sources as special cases. The type or frequency histogram function counts the
number of occurrences of each argument, which yields many important statistics
such as mean, variance, maximum, minimum, median, and so on. The proposed
computation coding first abstracts Gaussian networks into the corresponding
modulo sum multiple-access channels via nested lattice codes and linear network
coding and then computes the desired function by using linear Slepian-Wolf
source coding. For orthogonal Gaussian networks (with no broadcast and
multiple-access components), the computation capacity is characterized for a
class of networks. For Gaussian networks with multiple-access components (but
no broadcast), an approximate computation capacity is characterized for a class
of networks.
