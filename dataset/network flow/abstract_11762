Limitation of resources has been recently introduced as a mechanism for the
survival and coexistance of cooperators with defectors in well-mixed
populations. Here we examine the same model on a scale-free network. A
prisoner's dilemma game on a scale-free network has shown coexistance of
cooperators and defectors for the entire range of parameters. Our results show
thatby introducing the network to the limited resources model, the cooperator
dominared region in the parameter space expands comparing to the results of
well-mixed population and the coexistenceregion becomes narrower. The effect of
scale-free network is therefore interpreted as improving the cooperation in the
population and reducing the coexistence.
