In the note an error in Low and Lapsley's article ("Optimization Flow
Control, I: Basic Algorithm and Convergence", IEEE/ACM Transactions on
Networking, 7(6), pp. 861-874, 1999) is pointed out. Because of this error the
proof of the Theorem 2 presented in the article is incomplete and some
assessments are wrong. In the second part of the note the contributor proposes a
correction to this proof.
