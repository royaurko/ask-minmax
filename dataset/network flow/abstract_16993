This paper examines the use of Bayesian Networks to tackle one of the tougher
problems in requirements engineering, translating user requirements into system
requirements. The approach taken is to model domain knowledge as Bayesian
Network fragments that are glued together to form a complete view of the domain
specific system requirements. User requirements are introduced as evidence and
the propagation of belief is used to determine what are the appropriate system
requirements as indicated by user requirements. This concept has been
demonstrated in the development of a system specification and the results are
presented here.
