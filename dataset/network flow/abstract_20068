Unitary transformations are an essential tool for the theoretical
understanding of many systems by mapping them to simpler effective models. A
systematically controlled variant to perform such a mapping is a perturbative
continuous unitary transformation (pCUT) among others. So far, this approach
required an equidistant unperturbed spectrum. Here, we pursue two goals: First,
we extend its applicability to non-equidistant spectra with the particular
focus on an efficient derivation of the differential flow equations, which
define the enhanced perturbative continuous unitary transformation (epCUT).
Second, we show that the numerical integration of the flow equations yields a
robust scheme to extract data from the epCUT. The method is illustrated by the
perturbation of the harmonic oscillator with a quartic term and of the two-leg
spin ladders in the strong-rung-coupling limit for uniform and alternating rung
couplings. The latter case provides an example of perturbation around a
non-equidistant spectrum.
