We use three-dimensional simulations to study the statistics of supersonic
turbulence in molecular clouds. Our numerical experiments describe driven
turbulent flows with an isothermal equation of state, Mach numbers around 10,
and various degrees of magnetization. We first support the so-called 1/3-rule
of Kritsuk et al. 2007 with our new data from a larger 2048^3 simulation. We
then attempt to extend the 1/3-rule to supersonic MHD turbulence and get
encouraging preliminary results based on a set of 512^3 simulations. Our
results suggest an interesting new approach to tackle universal scaling
relations and intermittency in supersonic MHD turbulence.
