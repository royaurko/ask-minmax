The Japanese shareholding network existing at the end of March 2002 is
studied empirically. The network is constructed from 2,303 listed companies and
53 non-listed financial institutions. We consider this network as a directed
graph by drawing edges from shareholders to stock corporations. The lengths of
the shareholder lists vary with the companies, and the most comprehensive lists
contain the top 30 shareholders. Consequently, the distribution of incoming
edges has an upper bound, while that of outgoing edges has no bound. The
distribution of outgoing degrees is well explained by the power law function
with an exponential tail. The exponent in the power law range is gamma=1.7. To
understand these features from the viewpoint of a company's growth, we consider
the correlations between the outgoing degree and the company's age, profit, and
total assets.
