We have analyzed available full-disc data from the Michelson Doppler Imager
(MDI) on board SoHO using the "ring diagram" technique to determine the
behavior of solar meridional flows over solar cycle 23 in the outer 2% of the
solar radius. We find that the dominant component of meridional flows during
solar maximum was much lower than that during the minima at the beginning of
cycles 23 and 24. There were differences in the flow velocities even between
the two minima. The meridional flows show a migrating pattern with
higher-velocity flows migrating towards the equator as activity increases.
Additionally, we find that the migrating pattern of the meridional flow matches
those of sunspot butterfly diagram and the zonal flows in the shallow layers. A
high latitude band in meridional flow appears around 2004, well before the
current activity minimum. A Legendre polynomial decomposition of the meridional
flows shows that the latitudinal pattern of the flow was also different during
the maximum as compared to that during the two minima. The different components
of the flow have different time-dependences, and the dependence is different at
different depths.
