We present a simple model to account for the rheological behavior observed in
recent experiments on micellar gels. The model combines attachment-detachment
kinetics with stretching due to shear, and shows well-defined jammed and
flowing states. The large deviation function (LDF) for the coarse-grained
velocity becomes increasingly non-quadratic as the applied force $F$ is
increased, in a range near the yield threshold. The power fluctuations are
found to obey a steady-state fluctuation relation (FR) at small $F$. However,
the FR is violated when $F$ is near the transition from the flowing to the
jammed state although the LDF still exists; the antisymmetric part of the LDF
is found to be nonlinear in its argument. Our approach suggests that large
fluctuations and motion in a direction opposite to an imposed force are likely
to occur in a wider class of systems near yielding.
