Diabetes mellitus type II affects around 8 percent of the total adult
population in the world. It is the fifth leading cause of death in high income
countries and an epidemic in developing countries. We analyze protein-protein
interaction data of the pancreatic cells for normal and disease states. The
analysis exhibits overall structural similarities in the normal and disease
networks. The important differences are revealed through specific interaction
patterns and eigenvector analyses. The top contributing nodes from localized
eigenvectors as well as those being part of specific interaction patterns turn
out to be significant for the occurrence of the disease. The analysis provides
a direction for further development of novel drugs and therapies in curing the
disease by targeting specific patterns instead of a single node.
