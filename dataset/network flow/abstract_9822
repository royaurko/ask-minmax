We show that the velocity correlations in uniform dense granular flows inside
a silo are similar to the hydrodynamic response of an elastic hard-sphere
liquid. The measurements are made using a fluorescent refractive index matched
interstitial fluid in a regime where the flow is dominated by grains in
enduring contact and fluctuations scale with the distance traveled, independent
of flow rate. The velocity autocorrelation function of the grains in the bulk
shows a negative correlation at short time and slow oscillatory decay to zero
similar to simple liquids. Weak spatial velocity correlations are observed over
several grain diameters. The mean square displacements show an inflection point
indicative of caging dynamics. The observed correlations are qualitatively
different at the boundaries.
