We report experimental results on the dynamics of heavy particles of the size
of the Kolmogorov-scale in a fully developed turbulent flow. The mixed Eulerian
structure function of two-particle velocity and acceleration difference vectors
<\delta v\cdot\delta a_p> was observed to increase significantly with particle
inertia for identical flow conditions. We show that this increase is related to
a preferential alignment between these dynamical quantities. With increasing
particle density the probability for those two vectors to be collinear was
observed to grow. We show that these results are consistent with the
preferential sampling of strain-dominated regions by inertial particles.
