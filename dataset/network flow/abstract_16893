In the magnetic Eden model (MEM), particles have a spin and grow in contact
with a thermal bath. Although Ising-like interactions affect the growth
dynamics, deposited spins are frozen and not allowed to flip. This review
article focuses on recent developments and future prospects, such as
spontaneous switching phenomena, critical behavior associated with fractal,
wetting, and order-disorder phase transitions, the equilibrium/nonequilibrium
correspondence conjecture, as well as dynamical and critical features of the
MEM defined on complex network substrates.
