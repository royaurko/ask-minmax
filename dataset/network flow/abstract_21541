A study by computer simulation is reported of the behaviour of a quantized
vortex line at a very low temperature when there is continuous excitation of
low-frequency Kelvin waves. There is no dissipation except by phonon radiation
at a very high frequency. It is shown that non-linear coupling leads to a net
flow of energy to higher wavenumbers and to the development of a simple
spectrum of Kelvin waves that is insensitive to the strength and frequency of
the exciting drive. The results are likely to be relevant to the decay of
turbulence in superfluid $^4$He at very low temperatures.
