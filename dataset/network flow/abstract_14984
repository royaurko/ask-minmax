Many properties of disordered materials can be understood by looking at
idealized structural models, in which the strain is as small as is possible in
the absence of long-range order. For covalent amorphous semiconductors and
glasses, such an idealized structural model, the continuous-random network, was
introduced 70 years ago by Zachariasen. In this model, each atom is placed in a
crystal-like local environment, with perfect coordination and chemical
ordering, yet longer-range order is nonexistent. Defects, such as missing or
added bonds, or chemical mismatches, however, are not accounted for. In this
paper we explore under which conditions the idealized CRN model without defects
captures the properties of the material, and under which conditions defects are
an inherent part of the idealized model. We find that the density of defects in
tetrahedral networks does not vary smoothly with variations in the interaction
strengths, but jumps from close-to-zero to a finite density. Consequently, in
certain materials, defects do not play a role except for being thermodynamical
excitations, whereas in others they are a fundamental ingredient of the ideal
structure.
