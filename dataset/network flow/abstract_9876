The addition of the two Forward TPCs to the STAR detector allows one to
measure anisotropic flow at forward pseudorapidities. This made possible the
first measurement of directed flow at collision energies of sqrt(s_NN) = 200
GeV. PHOBOS' results on elliptic flow at forward rapidities were confirmed, and
the sign of v2 was determined to be positive for the first time at RHIC
energies. The higher harmonic, v4, is consistent with the recently suggested
v2^2 scaling behavior.
