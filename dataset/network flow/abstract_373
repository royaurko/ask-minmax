This article characterizes certain small multistationary chemical reaction
networks. We consider the set of fully open networks, those for which all
chemical species participate in inflow and outflow, containing one non-flow
(reversible or irreversible) reaction. We show that such a network admits
multiple positive mass-action steady states if and only if the stoichiometric
coefficients in the non-flow reaction satisfy a certain simple arithmetic
relation. The multistationary fully open one-reaction networks are identified
with the chemical process of autocatalysis. Using the notion of `embedded
network' defined recently by Joshi and Shiu, we provide new sufficient
conditions for establishing multistationarity of fully open networks,
applicable well beyond the one-reaction setting.
