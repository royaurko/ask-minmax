We present a new approach to the minimum-cost integral flow problem for small
values of the flow. It reduces the problem to the tests of simple multi-variate
polynomials over a finite field of characteristic two for non-identity with
zero. In effect, we show that a minimum-cost flow of value k in a network with
n vertices, a sink and a source, integral edge capacities and positive integral
edge costs polynomially bounded in n can be found by a randomized PRAM, with
errors of exponentially small probability in n, running in O(k\log (kn)+\log^2
(kn)) time and using 2^{k}(kn)^{O(1)} processors. Thus, in particular, for the
minimum-cost flow of value O(\log n), we obtain an RNC^2 algorithm.
