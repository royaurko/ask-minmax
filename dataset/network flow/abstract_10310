The structure of magnetic reconnection-driven outflows and their dissipation
are explored with large-scale, 3-D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Outflow
jets resulting from 3-D reconnection with a finite length x-line form fronts as
they propagate into the downstream medium. A large pressure increase ahead of
this ``reconnection jet front'' (RJF), due to reflected and transmitted ions,
slows the front so that its velocity is well below the velocity of the ambient
ions in the core of the jet. As a result, the RJF slows and diverts the
high-speed flow into the direction perpendicular to the reconnection plane. The
consequence is that the RJF acts as a thermalization site for the ion bulk flow
and contributes significantly to the dissipation of magnetic energy during
reconnection even though the outflow jet is subsonic. This behavior has no
counterpart in 2-D reconnection. A simple analytic model predicts the front
velocity and the fraction of the ion bulk flow energy that is dissipated.
