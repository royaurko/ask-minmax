Hot flow anomalies (HFAs) represent a subset of solar wind discontinuities
interacting with collisionless bow shocks. They are typically formed when the
normal component of motional (convective) electric field points toward the
embedded current sheet on at least one of its sides. The core region of an HFA
contains hot and highly deflected ion flows and rather low and turbulent
magnetic field. In this paper, we report first observations of HFA-like events
at Mercury identified over a course of two planetary years. Using data from the
orbital phase of the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and
Ranging (MESSENGER) mission, we identify a representative ensemble of active
current sheets magnetically connected to Mercury's bow shock. We show that some
of these events exhibit unambiguous magnetic and particle signatures of HFAs
similar to those observed earlier at other planets, and present their key
physical characteristics. Our analysis suggests that Mercury's bow shock does
not only mediate the flow of supersonic solar wind plasma but also provides
conditions for local particle acceleration and heating as predicted by previous
numerical simulations. Together with earlier observations of HFA activity at
Earth, Venus and Saturn, our results confirm that hot flow anomalies are a
common property of planetary bow shocks, and show that the characteristic size
of these events is of the order of one planetary radius.
