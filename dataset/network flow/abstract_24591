In this paper, we propose a new gossip-based signaling dissemination method
for the Next Steps in Signaling protocol family. In more detail, we propose to
extend the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol, so as to
leverage these new dissemination capabilities from all NSIS Signaling Layer
Protocol applications using its transport capabilities. The new GIST extension
consists of two main procedures: a bootstrap procedure, during which new
GIST-enabled nodes discover each other, and a service dissemination procedure,
which is used to effectively disseminate signaling messages within an
Autonomous System. To this aim, we defined three dissemination models, bubble,
balloon, and hose, so as to fulfill requirements of different network and/or
service management scenarios. An experimental campaign carried out on the GENI
testbed shows the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
