The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO/HMI) provides continuous full-disk observations of solar oscillations. We
develop a data-analysis pipeline based on the time-distance helioseismology
method to measure acoustic travel times using HMI Doppler-shift observations,
and infer solar interior properties by inverting these measurements. The
pipeline is used for routine production of near-real-time full-disk maps of
subsurface wave-speed perturbations and horizontal flow velocities for depths
ranging from 0 to 20 Mm, every eight hours. In addition, Carrington synoptic
maps for the subsurface properties are made from these full-disk maps. The
pipeline can also be used for selected target areas and time periods. We
explain details of the pipeline organization and procedures, including
processing of the HMI Doppler observations, measurements of the travel times,
inversions, and constructions of the full-disk and synoptic maps. Some initial
results from the pipeline, including full-disk flow maps, sunspot subsurface
flow fields, and the interior rotation and meridional flow speeds, are
presented.
