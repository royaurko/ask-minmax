Community detection is one of the most active fields in complex networks
analysis, due to its potential value in practical applications. Many works
inspired by different paradigms are devoted to the development of algorithmic
solutions allowing to reveal the network structure in such cohesive subgroups.
Comparative studies reported in the literature usually rely on a performance
measure considering the community structure as a partition (Rand Index,
Normalized Mutual information, etc.). However, this type of comparison neglects
the topological properties of the communities. In this article, we present a
comprehensive comparative study of a representative set of community detection
methods, in which we adopt both types of evaluation. Community-oriented
topological measures are used to qualify the communities and evaluate their
deviation from the reference structure. In order to mimic real-world systems,
we use artificially generated realistic networks. It turns out there is no
equivalence between both approaches: a high performance does not necessarily
correspond to correct topological properties, and vice-versa. They can
therefore be considered as complementary, and we recommend applying both of
them in order to perform a complete and accurate assessment.
