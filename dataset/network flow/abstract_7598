The elliptic flow for Lambda hyperons and K0s mesons was measured by the NA49
experiment in semicentral Pb+Pb collisions at 158A GeV. The standard method of
correlating particles with an event plane has been used. Measurements of v2
near mid-rapidity are reported as a function of centrality, rapidity and
transverse momentum. Elliptic flow of Lambda and K0s particles increases both
with the impact parameter and with the transverse momentum. It is compared with
v2 for pions and protons as well as with various model predictions. The NA49
results are compared with data from NA45/CERES and STAR experiments.
