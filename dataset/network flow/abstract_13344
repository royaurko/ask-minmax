Systems coupling fluids and polymers are of great interest in many branches
of sciences. One of the models to describe them is the FENE (Finite Extensible
Nonlinear Elastic) dumbbell model. We prove global existence of weak solutions
to the FENE dumbbell model of polymeric flows for a very general class of
potentials. The main problem is the passage to the limit in a nonlinear term
that has no obvious compactness properties. The proof uses many weak
convergence techniques. In particular it is based on the control of the
propagation of strong convergence of some well chosen quantity by studying a
transport equation for its defect measure.
