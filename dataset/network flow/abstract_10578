The problem of community detection is relevant in many scientific
disciplines, from social science to statistical physics. Given the impact of
community detection in many areas, such as psychology and social sciences, we
have addressed the issue of modifying existing well performing algorithms by
incorporating elements of the domain application fields, i.e. domain-inspired.
We have focused on a psychology and social network - inspired approach which
may be useful for further strengthening the link between social network studies
and mathematics of community detection. Here we introduce a community-detection
algorithm derived from the van Dongen's Markov Cluster algorithm (MCL) method
by considering networks' nodes as agents capable to take decisions. In this
framework we have introduced a memory factor to mimic a typical human behavior
such as the oblivion effect. The method is based on information diffusion and
it includes a non-linear processing phase. We test our method on two classical
community benchmark and on computer generated networks with known community
structure. Our approach has three important features: the capacity of detecting
overlapping communities, the capability of identifying communities from an
individual point of view and the fine tuning the community detectability with
respect to prior knowledge of the data. Finally we discuss how to use a Shannon
entropy measure for parameter estimation in complex networks.
