We employ a coarse-graining approach to analyze nonlinear cascades in
Boussinesq flows using high-resolution simulation data. We derive budgets which
resolve the evolution of energy and potential enstrophy simultaneously in space
and in scale. We then use numerical simulations of Boussinesq flows, with
forcing in the large-scales, and fixed rotation and stable stratification along
the vertical axis, to study the inter-scale flux of energy and potential
enstrophy in three different regimes of stratification and rotation: (i) strong
rotation and moderate stratification, (ii) moderate rotation and strong
stratification, and (iii) equally strong stratification and rotation. In all
three cases, we observe constant fluxes of both global invariants, the mean
energy and mean potential enstrophy, from large to small scales. The existence
of constant potential enstrophy flux ranges provides the first direct empirical
evidence in support of the notion of a cascade of potential enstrophy. The
persistent forward cascade of the two invariants reflects a marked departure of
these flows from two-dimensional turbulence.
