We present an implementation of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) under the NS-3 open
source network simulator. MPTCP is a promising extension of TCP currently
considered by the recent eponymous IETF working group, with the objective of
improving the performance of TCP, especially its robustness to variable network
conditions. We describe this new protocol, its main functions and our
implementation in NS-3. Besides this implementation compliant to the current
versions of the IETF drafts, we have also added and compared various packet
reordering mechanisms. We indeed notice that such mechanisms highly improve the
performance of MPTCP. We believe that our implementation could be useful for
future works in MPTCP performance evaluation, especially to compare packet
reordering algorithms or coupling congestion control mechanisms between
subfows.
