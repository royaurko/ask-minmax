In the recent years many research groups have studied slippery properties on
lubricating fluid infused rough surfaces using hydrophobic substrates. These
surfaces show excellent slippery behaviour for water and other liquids. Here we
demonstrate a simple method to fabricate stable slippery surfaces based on
silicone oil coated hydrophilic samples. At room temperature, as prepared
samples exhibit non-slippery behaviour due to sinking of water drops inside
silicone oil layer because of inherently hydrophilic silicon substrate.
Subsequent annealing at higher temperatures provides covalent bonding of
silicone molecules at silicon surface making the surface hydrophobic which was
confirmed by lubricant wash tests. So the silicone oil coated annealed samples
show excellent water repellency, very low contact angle hysteresis and very
good slippery behavior. But these surfaces show poor oil stability against
drops flow due to cloaking of the oil around water drops which can be prevented
by using drops of larger volume or continuous flow of water.
