In this paper, we derive consistent shallow water equations for bi-layer
flows of Newtonian fluids flowing down a ramp. We carry out a complete spectral
analysis of steady flows in the low frequency regime and show the occurence of
hydrodynamic instabilities, so called roll-waves, when steady flows are
unstable.
