We present a single, unified, multi-scale model to study the
attachment\detachment dynamics of two deforming, near spherical cells, coated
with binding ligands and subject to a slow, homogeneous shear flow in a viscous
fluid medium. The binding ligands on the surface of the cells experience
attractive and repulsive forces in an ionic medium and exhibit finite
resistance to rotation via bond tilting. The macroscale drag forces and couples
describing the fluid flow inside the small separation gap between the cells,
are calculated using a combination of methods in lubrication theory and
previously published numerical results. For a select range of material and
fluid parameters, a hysteretic transition of the sticking probability curves
between the adhesion and fragmentation domain is attributed to a nonlinear
relation between the total microscale binding forces and the separation gap
between the cells. We show that adhesion is favored in highly ionic fluids,
increased deformability of the cells, elastic binders and a higher fluid shear
rate (until a critical value). Continuation of the limit points predict a
bistable region, indicating an abrupt switching between the adhesion and
fragmentation regimes at critical shear rates, and suggesting that adhesion of
two deformable surfaces in shearing fluids may play a significant dynamical
role in some cell adhesion applications.
