Observations of interstellar gas and dust towards nearby stars and within the
solar system show that the Sun is embedded in a warm diffuse partially-ionized
cloud. This cloud is the leading edge of a flow of interstellar matter (ISM)
through our Galactic neighborhood. Interstellar matter sets the boundary
conditions of the heliosphere and astrospheres of extra-solar planetary
systems. Moreover, the interplanetary regions in these systems are sensitive to
inflowing ISM.
