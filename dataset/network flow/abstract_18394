A computer network can be attacked in a number of ways. The security-related
threats have become not only numerous but also diverse and they may also come
in the form of blended attacks. It becomes difficult for any security system to
block all types of attacks. This gives rise to the need of an incidence
handling capability which is necessary for rapidly detecting incidents,
minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited
and restoring the computing services. Incidence response has always been an
important aspect of information security but it is often overlooked by security
administrators. in this paper, we propose an automated system which will handle
the security threats and make the computer network capable enough to withstand
any kind of attack. we also present the state-of-the-art technology in
computer, network and software which is required to build such a system.
