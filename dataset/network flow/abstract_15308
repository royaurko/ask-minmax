A step-to-step introduction is provided on how to generate a semantic map
from a collection of messages (full texts, paragraphs or statements) using
freely available software and/or SPSS for the relevant statistics and the
visualization. The techniques are discussed in the various theoretical contexts
of (i) linguistics (e.g., Latent Semantic Analysis), (ii) sociocybernetics and
social systems theory (e.g., the communication of meaning), and (iii)
communication studies (e.g., framing and agenda-setting). We distinguish
between the communication of information in the network space (social network
analysis) and the communication of meaning in the vector space. The vector
space can be considered a generated as an architecture by the network of
relations in the network space; words are then not only related, but also
positioned. These positions are expected rather than observed and therefore one
can communicate meaning. Knowledge can be generated when these meanings can
recursively be communicated and therefore also further codified.
