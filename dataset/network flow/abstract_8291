We propose a new method to estimate the critical index $t$ for strength of
networks of random fused conductors. It relies on a recently introduced
expression for their yield strength. We confirm the results using finite size
scaling. To pursue this commitment, we systematically study different damage
modalities of conducting networks inducing variations on the behavior of their
nonlinear strength reduction.
