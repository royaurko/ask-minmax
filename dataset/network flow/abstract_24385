We investigate the critical properties of the Ising model in two dimensions
on {\it directed} small-world lattice with quenched connectivity disorder. The
disordered system is simulated by applying the Monte Carlo update heat bath
algorithm. We calculate the critical temperature, as well as the critical
exponents $\gamma/\nu$, $\beta/\nu$, and $1/\nu$ for several values of the
rewiring probability $p$. We find that this disorder system does not belong to
the same universality class as the regular two-dimensional ferromagnetic model.
The Ising model on {\it directed} small-world lattices presents in fact a
second-order phase transition with new critical exponents which do not
dependent of $p$, but are identical to the exponents of the Ising model and the
spin-1 Blume-Capel model on {\it directed} small-world network.
