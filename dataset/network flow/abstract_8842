We consider the It\^{o} SDE with non-degenerate diffusion coefficient and
measurable drift coefficient. Under the condition that the gradient of the
diffusion coefficient and the divergences of the diffusion and drift
coefficients are exponentially integrable with respect to the Gaussian measure,
we show that the stochastic flow leaves the reference measure absolutely
continuous.
