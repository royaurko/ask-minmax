Rich recirculation patterns have been recently discovered in the electrically
conducting flow subject to a local external magnetic termed "the magnetic
obstacle" [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 (2007), 144504]. This paper continues the study
of magnetic obstacles and sheds new light on the core of the magnetic obstacle
that develops between magnetic poles when the intensity of the external field
is very large. A series of both 3D and 2D numerical simulations have been
carried out, through which it is shown that the core of the magnetic obstacle
is streamlined both by the upstream flow and by the induced cross stream
electric currents, like a foreign insulated insertion placed inside the
ordinary hydrodynamic flow. The closed streamlines of the mass flow resemble
contour lines of electric potential, while closed streamlines of the electric
current resemble contour lines of pressure. New recirculation patterns not
reported before are found in the series of 2D simulations. These are composed
of many (even number) vortices aligned along the spanwise line crossing the
magnetic gap. The intensities of these vortices are shown to vanish toward to
the center of the magnetic gap, confirming the general conclusion of 3D
simulations that the core of the magnetic obstacle is frozen. The implications
of these findings for the case of turbulent flow are discussed briefly.
