We consider the two dimensional version of a drainage network model
introduced by Gangopadhyay, Roy and Sarkar, and show that the appropriately
rescaled family of its paths converges in distribution to the Brownian web. We
do so by verifying the convergence criteria proposed by Fontes, Isopi, Newman
and Ravishankar.
