Reactions to posts in an online social network show different dynamics
depending on several textual features of the corresponding content. Do similar
dynamics exist when images are posted? Exploiting a novel dataset of posts,
gathered from the most popular Google+ users, we try to give an answer to such
a question. We describe several virality phenomena that emerge when taking into
account visual characteristics of images (such as orientation, mean saturation,
etc.). We also provide hypotheses and potential explanations for the dynamics
behind them, and include cases for which common-sense expectations do not hold
true in our experiments.
