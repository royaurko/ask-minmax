A new defence mechanism for different jamming attack on Wireless Sensor
Network (WSN) based on ant system it is introduced. The artificial sensitive
ants react on network attacks in particular based on their sensitivity level.
The information is re-directed from the attacked node to its appropriate
destination node. It is analyzed how are detected and isolated the jamming
attacks with mobile agents in general and in particular with the newly
ant-based sensitive approach.
