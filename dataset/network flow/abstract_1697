Models of message flows in an artificial group of users communicating via the
Internet are introduced and investigated using numerical simulations. We
assumed that messages possess an emotional character with a positive valence
and that the willingness to send the next affective message to a given person
increases with the number of messages received from this person. As a result,
the weights of links between group members evolve over time. Memory effects are
introduced, taking into account that the preferential selection of message
receivers depends on the communication intensity during the recent period only.
We also model the phenomenon of secondary social sharing when the reception of
an emotional e-mail triggers the distribution of several emotional e-mails to
other people.
