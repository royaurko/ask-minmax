We demonstrate that superclean d-wave superconductors display a novel type of
vortex dynamics: At low temperatures, both dissipative and transverse
components of the flux-flow conductivity are found to approach universal values
even in the limit of infinite relaxation time. A finite dissipation in the
superclean limit is explained in terms of the Landau damping on zero-frequency
vortex modes which appear due to minigap nodes in the bound-state spectrum in
the vortex core. In the moderately clean regime the scaling law at low T and
low field is obtained.
