In 2000 we proposed a sociophysics model of opinion formation, which was
based on trade union maxim "United we Stand, Divided we Fall" (USDF) and latter
due to Dietrich Stauffer became known as the Sznajd model (SM). The main
difference between SM compared to voter or Ising-type models is that
information flows outward. In this paper we review the modifications and
applications of SM that have been proposed in the literature.
