We study the important problem of tracking moving targets in wireless sensor
networks. We try to overcome the limitations of standard state of the art
tracking methods based on continuous location tracking, i.e. the high energy
dissipation and communication overhead imposed by the active participation of
sensors in the tracking process and the low scalability, especially in sparse
networks. Instead, our approach uses sensors in a passive way: they just record
and judiciously spread information about observed target presence in their
vicinity; this information is then used by the (powerful) tracking agent to
locate the target by just following the traces left at sensors. Our protocol is
greedy, local, distributed, energy efficient and very successful, in the sense
that (as shown by extensive simulations) the tracking agent manages to quickly
locate and follow the target; also, we achieve good trade-offs between the
energy dissipation and latency.
