Networks built using SDN (Software-Defined Networks) and NFV (Network
Functions Virtualization) approaches are expected to face several challenges
such as scalability, robustness and resiliency. In this paper, we propose a
self-modeling based diagnosis to enable resilient networks in the context of
SDN and NFV. We focus on solving two major problems: On the one hand, we lack
today of a model or template that describes the managed elements in the context
of SDN and NFV. On the other hand, the highly dynamic networks enabled by the
softwarisation require the generation at runtime of a diagnosis model from
which the root causes can be identified. In this paper, we propose finer
granular templates that do not only model network nodes but also their
sub-components for a more detailed diagnosis suitable in the SDN and NFV
context. In addition, we specify and validate a self-modeling based diagnosis
using Bayesian Networks. This approach differs from the state of the art in the
discovery of network and service dependencies at run-time and the building of
the diagnosis model of any SDN infrastructure using our templates.
