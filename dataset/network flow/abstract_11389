Robustness of two coupled networks system has been studied only for
dependency coupling (S. Buldyrev et. al., Nature, 2010) and only for
connectivity coupling (E. A. Leicht and R. M. D'Souza, arxiv:09070894). Here we
study, using a percolation approach, a more realistic coupled networks system
where both interdependent and interconnected links exist. We find a rich and
unusual phase transition phenomena including hybrid transition of mixed first
and second order i.e., discontinuities like a first order transition of the
giant component followed by a continuous decrease to zero like a second order
transition. Moreover, we find unusual discontinuous changes from second order
to first order transition as a function of the dependency coupling between the
two networks.
