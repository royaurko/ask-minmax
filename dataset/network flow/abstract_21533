We report Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) measurements on the vortex
lattice in a PbIn polycrystal in the presence of an applied current. Using the
rocking curves as a probe of the distribution of current in the sample, we
observe that vortex pinning is due to the surface roughness. This leads to a
surface current that persists in the flux flow region. We show the influence of
surface treatments on the distribution of this current.
