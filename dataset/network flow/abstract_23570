We develop a phenomenological vector model of polar liquids capable to
describe aqueous interactions of macroscopic bodies. It is shown that a strong,
long-range and orientationally dependent interaction between macroscopic
objects appears as a result of competition between short-range (hydrogen
bonding) and the long-range dipole-dipole interactions of the solvent
molecules. Spontaneous polarization of molecular dipoles next to a hydrophobic
boundaries leads to formation of globally ordered network of hydrogen-bonded
molecules with ferroelectric properties. The proposed vector model naturally
describes topological excitations on the solute boundaries and can be used to
explain the hydrogen bonds networks and order-disorder phase transitions in the
hydration water layer.
