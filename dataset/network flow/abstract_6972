We report on the first measurement of the triangular v3, quadrangular v4, and
pentagonal v5 charged particle flow in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV measured
with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We show that the
triangular flow can be described in terms of the initial spatial anisotropy and
its fluctuations, which provides strong constraints on its origin. In the most
central events, where the elliptic flow v2 and v3 have similar magnitude, a
double peaked structure in the two-particle azimuthal correlations is observed,
which is often interpreted as a Mach cone response to fast partons. We show
that this structure can be naturally explained from the measured anisotropic
flow Fourier coefficients.
