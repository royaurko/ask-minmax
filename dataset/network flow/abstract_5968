In wireless sensor-actor networks, sensors probe their surroundings and
forward their data to actor nodes. Actors collect sensor data and perform
certain tasks in response to various events. Since actors operate on harsh
environment, they may easily get damaged or failed. Failed actor nodes may
partition the network into disjoint subsets. In order to reestablish
connectivity nodes may be relocated to new positions. This paper focus on
review of three (LeDir, RIM, DARA) node recovery algorithms, and their
performance has been analysed in terms network overhead and path length
validation metrics.
