The existence of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on a compact K\"ahler manifold has
been the subject of intensive study over the last few decades, following Yau's
solution to Calabi's conjecture. The Ricci flow, introduced by Richard Hamilton
has become one of the most powerful tools in geometric analysis.
  We study the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on minimal surfaces of Kodaira dimension one
and show that the flow collapses and converges to a unique canonical metric on
its canonical model. Such a canonical is a generalized K\"ahler-Einstein
metric. Combining the results of Cao, Tsuji, Tian and Zhang, we give a metric
classification for K\"aher surfaces with a numerical effective canonical line
bundle by the K\"ahler-Ricci flow. In general, we propose a program of finding
canonical metrics on canonical models of projective varieties of positive
Kodaira dimension.
