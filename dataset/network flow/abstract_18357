This paper develops a contention-based opportunistic feedback technique
towards relay selection in a dense wireless network. This technique enables the
forwarding of additional parity information from the selected relay to the
destination. For a given network, the effects of varying key parameters such as
the feedback probability are presented and discussed. A primary advantage of
the proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in a
distributed way. Simulation results find its performance to closely match that
of centralized schemes that utilize GPS information, unlike the proposed
method. The proposed relay selection method is also found to achieve throughput
gains over a point-to-point transmission strategy.
