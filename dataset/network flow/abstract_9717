Network intrusion detection is the process of identifying malicious behaviors
that target a network and its resources. Current systems implementing intrusion
detection processes observe traffic at several data collecting points in the
network but analysis is often centralized or partly centralized. These systems
are not scalable and suffer from the single point of failure, i.e. attackers
only need to target the central node to compromise the whole system. This paper
proposes an anomaly-based fully distributed network intrusion detection system
where analysis is run at each data collecting point using a naive Bayes
classifier. Probability values computed by each classifier are shared among
nodes using an iterative average consensus protocol. The final analysis is
performed redundantly and in parallel at the level of each data collecting
point, thus avoiding the single point of failure issue. We run simulations
focusing on DDoS attacks with several network configurations, comparing the
accuracy of our fully distributed system with a hierarchical one. We also
analyze communication costs and convergence speed during consensus phases.
