Defaults in vascular (VN) and neuronal networks of spinal cord are
responsible for serious neurodegenerative pathologies. Because of inadequate
investigation tools, the lacking knowledge of the complete fine structure of VN
and neuronal systems is a crucial problem. Conventional 2D imaging yields
incomplete spatial coverage leading to possible data misinterpretation, whereas
standard 3D computed tomography imaging achieves insufficient resolution and
contrast. We show that X-ray high-resolution phase-contrast tomography allows
the simultaneous visualization of three-dimensional VN and neuronal systems of
mouse spinal cord at scales spanning from millimeters to hundreds of
nanometers, with neither contrast agent nor a destructive sample-preparation.
We image both the 3D distribution of micro-capillary network and the
micrometric nerve fibers, axon-bundles and neuron soma. Our approach is a
crucial tool for pre-clinical investigation of neurodegenerative pathologies
and spinal-cord-injuries. In particular, it should be an optimal tool to
resolve the entangled relationship between VN and neuronal system.
