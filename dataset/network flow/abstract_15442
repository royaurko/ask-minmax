Publishing social network data for research purposes has raised serious
concerns for individual privacy. There exist many privacy-preserving works that
can deal with different attack models. In this paper, we introduce a novel
privacy attack model and refer it as a mutual friend attack. In this model, the
adversary can re-identify a pair of friends by using their number of mutual
friends. To address this issue, we propose a new anonymity concept, called
k-NMF anonymity, i.e., k-anonymity on the number of mutual friends, which
ensures that there exist at least k-1 other friend pairs in the graph that
share the same number of mutual friends. We devise algorithms to achieve the
k-NMF anonymity while preserving the original vertex set in the sense that we
allow the occasional addition but no deletion of vertices. Further we give an
algorithm to ensure the k-degree anonymity in addition to the k-NMF anonymity.
The experimental results on real-word datasets demonstrate that our approach
can preserve the privacy and utility of social networks effectively against
mutual friend attacks.
