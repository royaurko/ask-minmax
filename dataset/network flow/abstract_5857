We prove that the general mean-field type networks at low load behave in
accordance with the Poisson Hypothesis. That means that the network
equilibrates in time independent of its size. This is a "high-temperature"
counterpart of our earlier result, where we have shown that at high load the
relaxation time can diverge with the size of the network ("low-temperature").
In other words, the phase transitions in the networks can happen at high load,
but cannot take place at low load.
