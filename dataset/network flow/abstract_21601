Conservation laws, heirarchies, scattering theory and B\"acklund
transformations are known to be the building blocks of integrable partial
differential equations. We identify these as facets of a theory of Poisson
group actions, and apply the theory to the ZS-AKNS nxn heirarchy (which
includes the non-linear Schr\"odinger equation, modified KdV, and the n-wave
equation). We also discuss a number of applications in geometry, including the
sine-Gordon equation, harmonic maps, Schr\"odinger flows on Hermitian symmetric
spaces, Darboux orthogonal coordinates, and isometric immerisons of one space
form in another.
