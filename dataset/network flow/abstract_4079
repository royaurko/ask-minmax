In this paper, we construct smooth forward Ricci flow evolutions of singular
initial metrics resulting from rotationally symmetric neckpinches on S^(n+1),
without performing an intervening surgery. In the restrictive context of
rotational symmetry, this construction gives evidence in favor of Perelman's
hope for a "canonically defined Ricci flow through singularities".
