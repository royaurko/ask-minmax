Incompressible two-dimensional flows such as the advection (Liouville)
equation and the Euler equations have a large family of conservation laws
related to conservation of area. We present two Eulerian numerical methods
which preserve a discrete analog of area. The first is a fully discrete model
based on a rearrangement of cells; the second is more conventional, but still
preserves the area within each contour of the vorticity field. Initial tests
indicate that both methods suppress the formation of spurious oscillations in
the field.
