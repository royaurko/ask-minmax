We present a satisfactory definition of the important class of L\'evy
processes indexed by a general collection of sets. We use a new definition for
increment stationarity of set-indexed processes to obtain different
characterizations of this class. As an example, the set-indexed compound
Poisson process is introduced. The set-indexed L\'evy process is characterized
by infinitely divisible laws and a L\'evy-Khintchine representation. Moreover,
the following concepts are discussed: projections on flows, Markov properties,
and pointwise continuity. Finally the study of sample paths leads to a
L\'evy-It\^o decomposition. As a corollary, the semimartingale property is
proved.
