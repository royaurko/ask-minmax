Is every irreducible shift of finite type flow equivalent to a renewal
system? For the first time, this variation of a classic problem formulated by
Adler is investigated, and several partial results are obtained in an attempt
to find the range of the Bowen--Franks invariant over the set of renewal
systems of finite type. In particular, it is shown that the Bowen--Franks group
is cyclic for every member of a class of renewal systems known to attain all
entropies realised by shifts of finite type, and several classes of renewal
systems with non--trivial values of the invariant are constructed.
