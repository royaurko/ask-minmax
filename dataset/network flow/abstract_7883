In this paper, we study the global K\"ahler-Ricci flow on a complete
non-compact K\"ahler manifold. We prove the following result. Assume that
$(M,g_0)$ is a complete non-compact K\"ahler manifold such that there is a
potential function $f$ of the Ricci tensor, i.e., $$
R_{i\bar{j}}(g_0)=f_{i\bar{j}}. $$ Assume that the quantity
$|f|_{C^0}+|\nabla_{g_0}f|_{C^0}$ is finite and the L2 Sobolev inequality holds
true on $(M,g_0)$. Then the Kahler-Ricci flow with the initial metric $g_0$
either blows up at finite time or infinite time to Ricci flat metric or exists
globally with Ricci-flat limit at infinite time. A related is also discussed.
