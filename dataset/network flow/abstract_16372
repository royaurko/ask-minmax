Amorphous materials as diverse as foams, emulsions, colloidal suspensions and
granular media can {\em jam} into a rigid, disordered state where they
withstand finite shear stresses before yielding. The jamming transition has
been studied extensively, in particular in computer simulations of
frictionless, soft, purely repulsive spheres. Foams and emulsions are the
closest realizations of this model, and in foams, the (un)jamming point
corresponds to the wet limit, where the bubbles become spherical and just form
contacts. Here we sketch the relevance of the jamming perspective for the
geometry and flow of foams --- and also discuss the impact that foams studies
may have on theoretical studies on jamming.
  We first briefly review insights into the crucial role of disorder in these
systems, culminating in the breakdown of the affine assumption that underlies
the rich mechanics near jamming. Second, we discuss how crucial theoretical
predictions, such as the square root scaling of contact number with packing
fraction, and the nontrivial role of disorder and fluctuations for flow have
been observed in experiments on 2D foams. Third, we discuss a scaling model for
the rheology of disordered media that appears to capture the key features of
the flow of foams, emulsions and soft colloidal suspensions. Finally, we
discuss how best to confront predictions of this model with experimental data.
