We study the stability of shear flows in a fully ionized plasma.
Kelvin-Helmholtz is a well known, macroscopic and ideal shear-driven
instability. In sufficiently low density plasmas, also the microscopic Hall
magneto-shear instability can take place. We performed three-dimensional
simulations of the Hall-MHD equations where these two instabilities are
present, and carried out a comparative study. We find that when the shear flow
is so intense that its vorticity surpasses the ion-cyclotron frequency of the
plasma, the Hall magneto-shear instability is not only non-negligible, but it
actually displays growth rates larger than those of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability.
