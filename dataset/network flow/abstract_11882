We propose two robust methods for anomaly detection in dynamic networks in
which the properties of normal traffic are time-varying. We formulate the
robust anomaly detection problem as a binary composite hypothesis testing
problem and propose two methods: a model-free and a model-based one, leveraging
techniques from the theory of large deviations. Both methods require a family
of Probability Laws (PLs) that represent normal properties of traffic. We
devise a two-step procedure to estimate this family of PLs. We compare the
performance of our robust methods and their vanilla counterparts, which assume
that normal traffic is stationary, on a network with a diurnal normal pattern
and a common anomaly related to data exfiltration. Simulation results show that
our robust methods perform better than their vanilla counterparts in dynamic
networks.
