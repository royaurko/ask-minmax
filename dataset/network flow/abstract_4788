We propose an exact flow equation for composite operators and their
correlation functions. This can be used for a scale-dependent partial
bosonization or "flowing bosonization" of fermionic interactions, or for an
effective change of degrees of freedom in dependence on the momentum scale. The
flow keeps track of the scale dependent relation between effective composite
fields and corresponding composite operators in terms of the fundamental
fields.
