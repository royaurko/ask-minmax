Review of theoretical methods for description of thermoelectrical properties
of two-phase macroscopically inhomogeneous media is given. Description by means
of a hierarchical model of percolation structure is given, allowing a
description on a qualitative and quantitative level of the basic regularities
of effective thermoelectric coefficient close to flow threshold.
