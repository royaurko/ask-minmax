Recently, it has been shown that networks with an arbitrary degree sequence
may be a stable solution to a network formation game. Further, in recent years
there has been a rise in the number of firms participating in collaborative
efforts. In this paper, we show conditions under which a graph with an
arbitrary degree sequence is admitted as a stable firm collaboration graph.
