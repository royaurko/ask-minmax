The design and synthesis of complex and large mimicked biochemical networks
de novo is an unsolved problem in synthetic biology. To address this limitation
without resorting to ad hoc computations and experiments, a predictive
mathematical theory is required to reduce these complex chemical networks into
natural physico-chemical expressions. Here we provide a theory that offers a
physico-chemical expression for a large chemical network that is almost
arbitrarily both nonlinear and complex. Unexpectedly, the theory demonstrates
that such networks can be decomposed into reactions based solely on the Hill
equation, a simple chemical logic gate. This theory, analogous to implemented
electrical logic gates or functional algorithms in a computer, is proposed for
implementing regulated sequences of functional chemical reactions, such as
mimicked genes, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, protein
interaction, and metabolic networks, into an artificial designed chemical
network.
