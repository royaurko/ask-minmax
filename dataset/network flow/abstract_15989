This paper addresses the path selection problem from a known source to the
destination in dense networks. The proposed solution for route discovery uses
the genetic algorithm approach for a QoS based network. The multi point
crossover and mutation helps in determining the optimal path and alternate path
when required. The input to the genetic algorithm is a learnt module which is a
part of the cognitive router that takes care of four QoS parameters. Here the
set of nodes selected for routing is determined by delay, jitter and loss. On
this graded surface of nodes selected, the bandwidth parameter is considered
for path selection. The aim of the approach is to occupy the maximized
bandwidth along the forward channels and minimize the route length. The
population size is considered as fixed nodes participating in the network
scenario, which will be limited to a known size of topology. The simulated
results show that by using genetic algorithm (GA) approach the probability of
convergence to shortest path is higher.
