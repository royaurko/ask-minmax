Gradient flow in a potential energy (or Euclidean action) landscape provides
a natural set of paths connecting different saddle points. We apply this method
to General Relativity, where gradient flow is Ricci flow, and focus on the
example of 4-dimensional Euclidean gravity with boundary S^1 x S^2,
representing the canonical ensemble for gravity in a box. At high temperature
the action has three saddle points: hot flat space and a large and small black
hole. Adding a time direction, these also give static 5-dimensional
Kaluza-Klein solutions, whose potential energy equals the 4-dimensional action.
The small black hole has a Gross-Perry-Yaffe-type negative mode, and is
therefore unstable under Ricci flow. We numerically simulate the two flows
seeded by this mode, finding that they lead to the large black hole and to hot
flat space respectively, in the latter case via a topology-changing
singularity. In the context of string theory these flows are world-sheet
renormalization group trajectories. We also use them to construct a novel free
energy diagram for the canonical ensemble.
