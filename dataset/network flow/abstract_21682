The Tricritical Ising model perturbed by the subleading energy operator
\Phi_(3/5) was known to be an Integrable Scattering Theory of massive kinks and
in fact preserves supersymmetry. We consider here the model defined on the
half-plane with a boundary and computed the associated factorizable boundary
S-matrix. The conformal boundary conditions of this model were identified and
the corresponding S-matrices were found. We also show how some of these
S-matrices can be perturbed and generate ``flows'' between different boundary
conditions.
