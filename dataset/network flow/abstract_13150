Proton and deuteron m_T spectra and rapidity densities at y=1.9-2.3 are
presented for central SS, SPb and PbPb collisions. The inverse slopes increase
with system size and mass. The radius parameter, R_G, extracted from ratios of
the spectra increases with system size. R_G is proportional to 1/\sqrt{m_T}
consistent with transverse flow and NA44's HBT results.
