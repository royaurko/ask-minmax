The aim in the dynamical systems approach to transitional turbulence is to
construct a scaffold in phase space for the dynamics using simple invariant
sets (exact solutions) and their stable and unstable manifolds. In large
(realistic) domains where turbulence can co-exist with laminar flow, this
requires identifying exact localized solutions. In wall-bounded shear flows the
first of these has recently been found in pipe flow, but questions remain as to
how they are connected to the many known streamwise-periodic solutions. Here we
demonstrate the origin of the first localized solution in a modulational
symmetry-breaking Hopf bifurcation from a known global travelling wave that has
2-fold rotational symmetry about the pipe axis. Similar behaviour is found for
a global wave of 3-fold rotational symmetry, this time leading to two localized
relative periodic orbits. The clear implication is that all global solutions
should be expected to lead to more realistic localised counterparts through
such bifurcations, which provides a constructive route for their generation.
