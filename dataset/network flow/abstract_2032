We study statistical properties of peculiar responses in glassy systems at
mesoscopic scales based on a class of mean-field spin-glass models which
exhibit 1 step replica symmetry breaking. Under variation of a generic external
field, a finite-sized sample of such a system exhibits a series of step wise
responses which can be regarded as a finger print of the sample. We study in
detail the statistical properties of the step structures based on a low
temperature expansion approach and a replica approach. The spacings between the
steps vanish in the thermodynamic limit so that arbitrary small but finite
variation of the field induce infinitely many level crossings in the
thermodynamic limit leading to a static chaos effect which yields a
self-averaging, smooth macroscopic response. We also note that there is a
strong analogy between the problem of step-wise responses in glassy systems at
mesoscopic scales and intermittency in turbulent flows due to shocks.
