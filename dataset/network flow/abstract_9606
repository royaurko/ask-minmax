We investigate the problem of finding modules (or clusters, communities) in
directed networks. Until now, most articles on this topic have been oriented
towards finding full network partitions, where every node belongs to exactly
one module. In this paper, we will present a novel random walk based approach
for fuzzy partitions of the directed network into modules, such that some nodes
do not belong to only one of the modules but to several or to none at all.
Despite the fact that the new random walk process is reversible, we will show
that it inherits all necessary information about directions and structure of
the original network. We accompany our theoretical considerations with
numerical examples.
