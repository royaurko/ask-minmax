Many new products fail, despite preliminary market surveys having determined
considerable potential market share. This effect is too systematic to be
attributed to bad luck. We suggest an explanation by presenting a new
percolation theory model for product propagation, where agents interact over a
social network. In our model, agents who do not adopt the product spread
negative word of mouth to their neighbors, and so their neighborhood becomes
less susceptible to the product. The result is a dramatic increase in the
percolation threshold. When the effect of negative word of mouth is strong
enough, it is shown to block any product from spreading to a significant
fraction of the network. So, rather then being rejected by a large fraction of
the agents, the product gets blocked by the rejection of a negligible fraction
of the potential market. The rest of the potential buyers do not adopt the
product because they are never exposed to it: the negative word of mouth spread
by initial rejectors suffocates the diffusion by negatively affecting the
immediate neighborhood of the propagation front.
