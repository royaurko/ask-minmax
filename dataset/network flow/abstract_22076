Hydrodynamic slippage plays a crucial role in the flow dynamics of thin
polymer films, as recently shown by the analysis of the profiles of liquid
fronts. For long-chained polymer films it was reported that a deviation from a
symmetric profile is a result of viscoelastic effects. In this Letter, however,
evidence is given that merely a slip boundary condition at the solid/liquid
interface can lead to an asymmetric profile. Dewetting experiments of entangled
polymer melts on diverse substrates allow a direct comparison of rim
morphologies. Variation of molecular weight Mw clearly reveals that slippage
increases dramatically above a certain Mw and governs the shape of the rim. The
results are in accordance with the theoretical description by de Gennes.
