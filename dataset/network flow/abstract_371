The theory of complex networks and of disordered systems is used to study the
stability and dynamical properties of a simple model of material flow networks
defined on random graphs. In particular we address instabilities that are
characteristic of flow networks in economic, ecological and biological systems.
Based on results from random matrix theory, we work out the phase diagram of
such systems defined on extensively connected random graphs, and study in
detail how the choice of control policies and the network structure affects
stability. We also present results for more complex topologies of the
underlying graph, focussing on finitely connected Erd\"os-R\'eyni graphs,
Small-World Networks and Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks. Results
indicate that variability of input-output matrix elements, and random
structures of the underlying graph tend to make the system less stable, while
fast price dynamics or strong responsiveness to stock accumulation promote
stability.
