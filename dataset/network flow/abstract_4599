Multiplex networks (a system of multiple networks that have different types
of links but share a common set of nodes) arise naturally in a wide spectrum of
fields. Theoretical studies show that in such multiplex networks, correlated
edge dynamics between the layers can have a profound effect on dynamical
processes. However, how to extract the correlations from real-world systems is
an outstanding challenge. Here we provide a null model based on Markov chains
to quantify correlations in edge dynamics found in longitudinal data of
multiplex networks. We use this approach on two different data sets: the
network of trade and alliances between nation states, and the email and
co-commit networks between developers of open source software. We establish the
existence of "dynamical spillover" showing the correlated formation (or
deletion) of edges of different types as the system evolves. The details of the
dynamics over time provide insight into potential causal pathways.
