Various molecular interaction networks have been claimed to follow power-law
decay for their global connectivity distribution. It has been proposed that
there may be underlying generative models that explain this heavy-tailed
behavior by self-reinforcement processes such as classical or hierarchical
scale-free network models. Here we analyze a comprehensive data set of
protein-protein and transcriptional regulatory interaction networks in yeast,
an E. coli metabolic network, and gene activity profiles for different
metabolic states in both organisms. We show that in all cases the networks have
a heavy-tailed distribution, but most of them present significant differences
from a power-law model according to a stringent statistical test. Those few
data sets that have a statistically significant fit with a power-law model
follow other distributions equally well. Thus, while our analysis supports that
both global connectivity interaction networks and activity distributions are
heavy-tailed, they are not generally described by any specific distribution
model, leaving space for further inferences on generative models.
