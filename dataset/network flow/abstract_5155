There are now several types of relativistic flows in astrophysical settings.
The foremost examples are jets and disks orbiting spinning black holes, pulsar
winds and gamma ray bursts. As discussed at this meeting, these flows exhibit
unusual kinematic and dynamical properties, that distinguish them from
non-relativistic flows. It is possible that all collimated outflows are
essentially hydromagnetic or electromagnetic. Future study of relativistic
flows will rely heavily on numerical experiments. Model relativistic flows
provide a basis for carrying out secondary studies of the underlying plasma
physics, particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification and the emission
and transfer of radiation, particularly at shock fronts. Some current
opportunities in observation, phenomenology and theory are briefly suggested.
