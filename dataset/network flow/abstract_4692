We consider the internal dynamics of the polymer molecule which is injected
in the chaotic flow with strong mean shear component. The flow geometry
corresponds to the recent experiments on the elastic turbulence (Groisman,
Steinberg 2000). The passive polymer in such flows experiences aperiodic
tumbling. We present a detailed study of the statistical properties of such
polymer dynamics. First we obtain the stationary probability distribution
function of the polymer orientation. Secondly we find the distribution of the
time periods between consequent events of tumbling, and finally we find the
tails of the polymer size distribution.
