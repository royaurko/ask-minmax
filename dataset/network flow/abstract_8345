We suggest a minimalistic model for directed networks and suggest an
application to injection and merging of magnetic field lines. We obtain a
network of connected donor and acceptor vertices with degree distribution
$1/s^2$, and with dynamical reconnection events of size $\Delta s$ occurring
with frequency that scale as $1/\Delta s^3$. This suggest that the model is in
the same universality class as the model for self organization in the solar
atmosphere suggested by Hughes et al.(PRL {\bf 90} 131101).
