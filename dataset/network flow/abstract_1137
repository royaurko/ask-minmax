A well-studied nonlinear extension of the minimum-cost flow problem is to
minimize the objective \sum_{ij\in E} C_{ij}(f_{ij}) over feasible flows f,
where on each arc ij of the network, C_{ij} is a convex function. We give a
strongly polynomial algorithm for finding an exact optimal solution for a broad
class of such problems. The most important characteristic of this class is that
an optimal solution can be computed exactly provided its support.
  The class includes convex quadratic objectives and also certain market
equilibria problems, such as Fisher's market with linear or with spending
constraint utilities. Thereby we give the first strongly polynomial algorithms
for separable quadratic minimum-cost flows and for Fisher's market with
spending constraint utilities, settling open questions posed e.g. in
[Hochbaum,94] and in [Vazirani,10], respectively. The running time is O(m^4 log
m) for quadratic costs, O(n^4 + n^2(m + n log n)log n) for Fisher's markets
with linear utilities and O(m n^3 +m^2(m + n log n) log m) for spending
constraint utilities.
