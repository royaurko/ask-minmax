We investigate the behavior of the Ising model on two connected
Barabasi-Albert scale-free networks. We extend previous analysis and show that
a first order temperature-driven phase transition occurs in such system. The
transition between antiparalelly ordered networks to paralelly ordered networks
is shown to be discontinuous. We calculate the critical temperature. We confirm
the calculations with numeric simulations using Monte-Carlo methods.
