We demonstrate the power of a recently-proposed approximation scheme for the
non-perturbative renormalization group that gives access to correlation
functions over their full momentum range. We solve numerically the
leading-order flow equations obtained within this scheme, and compute the
two-point functions of the O(N) theories at criticality, in two and three
dimensions. Excellent results are obtained for both universal and non-universal
quantities at modest numerical cost.
