We report the results of Monte Carlo simulations of a medium baseline reactor
neutrino experiment. The difference in baselines resulting from the 1 km
separations of Daya Bay and Ling Ao reactors reduces the amplitudes of 1-3
oscillations at low energies, decreasing the sensitivity to the neutrino mass
hierarchy. A perpendicular detector location eliminates this effect. We
simulate experiments under several mountains perpendicular to the Daya Bay/Ling
Ao reactors, considering in particular the background from the TaiShan and
YangJiang reactor complexes. In general the hierarchy can be determined most
reliably underneath the 1000 meter mountain BaiYunZhang, which is 44.5 km from
Daya Bay. If some planned reactors are not built then nearby 700 meter
mountains at 47-51 km baselines gain a small advantage. Neglecting their low
overhead burdens, hills near DongKeng would be the optimal locations. We use a
weighted Fourier transform to avoid a spurious dependence on the high energy
neutrino spectrum and find that a neural network can extract quantities which
determine the hierarchy marginally better than the traditional RL + PV.
