A surprising similarity is found between the distribution of hydrodynamic
stress on the wall of an irregular channel and the distribution of flux from a
purely Laplacian field on the same geometry. This finding is a direct outcome
from numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations for flow at low
Reynolds numbers in two-dimensional channels with rough walls presenting either
deterministic or random self-similar geometries. For high Reynolds numbers,
when inertial effects become relevant, the distribution of wall stresses on
deterministic and random fractal rough channels becomes substantially dependent
on the microscopic details of the walls geometry. In addition, we find that,
while the permeability of the random channel follows the usual decrease with
Reynolds, our results indicate an unexpected permeability increase for the
deterministic case, i.e., ``the rougher the better''. We show that this complex
behavior is closely related with the presence and relative intensity of
recirculation zones in the reentrant regions of the rough channel.
