Consider routing traffic on the N x N torus, simultaneously between all
source-destination pairs, to minimize the cost $\sum_ec(e)f^2(e)$, where f(e)
is the volume of flow across edge e and the c(e) form an i.i.d. random
environment. We prove existence of a rescaled $N\to \infty$ limit constant for
minimum cost, by comparison with an appropriate analogous problem about
minimum-cost flows across a M x M subsquare of the lattice.
