With our growing reliability on distributed networks, the security aspect of
such networks becomes of prime importance. In large scale distributed networks
it becomes cardinal to have an efficient and effective monitoring scheme. The
monitoring schemes supervise the node behaviour in the network and look out for
any discrepancy. Monitoring schemes comprise of monitoring components that work
together to help schemes in meeting various security requirement parameters for
the networks. These security parameters are breached via various attacks by
manipulation of monitoring components of particular monitoring schemes to
produce faulty results and thereby reducing efficiency of networks, reliability
and security. In this paper we have discussed these components of monitoring,
multiple monitoring schemes, their security parameters and various types of
attacks possible on these monitoring components by manipulating assumptions of
monitoring schemes.
