Character identification plays a vital role in the contemporary world of
Image processing. It can solve many composite problems and makes humans work
easier. An instance is Handwritten Character detection. Handwritten recognition
is not a novel expertise, but it has not gained community notice until Now. The
eventual aim of designing Handwritten Character recognition structure with an
accurateness rate of 100% is pretty illusionary. Tamil Handwritten Character
recognition system uses the Neural Networks to distinguish them. Neural Network
and structural characteristics are used to instruct and recognize written
characters. After training and testing the exactness rate reached 99%. This
correctness rate is extremely high. In this paper we are exploring image
processing through the Hilditch algorithm foundation and structural
characteristics of a character in the image. And we recognized some character
of the Tamil language, and we are trying to identify all the character of Tamil
In our future works.
