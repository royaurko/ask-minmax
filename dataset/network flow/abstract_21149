I develop the simplest geometric-discretized analogue of two dimensional
scalar field theory, which qualitatively reproduces the trace anomaly of the
continuous theory. The discrete analogue provides an interpretation of the
trace anomaly in terms of a non-trivial transformation of electric-magnetic
duality-invariant modes of resistor networks that accommodate both electric and
magnetic charge currents.
