A model for growing information networks is introduced where nodes receive
new links through j-redirection, i.e. the probability for a node to receive a
link depends on the number of paths of length j arriving at this node. In
detail, when a new node enters the network, it either connects to a randomly
selected node, or to the j -ancestor of this selected node. The j -ancestor is
found by following j links from the randomly selected node. The system is shown
to undergo a transition to a phase where condensates develop. We also find
analytical predictions for the height statistics and show numerically the
non-trivial behaviour of the degree distribution.
