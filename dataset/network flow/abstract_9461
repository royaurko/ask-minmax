In wireless channels, the path loss exponent (PLE) has a strong impact on the
quality of links, and hence, it needs to be accurately estimated for the
efficient design and operation of wireless networks. In this paper, we address
the problem of PLE estimation in large wireless networks, which is relevant to
several important issues in networked communications such as localization,
energy-efficient routing, and channel access. We consider a large ad hoc
network where nodes are distributed as a homogeneous Poisson point process on
the plane and the channels are subject to Nakagami-m fading. We propose and
discuss three distributed algorithms for estimating the PLE under these
settings which explicitly take into account the interference in the network. In
addition, we provide simulation results to demonstrate the performance of the
algorithms and quantify the estimation errors. We also describe how to estimate
the PLE accurately even in networks with spatially varying PLEs and more
general node distributions.
