Viscous flows within an elastic structure apply stress on the solid-liquid
interface. The stress-field created by the viscous flow can be utilized to
counter stress created by external forces and thus may be applied as a tool for
delaying the onset of structural failure. To illustrate this concept we study
viscous flow within an elastic cylinder under compressive axial force. We
obtain a closed-form expression showing an approximately linear relation
between the critical buckling load and the liquid inlet pressure. Our results
are validated by numerical computations. We discuss future research directions
of fluid-solid composite materials which create flow under external stress,
yielding enhanced resistance to structural failure.
