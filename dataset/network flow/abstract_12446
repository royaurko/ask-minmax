Energy is one of the most important and scarce resources in Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSN). WSN nodes work with the embedded operating system called
TinyOS, which addresses the constrains of the WSN nodes such as limited
processing power, memory, energy, etc and it uses the collection Tree Protocol
(CTP) to collect the data from the sensor nodes. It uses either the four-bit
link estimation or Link Estimation Exchange Protocol (LEEP) to predict the bi
directional quality of the wireless link between the nodes and the next hop
candidate is based on the estimated link quality. The residual energy of the
node is an important key factor, which plays a vital role in the lifetime of
the network and hence this has to taken as one of the metric in the parent
selection. In this work, we consider the remaining energy of the node as one of
the metric to decide the parent in addition to the link quality metrics. The
proposed protocol was compared with CTP protocol in terms of number of packets
forwarded by each node and packet reception ratio (PRR) of the network. This
work was simulated in TOSSIM simulator and the same was tested in Crossbow IRIS
radio test bed. The results show that our algorithm performs better than CTP in
terms of load distribution and hence the increased lifetime
