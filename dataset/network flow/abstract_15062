We study stochastic tree fluid networks driven by a multidimensional Levy
process. We are interested in (the joint distribution of) the steady-state
content in each of the buffers, the busy periods, and the idle periods. To
investigate these fluid networks, we relate the above three quantities to
fluctuations of the input Levy process by solving a multidimensional Skorokhod
reflection problem. This leads to the analysis of the distribution of the
componentwise maximums, the corresponding epochs at which they are attained,
and the beginning of the first last-passage excursion. Using the notion of
splitting times, we are able to find their Laplace transforms. It turns out
that, if the components of the Levy process are `ordered', the Laplace
transform has a so-called quasi-product form.
  The theory is illustrated by working out special cases, such as tandem
networks and priority queues.
