The first result is on the separability of the unicast capacity of stationary
multi-channel multi-radio wireless networks, i.e., whether the capacity of such
a network is equal to the sum of the capacities of the corresponding
single-channel single-radio wireless networks. For both the Arbitrary Network
model and the Random Network model, given a channel assignment, the
separability property does not always hold. However, if the number of radio
interfaces at each node is equal to the number of channels, the separability
property holds. The second result is on the impact of multi-channel routing
(i.e., routing a bit through multiple channels as opposed to through a single
channel) on the network capacity. For both network models, the network
capacities conditioned on a channel assignment under the two routing schemes
are not always equal, but if again the number of radio interfaces at each node
is equal to the number of channels, the two routing schemes yield equal network
capacities.
