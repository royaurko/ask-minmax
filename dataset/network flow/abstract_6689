Link prediction is an important network science problem in many domains such
as social networks, chem/bio-informatics, etc. Most of these networks are
dynamic in nature with patterns evolving over time. In such cases, it is
necessary to incorporate time in the mining process in a seamless manner to aid
in better prediction performance. We propose a two-step solution strategy to
the link prediction problem in dynamic networks in this work. The first step
involves a novel yet simple feature construction approach using a combination
of domain and topological attributes of the graph. In the second phase, we
perform unconstrained edge selection to identify potential candidates for
prediction by any generic two-class learner. We design various experiments on a
real world collaboration network and show the effectiveness of our approach.
