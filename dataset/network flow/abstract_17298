The derivation of the viscosity formula of accretion disks appearing in a
number of textbooks is based on a mean free path theory of gas particles.
However, this procedure, when followed precisely, leads to the incorrect
conclusion that the angular momentum of an accretion disk flows from the outer
part to the inner part.
