In this paper, we consider the initial and boundary value problem of a
simplified compressible nematic liquid crystal flow in $\Omega\subset\mathbb
R^3$. We establish the existence of global weak solutions, provided the initial
orientational director field $d_0$ lies in the hemisphere $\mathbb S^2_+$.
