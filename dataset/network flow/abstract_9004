Contraction hierarchies are a simple hierarchical routing technique that has
proved extremely efficient for static road networks. We explain how to
generalize them to networks with time-dependent edge weights. This is the first
hierarchical speedup technique for time-dependent routing that allows
bidirectional query algorithms.
