The collective motion of nucleons from high-energy heavy-ion collisions is
analyzed within a relativistic two-fluid model for different equations of state
(EoS). As function of beam energy the theoretical slope parameter F_y of the
differential directed flow is in good agreement with experimental data, when
calculated for the QCD-consistent EoS described by the statistical mixed-phase
model. Within this model, which takes the deconfinement phase transition into
account, the excitation function of the directed flow <P_x> turns out to be a
smooth function in the whole range from SIS till SPS energies. This function is
close to that for pure hadronic EoS and exhibits no minimum predicted earlier
for a two-phase bag-model EoS. Attention is also called to a possible formation
of nucleon antiflow (F_y < 0) at energies of the order of 100 A GeV.
