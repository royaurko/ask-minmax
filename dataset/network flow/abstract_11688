Handoff decisions are usually signal strength based because of simplicity and
effectiveness. Apart from the conventional techniques, such as threshold and
hysteresis based schemes, recently many artificial intelligent techniques such
as Fuzzy Logic, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) etc. are also used for taking
handoff decision. In this paper, an Artificial Neural Network based handoff
algorithm is proposed and its performance is studied. We have used ANN here for
taking fast and accurate handoff decision. In our proposed handoff algorithm,
Backpropagation Neural Network model is used.The advantages of Back propagation
method are its simplicity and reasonable speed. The algorithm is designed,
tested and found to give optimum results.
