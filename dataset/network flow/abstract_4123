In this paper we investigate the convergence for the mean curvature flow of
closed submanifolds with arbitrary codimension in space forms. Particularly, we
prove that the mean curvature flow deforms a closed submanifold satisfying a
pinching condition in a hyperbolic space form to a round point in finite time.
