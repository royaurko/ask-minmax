We consider local leaders in random uncorrelated networks, i.e. nodes whose
degree is higher or equal than the degree of all of their neighbors. An
analytical expression is found for the probability of a node of degree $k$ to
be a local leader. This quantity is shown to exhibit a transition from a
situation where high degree nodes are local leaders to a situation where they
are not when the tail of the degree distribution behaves like the power-law
$\sim k^{-\gamma_c}$ with $\gamma_c=3$. Theoretical results are verified by
computer simulations and the importance of finite-size effects is discussed.
