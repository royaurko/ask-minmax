It is proposed that after the macroscopic fluctuation of energy density that
is responsible for inflation dies away, a class of microscopic fluctuations,
always present, survives to give the present day dark energy. This latter is
simply a reinterpretation of the causet mechanism of Ahmed, Dodelson, Green and
Sorkin, wherein the emergence of space is dropped but only energy
considerations are maintained. At postinflation times, energy is exchanged
between the "cisplanckian" cosmos and an unknown foam-like transplanckian
reservoir. Whereas during inflation, the energy flows only from the latter to
the former after inflation it fluctuates in sign thereby accounting for the
tiny effective cosmological constant that seems to account for dark energy.
