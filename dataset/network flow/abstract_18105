A rectangular enclosure has such an even distribution of resonances that it
can be accurately and efficiently modelled using a feedback delay network.
Conversely, a non rectangular shape such as a sphere has a distribution of
resonances that challenges the construction of an efficient model. This work
proposes an extension of the already known feedback delay network structure to
model the resonant properties of a sphere. A specific frequency distribution of
resonances can be approximated, up to a certain frequency, by inserting an
allpass filter of moderate order after each delay line of a feedback delay
network. The structure used for rectangular boxes is therefore augmented with a
set of allpass filters allowing parametric control over the enclosure size and
the boundary properties. This work was motivated by informal listening tests
which have shown that it is possible to identify a basic shape just from the
distribution of its audible resonances.
