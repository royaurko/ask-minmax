Results from Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional gauge glass
supporting a zero-temperature transition are presented. A finite-size scaling
analysis of the correlation length shows that the system does not exhibit
spin-glass order at finite temperatures. These results are compared to earlier
claims of a finite-temperature transition.
