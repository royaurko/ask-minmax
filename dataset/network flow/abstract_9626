Wireless Sensor Network(WSN) is an emerging technology and explored field of
researchers worldwide in the past few years, so does the need for effective
security mechanisms. The sensing technology combined with processing power and
wireless communication makes it lucrative for being exploited in abundance in
future. The inclusion of wireless communication technology also incurs various
types of security threats due to unattended installation of sensor nodes as
sensor networks may interact with sensitive data and /or operate in hostile
unattended environments. These security concerns be addressed from the
beginning of the system design. The intent of this paper is to investigate the
security related issues in wireless sensor networks. In this paper we have
explored general security threats in wireless sensor network with extensive
study.
