This paper presents methods to compare high order networks using persistent
homology. High order networks are weighted complete hypergraphs collecting
relationship functions between elements of tuples. They can be considered as
generalizations of conventional networks where only relationship functions
between pairs are defined. Valid metric distances between high order networks
have been defined but they are inherently difficult to compute when the number
of nodes is large. We relate high order networks to the filtrations of
simplicial complexes and show that the difference between networks can be lower
bounded by the difference between the homological features of their respective
filtrations. Practical implications are explored by comparing the cocontributorship
networks of engineering and mathematics academic journals. The lower bounds
succeed in discriminating engineering communities from mathematics communities
and in differentiating engineering communities with different research
interests.
