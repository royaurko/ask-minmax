We introduce darkons as fluid particles of a Galilean massless
self-gravitating fluid. This fluid exhibits anisotropic scaling with $z=5/3$.
The minimal gravitational coupling dynamically generates a gravitational mass
density of either sign. Hence such fluid may serve as a model for the dark
sector of the Universe. Its cosmological solutions give a deceleration phase
for the early Universe and an acceleration phase for the late Universe. Will
the steady flow solutions lead to a confining potential and so a possible model
for halos?
