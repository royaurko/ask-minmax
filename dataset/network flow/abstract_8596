An intuitive overview of the scalability of a variety of types of wireless
networks is presented. Simple heuris- tic arguments are demonstrated here for
scaling laws presented in other works, as well as for conditions not previously
considered in the literature. Unicast and multicast messages, topology,
hierarchy, and e?ects of reliability protocols are discussed. We show how two
key factors, bottlenecks and erasures, can often domi- nate the network scaling
behavior. Scaling of through- put or delay with the number of transmitting
nodes, the number of receiving nodes, and the ?le size is described.
