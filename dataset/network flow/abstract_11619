We study a model for a random walk of two classes of particles (A and B).
Where both species are present in the same site, the motion of A's takes
precedence over that of B's. The model was originally proposed and analyzed in
Maragakis et al., Phys. Rev. E 77, 020103 (2008); here we provide additional
results. We solve analytically the diffusion coefficients of the two species in
lattices for a number of protocols. In networks, we find that the probability
of a B particle to be free decreases exponentially with the node degree. In
scale-free networks, this leads to localization of the B's at the hubs and
arrest of their motion. To remedy this, we investigate several strategies to
avoid trapping of the B's: moving an A instead of the hindered B; allowing a
trapped B to hop with a small probability; biased walk towards non-hub nodes;
and limiting the capacity of nodes. We obtain analytic results for lattices and
networks, and discuss the advantages and shortcomings of the possible
strategies.
