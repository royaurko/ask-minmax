We view the folding of RNA-sequences as a map that assigns a pattern of base
pairings to each sequence, known as secondary structure. These preimages can be
constructed as random graphs (i.e. the neutral networks associated to the
structure $s$). By interpreting the secondary structure as biological
information we can formulate the so called Error Threshold of Shapes as an
extension of Eigen's et al. concept of an error threshold in the single peak
landscape. Analogue to the approach of Derrida & Peliti for a of the population
on the neutral network. On the one hand this model of a single shape landscape
allows the derivation of analytical results, on the other hand the concept
gives rise to study various scenarios by means of simulations, e.g. the
interaction of two different networks. It turns out that the intersection of
two sets of compatible sequences (with respect to the pair of secondary
structures) plays a key role in the search for ''fitter'' secondary structures.
