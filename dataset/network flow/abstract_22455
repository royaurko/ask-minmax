We address the heat flow study starting from microscopic models of matter: we
develop an approach and investigate some anharmonic graded mass crystals, with
weak interparticle interactions. We calculate the thermal conductivity, and
show the existence of rectification and negative differential thermal
resistance. Our formalism allows us to understand the mechanism behind the
phenomena, and shows that the properties of graded materials make them genuine
thermal diodes.
