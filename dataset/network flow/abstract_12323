The rise and fall of online social networks has recently generated an
enormous amount of interest among people, both inside and outside of academia.
Gillette [Businessweek magazine, 2011] did a detailed analysis of MySpace,
which started losing its popularity since 2008. Recently, Cannarella and
Spechler [arXiv:1401.4208] used a model of disease spread to explain this rise
and fall of MySpace. In this paper, we give an alternative explanation for the
same. Our explanation is based on the well-known Barabasi-Albert model of
generating random scale-free networks using preferential attachment mechanism.
