Prediction and control of the dynamics of complex networks is a central
problem in network science. Structural and dynamical similarities of different
real networks suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the
dynamics of these networks, albeit the nature and common origin of such laws
remain elusive. Here we show that the causal network representing the
large-scale structure of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law
graph with strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the
Internet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural
similarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the
large-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. This
equivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the dynamics of
complex networks and spacetime in the universe, with implications to network
science and cosmology.
