Collaboration networks are studied as an example of growing bipartite
networks. These have been previously observed to have structure such as
positive correlations between nearest-neighbour degrees. However, a detailed
understanding of the origin of this phenomenon and the growth dynamics is
lacking. Both of these are analyzed empirically and simulated using various
models. A new one is presented, incorporating empirically necessary ingredients
such as bipartiteness and sublinear preferential attachment. This, and a
recently proposed model of team assembly both agree roughly with some empirical
observations and fail in several others.
