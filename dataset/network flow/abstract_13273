We analyze the operation of a molecular machine driven by the non-adiabatic
variation of external parameters. We derive a formula for the integrated flow
from one configuration to another, obtain a "no-pumping theorem" for cyclic
processes with thermally activated transitions, and show that in the adiabatic
limit the pumped current is given by a geometric expression.
