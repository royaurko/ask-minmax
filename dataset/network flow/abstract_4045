This paper presents results of elliptic flow measurements at moderate high
transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions using the STAR detector at RHIC.
Sizable $v_{2}$ is found up to 7 GeV/c in transverse momentum. Non-flow effects
are discussed comparing correlations in p+p collisions and Au+Au collisions.
$v_{2}$ from two-, four- and six-particle cumulant are shown and discussed.
