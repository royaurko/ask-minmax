These are notes prepared for presentation at the workshop "Challenges in
Granular Matter" at the Abdus Salam Institute for Theoretical Physics, Trieste,
August 2001. Revisions and figures will be added at a later date.
  Many features of real granular fluids under rapid flow are replicated by a
system of smooth hard spheres with inelastic collisions. For such a system, it
is tempting to apply standard methods of kinetic theory and hydrodynamics to
calculate properties of interest. The domain of validity for such methods is a
priori uncertain due to the inelasticity, but recent systemmatic studies
continue to support the utility of kinetic theory and hydrodynamics as both
qualitative and quantitative descriptions for many physical states. The current
status of kinetic theory and hydrodynamics is reviewed and interpreted, with
the optimistic conclusion that much existing phenomenology can be placed on
firm grounds for further understanding of complex states observed in rapid
granular flow.
