In this paper, we investigate the delay-throughput trade-offs in mobile
ad-hoc networks under two-dimensional i.i.d. mobility models. We consider two
mobility time-scales: (i) Fast mobility where node mobility is at the same
time-scale as data transmissions; (ii) Slow mobility where node mobility is
assumed to occur at a much slower time-scale than data transmissions. Given a
delay constraint $D,$ the main results are as follows: (1) For the
two-dimensional i.i.d. mobility model with fast mobiles, the maximum throughput
per source-destination (S-D) pair is shown to be $O(\sqrt{D/n}),$ where $n$ is
the number of mobiles. (2) For the two-dimensional i.i.d. mobility model with
slow mobiles, the maximum throughput per S-D pair is shown to be
$O(\sqrt[3]{D/n}).$ (3) For each case, we propose a joint coding-scheduling
algorithm to achieve the optimal delay-throughput trade-offs.
