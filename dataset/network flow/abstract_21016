One of the aims of systems biology is to build multiple layered and multiple
scale models of living systems which can efficiently describe phenomena
occurring at various level of resolution. Such models should consist of layers
of various microsystems interconnected by a network of pathways, to form a
macrosystem in a consistent way; that is, the observable characteristics of the
macrosystem should be, at least asymptotically, derivable by aggregation of the
appropriate features of the microsystems forming it, and from the properties of
the network. In this paper we consider a general macromodel describing a
population consisting of several interacting with each other subgroups, with
the rules of interactions given by a system of ordinary differential equations,
and we construct two different micromodels whose aggregated dynamics is
approximately the same as that of the original macromodel. The micromodels
offer a more detailed description of the original macromodel's dynamics by
considering an internal structure of each subgroup. Here, each subgroup is
represented by an edge of a graph with diffusion or transport occurring along
it, while the interactions between the edges are described by interface
conditions at the nodes joining them. We prove that with an appropriate scaling
of such models, roughly speaking, with fast diffusion or transport combined
with slow exchange at the nodes, the solutions of the micromodels are close to
the solution to the macromodel.
