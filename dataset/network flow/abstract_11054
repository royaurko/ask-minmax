In the control system of the JAERI-KEK joint project (High Intensity Proton
Accelerator Facility), it is planned to employ network-based controllers such
as PLC's and measurement stations instead of using other field control
networks, since the network hardware and software can be standardized and they
have been successfully utilized in other accelerator control systems in KEK.
  EPICS software support for those controllers was designed paying special
attention to robustness and has been implemented and applied for the
accelerator test stand. Basic functionalities were confirmed and miscellaneous
functions such as diagnosis of the software itself would be added.
  Since many kinds of network-based equipment such as oscilloscopes have become
available recently, they are considered to be integrated as well. They may
enable more manageable controllers.
