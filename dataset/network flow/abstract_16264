Young massive stars in the center of crowded star clusters are expected to
undergo close dynamical encounters that could lead to energetic, explosive
events. However, there has so far never been clear observational evidence of
such a remarkable phenomenon. We here report new interferometric observations
made with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) that indicate the well known enigmatic
wide-angle outflow located in the Orion BN/KL star-forming region to have been
produced by such a violent explosion during the disruption of a massive young
stellar system, and that this was caused by a close dynamical interaction about
500 years ago. This outflow thus belongs to a totally different family of
molecular flows which is not related to the classical bipolar flows that are
generated by stars during their formation process. Our molecular data allow us
to create a 3D view of the debris flow and to link this directly to the well
known Orion H$_2$ "fingers" farther out
