Link and node failures are two common fundamental problems that affect
operational networks. Protection of communication networks against such
failures is essential for maintaining network reliability and performance.
Network protection codes (NPC) are proposed to protect operational networks
against link and node failures. Furthermore, encoding and decoding operations
of such codes are well developed over binary and finite fields. Finding network
topologies, practical scenarios, and limits on graphs applicable for NPC are of
interest. In this paper, we establish limits on network protection design. We
investigate several network graphs where NPC can be deployed using network
coding. Furthermore, we construct graphs with minimum number of edges suitable
for network protection codes deployment.
