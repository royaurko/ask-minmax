With the rapid development of Cloud computing technologies and wide adopt of
Cloud services and applications, QoS provisioning in Clouds becomes an
important research topic. In this paper, we propose an admission control
mechanism for Cloud computing. In particular we consider the high volume of
simultaneous requests for Cloud services and develop admission control for
aggregated traffic flows to address this challenge. By employ network calculus,
we determine effective bandwidth for aggregate flow, which is used for making
admission control decision. In order to improve network resource allocation
while achieving Cloud service QoS, we investigate the relationship between
effective bandwidth and equivalent capacity. We have also conducted extensive
experiments to evaluate performance of the proposed admission control
mechanism.
