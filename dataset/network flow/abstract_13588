We review different approaches to the problem of generating the observed
Hubble flow, whose discussion was pioneered by A.D. Sakharov. Extrapolating the
Cosmological Standard Model to the past makes it possible to determine physical
properties of and conditions in the early universe. We discuss a new
cosmogenesis paradigm based on studying geodesically complete geometries of
black/white holes with integrable singularities.
