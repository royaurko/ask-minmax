Statistical properties of binary complex networks are well understood and
recently many attempts have been made to extend this knowledge to weighted
ones. There is, however, a subtle difference between networks where weights are
continuos variables and those where they account for discrete, distinguishable
events, which we call multi-edge networks. In this work we face this problem
introducing multi-edge networks as graphs where multiple (distinguishable)
connections between nodes are considered. We develop a statistical mechanics
framework where it is possible to get information about the most relevant
observables given a large spectrum of linear and nonlinear constraints
including those depending both on the number of multi-edges per link and their
binary projection. The latter case is particularly interesting as we show that
binary projections can be understood from multi-edge processes. The
implications of these results are important as many real agent based problems
mapped onto graphs require of this treatment for a proper characterization of
its collective behavior.
