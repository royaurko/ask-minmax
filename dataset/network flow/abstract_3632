It is shown that step moving to meet solution flow can be unstable against
lateral perturbations. The instability of long-wavelength perturbations occurs
at values of the solution flow intensity less than some critical value
depending on the step velocity. At given intensity of the solution flow, the
instability comes at the step velocity exceeding a critical velocity. Decay of
short-wavelength fluctuations is conditioned by the line tension of the step.
The step moving along the solution flow is laterally stable at all values of
the step velocity and the intensity of the solution flow. The overlapping
diffusion field of the neighbour steps suppresses the lateral instability but
it gives an instability of the step train against doubling of the period, i.e.
neighbouring steps are attracted. The equidistant train moving to meet the
solution flow is stable against the period variations.
