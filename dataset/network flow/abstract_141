A jet of heavy fluid is injected upwards, at time $t=0$, into a lighter fluid
and reaches a maximum height at time $t=t_i$ and then flows back around the
upward flow. A similar flow situation occurs for a light fluid injected
downward into a heavy one. In this paper an exact analytical expression for
$t_i$ is derived. The expression remains valid for laminar and turbulent
buoyant jets with or without swirl.
