An important problem in gas dynamics simulation is to prevent the carbuncle,
a breakdown of discrete shock profiles. We show that for high Froude number,
this also occurs in shallow water simulations and give numerical evidence that
all cures developed for gas dynamics should also work in shallow water flows.
