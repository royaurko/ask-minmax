A hierarchy of mathematical models describing viscosity-stratified flow in a
Hele-Shaw cell is constructed. Numerical modelling of jet flow and development
of viscous fingers with the influence of the forces of inertia and friction is
carried out. One-dimensional multi-layer flows are studied. In the framework of
three-layer flow scheme the interpretation of the Saffman--Taylor instability
is given. A kinematic model of viscous fingering taking into account the
formation of the intermediate mixing layer is proposed. Comparison with
calculations on the basis of two-dimensional equations shows that this model
allows one to determine the velocity of propagation and the thickness of the
viscous fingers.
