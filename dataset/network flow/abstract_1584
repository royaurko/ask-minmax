We experimentally characterize the transverse vortex motion and observed some
striking features. We found large structures and peaks in the Hall resistance,
which can be attributed to the long-range inhomogeneous vortex flow present in
some phases of vortex dynamics. We further demonstrate the existence of a
moving vortex phase between the pinned phase (peak effect) and the field
induced normal state. The measurements were performed on NiZr2 based
superconducting glasses.
