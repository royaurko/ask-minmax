Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations have been conducted to investigate
turbulent transport in tokamak plasmas with rotational shear. At sufficiently
large flow shears, linear instabilities are suppressed, but transiently growing
modes drive subcritical turbulence whose amplitude increases with flow shear.
This leads to a local minimum in the heat flux, indicating an optimal E x B
shear value for plasma confinement. Local maxima in the momentum fluxes are
also observed, allowing for the possibility of bifurcations in the E x B shear.
The sensitive dependence of heat flux on temperature gradient is relaxed for
large flow shear values, with the critical temperature gradient increasing at
lower flow shear values. The turbulent Prandtl number is found to be largely
independent of temperature and flow gradients, with a value close to unity.
