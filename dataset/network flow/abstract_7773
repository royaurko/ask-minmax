Current status of dynamical modeling of relativistic heavy ion collisions and
hydrodynamic description of the quark gluon plasma is reported. We find the
hadronic rescattering effect plays an important role in interpretation of mass
splitting pattern in the differential elliptic flow data observed at RHIC. To
demonstrate this, we predict the elliptic flow parameter for phi mesons to
directly observe the flow just after hadronisation. We also discuss recent
applications of outputs from hydrodynamic calculations to J/psi suppression,
thermal photon radiation and heavy quark diffusion.
