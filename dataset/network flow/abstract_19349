Based on recent multiwavelength observations of the new X-ray nova XTE
J1118+480, we can place strong constraints on the geometry of the accretion
flow in which a low/hard state spectrum, characteristic of an accreting black
hole binary, is produced. We argue that the absence of any soft blackbody-like
component in the X-ray band implies the existence of an extended hot
optically-thin region, with the optically-thick cool disk truncated at some
radius R_{tr} > 55 R_{Schw}. We show that such a model can indeed reproduce the
main features of the observed spectrum: the relatively high optical to X-ray
ratio, the sharp downturn in the far UV band and the hard X-ray spectrum. The
absence of the disk blackbody component also underscores the requirement that
the seed photons for thermal Comptonization be produced locally in the hot
flow, e.g. via synchrotron radiation. We attribute the observed spectral break
at 2 keV to absorption in a warm, partially ionized gas.
