Wireless sensor networks are harshly restricted by storage capacity, energy
and computing power. So it is essential to design effective and energy aware
protocol in order to enhance the network lifetime. In this paper, a review on
routing protocol in WSNs is carried out which are classified as data-centric,
hierarchical and location based depending on the network structure. Then some
of the multipath routing protocols which are widely used in WSNs to improve
network performance are also discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of each
routing algorithm are discussed thereafter. Furthermore, this paper compares
and summarizes the performances of routing protocols.
