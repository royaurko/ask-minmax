This paper investigates the performance of open-loop multi-antenna
point-to-point links in ad hoc networks with slotted ALOHA medium access
control (MAC). We consider spatial multiplexing transmission with linear
maximum ratio combining and zero forcing receivers, as well as orthogonal space
time block coded transmission. New closed-form expressions are derived for the
outage probability, throughput and transmission capacity. Our results
demonstrate that both the best performing scheme and the optimum number of
transmit antennas depend on different network parameters, such as the node
intensity and the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio operating value. We
then compare the performance to a network consisting of single-antenna devices
and an idealized fully centrally coordinated MAC. These results show that
multi-antenna schemes with a simple decentralized slotted ALOHA MAC can
outperform even idealized single-antenna networks in various practical
scenarios.
