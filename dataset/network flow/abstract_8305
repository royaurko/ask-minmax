The inclusion of a macroscopic adaptive threshold is studied for the
retrieval dynamics of layered feedforward neural network models with synaptic
noise. It is shown that if the threshold is chosen appropriately as a function
of the cross-talk noise and of the activity of the stored patterns, adapting
itself automatically in the course of the recall process, an autonomous
functioning of the network is guaranteed.This self-control mechanism
considerably improves the quality of retrieval, in particular the storage
capacity, the basins of attraction and the mutual information content.
