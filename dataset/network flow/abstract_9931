Regular patterns of turbulent and laminar fluid motion arise in plane Couette
flow near the lowest Reynolds number for which turbulence can be sustained. We
study these patterns using an extension of the minimal flow unit approach to
simulations of channel flows pioneered by Jimenez and Moin. In our case,
computational domains are of minimal size in only two directions. The third
direction is taken to be large. Furthermore, the long direction can be tilted
at any prescribed angle to the streamwise direction. We report on different
patterned states observed as a function of Reynolds number, imposed tilt, and
length of the long direction. We compare our findings to observations in large
aspect-ratio experiments.
