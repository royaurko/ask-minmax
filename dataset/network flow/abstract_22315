Numerical simulations of the behavior of the osteonal structure are more and
more acute and an important parameter is the pressure of the bony fluid.
Haversian and Volkmann canals contain blood vessels that transport oxygen and
nutrients necessary for the cellular activity. The pressure in these vessels
must be taken into account. While it is possible to estimate the value of this
pressure, there is no information on the effect of the vessel wall that may
have in the transmission of pressure.
