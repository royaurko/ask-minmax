Critical infrastructure networks are a key ingredient of modern society. We
discuss a general method to spot the critical components of a critical
infrastructure network, i.e. the nodes and the links fundamental to the perfect
functioning of the network. Such nodes, and not the most connected ones, are
the targets to protect from terrorist attacks. The method, used as an
improvement analysis, can also help to better shape a planned expansion of the
network.
