Texture plays an important role in many image analysis applications. In this
paper, we give a performance evaluation of color texture classification by
performing wavelet scattering network in various color spaces. Experimental
results on the KTH_TIPS_COL database show that opponent RGB based wavelet
scattering network outperforms other color spaces. Therefore, when dealing with
the problem of color texture classification, opponent RGB based wavelet
scattering network is recommended.
