We consider the Taylor-Couette problem in an infinitely extended cylindrical
domain. There exist modulated front solutions which describe the spreading of
the stable Taylor vortices into the region of the unstable Couette flow. These
transient solutions have the form of a front-like envelope advancing in the
laboratory frame and leaving behind the stationary, spatially periodic Taylor
vortices. We prove the nonlinear stability of these solutions with respect to
small spatially localized perturbations.
