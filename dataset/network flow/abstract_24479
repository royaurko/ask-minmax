As the result of the high-temperature improper ferroelectric transition
occurring in YMnO3 and other hexagonal manganites a striking domain pattern was
observed: an emergence of six domains of alternating polarization from one
point in a vortex-like pattern. We derive the formation and distribution of the
domain-vortex network from a combinatorial analysis based on order-parameter
symmetry and lattice geometry. The analysis leads to stable vortex-like
configurations of the six domain states in the basal plane perpendicular to the
polarization and to fragmented vortices in planes parallel to the polarization.
The predictions are debated in the light of existing experimental and
theoretical work on the vortex domain state. The relation of the
symmetry-determined geomet- rical defects to the topological defects proposed
to describe the behavior of YMnO3 near the Curie temperature is discussed.
