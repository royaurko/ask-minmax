We reveal that under moderate shear stress (of the order of 0.1 Pa) red blood
cells present an oscillation of their inclination (swinging) superimposed to
the long-observed steady tanktreading (TT) motion. A model based on a fluid
ellipsoid surrounded by a visco-elastic membrane initially unstrained (shape
memory) predicts all observed features of the motion: an increase of both
swinging amplitude and period (1/2 the TT period) upon decreasing the shear
stress, a shear stress-triggered transition towards a narrow shear stress-range
intermittent regime of successive swinging and tumbling, and a pure tumbling
motion at lower shear stress-values.
