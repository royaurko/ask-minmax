We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to study flows of N=4 SYM to non-conformal
theories. The dual geometries can be seen as sourced by a Wigner's semicircle
distribution of D3 branes. We consider two cases, the first case corresponds to
a point in the Coulomb branch and the theory flows to a six dimensional
conformal field theory. In the second case a mass is introduced for a
hypermultiplet and the theory flows to a five dimensional conformal field
theory. We argue from the gravity and the field theory side that the low energy
theories correspond to the (2,0) theory in six dimensions and to a theory with
exceptional global symmetry $E_1$ in five dimensions.
