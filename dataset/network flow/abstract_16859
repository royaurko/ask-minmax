We present a double site-bond percolation model to account, on the one hand,
for the vascularization and/or resorption of biomaterial implant in bones and,
on the other hand, for its mechanical continuity. The transformation of the
implant into osseous material, and the dynamical formation/destruction of this
osseous material is accounted for by creation and destruction of links and
sites in two, entangled, networks. We identify the relevant parameters to
describe the implant and its evolution, and separate their biological or
chemical origin from their physical one. We classify the various phenomena in
the two regimes, percolating or non-percolating, of the networks. We present
first numerical results in two dimensions.
