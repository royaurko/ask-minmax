We propose a new measure to estimate the direction of information flux in
multivariate time series from complex systems. This measure, based on the slope
of the phase spectrum (Phase Slope Index) has invariance properties that are
important for applications in real physical or biological systems: (a) it is
strictly insensitive to mixtures of arbitrary independent sources, (b) it gives
meaningful results even if the phase spectrum is not linear, and (c) it
properly weights contributions from different frequencies. Simulations of a
class of coupled multivariate random data show that for truly unidirectional
information flow without additional noise contamination our measure detects the
correct direction as good as the standard Granger causality. For random
mixtures of independent sources Granger Causality erroneously yields highly
significant results whereas our measure correctly becomes non-significant. An
application of our novel method to EEG data (88 subjects in eyes-closed
condition) reveals a strikingly clear front-to-back information flow in the
vast majority of subjects and thus contributes to a better understanding of
information processing in the brain.
