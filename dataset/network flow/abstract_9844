We analyze the Ising model on a random surface with a boundary magnetic field
using matrix model techniques. We are able to exactly calculate the disk
amplitude, boundary magnetization and bulk magnetization in the presence of a
boundary field. The results of these calculations can be interpreted in terms
of renormalization group flow induced by the boundary operator. In the
continuum limit this RG flow corresponds to the flow from non-conformal to
conformal boundary conditions which has recently been studied in flat space
theories.
