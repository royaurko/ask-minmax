We consider the problem of deriving an explicit approximate solution of the
nonlinear power equations that describe a balanced power distribution network.
We give sufficient conditions for the existence of a practical solution to the
power flow equations, and we propose an approximation that is linear in the
active and reactive power demands of the PQ buses. For this approximation,
which is valid for generic power line impedances and grid topology, we derive a
bound on the approximation error as a function of the grid parameters. We
illustrate the quality of the approximation via simulations, we show how it can
also model the presence of voltage controlled (PV) buses, and we discuss how it
generalizes the DC power flow model to lossy networks.
