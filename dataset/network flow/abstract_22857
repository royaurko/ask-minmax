The formalism of state estimation and hidden Markov models (HMMs) can
simplify and clarify the discussion of stochastic thermodynamics in the
presence of feedback and measurement errors. After reviewing the basic
formalism, we use it to shed light on a recent discussion of phase transitions
in the optimized response of an information engine, for which measurement noise
serves as a control parameter. The HMM formalism also shows that the value of
additional information shows a maximum at intermediate signal-to-noise ratios.
Finally, we discuss how systems open to information flow can apparently violate
causality; the HMM formalism can quantify the performance gains due to such
violations.
