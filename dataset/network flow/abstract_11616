Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are often deployed in hostile environments,
which make such networks highly vulnerable and increase the risk of attacks
against this type of network. WSN comprise of large number of sensor nodes with
different hardware abilities and functions. Due to the limited memory resources
and energy constraints, complex security algorithms cannot be used in sensor
networks. Therefore, it is necessary to balance between the security level and
the associated energy consumption overhead to mitigate the security risks.
Hierarchical routing protocol is more energy-efficient than other routing
protocols in WSNs. Many secure cluster-based routing protocols have been
proposed in the literature to overcome these constraints. In this paper, we
discuss Secure Energy-Efficient Hierarchical Routing Protocols in WSNs and
compare them in terms of security, performance and efficiency. Security issues
for WSNs and their solutions are also discussed.
