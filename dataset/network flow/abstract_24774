The problem of RED-module mathematical model results verification, based on
GNS3 experimental stand, is discussed in this article. The experimental stand
consists of virtual Cisco router, traffic generator D-ITG and traffic receiver.
The process of construction of such stand is presented. Also, the interaction
between experimental stand and a computer of investigation in order to obtain
and analyze data from stand is revised. A stochastic model of the traffic
management RED type module was built. Verification of the model was carried out
on the NS-2 basis. However, we would like to conduct verification on a real
router. As a result was the task of designing an experimental stand. It was
decided to verify the clean RED algorithm based on Cisco router. For the
construction of the stand software package GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator)
was chosen. Thus, the purpose of the study is to build on the GNS3 basis a
virtual stand consisting of a Cisco router, a traffic generator and a receiver.
A traffic generator D-ITG (Distributed Internet Traffic Generator) is used as.
