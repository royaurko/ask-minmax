We propose simple model of colloidal sessile drop desiccation. The model
describes correctly both evolution of the phase boundary between sol and gel
inside such a drop and the final shape of the dried film (deposit). The model
is based on mass conservation and natural assumption that deposit (gel phase)
prevents flows and evaporation.
