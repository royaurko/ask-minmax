In the first part of this paper, we have studied solely the spectrum sharing
aspect of the above problem, and proposed algorithms for the CUs in the single
AP network to efficiently share the spectrum. In this second part of the paper,
we build upon our previous understanding of the single AP network, and
formulate the joint spectrum decision and spectrum sharing problem in a
multiple AP network into a non-cooperative game, in which the feasible strategy
of a player contains a discrete variable (the AP/spectrum decision) and a
continuous vector (the power allocation among multiple channels). The structure
of the game is hence very different from most non-cooperative spectrum
management game proposed in the literature. We provide characterization of the
Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this game, and present a set of novel algorithms that
allow the CUs to distributively and efficiently select the suitable AP and
share the channels with other CUs. Finally, we study the properties of the
proposed algorithms as well as their performance via extensive simulations.
