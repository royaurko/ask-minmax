In wireless sensor networks, an important issue of Geographic Routing is
local minimum problem, which is caused by hole that blocks the greedy
forwarding process. To avoid the long detour path, recent research focuses on
detecting the hole in advance, then the nodes located on the boundary of the
hole advertise the hole information to the nodes near the hole.
