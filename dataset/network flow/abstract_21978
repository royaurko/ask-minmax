An approach to master symmetries of lattice equations is proposed by the use
of discrete zero curvature equation. Its key is to generate non-isospectral
flows from the discrete spectral problem associated with a given lattice
equation. A Volterra-type lattice hierarchy and the Toda lattice hierarchy are
analyzed as two illustrative examples.
