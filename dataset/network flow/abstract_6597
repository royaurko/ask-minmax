Bipartite user-object networks are becoming increasingly popular in
representing user interaction data in a web or e-commerce environment. They
have certain characteristics and challenges that differentiates them from other
bipartite networks. This paper analyzes the properties of five real world
user-object networks. In all cases we found a heavy tail object degree
distribution with popular objects connecting together a large part of the users
causing significant edge inflation in the projected users network. We propose a
novel edge weighting strategy based on tf-idf and show that the new scheme
improves both the density and the quality of the community structure in the
projections. The improvement is also noticed when comparing to partially random
networks.
