The Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model is extended to include the concept of
local world and the microscopic event of adding edges. With probability $p$, we
add a new node with $m$ edges which preferentially link to the nodes presented
in the network; with probability $1-p$, we add $m$ edges among the present
nodes. A node is preferentially selected by its degree to add an edge randomly
among its neighbors. Using continuum theory and rate equation method we get the
analytical expressions of the power-law degree distribution with exponent
$\gamma=3$ and the clustering coefficient $c(k)\sim k^{-1}+c$. The analytical
expressions are in good agreement with the numerical calculations.
