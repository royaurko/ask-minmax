We consider a one-parameter family of closed, embedded hypersurfaces moving
with normal velocity $G_\kappa = \big ( \sum_{i < j}
\frac{1}{\lambda_i+\lambda_j-2\kappa} \big )^{-1}$, where $\lambda_1 \leq
\hdots \leq \lambda_n$ denote the curvature eigenvalues and $\kappa$ is a
nonnegative constant. This defines a fully nonlinear parabolic equation,
provided that $\lambda_1+\lambda_2>2\kappa$. For this flow, we establish a
cylindrical estimate, a convexity estimate, an estimate for the inscribed
radius, as well as a pointwise curvature derivative estimate. This allows us to
extend the flow beyond singularities by means of a surgery procedure. Our
results also apply to hypersurfaces in a Riemannian manifold. This is in sharp
contrast to mean curvature flow, which does not preserve two-convexity in the
Riemannian setting. Finally, our results extend to a more general class of
fully nonlinear curvature flows.
