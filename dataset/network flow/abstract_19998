We experimentally investigate the impact of a liquid jet on a soap film. We
observe that the jet never breaks the film and that two qualitatively different
steady regimes may occur. The first one is a refraction-like behavior obtained
at small incidence angles when the jet crosses the film and is deflected by the
film-jet interaction. For larger incidence angles, the jet is absorbed by the
film, giving rise to a new class of flow in which the jet undulates along the
film with a characteristic wavelength. Besides its fundamental interest, this
study presents a new way to guide a micro-metric flow of liquid in the inertial
regime and to probe foam stability submitted to violent perturbations at the
soap film scale.
