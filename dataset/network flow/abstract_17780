Basic aspects of the equiaffine geometry of level sets are developed
systematically. As an application there are constructed families of
$2n$-dimensional nondegenerate hypersurfaces ruled by $n$-planes, having
equiaffine mean curvature zero, and solving the affine normal flow. Each
carries a symplectic structure with respect to which the ruling is Lagrangian.
