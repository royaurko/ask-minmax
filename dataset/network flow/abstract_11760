Wireless sensor networks require communication protocols for efficiently
propagating data in a distributed fashion. The Trickle algorithm is a popular
protocol serving as the basis for many of the current standard communication
protocols. In this paper we develop a mathematical model describing how Trickle
propagates new data across a network consisting of nodes placed on a line. The
model is analyzed and asymptotic results on the hop count and end-to-end delay
distributions in terms of the Trickle parameters and network density are given.
Additionally, we show that by only a small modification of the Trickle
algorithm the expected end-to-end delay can be greatly decreased. Lastly, we
demonstrate how one can derive the exact hop count and end-to-end delay
distributions for small network sizes.
