We investigate the influence of boundary slip velocity in Newtonian fluids at
finite Reynolds numbers. Numerical simulations with Lattice Boltzmann method
(LBM) and Finite Differences method (FDM) are performed to quantify the effect
of heterogeneous boundary conditions on the integral and local properties of
the flow. Non linear effects are induced by the non homogeneity of the boundary
condition and change the symmetry properties of the flow inducing an overall
mean flow reduction. To explain the observed drag modification, reciprocal
relations for stationary ensembles are used, predicting a reduction of the mean
flow rate from the creeping flow to be proportional to the fourth power of the
friction Reynolds number. Both numerical schemes are then validated within the
theoretical predictions and reveal a pronounced numerical efficiency of the LBM
with respect to FDM.
