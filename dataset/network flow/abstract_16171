Granular materials react to shear stresses differently than do ordinary
fluids. Rather than deforming uniformly, materials such as dry sand or
cohesionless powders develop shear bands: narrow zones containing large
relative particle motion leaving adjacent regions essentially rigid[1,2,3,4,5].
Since shear bands mark areas of flow, material failure and energy dissipation,
they play a crucial role for many industrial, civil engineering and geophysical
processes[6]. They also appear in related contexts, such as in lubricating
fluids confined to ultra-thin molecular layers[7]. Detailed information on
motion within a shear band in a three-dimensional geometry, including the
degree of particle rotation and inter-particle slip, is lacking. Similarly,
only little is known about how properties of the individual grains - their
microstructure - affect movement in densely packed material[5]. Combining
magnetic resonance imaging, x-ray tomography, and high-speed video particle
tracking, we obtain the local steady-state particle velocity, rotation and
packing density for shear flow in a three-dimensional Couette geometry. We find
that key characteristics of the granular microstructure determine the shape of
the velocity profile.
