We find a family of holographic N=1 supersymmetric RG flows on M2 branes.
These flows are driven by two mass parameters from the maximally (N=8)
supersymmetric theory and the infra-red theory is controlled by two fixed
points, one with G_2 symmetry and the other with SU(3)xU(1) symmetry and N=2
supersymmetry. The generic flow, with unequal mass parameters, is N=1
supersymmetric but goes to the SU(3)xU(1) symmetric, N=2 supersymmetric fixed
point, where the masses are equal. The only flow that goes to the G_2 symmetric
point occurs when one of the mass parameters is set to zero. There is an N=1
supersymmetric flow from the G_2 symmetric point to the SU(3)xU(1) symmetric
point and supergravity gives a prediction of 1/\sqrt{6} for the anomalous
dimensions of the operators that drive this flow. We examine these flows from
the field theory perspective but find that one is limited to qualitative
results since N=1 supersymmetry in three dimensions is insufficient to protect
the form and dimensions of the operators involved in the flow.
