In this paper we show that living cells can multiplex biochemical signals,
i.e. transmit multiple signals through the same signaling pathway
simultaneously, and yet respond to them very specifically. We demonstrate how
two binary input signals can be encoded in the concentration of a common
signaling protein, which is then decoded such that each of the two output
signals provides reliable information about one corresponding input. Under
biologically relevant conditions the network can reach the maximum amount of
information that can be transmitted, which is 2 bits.
