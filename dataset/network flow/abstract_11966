Community detection in a complex network is an important problem of much
interest in recent years. In general, a community detection algorithm chooses
an objective function and captures the communities of the network by optimizing
the objective function, and then, one uses various heuristics to solve the
optimization problem to extract the interesting communities for the user. In
this article, we demonstrate the procedure to transform a graph into points of
a metric space and develop the methods of community detection with the help of
a metric defined for a pair of points. We have also studied and analyzed the
community structure of the network therein. The results obtained with our
approach are very competitive with most of the well-known algorithms in the
literature, and this is justified over the large collection of datasets. On the
other hand, it can be observed that time taken by our algorithm is quite less
compared to other methods and justifies the theoretical findings.
