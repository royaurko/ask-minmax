Water vortices are known to develop polygon structures inside their cores.
The apexes of the polygonal manifestations are the result of satellite vortices
attached to the parent vortex. Exploiting the analogy between the shallow water
hydraulics and the two-dimensional compressible gas flows we arrive to the
following line of reasoning concerning the spiral galactic structure. The
backward free surface fore ripples of the advancing pressure disturbance in the
hydraulic system should appear as high-density spirals in the gaseous galactic
disk. Since the number of galactic arms is equal to the number of satellite
eddies in the parent vortex, spiral galaxies with say two arms will possess two
nuclei. The last appears to be in complete agreement with the latest
observations regarding M 31 and Mrk 315 galaxies. If the present hypothesis is
accurate then a closer look at the central regions of multi-tentacle spiral
galaxies should also reveal that these have multiple nuclei.
