We demonstrate how three-dimensional fluid flow simulations can be carried
out on the Cellular Automata Machine 8 (CAM-8), a special-purpose computer for
cellular-automata computations. The principal algorithmic innovation is the use
of a lattice-gas model with a 16-bit collision operator that is specially
adapted to the machine architecture. It is shown how the collision rules can be
optimized to obtain a low viscosity of the fluid. Predictions of the viscosity
based on a Boltzmann approximation agree well with measurements of the
viscosity made on CAM-8. Several test simulations of flows in simple geometries
-- channels, pipes, and a cubic array of spheres -- are carried out.
Measurements of average flux in these geometries compare well with theoretical
predictions.
