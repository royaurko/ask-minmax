The conductance of thin films with diffusive surface scattering was solved
semi-classically by Fuchs and Sondheimer. However, when the intrinsic electron
mean free path is very large or infinite their conductance diverges. In this
letter a simple diffraction picture is presented. It yields a conductance which
corresponds to a limiting mean free path. PACS: 73.50.-h, 73.50.Bk, 73.23.-b,
