A new era in wireless sensor network technology has been ushered in through
the introduction of multimedia sensor networks, which has a major bottleneck in
the form of network congestion. Congestion occurs when resources are in high
demand during the active period while the data processing and transmission
speeds lag behind the speed of the incoming traffic. This may disrupt normal
network operations by buffer overflow, packet loss, increased latency,
excessive energy consumption and even worse, a collapse of the entire
operation. In this paper we propose a novel Trust Integrated Congestion-aware
Energy Efficient Routing algorithm (TCEER) in which the potential of a node is
computed using its trust value, congestion status, residual energy, distance
from the current packet-forwarding node and the distance from the base station
using a Fuzzy Logic Controller. The source node selects the node of highest
potential in its one hop radio range for data transmission. Hop by hop data
routing from source to base station is obtained which is light-weight as well
as energy-efficient. Finally, the merits of the proposed scheme are discussed
by comparing it with the existing protocols and the study shows promising
improvements in network performance.
