Detection and isolation of link failures under the Laplacian consensus
dynamics have been the focus of our previous study. Our results relate the
failure of links in the network to jump discontinuities in the derivatives of
the output responses of the nodes and exploit that relation to propose failure
detection and isolation (FDI) techniques, accordingly. In this work, we extend
the results to general linear networked dynamics. In particular, we show that
with additional niceties of the integrator networks and the enhanced proofs, we
are able to incorporate both unidirectional and bidirectional link failures. At
the next step, we extend the available FDI techniques to accommodate the cases
of bidirectional link failures and undirected topologies. Computer experiments
with large networks and both directed and undirected topologies provide
interesting insights as to the role of directionality, as well as the
scalability of the proposed FDI techniques with the network size.
