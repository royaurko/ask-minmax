We consider a class of optimal power flow (OPF) applications where some loads
offer a modulation service in exchange for an activation fee. These
applications can be modeled as multi-period formulations of the OPF with
discrete variables that define mixed-integer non-convex mathematical programs.
We propose two types of relaxations to tackle these problems. One is based on a
Lagrangian relaxation and the other is based on a network flow relaxation. Both
relaxations are tested on several benchmarks and, although they provide a
comparable dual bound, it appears that the constraints in the solutions derived
from the network flow relaxation are significantly less violated.
