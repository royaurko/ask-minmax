We have developed a simple method to construct local equilibrium function for
one dimensional lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). This new method can make LBM
model satisfy compressible flow with a flexible specific-heat ratio. Test
cases, including the one dimensional Sod flow and one dimensional Lax flow are
presented. Favorable results are obtained using proposed new method, indicating
that the proposed method is potentially capable of constructing of the local
equilibrium function for one dimensional LBM.
