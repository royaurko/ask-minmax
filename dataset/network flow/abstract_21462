We have studied the breakup and subsequent fluid flow in very thin films of
partially wetting liquid on solid substrates, using molecular dynamics
simulations. The liquid is made of short chain molecules interacting with
Lennard-Jones interactions, and the solid is modeled as a clean crystal lattice
whose atoms have thermal oscillations. Films below a critical thickness are
found to exhibit a spontaneous spinodal-like instability leading to dry
patches, as predicted theoretically and observed in some experiments. Liquid
withdrawing from a dry patch collects in a moving rim whose fluid dynamics is
only partially in agreement with earlier predictions.
