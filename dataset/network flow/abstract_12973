The interplay and competition of magnetic and superconducting correlations in
the weakly interacting two-dimensional Hubbard Model is investigated by means
of the functional renormalization group. At zero temperature the flow of
interactions in one-loop approximation evolves into a strong coupling regime at
low energy scales, signalling the possible onset of spontaneous symmetry
breaking. This is further analyzed by a mean-field treatment of the strong
renormalized interactions which takes into account magnetic and superconducting
order simultaneously. The effect of strong correlations on single-particle
properties in the normal phase is studied by calculating the flow of the
self-energy.
