It has been argued that high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions at the LHC
may exhibit collective phenomena usually studied in the context of heavy-ion
collisions, such as elliptic flow. We study this issue using DIPSY - a Monte
Carlo event generator based on the QCD dipole model. We calculate the
eccentricity of the transverse area defined by the spatial distribution of
produced gluons. The resulting elliptic flow is estimated to be about 6%,
comparable to the value in nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC.
Experimentally, elliptic flow is inferred from the azimuthal correlation
between hadrons, which receives contributions from collective flow, and from
various other effects referred to as "nonflow". We discuss how to identify in
experiments the signal of flow in the presence of large nonflow effects.
