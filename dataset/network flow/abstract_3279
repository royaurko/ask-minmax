We present numerically determined travelling-wave solutions for
pressure-driven flow through a straight duct with a square cross-section. This
family of solutions represents typical coherent structures (a staggered array
of counter-rotating streamwise vortices and an associated low-speed streak) on
each wall. Their streamwise average flow in the cross-sectional plane
corresponds to an eight vortex pattern much alike the secondary flow found in
the turbulent regime.
