On Archimedean lattices, the Ising model exhibits spontaneous ordering. Two
examples of these lattices of the majority-vote model with noise are considered
and studied through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The order/disorder phase
transition is observed in this system. The calculated values of the critical
noise parameter are q_c=0.091(2) and q_c=0.134(3) for (3,4,6,4) and (3^4,6)
Archimedean lattices, respectively. The critical exponents beta/nu, gamma/nu
and 1/nu for this model are 0.103(6), 1.596(54), 0.872(85) for (3,4,6,4) and
0.114(3), 1.632(35), 0.978(104) for (3^4,6) Archimedean lattices. These results
differs from the usual Ising model results and the majority-vote model on
so-far studied regular lattices or complex networks. The effective
dimensionality of the system [D_{eff}(3,4,6,4)=1.802(55) and
D_{eff}(3^4,6)=1.860(34)] for these networks are reasonably close to the
embedding dimension two.
