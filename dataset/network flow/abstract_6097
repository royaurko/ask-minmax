In this paper we present a model describing Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible
(SIS) type epidemics spreading on a dynamic contact network with random link
activation and deletion where link ac- tivation can be locally constrained. We
use and adapt a improved effective degree compartmental modelling framework
recently proposed by Lindquist et al. [J. Lindquist et al., J. Math Biol. 62,
2, 143 (2010)] and Marceau et al. [V. Marceau et al., Phys. Rev. E 82, 036116
(2010)]. The resulting set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is solved
numerically and results are compared to those obtained using individual-based
stochastic network simulation. We show that the ODEs display excellent
agreement with simulation for the evolution of both the disease and the
network, and is able to accurately capture the epidemic threshold for a wide
range of parameters. We also present an analytical R0 calculation for the
dynamic network model and show that depending on the relative timescales of the
network evolution and disease transmission two limiting cases are recovered:
(i) the static network case when network evolution is slow and (ii) homogeneous
random mixing when the network evolution is rapid. We also use our threshold
calculation to highlight the dangers of relying on local stability analysis
when predicting epidemic outbreaks on evolving networks.
