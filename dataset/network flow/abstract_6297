Stochastic network calculus is a theory for stochastic service guarantee
analysis of computer communication networks. In the current stochastic network
calculus literature, its traffic and server models are typically based on the
cumulative amount of traffic and cumulative amount of service respectively.
However, there are network scenarios where the applicability of such models is
limited, and hence new ways of modeling traffic and service are needed to
address this limitation. This paper presents time-domain models and results for
stochastic network calculus. Particularly, we define traffic models, which are
based on probabilistic lower-bounds on cumulative packet inter-arrival time,
and server models, which are based on probabilistic upper-bounds on cumulative
packet service time. In addition, examples demonstrating the use of the
proposed time-domain models are provided. On the basis of the proposed models,
the five basic properties of stochastic network calculus are also proved, which
implies broad applicability of the proposed time-domain approach.
