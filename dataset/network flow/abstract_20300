In this paper we mingle the Gaussian free field, the Schramm-Loewner
evolution and the KPZ relation in a natural way, shedding new light on all of
them. Our principal result shows that the level lines and the SLE$_\kappa$ flow
lines of the Gaussian free field do not satisfy the usual KPZ relation. In
order to prove this, we have to make a technical detour: by a careful study of
a certain diffusion process, we provide exact estimates of the exponential
moments of winding of chordal SLE curves conditioned to pass nearby a fixed
point. This extends previous results on winding of SLE curves by Schramm.
