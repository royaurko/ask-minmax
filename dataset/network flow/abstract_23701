Recently, great efforts have been dedicated to researches on the management
of large scale graph based data such as WWW, social networks, biological
networks. In the study of graph based data management, node disjoint subgraph
homeomorphism relation between graphs is more suitable than (sub)graph
isomorphism in many cases, especially in those cases that node skipping and
node mismatching are allowed. However, no efficient node disjoint subgraph
homeomorphism determination (ndSHD) algorithms have been available. In this
paper, we propose two computationally efficient ndSHD algorithms based on state
spaces searching with backtracking, which employ many heuristics to prune the
search spaces. Experimental results on synthetic data sets show that the
proposed algorithms are efficient, require relative little time in most of the
testing cases, can scale to large or dense graphs, and can accommodate to more
complex fuzzy matching cases.
