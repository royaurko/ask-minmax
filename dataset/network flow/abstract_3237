The solution of problem on distribution of static head along the pipe flowing
element is submitted. The solution is reached on the basis of consideration of
contact interaction of gas and liquid stream with the wall of the pipe flowing
element. The expression for distribution of static head along the pipe flowing
element is obtained on the basis of usage of three fundamental laws in fluid
dynamics: Torricelli formula, Weissbach-Darcy formula and Bernoulli equation.
The general solution is obtained for a gas stream. The special case of the
obtained solution is retrieved for liquid stream.
