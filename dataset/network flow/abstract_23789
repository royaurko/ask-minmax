This paper introduces a robust point-to-point transmission scheme: Tetrys,
that relies on a novel on-the-fly erasure coding concept which reduces the
delay for recovering lost data at the receiver side. In current erasure coding
schemes, the packets that are not rebuilt at the receiver side are either lost
or delayed by at least one RTT before transmission to the application. The
present contribution aims at demonstrating that Tetrys coding scheme can fill
the gap between real-time applications requirements and full reliability.
Indeed, we show that in several cases, Tetrys can recover lost packets below
one RTT over lossy and best-effort networks. We also show that Tetrys allows to
enable full reliability without delay compromise and as a result: significantly
improves the performance of time constrained applications. For instance, our
evaluations present that video-conferencing applications obtain a PSNR gain up
to 7dB compared to classic block-based erasure codes.
