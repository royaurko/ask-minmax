There are relatively few observations of UV emission during the impulsive
phases of solar flares, so the nature of that emission is poorly known. Photons
produced by solar flares can resonantly scatter off atoms and ions in the
corona. Based on off-limb measurements by SOHO/UVCS, we derive the O VI
$\lambda$1032 luminosities for 29 flares during the impulsive phase and the
Ly$\alpha$ luminosities of 5 flares, and we compare them with X-ray
luminosities from GOES measurements. The upper transition region and lower
transition region luminosities of the events observed are comparable. They are
also comparable to the luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas at the beginning of
the flare, but after 10-15 minutes the X-ray luminosity usually dominates. In
some cases we can use Doppler dimming to estimate flow speeds of the O VI
emitting gas, and 5 events show speeds in the 40 to 80 $\rm km s^{-1}$ range.
The O VI emission could originate in gas evaporating to fill the X-ray flare
loops, in heated chromospheric gas at the footpoints, or in heated prominence
material in the coronal mass ejection. All three sources may contribute in
different events or even in a single event, and the relative timing of UV and
X-ray brightness peaks, the flow speeds, and the total O VI luminosity favor
each source in one or more events.
