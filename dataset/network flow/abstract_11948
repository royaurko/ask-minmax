Presently, there are not many literatures on the characterization of
reputation and trust in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) which can be referenced
by scientists, researchers and students. Although some research documents
include information on reputation and trust, characterization of these features
are not adequately covered. In this paper, reputation and trust are divided
into various classes or categories and a method of referencing the information
is provided. This method used results in providing researchers with a tool that
makes it easier to reference these features on reputation and trust in a much
easier way than if referencing has to be directed to several uncoordinated
resources. Although the outcome of this work proves beneficial to research in
the characterization of reputation and trust in WSNs, more work needs to be
done in extending the benefits to other network systems.
