In this paper we consider the training of single hidden layer neural networks
by pseudoinversion, which, in spite of its popularity, is sometimes affected by
numerical instability issues. Regularization is known to be effective in such
cases, so that we introduce, in the framework of Tikhonov regularization, a
matricial reformulation of the problem which allows us to use the condition
number as a diagnostic tool for identification of instability. By imposing
well-conditioning requirements on the relevant matrices, our theoretical
analysis allows the identification of an optimal value for the regularization
parameter from the standpoint of stability. We compare with the value derived
by cross-validation for overfitting control and optimisation of the
generalization performance. We test our method for both regression and
classification tasks. The proposed method is quite effective in terms of
predictivity, often with some improvement on performance with respect to the
reference cases considered. This approach, due to analytical determination of
the regularization parameter, dramatically reduces the computational load
required by many other techniques.
