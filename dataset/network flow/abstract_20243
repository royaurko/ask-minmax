In this article, we study the axisymmetric surface diffusion flow (ASD), a
fourth-order geometric evolution law. In particular, we prove that ASD
generates a real analytic semiflow in the space of (2 + \alpha)-little-H\"older
regular surfaces of revolution embedded in R^3 and satisfying periodic boundary
conditions. We also give conditions for global existence of solutions and prove
that solutions are real analytic in time and space. Further, we investigate the
geometric properties of solutions to ASD. Utilizing a connection to
axisymmetric surfaces with constant mean curvature, we characterize the
equilibria of ASD. Then, focusing on the family of cylinders, we establish
results regarding stability, instability and bifurcation behavior, with the
radius acting as a bifurcation parameter for the problem.
