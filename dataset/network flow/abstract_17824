We investigate a prototypical agent-based model, the Naming Game, on random
geometric networks. The Naming Game is a minimal model, employing local
communications that captures the emergence of shared communication schemes
(languages) in a population of autonomous semiotic agents. Implementing the
Naming Games on random geometric graphs, local communications being local
broadcasts, serves as a model for agreement dynamics in large-scale,
autonomously operating wireless sensor networks. Further, it captures essential
features of the scaling properties of the agreement process for
spatially-embedded autonomous agents. We also present results for the case when
a small density of long-range communication links are added on top of the
random geometric graph, resulting in a "small-world"-like network and yielding
a significantly reduced time to reach global agreement.
