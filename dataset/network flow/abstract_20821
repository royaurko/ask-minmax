For realistic scale-free networks, we investigate the traffic properties of
stochastic routing inspired by a zero-range process known in statistical
physics. By parameters $\alpha$ and $\delta$, this model controls
degree-dependent hopping of packets and forwarding of packets with higher
performance at more busy nodes. Through a theoretical analysis and numerical
simulations, we derive the condition for the concentration of packets at a few
hubs. In particular, we show that the optimal $\alpha$ and $\delta$ are
involved in the trade-off between a detour path for $\alpha < 0$ and long wait
at hubs for $\alpha > 0$; In the low-performance regime at a small $\delta$,
the wandering path for $\alpha < 0$ better reduces the mean travel time of a
packet with high reachability. Although, in the high-performance regime at a
large $\delta$, the difference between $\alpha > 0$ and $\alpha < 0$ is small,
neither the wandering long path with short wait trapped at nodes ($\alpha =
-1$), nor the short hopping path with long wait trapped at hubs ($\alpha = 1$)
is advisable. A uniformly random walk ($\alpha = 0$) yields slightly better
performance. We also discuss the congestion phenomena in a more complicated
situation with packet generation at each time step.
