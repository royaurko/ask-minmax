We track the trajectories of individual horocycles on the modular surface.
Our tracking is constructive, and we thus \emph{effectively} establish
topological transitivity and even line-transitivity for the horocyclic flow. We
also describe homotopy class jumps that occur under continuous deformation of
horocycles.
