In a recent study [DutykhDias2007] we presented a novel visco-potential free
surface flows formulation. The governing equations contain local and nonlocal
dissipative terms. From physical point of view, local dissipation terms come
from molecular viscosity but in practical computations, rather eddy viscosity
should be used. On the other hand, nonlocal dissipative term represents a
correction due to the presence of a bottom boundary layer. Using the standard
procedure of Boussinesq equations derivation, we come to nonlocal long wave
equations. In this article we analyse dispersion relation properties of
proposed models. The effect of nonlocal term on solitary and linear progressive
waves attenuation is investigated. Finally, we present some computations with
viscous Boussinesq equations solved by a Fourier type spectral method.
