We study a discrete-to-continuous Gamma-limit of a family of high-contrast
double porosity type functionals defined on a scaled integer lattice. Under
periodicity and p-growth conditions we prove the homogenization result and
describe the structure of the limit functional. Also, we study the convergence
of the corresponding gradient flow.
