Inspired by the structure of technological networks, we discuss network
evolution mechanisms which give rise to topological properties found in real
spatial networks. Thus, the peculiar structure of transport and distribution
networks is fundamentally determined by two factors. These are the dependence
of the spatial interaction range of vertices on the vertex attractiveness (or
importance within the network) and on the inhomogeneous distribution of
vertices in space. We propose and analyse numerically a simple model based on
these generating mechanisms which seems, for instance, to be able to reproduce
known structural features of the Internet.
