Extending the results of a previous paper, we consider boundary conditions
for spinor fields and other fields of non-zero spin in the AdS/CFT
correspondence. We calculate the RG-flow induced by double trace perturbations
dual to bulk spinor fields. For spinors there is a half-unit shift in the
central charge in running from the UV to the IR, in accordance with the
c-theorem.
