We propose that femto scale QCD analogs of Fullerene type excitations may
exist with ``magic numbers'' 8,24,48, and 120. These ``J-balls'' are the most
symmetrical closed networks of gluonic baryon junctions and anti-junctions with
zero net baryon number. CP odd J-Moebii and other femto-tubes and tori gluonic
structures may also exist. We estimate the relative binding energies and
discuss possible experimental signatures of the formation of these new
topological gluonic states.
