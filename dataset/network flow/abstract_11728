In this article, we investigate the structure of Croatian linguistic
co-occurrence networks. We examine the change of network structure properties
by systematically varying the co-occurrence window sizes, the corpus sizes and
removing stopwords. In a co-occurrence window of size $n$ we establish a link
between the current word and $n-1$ subsequent words. The results point out that
the increase of the co-occurrence window size is followed by a decrease in
diameter, average path shortening and expectedly condensing the average
clustering coefficient. The same can be noticed for the removal of the
stopwords. Finally, since the size of texts is reflected in the network
properties, our results suggest that the corpus influence can be reduced by
increasing the co-occurrence window size.
