We establish heavy traffic limit theorems for queue-length processes in
critically loaded single class queueing networks with state dependent arrival
and service rates. A distinguishing feature of our model is non-Markovian state
dependence. The limit stochastic process is a continuous-path reflected process
on the nonnegative orthant. We give an application to generalised Jackson
networks with state-dependent rates.
