Mixed harmonic charge dependent azimuthal correlations at mid-rapidity in
Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV were measured with the ALICE
detector at the LHC. A clear charge dependence for a series of correlations is
observed both via the multi-particle cumulant and the event plane methods.
Implications from these measurements for the possible effects of the local
parity violation in QCD and for models which incorporate the azimuthal
anisotropic flow and the local charge conservation on the kinetic freeze-out
surface are discussed.
