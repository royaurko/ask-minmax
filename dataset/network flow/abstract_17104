Which thinkers are we guided by? A novel "Thought Leader Map" shows the
select group of people with real influence who are setting the trends in the
market for ideas. The influencers in philosophy, sociology, economics, and the
"hard sciences" have been identified by a Delphi process, asking 50 thought
leaders to name their peers. The importance of the influencers is calculated by
constructing a co-occurrence network in the Blogosphere. Our main insight is
that the era of the great contributorities seems to be over. Major thought leaders
are rare - the picture is composed of many specialists.
