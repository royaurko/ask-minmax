Recent numerical simulations have shown long-lived axisymmetric sub- and
super-Keplerian flows in protoplanetary disks. These zonal flows are found in
local as well as global simulations of disks unstable to the magnetorotational
instability. This paper covers our study of the strength and lifetime of zonal
flows and the resulting long-lived gas over- and underdensities as functions of
the azimuthal and radial size of the local shearing box. We further investigate
dust particle concentrations without feedback on the gas and without
self-gravity. Strength and lifetime of zonal flows increase with the radial
extent of the simulation box, but decrease with the azimuthal box size. Our
simulations support earlier results that zonal flows have a natural radial
length scale of 5-7 gas pressure scale heights. This is the first study that
combines three-dimensional MHD simulations of zonal flows and dust particles
feeling the gas pressure. The pressure bumps trap particles with $\textrm{St} =
1$ very efficiently. We show that $\textrm{St} = 0.1$ particles (of some
centimeters in size if at $5\textrm{AU}$ in an MMSN) reach a hundred-fold
higher density than initially. This opens the path for particles of
$\textrm{St} = 0.1$ and dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01 or for particles of
$\textrm{St} \geq 0.5$ and dust-to-gas ratio $10^{-4}$ to still reach densities
that potentially trigger the streaming instability and thus gravoturbulent
formation of planetesimals.
