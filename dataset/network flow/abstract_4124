We define a class of geometric flows on a complete K\"ahler manifold to unify
some physical and mechanical models such as the motion equations of vortex
filament, complex-valued mKdV equations, derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equations etc. Furthermore, we consider the existence for these flows from
$S^1$ into a complete K\"ahler manifold and prove some local and global
existence results.
