In the past decade, significant research has been carried out for realizing
intelligent network routing using advertisement, position and near-optimum node
selection schemes. In this paper, a grade-based two-level node selection method
along with genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for realizing an efficient
routing scheme. This method assumes that the nodes are intelligent and that
there exists a knowledge base about the environment in their local memory.
There are two levels for approaching the effective route selection process
through grading. At the first level, grade-based selection is applied and at
the second level, the optimum path is explored using GA. The simulation has
been carried out on different topological structures, and a significant
reduction in time is achieved for determining the optimal path through this
method compared to the non-graded networks.
