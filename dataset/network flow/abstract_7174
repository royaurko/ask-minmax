In this paper we propose distributed flooding-based storage algorithms for
large-scale wireless sensor networks. Assume a wireless sensor network with $n$
nodes that have limited power, memory, and bandwidth. Each node is capable of
both sensing and storing data. Such sensor nodes might disappear from the
network due to failures or battery depletion. Hence it is desired to design
efficient schemes to collect data from these $n$ nodes. We propose two
distributed storage algorithms (DSA's) that utilize network flooding to solve
this problem. In the first algorithm, DSA-I, we assume that every node utilizes
network flooding to disseminate its data throughout the network using a mixing
time of approximately O(n). We show that this algorithm is efficient in terms
of the encoding and decoding operations. In the second algorithm, DSA-II, we
assume that the total number of nodes is not known to every sensor; hence
dissemination of the data does not depend on $n$. The encoding operations in
this case take $O(C\mu^2)$, where $\mu$ is the mean degree of the network graph
and $C$ is a system parameter. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithms through analysis and simulation, and show that their performance
matches the derived theoretical results.
