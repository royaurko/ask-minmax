This research aims at using vehicular ad-hoc networks as infra-structure for
an urban cyber-physical system in order to gather data about a city. In this
scenario, all nodes are data sources and there is a gateway as ultimate
destination for all packets. Because of the volatility of the network
connections and uncertainty of actual node placement, we argue that a
broadcast-based protocol is the most adequate solution, despite the high
overhead. The Urban Data Collector (UDC) protocol has been proposed which uses
a distributed election of the forwarding node among the nodes receiving the
packet: nodes that are nearer to the gateway have shorter timers and a higher
forwarding probabilities. The performance of the UDC protocol has been
evaluated with different suppression levels in terms of the amount of collected
data from each road segment using NS-3, and our results show that UDC can
achieve significantly higher sensing accuracy than to other broadcast-based
protocols.
