Modularity is one of the most prominent properties of real-world complex
networks. Here, we address the issue of module identification in two important
classes of networks: bipartite networks and directed unipartite networks. Nodes
in bipartite networks are divided into two non-overlapping sets, and the links
must have one end node from each set. Directed unipartite networks only have
one type of nodes, but links have an origin and an end. We show that directed
unipartite networks can be conviniently represented as bipartite networks for
module identification purposes. We report a novel approach especially suited
for module detection in bipartite networks, and define a set of random networks
that enable us to validate the new approach.
