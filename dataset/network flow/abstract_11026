On the base of recently proposed three-stage quantitative neural network
model of the tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomenon a possibility to occur of TOT
states coursed by neural network interneuron links' disruption has been
studied. Using a numerical example it was found that TOTs coursed by interneron
links' disruption are in (1.5 + - 0.3)x1000 times less probable then those
coursed by irrelevant (incomplete) neural network localization. It was shown
that delayed TOT states' etiology cannot be related to neural network
interneuron links' disruption.
