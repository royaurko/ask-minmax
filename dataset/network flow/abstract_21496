We study single-chain motion in semidilute solutions of polymers of length N
= 1000 with excluded-volume and hydrodynamic interactions by a novel algorithm.
The crossover length of the transition from Zimm (short lengths and times) to
Rouse dynamics (larger scales) is proportional to the static screening length.
The crossover time is the corresponding Zimm time. Our data indicate Zimm
behavior at large lengths but short times. There is no hydrodynamic screening
until the chains feel constraints, after which they resist the flow:
"Incomplete screening" occurs in the time domain.
