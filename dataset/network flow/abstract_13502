We briefly discuss the recent developments in causal dissipative hydrodynamic
for relativistic heavy ion collisions. Phenomenological estimate of QGP
viscosity over entropy ratio from several experimental data, e.g. STAR's $\phi$
meson data, centrality dependence of elliptic flow, universal scaling elliptic
flow etc. are discussed. QGP viscosity, extracted from hydrodynamical model
analysis can have very large systematic uncertainty due to uncertain initial
conditions.
