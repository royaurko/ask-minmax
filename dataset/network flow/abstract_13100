In this note, we construct families of functionals of the type of
$\mathcal{F}$-functional and $\mathcal{W}$-functional of Perelman. We prove
that these new functionals are nondecreasing under the Ricci flow. As
applications, we give a proof of the theorem that compact steady Ricci
breathers must be Ricci-flat. Using these new functionals, we also give a new
proof of Perelman's no non-trivial expanding breather theorem. Furthermore, we
prove that compact expanding Ricci breathers must be Einstein by a direct
method. In this note, we also extend X. Cao's methods of eigenvalues\cite{C}
and improve their results.
