The authors present a randomized maximum-flow algorithm, called the PLED (prudent linking excess diminishing) algorithm, whose expected running time is O ( nm + n 2 (log n ) 3 ); this is O ( nm ) for all except relatively sparse networks. The algorithm is always correct, and in the worst case, which occurs with negligible probability, it take O ( nm log n ) time. The approach taken is to maintain a parameter Δ, which is a measure of the maximum flow excess of a vertex and of the maximum amount of flow sent by a single operation. Initially, Δ is less than or equal to the maximum edge capacity, and Δ=0 at termination. The execution of the PLED algorithm is partitioned into phases so that Δ stays fixed during each phase and decreases between consecutive phases. In order to achieve a bound on the number of phases that is independent of the maximum edge capacity, the algorithm decreases Δ by as large a factor (&ges;2) as possible, rather than by a constant factor. The algorithm uses the dynamic trees data structure
