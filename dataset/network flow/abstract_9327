Resources in a distributed system can be identified using identifiers based
on random numbers. When using a distributed hash table to resolve such
identifiers to network locations, the straightforward approach is to store the
network location directly in the hash table entry associated with an
identifier. When a mobile host contains a large number of resources, this
requires that all of the associated hash table entries must be updated when its
network address changes.
  We propose an alternative approach where we store a host identifier in the
entry associated with a resource identifier and the actual network address of
the host in a separate host entry. This can drastically reduce the time
required for updating the distributed hash table when a mobile host changes its
network address. We also investigate under which circumstances our approach
should or should not be used. We evaluate and confirm the usefulness of our
approach with experiments run on top of OpenDHT.
