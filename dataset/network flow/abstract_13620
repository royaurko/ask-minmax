In this article we present ill-posedness results for generalized Boussinesq
equations, which incorporate also the ones obtained by the contributors for the
classical "good" Boussinesq equation (arXiv:1202.6671). More precisely, we show
that the associated flow map is not smooth for a range of Sobolev indices, thus
providing a threshold for the regularity needed to perform a Picard iteration
for these problems.
