This paper proposes a methodology for optimizing a frequency-hopping network
that uses continuous-phase frequency-shift keying and adaptive
capacity-approaching channel coding. The optimization takes into account the
spatial distribution of the interfering mobiles, Nakagami fading, and lognormal
shadowing. It includes the effects of both co-channel interference and
adjacent-channel interference, which arises due to spectral-splatter effects.
The average network performance depends on the choice of the modulation index,
the number of frequency-hopping channels, and the fractional in-band power,
which are assumed to be fixed network parameters. The performance of a given
transmission depends on the code rate, which is adapted in response to the
interference to meet a constraint on outage probability. The optimization
proceeds by choosing a set of fixed network parameters, drawing the interferers
from the spatial distribution, and determining the maximum rate that satisfies
the outage constraint. The process is repeated for a large number of network
realizations, and the fixed network parameters that maximize the area spectral
efficiency are identified.
