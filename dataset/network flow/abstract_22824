We examine the collective dynamics of a monolayer of rotating particles
immersed in viscous fluid. Each rotor is driven by a constant magnitude torque
perpendicular to the monolayer. The rotors interact with each other through
soft repulsions but can also be advected and rotated by fluid flow generated by
the other rotors. We show here that this hydrodynamic coupling gives rise to
structures and phase behavior unobserved in rotor suspensions with only steric
repulsion. Our findings underscore the importance of inclusion of the many-body
and long-range hydrodynamic interactions in predicting the phase behavior of
active systems.
