Within hydrodynamics we study the effects of the initial spatial anisotropy
in non-central heavy-ion collisions on the momentum distributions of the
emitted hadrons. We show that the elliptic flow measured at midrapidity in 158
A GeV/c Pb+Pb collisions can be quantitatively reproduced by hydrodynamic
expansion, indicating early thermalization in the collision. We predict the
excitation functions of the 2nd and 4th harmonic flow coefficients from AGS to
LHC energies and discuss their sensitivity to the quark-hadron phase
transition.
