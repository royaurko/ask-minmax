The largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a network plays an
important role in several network processes (e.g., synchronization of
oscillators, percolation on directed networks, linear stability of equilibria
of network coupled systems, etc.). In this paper we develop approximations to
the largest eigenvalue of adjacency matrices and discuss the relationships
between these approximations. Numerical experiments on simulated networks are
used to test our results.
