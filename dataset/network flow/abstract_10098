An asymptotic expansion is established for time averages of translation flows
on flat surfaces. This result, which extends earlier work of A.Zorich and
G.Forni, yields limit theorems for translation flows.
  The argument, close in spirit to that of G.Forni, uses the approximation of
ergodic integrals by holonomy-invariant Hoelder cocycles on trajectories of the
flows. The space of holonomy-invariant Hoelder cocycles is finite-dimensional,
and is given by an explicit construction. First, a symbolic representation for
a uniquely ergodic translation flow is obtained following S.Ito and A.M.
Vershik, and then, the space of cocycles is constructed using a family of
finitely-additive complex-valued holonomy-invariant measures on the asymptotic
foliations of a Markov compactum.
