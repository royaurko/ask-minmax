To each non-isotropic almost-complex immersion of a 2-torus into $ S ^ 6 $ we
associate an algebraic curve, called the spectral curve, and a linear flow in
the intersection of two Prym varieties on this spectral curve. We show that
generically the spectral curve is smooth and compute the dimension of the
moduli space of such curves and of the torus in which the eigenline bundles
lie.
