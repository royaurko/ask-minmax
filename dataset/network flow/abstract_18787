We consider a multi-hop wireless sensor network that measures sparse events
and propose a simple forwarding protocol based on Compressed Sensing (CS) which
does not need any sophisticated Media Access Control (MAC) scheduling, neither
a routing protocol, thereby making significant overhead and energy savings. By
means of flooding, multiple packets with different superimposed measurements
are received simultaneously at any node. Thanks to our protocol, each node is
able to recover each measurement and forward it while avoiding cycles.
Numerical results show that our protocol achieves close to zero reconstruction
errors at the sink, while greatly reducing overhead. This initial research
reveals a new and promising approach to protocol design through CS for wireless
mesh and sensor networks.
