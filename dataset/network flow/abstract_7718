We study the sensitivity of the r-process abundance pattern to neutron
capture rates along the rare earth region (A~150 to A~180). We introduce the
concepts of large nuclear flow and flow saturation which determine the neutron
capture rates that are influential in setting the rare earth abundances. We
illustrate the value of the two concepts by considering high entropy conditions
favorable for rare earth peak production and identifying important neutron
capture rates among the rare earth isotopes. We also show how these rates
influence nuclear flow and specific sections of the abundance pattern.
