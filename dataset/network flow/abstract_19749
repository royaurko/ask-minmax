It has hitherto been widely considered that a mixing layer is unstable at all
Reynolds numbers. However this is untenable from energy considerations, which
demand that there must exist a non-zero Reynolds number below which
disturbances cannot extract energy from the mean flow. It is shown here that a
linear stability analysis of similarity solutions of the plane mixing layer,
including the effects of flow non-parallelism, using the minimal composite
theory and the properties of adjoints following Govindarajan & Narasimha
(2005), resolves the issue by yielding non-zero critical Reynolds numbers for
coflowing streams of any velocity ratio. The critical Reynolds number so found,
based on the vorticity thickness and the velocity differential as scales,
varies in the narrow range of 59 to 55 as the velocity ratio goes from zero to
unity.
