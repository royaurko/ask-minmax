We consider a system of phase oscillators with random intrinsic frequencies
coupled through sparse random networks, and investigate how the connectivity
disorder affects the nature of collective synchronization transitions. Various
distribution types of intrinsic frequencies are considered: uniform, unimodal,
and bimodal distribution. We employ a heterogeneous mean-field approximation
based on the annealed networks and also perform numerical simulations on the
quenched Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the connectivity disorder
drastically changes the nature of the synchronization transitions. In
particular, the quenched randomness completely wipes away the diversity of the
transition nature and only a continuous transition appears with the same
mean-field exponent for all types of frequency distributions. The physical
origin of this unexpected result is discussed.
