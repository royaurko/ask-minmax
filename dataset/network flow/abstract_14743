We consider a special case of the ordinary NP-hard two-machine flow shop
problem with the objective of determining simultaneously a minimal common due
date and the minimal number of tardy jobs. In [S. S. Panwalkar, C. Koulamas, An
O(n^2) algorithm for the variable common due date, minimal tardy jobs
bicriteria two-machine flow shop problem with ordered machines, European
Journal of Operational Research 221 (2012), 7-13.], the contributors presented
quadratic algorithm for the problem when each job has its smaller processing
time on the first machine. In this note, we improve the running time of the
algorithm to O(n log n) by efficient implementation using recently introduced
modified binary tree data structure.
