We recast the Calabi flow in DeGiorgi's language of minimizing movements. We
establish the long time existence of minimizing movements for K-energy with
arbitrary initial condition. Furthermore we establish some a priori regularity
of these solutions, and that sufficiently regular minimizing movements are
smooth solutions to Calabi flow.
