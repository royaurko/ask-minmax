We consider the problem of resource allocation and control of multihop
networks in which multiple source-destination pairs communicate confidential
messages, privately from the intermediate nodes. We pose the problem as that of
network utility maximization, into which confidentiality is incorporated as an
additional quality of service constraint. We develop a simple, and yet provably
optimal dynamic control algorithm which combines flow control, routing and
end-to-end secrecy encoding. In order to achieve confidentiality, our scheme
exploits multipath diversity and temporal diversity due to channel variability.
Our end-to-end dynamic encoding scheme encodes confidential messages over many
packets, to be combined at the ultimate destination for recovery. We also
evaluated our scheme numerically under various conditions to show its efficacy.
