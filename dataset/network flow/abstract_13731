We investigate the critical transition from an inverse cascade of energy to a
forward energy cascade in a two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic flow as the
ratio of magnetic to mechanical forcing amplitude is varied. It is found that
the critical transition is the result of two competing processes. The first
process is due to hydrodynamic interactions, cascades the energy to the large
scales. The second process couples small scale magnetic fields to large scale
flows transferring the energy back to the small scales via a non-local
mechanism. At marginality the two cascades are both present and cancel each
other. The phase space diagram of the transition is sketched.
