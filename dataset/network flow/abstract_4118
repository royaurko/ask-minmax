We revisit the statistical significance of the "dark flow" presented in
Kashlinsky et al. (2009). We do not find a statistically significant detection
of a bulk flow. Instead we find that CMB correlations between the 8 WMAP
channels used in this analysis decrease the inferred significance of the
detection to 0.7\sigma.
