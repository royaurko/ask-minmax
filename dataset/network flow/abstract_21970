We recall Krichever's construction of additional flows to Benney's hierarchy,
attached to poles at finite distance of the Lax operator. Then we construct a
``dispersionful'' analogue of this hierarchy, in which the role of poles at
finite distance is played by Miura fields. We connect this hierarchy with
$N$-wave systems, and prove several facts about the latter (Lax representation,
Chern-Simons-type Lagrangian, connection with Liouville equation,
$\tau$-functions).
