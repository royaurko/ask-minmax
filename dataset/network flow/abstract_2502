Gradient networks can be used to model the dominant structure of complex
networks. Previous works have focused on random gradient networks. Here we
study gradient networks that minimize jamming on substrate networks with
scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structure. We introduce structural
correlations and strongly reduce congestion occurring on the network by using a
Monte Carlo optimization scheme. This optimization alters the degree
distribution and other structural properties of the resulting gradient
networks. These results are expected to be relevant for transport and other
dynamical processes in real network systems.
