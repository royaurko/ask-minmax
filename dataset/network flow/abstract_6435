Many complex systems can be represented as networks, and how a network breaks
up into subnetworks or communities is of wide interest. However, the
development of a method to detect nodes important to communities that is both
fast and accurate is a very challenging and open problem. In this manuscript,
we introduce a new approach to characterize the node importance to communities.
First, a centrality metric is proposed to measure the importance of network
nodes to community structure using the spectrum of the adjacency matrix. We
define the node importance to communities as the relative change in the
eigenvalues of the network adjacency matrix upon their removal. Second, we also
propose an index to distinguish two kinds of important nodes in communities,
i.e., "community core" and "bridge". Our indices are only relied on the
spectrum of the graph matrix. They are applied in many artificial networks as
well as many real-world networks. This new methodology gives us a basic
approach to solve this challenging problem and provides a realistic result.
