We present a quantitative study of energy flow away from jets by numerically
solving the evolution equation derived by Banfi, Marchesini and Smye (BMS), and
apply the result to two processes at the LHC: Discriminating high-p_t jets
originating from decays of heavy electroweak bosons from the QCD background,
and the survival probability of BFKL-initiated dijet rapidity gaps. As a
byproduct, we find a hidden symmetry of the BMS equation which is a remnant of
conformal symmetry.
