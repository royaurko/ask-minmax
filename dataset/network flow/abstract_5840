The Pearson correlation coefficient is commonly used for quantifying the
global level of degree-degree association in complex networks. Here, we use a
probabilistic representation of the underlying network structure for assessing
the applicability of different association measures to heavy-tailed degree
distributions. Theoretical arguments together with our numerical study indicate
that Pearson's coefficient often depends on the size of networks with equal
association structure, impeding a systematic comparison of real-world networks.
In contrast, Kendall-Gibbons' $\tau_{b}$ is a considerably more robust measure
of the degree-degree association.
