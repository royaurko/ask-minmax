We derive the radiative transfer equation for arbitrary stationary
relativistic flows in stationary spacetimes, i.e. for steady-state transfer
problems. We show how the standard characteristics method of solution developed
by Mihalas and used throughout the radiative transfer community can be adapted
to multi-dimensional applications with isotropic sources. Because the
characteristics always coincide with geodesics and can always be specified by
constants, direct integration of the characteristics derived from the transfer
equation as commonly done in 1-D applications is not required. The
characteristics are known for a specified metric from the geodesics. We give
details in both flat and static spherically symmetric spacetimes. This work has
direct application in 3-dimensional simulations of supernovae, gamma-ray
bursts, and active galactic nuclei, as well as in modeling neutron star
atmospheres.
