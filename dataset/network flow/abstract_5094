Orchestrating a live field trial of wireless mobile networking involves
significant cost and logistical issues relating to mobile platforms, support
personnel, network and experiment automation and support equipment. The
significant cost and logistics required to execute such a field trial can also
be limiting in terms of achieving meaningful test results that exercise a
practical number of mobile nodes over a significant set of test conditions
within a given time. There is no argument that field trials are an important
component of dynamic network testing. A field test of prototype will show
whether simulations were on right track or not, but that's a big leap to take;
going from the simulator directly to the real thing. In conceiving our work, we
envisioned a mobile network emulation system that is low cost, flexible and
controllable. This paper describes our wireless MANET test bed under
development which emulates an actual MANET. Here, we focuses that, this test
bed allows the users to automatically generate arbitrary logically network
topologies in order to perform real time operations on adhoc network at a
relatively low cost in a laboratory environment without having to physically
move the nodes in the adhoc network. Thus, we try to "compress" wireless
network so that it fits on a single table.
