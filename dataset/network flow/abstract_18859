Delay-coupled networks are investigated with nonidentical delay times and the
effects of such heterogeneity on the emergent dynamics of complex systems are
characterized. A simple decomposition method is presented that decouples the
dynamics of the network into node-size modal equations in the vicinity of
equilibria. The resulting independent components contain distributed delays
that map the spatiotemporal complexity of the system to the time domain. We
demonstrate that this new approach can be used to reveal new physical phenomena
in heterogenous vehicular traffic when vehicles are linked via
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication.
