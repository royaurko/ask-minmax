In the above paper the contributors treat the natural convection boundary layer
flow in a Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer porous medium. In the energy equation the
radiation effect has been taken into account. A two-parameter perturbation
method is used for the solution of the equations. The first order results are
presented in tables and figures. This is an interesting work but there are some
weak points which are presented below:
