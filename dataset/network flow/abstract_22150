We consider in this paper a reaction-diffusion system in presence of a flow
and under a KPP hypothesis. While the case of a single-equation has been
extensively studied since the pioneering Kolmogorov-Petrovski-Piskunov paper,
the study of the corresponding system with a Lewis number not equal to 1 is
still quite open. Here, we will prove some results about the existence of
travelling fronts and generalized travelling fronts solutions of such a system
with the presence of a non-linear spacedependent loss term inside the domain.
In particular, we will point out the existence of a minimal speed, above which
any real value is an admissible speed. We will also give some spreading results
for initial conditions decaying exponentially at infinity.
