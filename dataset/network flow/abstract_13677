Our study of the basic model for incompressible two-phase flows with phase
transitions consistent with thermodynamics [10,11,12,16] is extended to the
case of temperature-dependent surface tension. We prove well-posedness in an
Lp-setting, study the stability of the equilibria of the problem, and show that
a solution which does not develop singularities exists globally, and if its
limit set contains a stable equilibrium it converges to this equilibrium in the
natural state manifold for the problem as time goes to infinity.
