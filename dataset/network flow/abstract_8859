We compare the rate of convergence to the time average of a function over an
integrable Hamiltonian flow with the one obtained by a stochastic perturbation
of the same flow. Precisely, we provide detailed estimates in different Fourier
norms and we prove the convergence even in a Sobolev norm for a special
vanishing limit of the stochastic perturbation.
