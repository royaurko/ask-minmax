We demonstrate that the nuclear collision geometry (i.e. impact parameter)
can be determined with 1.5 fm accuracy in an event-by-event analysis by
measuring the transverse energy flow in the pseudorapidity region $3 \le |\eta|
\le 5$ with a minimal dependence on collision dynamics details at the LHC
energy scale. Using the HIJING model we have illustrated our calculation by a
simulation of events of nucleus-nucleus interactions at the c.m.s energy from 1
up to 5.5 TeV per nucleon and various type of nuclei.
