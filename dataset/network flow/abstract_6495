We study the lobby index (l-index for short) as a local node centrality
measure for complex networks. The l-inde is compared with degree (a local
measure), betweenness and Eigenvector centralities (two global measures) in the
case of biological network (Yeast interaction protein-protein network) and a
linguistic network (Moby Thesaurus II). In both networks, the l-index has poor
correlation with betweenness but correlates with degree and Eigenvector. Being
a local measure, one can take advantage by using the l-index because it carries
more information about its neighbors when compared with degree centrality,
indeed it requires less time to compute when compared with Eigenvector
centrality. Results suggests that l-index produces better results than degree
and Eigenvector measures for ranking purposes, becoming suitable as a tool to
perform this task.
