We explore the SNR-optimal relay functionality in a \emph{memoryless} relay
network, i.e. a network where, during each channel use, the signal transmitted
by a relay depends only on the last received symbol at that relay. We develop a
generalized notion of SNR for the class of memoryless relay functions. The
solution to the generalized SNR optimization problem leads to the novel concept
of minimum mean square uncorrelated error estimation(MMSUEE). For the elemental
case of a single relay, we show that MMSUEE is the SNR-optimal memoryless relay
function regardless of the source and relay transmit power, and the modulation
scheme. This scheme, that we call estimate and forward (EF), is also shown to
be SNR-optimal with PSK modulation in a parallel relay network. We demonstrate
that EF performs better than the best of amplify and forward (AF) and
demodulate and forward (DF), in both parallel and serial relay networks. We
also determine that AF is near-optimal at low transmit power in a parallel
network, while DF is near-optimal at high transmit power in a serial network.
For hybrid networks that contain both serial and parallel elements, and when
robust performance is desired, the advantage of EF over the best of AF and DF
is found to be significant. Error probabilities are provided to substantiate
the performance gain obtained through SNR optimality. We also show that, for
\emph{Gaussian} inputs, AF, DF and EF become identical.
