Network coding-based link failure recovery techniques provide near-hitless
recovery and offer high capacity efficiency. Diversity coding is the first
technique to incorporate coding in this field and is easy to implement over
small arbitrary networks. However, its capacity efficiency is restricted by its
systematic coding and high design complexity even though it has lower
complexity than the other coding-based recovery techniques. Alternative
techniques mitigate some of these limitations, but they are difficult to
implement over arbitrary networks. In this paper, we propose a novel
non-systematic coding technique and a simple design algorithm to implement the
diversity coding-based (or network coding-based) recovery over arbitrary
networks. The design framework consists of two parts. An ILP formulation for
each part is developed. The simulation results suggest that both the novel
coding structure and the novel design algorithm lead to higher capacity
efficiency for near-hitless recovery. The new design algorithm is able to
achieve optimal results in large arbitrary networks.
