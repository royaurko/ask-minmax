Hadronic radiation provides a tool to distinguish different topologies of
colour flow in hard scattering processes. We study the structure of hadronic
flow corresponding to Higgs production and decay in high-energy hadron-hadron
collisions. In particular, the signal gg -> H -> b anti-b and background gg ->
b anti-b processes are shown to have very different radiation patterns, and
this may provide an useful additional method for distinguishing Higgs signal
events from the QCD background.
