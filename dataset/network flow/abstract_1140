We numerically investigate the saturation of the hydromagnetic instabilities
of a magnetized spherical Couette flow. Previous simulations [Hollerbach, 2009]
demonstrated region where the axisymmetric flow, calculated from a 2-D
simulation, was linearly unstable to nonaxisymmetric perturbations. Full,
nonlinear, 3d simulations [Hollerbach 2009, Travnikov 2011] showed that the
saturated state would consist only of harmonics of one azimuthal wave number,
though there were bifurcations and transitions as nondimensional parameters
(Re, Ha) were varied. Here, the energy transfer between different aziumthal
modes is formulated as a network. This demonstrates a mechanism or the
saturation of one mode and for the suppression of other unstable modes. A given
mode grows by extracting energy from the axisymmetric flow, and then saturates
as the energy transfer to its second harmonic equals this inflow. At the same
time, this mode suppresses other unstable modes by facilitating an energy
transfer to linearly stable modes.
