In this paper we present a combinatorial optimisation view on the routing
problem for connectionless packet networks by using the metaphor of a
landscape. We examine the main properties of the routing landscapes as we
define them and how they can help us on the evaluation of the problem
difficulty and the generation of effective algorithms. We also present the
random walk statistical technique to evaluate the main properties of those
landscapes and a number of examples to demonstrate the use of the method.
