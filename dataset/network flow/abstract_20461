We consider the rotation of small neutrally buoyant axisymmetric particles in
a viscous steady shear flow. When inertial effects are negligible the problem
exhibits infinitely many periodic solutions, the "Jeffery orbits". We compute
how inertial effects lift their degeneracy by perturbatively solving the
coupled particle-flow equations. We obtain an equation of motion valid at small
shear Reynolds numbers, for spheroidal particles with arbitrary aspect ratios.
We analyse how the linear stability of the \lq log-rolling\rq{} orbit depends
on particle shape and find it to be unstable for prolate spheroids. This
resolves a puzzle in the interpretation of direct numerical simulations of the
problem. In general both unsteady and non-linear terms in the Navier-Stokes
equations are important.
