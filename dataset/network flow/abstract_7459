We calculate the Nernst effect in the vortex fluid phase, which occurs in the
lower-T portion of the pseudogap region of the high Tc cuprate phase diagram.
The dynamics is dominated by the flows due to both thermally excited vortices
and those caused by the magnetic field; we show that the flow of the latter due
to the thermal gradient encounters a viscous force caused by the random vortex
flows. The temperature and field dependence is controlled by the effects of T
and B on the momentum-dependent energy gaps and thence on the superfluid
density. A reasonable level of agreement with the observational data is
obtained, in view of the crudity of the assumptions.
