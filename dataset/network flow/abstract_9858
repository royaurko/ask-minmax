In this work we study the asymptotic behavior of viscous incompressible 2D
flow in the exterior of a small material obstacle. We fix the initial vorticity
$\omega_0$ and the circulation $\gamma$ of the initial flow around the
obstacle. We prove that, if $\gamma$ is sufficiently small, the limit flow
satisfies the full-plane Navier-Stokes system, with initial vorticity $\omega_0
+ \gamma \delta$, where $\delta$ is the standard Dirac measure. The result
should be contrasted with the corresponding inviscid result obtained by the
contributors in [Comm P.D.E. 28 (2003) 349-379], where the effect of the small
obstacle appears in the coefficients of the PDE and not only on the initial
data. The main ingredients of the proof are $L^p-L^q$ estimates for the Stokes
operator in an exterior domain, a priori estimates inspired on Kato's fixed
point method, energy estimates, renormalization and interpolation.
