The \emph{World Trade Web} (WTW), the network defined by the international
import/export trade relationships, has been recently shown to display some
important topological properties which are tightly related to the Gross
Domestic Product of world countries. While our previous analysis focused on the
static, undirected version of the WTW, here we address its full evolving,
directed description. This is accomplished by exploiting the peculiar
reciprocity structure of the WTW to recover the directed nature of
international trade channels, and by studying the temporal dependence of the
parameters describing the WTW topology.
