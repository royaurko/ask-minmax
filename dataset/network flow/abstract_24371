We propose a framework to build formal developments for robot networks using
the COQ proof assistant, to state and to prove formally various properties. We
focus in this paper on impossibility proofs, as it is natural to take advantage
of the COQ higher order calculus to reason about algorithms as abstract
objects. We present in particular formal proofs of two impossibility results
forconvergence of oblivious mobile robots if respectively more than one half
and more than one third of the robots exhibit Byzantine failures, starting from
the original theorems by Bouzid et al.. Thanks to our formalization, the
corresponding COQ developments are quite compact. To our knowledge, these are
the first certified (in the sense of formally proved) impossibility results for
robot networks.
