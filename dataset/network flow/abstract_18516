Transportation networks are inevitably selected with reference to their
global cost which depends on the strengths and the distribution of the embedded
currents. We prove that optimal current distributions for a uniformly injected
d-dimensional network exhibit robust scale-invariance properties, independently
of the particular cost function considered, as long as it is convex. We find
that, in the limit of large currents, the distribution decays as a power law
with an exponent equal to (2d-1)/(d-1). The current distribution can be exactly
calculated in d=2 for all values of the current. Numerical simulations further
suggest that the scaling properties remain unchanged for both random injections
and by randomizing the convex cost functions.
