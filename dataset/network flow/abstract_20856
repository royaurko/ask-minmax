The interactions between the components of complex networks are often
directed. Proper modeling of such systems frequently requires the construction
of ensembles of digraphs with a given sequence of in- and out-degrees. As the
number of simple labeled graphs with a given degree sequence is typically very
large even for short sequences, sampling methods are needed for statistical
studies. Currently, there are two main classes of methods that generate
samples. One of the existing methods first generates a restricted class of
graphs, then uses a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm based on edge swaps to
generate other realizations. As the mixing time of this process is still
unknown, the independence of the samples is not well controlled. The other
class of methods is based on the Configuration Model that may lead to
unacceptably many sample rejections due to self-loops and multiple edges. Here
we present an algorithm that can directly construct all possible realizations
of a given bi-degree sequence by simple digraphs. Our method is rejection free,
guarantees the independence of the constructed samples, and provides their
weight. The weights can then be used to compute statistical averages of network
observables as if they were obtained from uniformly distributed sampling, or
from any other chosen distribution.
