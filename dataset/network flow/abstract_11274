Traditional random graph models of networks generate networks that are
locally tree-like, meaning that all local neighborhoods take the form of trees.
In this respect such models are highly unrealistic, most real networks having
strongly non-tree-like neighborhoods that contain short loops, cliques, or
other biconnected subgraphs. In this paper we propose and analyze a new class
of random graph models that incorporates general subgraphs, allowing for
non-tree-like neighborhoods while still remaining solvable for many fundamental
network properties. Among other things we give solutions for the size of the
giant component, the position of the phase transition at which the giant
component appears, and percolation properties for both site and bond
percolation on networks generated by the model.
