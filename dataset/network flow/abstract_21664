We give an overview of the current theoretical status of proper time
renormalization group flow equations applied to QCD. These equations give the
evolution of coupling constants in an effective QCD Lagrangian as a function of
an infra-red cut-off parameter. This parameter characterizes the resolution
with which the system is looked at. Decreasing resolution transforms partonic
quarks into constituent quarks and generates pion bound states. The evolution
equations can also be applied to finite temperature and finite density QCD.
