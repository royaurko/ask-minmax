A CR generic real analytic CR manifold M carries two families of Segre
varieties and conjugate Segre varieties. We observe in this article that their
complexifications give rise to two families of foliations of the
complexification of M which coincide with the flow foliations induced by the
complexified CR (1,0) and (0,1) vector fields tangent to M. As an application,
we derive a new proof of the characterization of finite type in terms of Segre
sets.
