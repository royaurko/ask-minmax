In this paper we present the comparison of the linguistic networks from
literature and blog texts. The linguistic networks are constructed from texts
as directed and weighted co-occurrence networks of words. Words are nodes and
links are established between two nodes if they are directly co-occurring
within the sentence. The comparison of the networks structure is performed at
global level (network) in terms of: average node degree, average shortest path
length, diameter, clustering coefficient, density and number of components.
Furthermore, we perform analysis on the local level (node) by comparing the
rank plots of in and out degree, strength and selectivity. The
selectivity-based results point out that there are differences between the
structure of the networks constructed from literature and blogs.
