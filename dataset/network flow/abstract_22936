We show that the combination of the similarities between the X-ray properties
of low luminosity accreting black holes and accreting neutron stars, combined
with the differences in their radio properties argues that the X-rays from
these systems are unlikely to be formed in the relativistic jets. Specifically,
the spectra of extreme island state neutron stars and low/hard state black
holes are known to be indistinguishable, while the power spectra from these
systems are known to show only minor differences beyond what would be expected
from scaling the characteristic variability frequencies by the mass of the
compact object. The spectral and temporal similarities thus imply a common
emission mechanism that has only minor deviations from having all key
parameters scaling linearly with the mass of the compact object, while we show
that this is inconsistent with the observations that the radio powers of
neutron stars are typically about 30 times lower than those of black holes at
the same X-ray luminosity. We also show that an abrupt luminosity change would
be expected when a system makes a spectral state transition from a radiatively
inefficient jet dominated accretion flow to a thin disk dominated flow, but
that such a change is not seen.
