Using high-resolution particle image velocimetry we measure velocity
profiles, the wind Reynolds number and characteristics of turbulent plumes in
Taylor-Couette flow for a radius ratio of 0.5 and Taylor number of up to
$6.2\cdot10^9$. The extracted angular velocity profiles follow a log-law more
closely than the azimuthal velocity profiles due to the strong curvature of
this $\eta=0.5$ setup. The scaling of the wind Reynolds number with the Taylor
number agrees with the theoretically predicted 3/7-scaling for the classical
turbulent regime, which is much more pronounced than for the well-explored
$\eta=0.71$ case, for which the ultimate regime sets in at much lower Ta. By
measuring at varying axial positions, roll structures are found for
counter-rotation while no clear coherent structures are seen for pure inner
cylinder rotation. In addition, turbulent plumes coming from the inner and
outer cylinder are investigated. For pure inner cylinder rotation, the plumes
in the radial velocity move away from the inner cylinder, while the plumes in
the azimuthal velocity mainly move away from the outer cylinder. For
counter-rotation, the mean radial flow in the roll structures strongly affects
the direction and intensity of the turbulent plumes. Furthermore, it is
experimentally confirmed that in regions where plumes are emitted, boundary
layer profiles with a logarithmic signature are created.
