This study provides insights into the quantitative similarities, differences
and relationships between users' spatial, face-to-face, urban social networks
and their transpatial, online counterparts. We explore and map the social ties
within a cohort of 2602 users, and how those ties are mediated via physical
co-presence and online tools. Our analysis focused on isolating two distinct
segments of the social network: one mediated by physical co-presence, and the
other mediated by Facebook. Our results suggest that as a whole the networks
exhibit homogeneous characteristics, but individuals' involvement in those
networks varies considerably. Furthermore this study provides a methodological
approach for jointly analysing spatial & transpatial networks utilising
pervasive and ubiquitous technology.
