The Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol allows the nodes
in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) or a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) to know
where to forward data packets. Such a protocol is 'loop free' if it never leads
to routing decisions that forward packets in circles. This paper describes the
mechanization of an existing pen-and-paper proof of loop freedom of AODV in the
interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. The mechanization relies on a novel
compositional approach for lifting invariants to networks of nodes. We exploit
the mechanization to analyse several improvements of AODV and show that
Isabelle/HOL can re-establish most proof obligations automatically and identify
exactly the steps that are no longer valid.
