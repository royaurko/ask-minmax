Multipath-TCP receives a lot of attention recently and can potentially
improve quality of service for both private and commercial users. It leverages
the multiple available paths and send packets through all the available paths.
The growing of Mutipath TCP has received a growing interest from both
researchers who publish a growing number of articles on the topic and the
vendors since Apple has decided to use Multipath TCP on its smartphones and
tablets to support the Siri voice recognition application. In this paper, we
study the performance of Multipath TCP from its impact on the stability of the
network. In particular, we study three scenarios, Internet, which is the
largest networks and involves heterogeneous traffic, data center, which is
smaller but has different traffic patterns compared with Internet scale network
and wireless network, whose energy consumption also needs to be considered. Our
study shows that stability is affected but not seriouly for Internet and
wireless network, but datacenter network stability is seriously affected due to
its bursty traffic pattern.
