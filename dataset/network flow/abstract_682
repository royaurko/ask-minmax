We analyse two large-scale intra-city urban networks and traffic flows
therein measured by GPS traces of taxis in San Francisco and Shanghai. Our
results coincide with previous findings that, based purely on topological
means, it is often insufficient to characterise traffic flow. Traditional
shortest-path betweenness analysis, where shortest paths are calculated from
each pairs of nodes, carries an unrealistic implicit assumption that each node
or junction in the urban network generates and attracts an equal amount of
traffic. We also argue that weighting edges based only on euclidean distance is
inadequate, as primary roads are commonly favoured over secondary roads due to
the perceived and actual travel time required. We show that betweenness traffic
analysis can be improved by a simple extended framework which incorporates both
the notions of node weights and fastest-path betweenness. We demonstrate that
the framework is superior to traditional methods based solely on simple
topological perspectives.
