We Study in this paper the scaling and statistical properties of the $ac$
conductivity of thin metal-dielectric films in different regions of the loss in
the metallic components and particularly in the limit of vanishing loss. We
model the system by a 2D $RL-C$ network and calculate the effective
conductivity by using a real space renormalization group method. It is found
that the real conductivity strongly fluctuates for very small losses. The
correlation length, which seems to be equivalent to the localization length,
diverges for vanishing losses confirming our previous results for the decay of
the real conductivity with the loss. We found also that the distribution of the
real conductivity becomes log-normal below a certain critical loss $R_{c}$
which is size dependent for finite systems. For infinite systems this critical
loss vanishes and corresponds to the phase transition between localized modes
for finite losses and the extended ones at zero loss.
