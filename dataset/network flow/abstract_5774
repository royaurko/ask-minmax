Commercial cellular telecommunications networks are routinely used as key
means of voice and data transport by both businesses and the Public. Despite
advances in encryption and other security measures, these commercial cellular
networks remain extremely vulnerable to malicious attacks and the loss of user
and data privacy and integrity. Such losses can result not only in mere
inconvenience, but in serious corporate and national security breaches. Because
of the potentially catastrophic nature of such security breaches, it behooves
cellular network operators, distributors, and users to explore these network
risk areas and mitigate them to the extent that current resources allow.
