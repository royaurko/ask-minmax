We investigate probability density functions of velocity differences at
different distances r measured in a Couette-Taylor flow for a range of Reynolds
numbers Re. There is good agreement with the predictions of a theoretical model
based on non-extensive statistical mechanics (where the entropies are
non-additive for independent subsystems). We extract the scale-dependent
non-extensitivity parameter q(r, Re) from the laboratory data.
