A novel trust region method for solving linearly constrained nonlinear
programs is presented. The proposed technique is amenable to a distributed
implementation, as its salient ingredient is an alternating projected gradient
sweep in place of the Cauchy point computation. It is proven that the algorithm
yields a sequence that globally converges to a critical point. As a result of
some changes to the standard trust region method, namely a proximal
regularisation of the trust region subproblem, it is shown that the local
convergence rate is linear with an arbitrarily small ratio. Thus, convergence
is locally almost superlinear, under standard regularity assumptions. The
proposed method is successfully applied to compute local solutions to
alternating current optimal power flow problems in transmission and
distribution networks. Moreover, the new mechanism for computing a Cauchy point
compares favourably against the standard projected search as for its activity
detection properties.
