The contributions of different color flows into the gluonic Bc-meson
production cross section has been calculated. This study is essential to
simulate Bc-meson production with the help of Pythia program. The essence of
matter is that in the frame work of the Lund model used by Pythia the
hadronization way of the final partons and hadronic remnants depends on the
color flow type. The modified method for calculation of the color flow
contributions has been proposed.
