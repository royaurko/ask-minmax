The stationary Josephson effect is studied theoretically in the situation
when there is externally injected transport supercurrent which flows in the
banks parallel to the contact interface. Coexistence of this supercurrent with
the order parameter phase difference between the banks of the contact results
in the appearance of quasiparticles in the weak link, which create the current,
localized in the vicinity of the contact and counter-flowing to the transport
supercurrent. We review the results of our previous study of weak links between
current-carrying conventional and unconventional (d-wave) superconductors. And
further we study the weak link in the form of double point contact between
current-carrying superconductors. The current distribution patterns, containing
the vortex-like states, are obtained.
