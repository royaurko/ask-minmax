We investigate the K\"ahler-Ricci flow modified by a holomorphic vector
field. We find equivalent analytic criteria for the convergence of the flow to
a K\"ahler-Ricci soliton. In addition, we relate the asymptotic behavior of the
scalar curvature along the flow to the lower boundedness of the modified
Mabuchi energy.
