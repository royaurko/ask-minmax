Nowadays many telescopes around the world are automated and some networks of
robotic telescopes are active or planned as shown by the lists we draw up. Such
equipment could be used for the training of students and for science in the
Universities of Developing Countries and of New Astronomical Countries, by
sending them observational data via Internet or through remotely controlled
telescopes. It seems that it is time to open up for discussion with UN and ESA
organizations and also with IAU, how to implement links between robotic
telescopes and such Universities applying for collaborations. Many scientific
fields could thus be accessible to them, for example on stellar variability,
near-earth object follow-up, gamma-ray burst counterpart tracking, and so on.
