In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the Eschenauer-Gligor (EG) key
pre-distribution scheme is a widely recognized way to secure communications.
Although connectivity properties of secure WSNs with the EG scheme have been
extensively investigated, few results address physical transmission
constraints. These constraints reflect real-world implementations of WSNs in
which two sensors have to be within a certain distance from each other to
communicate. In this paper, we present zero-one laws for connectivity in WSNs
employing the EG scheme under transmission constraints. These laws help specify
the critical transmission ranges for connectivity. Our analytical findings are
confirmed via numerical experiments. In addition to secure WSNs, our
theoretical results are also applied to frequency hopping in wireless networks.
