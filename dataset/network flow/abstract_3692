The directed flow of inclusive, transported and non-transported (including
produced) protons, as well as antiprotons, has been studied in the framework of
Ultra-Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics approach (UrQMD model) for Au+Au
collisions at\surdsNN =7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. The rapidity,
centrality and energy dependence of directed flow for various proton groups are
presented. It is found that the integrated directed flow decreases
monotonically as a function of collision energy for\surdsNN =11.5 GeV and
beyond. However, the sign-change of directed flow of inclusive protons, seen in
experimental data as a function of centrality and collision energy, can be
explained by the competing effect of directed flow between transported and
non-transported protons. Similarly the difference in directed flow between
protons and antiprotons can be explained. Our study offers a conventional
explanation on the cause of the v1 sign-change other than the antiflow
component of protons alone which is argued to be linked to a phase transition.
