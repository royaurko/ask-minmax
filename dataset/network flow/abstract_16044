We consider the problem of distributed scheduling in wireless networks where
heterogeneously delayed information about queue lengths and channel states of
all links are available at all the transmitters. In an earlier work (by Reddy
et al. in Queueing Systems, 2012), a throughput optimal scheduling policy
(which we refer to henceforth as the R policy) for this setting was proposed.
We study the R policy, and examine its two drawbacks -- (i) its huge
computational complexity, and (ii) its non-optimal average per-packet queueing
delay. We show that the R policy unnecessarily constrains itself to work with
information that is more delayed than that afforded by the system. We propose a
new policy that fully exploits the commonly available information, thereby
greatly improving upon the computational complexity and the delay performance
of the R policy. We show that our policy is throughput optimal. Our main
contribution in this work is the design of two fast and near-throughput-optimal
policies for this setting, whose explicit throughput and runtime performances
we characterize analytically. While the R policy takes a few milliseconds to
several tens of seconds to compute the schedule once (for varying number of
links in the network), the running times of the proposed
near-throughput-optimal algorithms range from a few microseconds to only a few
hundred microseconds, and are thus suitable for practical implementation in
networks with heterogeneously delayed information.
