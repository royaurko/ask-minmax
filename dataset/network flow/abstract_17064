We consider a single hop wireless X network with $K$ transmitters and $J$
receivers, all with single antenna. Each transmitter conveys for each receiver
an independent message. The channel is assumed to have constant coefficients.
We develop interference alignment scheme for this setup and derived several
achievable degrees of freedom regions. We show that in some cases, the derived
region meets a previous outer bound and are hence the DoF region. For our
achievability schemes, we divide each message into streams and use real
interference alignment on the streams. Several previous results on the DoF
region and total DoF for various special cases can be recovered from our
result.
