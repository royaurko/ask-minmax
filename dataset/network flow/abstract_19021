Wireless cellular networks evolve towards a heterogeneous infrastructure,
featuring multiple types of Base Stations (BSs), such as Femto BSs (FBSs) and
Macro BSs (MBSs). A wireless device observes multiple points (BSs) through
which it can access the infrastructure and it may choose to receive the
downlink (DL) traffic from one BS and send uplink (UL) traffic through another
BS. Such a situation is referred to as decoupled DL/UL access. Using the
framework of stochastic geometry, we derive the association probability for
DL/UL. In order to maximize the average received power, as the relative density
of FBSs initially increases, a large fraction of devices chooses decoupled
access, i.e. receive from a MBS in DL and transmit through a FBS in UL. We
analyze the impact that this type of association has on the average throughput
in the system.
