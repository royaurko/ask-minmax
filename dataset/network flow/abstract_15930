Reciprocity is a vital feature of social networks, but relatively little is
known about its temporal structure or the mechanisms underlying its persistence
in real world behavior. In pursuit of these two questions, we study the
stationary and dynamical signals of reciprocity in a network of manioc beer
(Spanish: chicha; Tsimane': shocdye') drinking events in a Tsimane' village in
lowland Bolivia. At the stationary level, our analysis reveals that social
exchange within the community is heterogeneously patterned according to kinship
and spatial proximity. A positive relationship between the frequencies at which
two families host each other, controlling for kinship and proximity, provides
evidence for stationary reciprocity. Our analysis of the dynamical structure of
this network presents a novel method for the study of conditional, or
non-stationary, reciprocity effects. We find evidence that short-timescale
reciprocity (within three days) is present among non- and distant-kin pairs;
conversely, we find that levels of cooperation among close kin can be accounted
for on the stationary hypothesis alone.
