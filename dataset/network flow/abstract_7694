It is shown that the elliptic flow can be successfully described in the color
string picture with fusion and percolation provided anisotropy of particle
emission from the fused string is taken into account. Two possible sources of
this anisotropy are considered, propagation of the string in the transverse
plane and quenching of produced particles in the strong color field of the
string. Calculations show that the second source gives an overwhelming
contribution to the flow at accessible energies.
