A sensor network is one of the critical networks that is based on hardware
components as well the energy parameters. Because of this, such network
requires the optimization in all kind communication to improve the network
life. In case of underwater sensor network, the criticality of network is also
increased because of the random floating movement of the nodes. In this work, a
composition of the multicast or broadcast communication is presented by the
generation of aggregative path. The presented work is about to define a new
chain based aggregative routing approach to provide the effective communication
over the network. In this work, an effective aggregative path is suggested
under the different parameters of energy, distance and congestion analysis.
Based on these parameters a trustful aggregative route will be generated so
that the network life will be improved.
