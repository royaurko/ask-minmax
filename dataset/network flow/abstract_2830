We associate to a CAT(0)-space a flow space that can be used as the
replacement for the geodesic flow on the sphere tangent bundle of a Riemannian
manifold. We use this flow space to prove that CAT(0)-group are transfer
reducible over the family of virtually cyclic groups. This result is an
important ingredient in our proof of the Farrell-Jones Conjecture for these
groups.
