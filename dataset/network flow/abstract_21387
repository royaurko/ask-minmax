Standard magnetohydrodynamic theories, such as the mean field dynamo theory,
have been criticized when the back reaction of the magnetic field on turbulent
motions is neglected. For the dynamo, this back reaction has been argued to
suppress the turbulent motions required for optimal mean field production. Here
it is suggested that if the magnetic field is spatially intermittent, for
example residing in flux tubes, the back reaction on turbulent flows may be
significantly reduced.
