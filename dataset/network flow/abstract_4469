Seamless continuity is the main goal and challenge in fourth generation
Wireless networks (FGWNs), to achieve seamless connectivity "HANDOVER"
technique is used,Handover mechanism are mainly used when a mobile terminal(MT)
is in overlapping area for service continuity. In Heterogeneous wireless
networks main challenge is continual connection among the different networks
like WiFi, WiMax, WLAN, WPAN etc. In this paper, Vertical handover decision
schemes are compared, Simple Additive Weighting method (SAW) and Weighted
product model (WPM) are used to choose the best network from the available
Visitor networks(VTs) for the continuous connection by the mobile terminal. In
our work we mainly concentrated to the handover decision phase and to reduce
the processing delay in the period of handover. In this paper both SAW and WPM
methods are compared with the Qos parameters of the mobile terminal (MT) to
connect with the best network. Keywords: Handover, Vertical handover decision
schemes, Simple additive weighting, Weight product method.
