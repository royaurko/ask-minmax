We simulate the granular flow in a narrow pipe with a lattice-gas automaton
model. We find that the density in the system is characterized by two features.
One is that spontaneous density waves propagate through the system with
well-defined shapes and velocities. The other is that density waves are so
distributed to make the power spectra of density fluctuations as $1/f^{\alpha}$
noise. Three important parameters make these features observable and they are
energy dissipation, average density and the rougness of the pipe walls.
