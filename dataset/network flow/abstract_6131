Ecological networks allow us to study the structure and function of
ecosystems and gain insights on species resilience/stability. The study of this
ecological networks is usually a snapshop focused in a limited specific range
of space and time, prevent us to perceive the real dynamics of ecological
processes. By definition, an alien species has some ecological strategies and
traits that permit it to compete better than the native species (e.g. absence
of predators, different bloom period, high grow rate, etc.). Plant-pollinator
networks provide valuable services to whole ecosystems and the introduction of
an alien species may have different effects on the native network (competitive
facilitation, native species extinction, etc.). While scientists acknowledge
the significance of network connectivity in driving ecosystem services, the
inclusion of temporary networks in ecological models is still in its infancy.
We propose to use existing data on seasonality to develop a simulation platform
that show inference between temporality of networks and invasions traits. Our
focus is only to pick up some simple model to show, that theoretically temporal
aspect play a role (different extinction patterns) to encourage ecologist to
get involved in temporal networks. Moreover, the derived simulations could be
further extended and adjust to other ecological questions.
