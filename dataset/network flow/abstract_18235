We study a genetic regulatory network model developed to demonstrate that
genetic robustness can evolve through stabilizing selection for optimal
phenotypes. We report preliminary results on whether such selection could
result in a reorganization of the state space of the system. For the chosen
parameters, the evolution moves the system slightly toward the more ordered
part of the phase diagram. We also find that strong memory effects cause the
Derrida annealed approximation to give erroneous predictions about the model's
phase diagram.
