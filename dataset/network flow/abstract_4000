At low densities, when radiation of an accreting gas is dynamically
unimportant, quasi-spherical non-radiative accretion flow is formed around a
compact object. We show that the density of the flow is n\propto r^{-1/2}. The
gas compression is much weaker than the standard Bondi's, n\propto r^{-3/2},
because most of the gas does not reach the compact object. It can either
circulate indefinitely long or it can be launched to infinity.
