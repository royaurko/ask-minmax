We show that the injection of polymer chains into nanochannels becomes easier
as the channel becomes narrower. This counter intuitive result arises because
of a decrease in the diffusive time scale of the chains with increasing
confinement. The results are obtained by extending the de Gennes blob model of
confined polymers, and confirmed by hybrid molecular dynamics -
lattice-Boltzmann simulations.
