As location-based techniques and applications become ubiquitous in emerging
wireless networks, the verification of location information will become of
growing importance. This has led in recent years to an explosion of activity
related to location verification techniques in wireless networks, with a
specific focus on Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) being evident. Such focus
is largely due to the mission-critical nature of vehicle location verification
within the ITS scenario. In this work we review recent research in wireless
location verification related to the vehicular network scenario. We
particularly focus on location verification systems that rely on formal
mathematical classification frameworks, showing how many systems are either
partially or fully encompassed by such frameworks.
