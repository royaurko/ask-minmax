We consider the representation of operators in terms of tensor networks and
their application to ground-state approximation and time evolution of systems
with long-range interactions. We provide an explicit construction to represent
an arbitrary many-body Hamilton operator in terms of a one-dimensional tensor
network, i.e. as a matrix product operator. For pairwise interactions, we show
that such a representation is always efficient and requires a tensor dimension
growing only linearly with the number of particles. For systems obeying certain
symmetries or restrictions we find optimal representations with minimal tensor
dimension. We discuss the analytic and numerical approximation of operators in
terms of low-dimensional tensor operators. We demonstrate applications for time
evolution and ground-state approximation, in particular for long-range
interaction with inhomogeneous couplings. The operator representations are also
generalized to other geometries such as trees and 2D lattices, where we show
how to obtain and use efficient tensor network representations respecting a
given geometry.
