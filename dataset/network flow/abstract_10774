We find three types of steady solutions and remarkable flow pattern
transitions between them in a two-dimensional wavy-walled channel for low to
moderate Reynolds (Re) and Weissenberg (Wi) numbers using direct numerical
simulations with spectral element method. The solutions are called
"convective", "transition", and "elastic" in ascending order of Wi. In the
convective region in the Re-Wi parameter space, the convective effect and the
pressure gradient balance on average. As Wi increases, the elastic effect
becomes suddenly comparable and the first transition sets in. Through the
transition, a separation vortex disappears and a jet flow induced close to the
wall by the viscoelasticity moves into the bulk; The viscous drag significantly
drops and the elastic wall friction rises sharply. This transition is caused by
an elastic force in the streamwise direction due to the competition of the
convective and elastic effects. In the transition region, the convective and
elastic effects balance. When the elastic effect dominates the convective
effect, the second transition occurs but it is relatively moderate. The second
one seems to be governed by so-called Weissenberg effect. These transitions are
not sensitive to driving forces. By the scaling analysis, it is shown that the
stress component is proportional to the Reynolds number on the boundary of the
first transition in the Re-Wi space. This scaling coincides well with the
numerical result.
