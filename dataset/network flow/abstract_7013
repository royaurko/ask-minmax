We investigate the dynamics of the two-dimensional periodic Kolmogorov flow
of a viscoelastic fluid, described by the Oldroyd-B model, by means of direct
numerical simulations. Above a critical Weissenberg number the flow displays a
transition from stationary to randomly fluctuating states, via periodic ones.
The increasing complexity of the flow in both time and space at progressively
higher values of elasticity accompanies the establishment of mixing features.
The peculiar dynamical behavior observed in the simulations is found to be
related to the appearance of filamental propagating patterns, which develop
even in the limit of very small inertial non-linearities, thanks to the
feedback of elastic forces on the flow.
