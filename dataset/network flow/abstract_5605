From the perspective of reindustrialization, it is important to understand
the evolution of the structure of the network of organizations employment
structure, and organization value. Understanding the potential influence of
collaborative networks (CNs) on these aspects may lead to the development of
appropriate economic policies. In this paper, we propose a theoretical approach
to analysis this potential influence, based on a model of dynamic networked
ecosystem of organizations encompassing collaboration relations among
organization, employment mobility, and organization value. A large number of
simulations has been performed to identify factors influencing the structure of
the network of organizations employment structure, and organization value. The
main findings are that 1) the higher the number of members of CNs, the better
the clustering and the shorter the average path length among organizations; 2)
the constitution of CNs does not affect neither the structure of the network of
organizations, nor the employment structure and the organization value.
