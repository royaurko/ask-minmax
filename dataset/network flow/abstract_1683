Dynamical instabilities in fluid mechanics are responsible of a variety of
important common phenomena, such as waves on the sea surface or Taylor vorteces
in Couette flow. In granular media dynamical instabilities has just begun to be
discovered. Here we show by means of molecular dynamics simulation the
existence of a new dynamical instability of a granular mixture under
oscillating horizontal shear, which leads to the formation of a striped pattern
where the components are segregated. We investigate the properties of such a
Kelvin-Helmholtz like instability and show how it is connected to pattern
formation in granular flow and segregation.
