Continuing the study of bounded geometry for Riemannian foliations, begun by
Sanguiao, we introduce a chart-free definition of this concept. Our main
theorem states that it is equivalent to a condition involving certain normal
foliation charts. For this type of charts, it is also shown that the
derivatives of the changes of coordinates are uniformly bounded, and there are
nice partitions of unity. Applications to a trace formula for foliated flows
will given in a forthcoming paper.
