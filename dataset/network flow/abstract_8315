We study {\sc greedy} routing over $n$ nodes placed in a ring, with the
\emph{distance} between two nodes defined to be the clockwise or the absolute
distance between them along the ring. Such graphs arise in the context of
modeling social networks and in routing networks for peer-to-peer systems. We
construct the first network over $n$ nodes in which {\sc greedy} routing takes
$O(\log n / \log d)$ hops in the worst-case, with $d$ out-going links per node.
Our result has the first asymptotically optimal greedy routing complexity.
Previous constructions required $O(\frac{\log^2 n}{d})$ hops.
