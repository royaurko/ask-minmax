An optical beam is said to be self-healing when, distorted by an obstacle,
the beam corrects itself upon propagation. In this letter, we show through
experiments supported by numerical simulations, that Helico-conical optical
beams (HCOBs) self-heal. We observe the strong resilience of these beams with
different types of obstructions, and relate this to the characteristics of
their transverse energy flow.
