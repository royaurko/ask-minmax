The Gene Ontology (GO) provides biologists with a controlled terminology that
describes how genes are associated with functions and how functional terms are
related to each other. These term-term relationships encode how scientists
conceive the organization of biological functions, and they take the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG). Here, we propose that the network structure of
gene-term annotations made using GO can be employed to establish an alternate
natural way to group the functional terms which is different from the
hierarchical structure established in the GO DAG. Instead of relying on an
externally defined organization for biological functions, our method connects
biological functions together if they are performed by the same genes, as
indicated in a compendium of gene annotation data from numerous different
experiments. We show that grouping terms by this alternate scheme is distinct
from term relationships defined in the ontological structure and provides a new
framework with which to describe and predict the functions of experimentally
identified sets of genes.
