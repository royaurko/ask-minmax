This paper introduces the concept of rate privacy in the context of wireless
sensor networks. Our discussion reveals that the concept indeed is of a great
importance for the privacy preservation of such networks. As a result, we
propose a buffering scheme to protect the rate from adversaries. Simulation
results verify the applicability of our approach.
