We will introduce the Rohlin property for flows on von Neumann algebras and
classify them up to strong cocycle conjugacy. This result provides alternative
approaches to some preceding results such as Kawahigashi's classification of
flows on the injective type II$_1$ factor, the classification of injective type
III factors due to Connes, Krieger and Haagerup and the non-fullness of type
III$_0$ factors. Several concrete examples are also studied.
