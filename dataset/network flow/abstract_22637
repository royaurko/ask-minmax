We study the effect of non-homogeneous out-of-plane magnetic field on the
behaviour of 2D spatially indirect excitons. Due to the difference of magnetic
field acting on electrons and holes the total Lorentz force affecting the
center of mass motion of an indirect exciton appears. Consequently, an indirect
exciton acquires an effective charge proportional to the gradient of the
magnetic field. The appearance of the Lorentz force causes the Hall effect for
neutral bosons which can be detected by measurement of the spatially
inhomogeneous blueshift of the photoluminescence using counter-flow experiment.
