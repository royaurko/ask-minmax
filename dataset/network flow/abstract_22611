A thin gaseous disc with an almost keplerian angular velocity profile,
bounded by a free surface and rotating around point-mass gravitating object is
nearly spectrally stable. Despite that the substantial transient growth of
linear perturbations measured by the evolution of their acoustic energy is
possible. This fact is demonstrated for the simple model of a non-viscous
polytropic thin disc of a finite radial size where the small adiabatic
perturbations are considered as a linear combination of neutral modes with a
corotational radius located beyond the outer boundary of the flow.
