In [Combinatorics, Probability and Computing 16 (2007), 557 - 593, Theorem 1]
we proved a polynomial-time bound on the mixing rate of the switch chain for
sampling d-regular graphs. This corrigendum corrects a technical error in the
proof. In order to fix the error, we must multiply the bound on the mixing time
by a factor of d^8 .
