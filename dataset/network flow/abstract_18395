Positive feedback regulation is ubiquitous in cell signaling networks, often
leading to binary outcomes in response to graded stimuli. However, the role of
such feedbacks in clustering, and in spatial spreading of activated molecules,
has come to be appreciated only recently. We focus on the latter, using a
simple model developed in the context of Ras activation with competing negative
and positive feedback mechanisms. We find that positive feedback, in the
presence of slow diffusion, results in clustering of activated molecules on the
plasma membrane, and rapid spatial spreading as the front of the cluster
propagates with a constant velocity (dependent on the feedback strength). The
advancing fronts of the clusters of the activated species are rough, with
scaling consistent with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in one
dimension. Our minimal model is general enough to describe signal transduction
in a wide variety of biological networks where activity in the
membrane-proximal region is subject to feedback regulation.
