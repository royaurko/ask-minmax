In peer-to-peer file sharing network, it is hard to distinguish between a
legitimate newcomer and a whitewasher. This makes whitewashing a big problem in
peer-to-peer networks. Although the problem of whitewashing can be solved using
permanent identities, it may take away the right of anonymity for users. In
this paper, we a have proposed a novel algorithm to avoid this problem when
network uses free temporary identities. In this algorithm, the initial
reputation is adjusted according to the level of whitewashing in the network.
