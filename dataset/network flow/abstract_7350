This technical document describes the comparison of the EPICS PV gateway and
a new solution based on relay of UDP packets using the UDP-HELPER switch
feature, iptables and a C program. The solution can be applied on environments
that contain multiple sub-networks and a number of IOCs on the same host or
multiple IOCs on the same sub-network.
