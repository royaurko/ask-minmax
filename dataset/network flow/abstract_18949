The problem and implications of community detection in networks have raised a
huge attention, for its important applications in both natural and social
sciences. A number of algorithms has been developed to solve this problem,
addressing either speed optimization or the quality of the partitions
calculated. In this paper we propose a multi-step procedure bridging the
fastest, but less accurate algorithms (coarse clustering), with the slowest,
most effective ones (refinement). By adopting heuristic ranking of the nodes,
and classifying a fraction of them as `critical', a refinement step can be
restricted to this subset of the network, thus saving computational time.
Preliminary numerical results are discussed, showing improvement of the final
partition.
