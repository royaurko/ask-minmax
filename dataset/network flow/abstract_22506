We show that magnetic dipolar interactions can stabilize superfluidity in
atomic gases but the dipole alignment direction required to achieve this
varies, depending on whether the flow is oscillatory or continuous. If a
condensate is made to oscillate through a lattice, damping of the oscillations
can be reduced by aligning the dipoles perpendicular to the direction of
motion. However, if a lattice is driven continuously through the condensate,
superfluid behavior is best preserved when the dipoles are aligned parallel to
the direction of motion. We explain these results in terms of the formation of
topological excitations and tunnel barrier heights between lattice sites.
