We revisit a recently introduced agent model[ACS {\bf 11}, 99 (2008)], where
economic growth is a consequence of education (human capital formation) and
innovation, and investigate the influence of the agents' social network, both
on an agent's decision to pursue education and on the output of new ideas.
Regular and random networks are considered. The results are compared with the
predictions of a mean field (representative agent) model.
