Interconnection networks of parallel systems are used for servicing traf- fic
generated by different applications, often belonging to different users. When
multiple traffic flows contend for channel bandwidth, the scheduling algorithm
regulating the access to that channel plays a key role in ensur- ing that each
flow obtains the required quality of service. Fairness is a highly desirable
property for a scheduling algorithm. We show that using the Relative Fairness
Bound as a fairness measure may lead to decrease in throughput and increase in
latency. We propose an alternative metric to evaluate the fairness and avoid
the drawback of Relative Fairness Bound.
