A central problem in gravitational wave research is the {\it generation
problem}, i.e., the problem of relating the outgoing gravitational wave field
to the structure and motion of the material source. This problem has become, in
recent years, of increased interest in view of the development of a worldwide
network of gravitational wave detectors. We review recent progress in {\it
analytical} methods of tackling the gravitational wave generation problem. In
particular, we describe recent work in an approach which consists of matching a
post-Newtonian expansion of the metric near the material source with a
multipolar-post-Minkowskian expansion of the external metric. The results of
such analytical methods are important notably for providing accurate
theoretical predictions for the most promising targets of the LIGO/VIRGO
interferometric network: the ``chirp'' gravitational waveforms emitted during
the radiation-reaction-driven inspiral of binary systems of compact objects
(neutron stars or black holes).
