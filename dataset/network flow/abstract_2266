It is investigated a possibility of physical interpretation of vector fields
(dynamic flows) in Euclidean spaces of higher dimension. There are analyzed the
methods of measurements of dynamic flows, the characteristics of dynamic flow
and the connection between its differential and integral characteristics. It is
obtained the criterion of local minimality of (n-1)-surfaces that is not
connected with interior geometry of surface. It is analyzed some analogy
between harmonicity of dynamic flows and dynamic principle of nature.
