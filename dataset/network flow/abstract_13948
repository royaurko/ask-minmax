Direct observations over the past four centuries show that the number of
sunspots observed on the Sun's surface vary periodically, going through
successive maxima and minima. Following sunspot cycle 23, the Sun went into a
prolonged minimum characterized by a very weak polar magnetic field and an
unusually large number of days without sunspots. Sunspots are strongly
magnetized regions and are generated by a dynamo mechanism which recreates the
solar polar field mediated via plasma flows. Here we report results from
kinematic dynamo simulations which demonstrate that a fast meridional flow in
the early half of a cycle, followed by a slower flow in the latter half,
reproduces both the characteristics of the minimum of sunspot cycle 23 - a
large number of spotless days and a relatively weak polar field. Our model
predicts that, in general, very deep minima are associated with weak polar
fields. Sunspots govern the solar radiative energy and radio flux, and in
conjunction with the polar field, modulate the solar wind, heliospheric open
flux and consequently cosmic ray flux at Earth; our results therefore provide a
causal link between solar internal dynamics and the atypical values of these
heliospheric forcing parameters during the recently concluded solar minimum.
