The strategy and techniques for analyzing anisotropic flow (directed,
elliptic, etc.) in relativistic nuclear collisions are presented. The emphasis
is on the use of the Fourier expansion of azimuthal distributions. We present
formulae relevant for this approach, and in particular, show how the event
multiplicity enters into the event plane resolution. We also discuss the role
of non-flow correlations and a method for introducing flow into a simulation.
