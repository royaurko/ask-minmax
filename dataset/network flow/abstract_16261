We investigate a steady flow of a viscous compressible fluid with inflow
boundary condition on the density and inhomogeneous slip boundary conditions on
the velocity in a cylindrical domain $\Omega = \Omega_0 \times (0,L) \in
\mathbb{R}^3$. We show existence of a solution $(v,\rho) \in W^2_p(\Omega)
\times W^1_p(\Omega)$, where $v$ is the velocity of the fluid and $\rho$ is the
density, that is a small perturbation of a constant flow $(\bar v \equiv
[1,0,0], \bar \rho \equiv 1)$. We also show that this solution is unique in a
class of small perturbations of $(\bar v,\bar \rho)$. The term $u \cdot \nabla
w$ in the continuity equation makes it impossible to show the existence
applying directly a fixed point method. Thus in order to show existence of the
solution we construct a sequence $(v^n,\rho^n)$ that is bounded in
$W^2_p(\Omega) \times W^1_p(\Omega)$ and satisfies the Cauchy condition in a
larger space $L_{\infty}(0,L;L_2(\Omega_0))$ what enables us to deduce that the
weak limit of a subsequence of $(v^n,\rho^n)$ is in fact a strong solution to
our problem.
