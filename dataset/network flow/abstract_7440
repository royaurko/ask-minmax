A new stochastic cellular automaton (CA) model of traffic flow, which
includes slow-to-start effects and a driver's perspective, is proposed by
extending the Burgers CA and the Nagel-Schreckenberg CA model. The flow-density
relation of this model shows multiple metastable branches near the transition
density from free to congested traffic, which form a wide scattering area in
the fundamental diagram. The stability of these branches and their velocity
distributions are explicitly studied by numerical simulations.
