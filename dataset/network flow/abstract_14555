In the Israel-Stewart's theory of second order hydrodynamics, we have
simulated $\sqrt{s}$=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. ALICE data for the centrality
dependence of charged particles multiplicity, $p_T$ spectra in 0-5% collisions,
centrality dependence of integrated and differential elliptic flow are
analysed. Analysis indicate that while ALICE data on charged particles
multiplicity or $p_T$ spectra do not demand any viscosity, viscosity is
demanded by the elliptic flow data. From a simulataneous fit to all the data
sets, viscosity to entropy ratio in $\sqrt{s}_{NN}$=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions
is extracted as, $\eta/s=0.06\pm 0.02$.
