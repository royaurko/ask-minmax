Recently, a framework for analyzing time series by constructing an associated
complex network has attracted significant research interest. One of the
advantages of the complex network method for studying time series is that
complex network theory provides a tool to describe either important nodes, or
structures that exist in the networks, at different topological scale. This can
then provide distinct information for time series of different dynamical
systems. In this paper, we systematically investigate the recurrence-based
phase space network of order $k$ that has previously been used to specify
different types of dynamics in terms of the motif ranking from a different
perspective. Globally, we find that the network size scales with different
scale exponents and the degree distribution follows a quasi-symmetric bell
shape around the value of $2k$ with different values of degree variance from
periodic to chaotic R\"{o}ssler systems. Local network properties such as the
vertex degree, the clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality are found
to be sensitive to the local stability of the orbits and hence contain
complementary information.
