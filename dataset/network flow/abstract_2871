Current network models assume one type of links to define the relations
between the network entities. However, many real networks can only be correctly
described using two different types of relations. Connectivity links that
enable the nodes to function cooperatively as a network and dependency links
that bind the failure of one network element to the failure of other network
elements. Here we present for the first time an analytical framework for
studying the robustness of networks that include both connectivity and
dependency links. We show that the synergy between the two types of failures
leads to an iterative process of cascading failures that has a devastating
effect on the network stability and completely alters the known assumptions
regarding the robustness of networks. We present exact analytical results for
the dramatic change in the network behavior when introducing dependency links.
For a high density of dependency links the network disintegrates in a form of a
first order phase transition while for a low density of dependency links the
network disintegrates in a second order transition. Moreover, opposed to
networks containing only connectivity links where a broader degree distribution
results in a more robust network, when both types of links are present a broad
degree distribution leads to higher vulnerability.
