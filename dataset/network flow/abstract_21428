We use a gaseous model and a semi-analytical approach to study the evolution
of a super-massive central gaseous object (a super-massive star, (SMS from now
on) in an AGN and its evolution by interactions with the surrounding stellar
system. Our future work in this field is outlined, which aims at a more
detailed study of energy flows in the interstellar medium, stellar evolution
and the relation between QSOs and galaxy formation.
