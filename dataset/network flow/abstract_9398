Companies are exposed to rigid competition, so they seek how best to improve
the capabilities of their innovations. One strategy is to collaborate with
other companies in order to speed up their own innovations. Such inter-company
collaborations are conducted by inventors belonging to the companies. At the
same time, the inventors also seem to be affected by past collaborations
between companies. Therefore, interdependency of two networks, namely inventor
and company networks, exists.
  This paper discusses a model that replicates two-layer networks extracted
from patent data of Japan and the United States in terms of degree
distributions. The model replicates two-layer networks with the
interdependency. Moreover it is the only model that uses local information,
while other models have to use overall information, which is unrealistic. In
addition, the proposed model replicates empirical data better than other
models.
