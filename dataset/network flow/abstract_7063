The consistency of time--distance inversions for horizontal components of the
plasma flow on supergranular scales in the upper solar convection zone is
checked by comparing the results derived using two k--\omega filtering
procedures -- ridge filtering and phase-speed filtering -- commonly used in
time--distance helioseismology. It is shown that both approaches result in
similar flow estimates when finite-frequency sensitivity kernels are used. It
is further demonstrated that the performance of the inversion improves (in
terms of simultaneously better averaging kernel and lower noise level) when the
two approaches are combined together in one inversion. Using the combined
inversion I invert for horizontal flows in the upper 10 Mm of the solar
convection zone. The flows connected with supergranulation seem to be coherent
only in the upper ~5 Mm depth, deeper down there is a hint on change of
convection scales towards structures larger than supergranules.
