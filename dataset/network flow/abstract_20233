We present the results on the energy flow measured with minimum-bias data
collected by the LHCb experiment in pp collisions at sqrt{s}=7 TeV for
inclusive minimum-bias interactions, hard scattering processes and events with
enhanced or suppressed diffractive contribution. The measurements are performed
in the pseudorapidity range 1.9<\eta<4.9, which corresponds to the main
detector acceptance of the LHCb spectrometer. The data are compared to
predictions given by the PYTHIA-based and cosmic-ray Monte Carlo event
generators, which model the underlying event activity in different ways.
