We consider the effect of weak disorder on eigenstates in a special class of
tight-binding models. Models in this class have short-range hopping on periodic
lattices; their defining feature is that the clean systems have some energy
bands that are dispersionless throughout the Brillouin zone. We show that
states derived from these flat bands are generically critical in the presence
of weak disorder, being neither Anderson localised nor spatially extended.
Further, we establish a mapping between this localisation problem and the one
of resonances in random impedance networks, which previous work has suggested
are also critical. Our conclusions are illustrated using numerical results for
a two-dimensional lattice, known as the square lattice with crossings or the
planar pyrochlore lattice.
