We study the dewetting of a porous plate withdrawn from a bath of fluid. The
microscopic contact angle is fixed to zero and the flow is assumed to be
parallel to the plate (lubrication approximation). The ordinary differential
equation involving the position of the water surface is analysed in phase space
by means of numerical integration. We show the existence of a critical value of
the capillary number $\eta U / \gamma$, above which no stationary contact line
can exist. An analytical model, based on asymptotic matching is developed, that
reproduces the dependence of the critical capillary number on the angle of the
plate with respect to the horizontal for large control parameters (3/2 power
law).
