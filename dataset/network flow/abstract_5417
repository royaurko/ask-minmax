We consider a class of stochastic processing networks. Assume that the
networks satisfy a complete resource pooling condition. We prove that each
maximum pressure policy asymptotically minimizes the workload process in a
stochastic processing network in heavy traffic. We also show that, under each
quadratic holding cost structure, there is a maximum pressure policy that
asymptotically minimizes the holding cost. A key to the optimality proofs is to
prove a state space collapse result and a heavy traffic limit theorem for the
network processes under a maximum pressure policy. We extend a framework of
Bramson [Queueing Systems Theory Appl. 30 (1998) 89--148] and Williams
[Queueing Systems Theory Appl. 30 (1998b) 5--25] from the multiclass queueing
network setting to the stochastic processing network setting to prove the state
space collapse result and the heavy traffic limit theorem. The extension can be
adapted to other studies of stochastic processing networks.
