We show that there exists a suitable neighborhood of a constant curvature
hyperbolic metric such that, for all initial data in this neighborhood, the
corresponding solution to a normalized cross curvature flow exists for all time
and converges to a hyperbolic metric. We show that the same technique proves an
analogous result for Ricci flow. Additionally, we show short time existence and
uniqueness of cross curvature flow for a more general class of initial data
than was previously known.
