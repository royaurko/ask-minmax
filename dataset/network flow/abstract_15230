Like many other social phenomena, prostitution is increasingly coordinated
over the Internet. The online behavior affects the offline activity; the
reverse is also true. We investigated the reported sexual contacts between
6,624 anonymous escorts and 10,106 sex-buyers extracted from an online
community from its beginning and six years on. These sexual encounters were
also graded and categorized (in terms of the type of sexual activities
performed) by the buyers. From the temporal, bipartite network of posts, we
found a full feedback loop in which high grades on previous posts affect the
future commercial success of the sex-worker, and vice versa. We also found a
peculiar growth pattern in which the turnover of community members and sex
workers causes a sublinear preferential attachment. There is, moreover, a
strong geographic influence on network structure-the network is geographically
clustered but still close to connected, the contacts consistent with the
inverse-square law observed in trading patterns. We also found that the number
of sellers scales sublinearly with city size, so this type of prostitution does
not, comparatively speaking, benefit much from an increasing concentration of
people.
