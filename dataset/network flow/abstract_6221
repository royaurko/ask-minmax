We analyze the non-equilibrium order-disorder transition of Axelrod's model
of social interaction in several complex networks. In a small world network, we
find a transition between an ordered homogeneous state and a disordered state.
The transition point is shifted by the degree of spatial disorder of the
underlying network, the network disorder favoring ordered configurations. In
random scale-free networks the transition is only observed for finite size
systems, showing system size scaling, while in the thermodynamic limit only
ordered configurations are always obtained. Thus in the thermodynamic limit the
transition disappears. However, in structured scale-free networks, the phase
transition between an ordered and a disordered phase is restored.
