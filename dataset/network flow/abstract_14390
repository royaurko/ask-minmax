As a step toward understanding the analytic behavior of Type-III Ricci flow
singularities, i.e. immortal solutions that exhibit |Rm|<C/t curvature decay,
we examine the linearization of an equivalent flow at fixed points discovered
recently by Baird--Danielo and Lott: nongradient homogeneous expanding Ricci
solitons on nilpotent or solvable Lie groups. For all explicitly known
nonproduct examples, we demonstrate linear stability of the flow at these fixed
points and prove that the linearizations generate strongly continuous
semigroups.
