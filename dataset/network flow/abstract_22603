We establish a one-parameter family of Harnack inequalities connecting the
constrained trace Li-Yau differential Harnack inequality for a nonlinear
parabolic equation to the constrained trace Chow-Hamilton Harnack inequality
for this nonlinear equation with respect to evolving metrics related to Ricci
flow on a 2-dimensional closed manifold. This result can be regarded as a
nonlinear version of the previous work of Y. Zheng and the contributor (Arch. Math.
94 (2010), 591-600).
