Rainfall in Kerala State, the southern part of Indian Peninsula in particular
is caused by the two monsoons and the two cyclones every year. In general,
climate and rainfall are highly nonlinear phenomena in nature giving rise to
what is known as the `butterfly effect'. We however attempt to train an ABF
neural network on the time series rainfall data and show for the first time
that in spite of the fluctuations resulting from the nonlinearity in the
system, the trends in the rainfall pattern in this corner of the globe have
remained unaffected over the past 87 years from 1893 to 1980. We also
successfully filter out the chaotic part of the system and illustrate that its
effects are marginal over long term predictions.
