In this paper, a distributed convex optimization framework is developed for
energy trading between islanded microgrids. More specifically, the problem
consists of several islanded microgrids that exchange energy flows by means of
an arbitrary topology. Due to scalability issues and in order to safeguard
local information on cost functions, a subgradient-based cost minimization
algorithm is proposed that converges to the optimal solution in a practical
number of iterations and with a limited communication overhead. Furthermore,
this approach allows for a very intuitive economics interpretation that
explains the algorithm iterations in terms of "supply--demand model" and
"market clearing". Numerical results are given in terms of convergence rate of
the algorithm and attained costs for different network topologies.
