The effect of strong shear flow on highly fluctuating lamellar systems
stabilized by intermembrane collisions via the Helfrich interaction is studied.
Advection enters the microscopic equation of motion for a single membrane via a
non-linear coupling. Upon coarse-graining the theory for a single bilayer up to
the length scale of the collision length, at which a hydrodynamic description
applies, an additional dynamical coupling is generated which is of the form of
a wavevector-dependent tension that is non-linear in the applied shear rate.
This new term has consequences for the effects of strong flow on the stability
and dynamics of lamellar surfactant phases.
