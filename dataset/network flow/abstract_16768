We study the spreading of an infection within an SIS epidemiological model on
a network. Susceptible agents are given the opportunity of breaking their links
with infected agents. Broken links are either permanently removed or
reconnected with the rest of the population. Thus, the network coevolves with
the population as the infection progresses. We show that a moderate
reconnection frequency is enough to completely suppress the infection. A
partial, rather weak isolation of infected agents suffices to eliminate the
endemic state.
