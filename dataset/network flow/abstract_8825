We study a Neumann problem related to the evolution of graphs under mean
curvature flow in Riemannian manifolds endowed with a Killing vector field. We
prove that in a particular case these graphs converge to a bounded minimal
graph which contacts the cylinder over the domain orthogonally along its
boundary.
