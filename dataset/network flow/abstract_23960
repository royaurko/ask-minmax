If a computer node is infected by a virus, worm or a backdoor, then this is a
security risk for the complete network structure where the node is associated.
Existing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) provide a certain amount of
support for the identification of such infected nodes but suffer from the need
of plenty of communication and computational power. In this article, we present
a novel approach called AGNOSCO to support the identification of infected nodes
through the usage of artificial ant colonies. It is shown that AGNOSCO
overcomes the communication and computational power problem while identifying
infected nodes properly.
