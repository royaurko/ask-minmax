We use the standard Runge-Kutta method to solve the set of basic equations
describing black hole accretion flows composed of two-temperature plasma. We do
not invoke any extra energy transport mechanism such as thermal conduction and
do not specify any ad hoc outer boundary condition for the advection-dominated
accretion flow (ADAF) solution. We find that in the case of high viscosity and
non-zero radiative cooling, the ADAF solution can have an asymptotic approach
to the Shakura-Sunyaev disk (SSD) solution, and the SSD-ADAF transition radius
is close to the central black hole. Our results further prove the mechanism of
thermal instability-triggered SSD-ADAF transition suggested previously by
Takeuchi & Mineshige and Gu & Lu.
