In this paper, we study the discrete Morse flow for the Ricci flow on
football, which is the 2-sphere with removed north and south poles and with the
metric $g_0$ of constant scalar curvature, and and for Porous media equation on
a bounded regular domain in the plane. We show that with a suitable assumption
about $g(0)$ we have a weak approximated discrete Morse flow for the
approximated Ricci flow and Porous media equation on any time intervals.
