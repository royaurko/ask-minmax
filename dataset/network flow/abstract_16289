The paper deals with a theoretical study of the transport of a fluid in a
channel, which takes place by the phenomenon of peristalsis. A mathematical
analysis of the said problem has been presented. The analysis involves the
application of a suitable perturbation technique. The velocity profile and the
critical pressure for the occurrence of reflux are investigated with particular
emphasis by using appropriate numerical methods. The effects of various
parameters, such as Reynolds number, pressure gradient, porosity parameter,
Darcy number, slip parameter, amplitude ratio and wave number on velocity and
critical pressure for reflux are investigated in detail. The computed results
are compared with a previous analytical work and an experimental investigation
reported earlier in existing scientific literatures. The results of the present
study are in conformity to both of them. The study has got some relevance to
the physiological flow of bile in the common bile duct in a pathological state.
It reveals that in the presence of gallstones, bile velocity increases as the
value of the porosity parameter increases, while the critical pressure for
reflux decreases as porosity increases.
