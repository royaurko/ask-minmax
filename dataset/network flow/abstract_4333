Based upon the correlation matrix of the human promoter sequences, a complex
network is constructed to capture the principal relationships between these
promoters. It is a complex network has the properties of the right-skewed
degree distribution and the clustering simultaneously, i.e., a hierarchical
structure. An eigenvector centrality (EC) based method is used to reconstruct
this hierarchical structure.
