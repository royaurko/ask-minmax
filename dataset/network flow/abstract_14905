We present high angular resolution ($\sim$0.94$"$) $^{12}$CO(1-0) Atacama
Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations obtained during the
2014 long baseline campaign from the eruptive bipolar flow from the multiple XZ
Tau stellar system discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These
observations reveal, for the first time, the kinematics of the molecular flow.
The kinematics of the different ejections close to XZ Tau reveal a rotating and
expanding structure with a southeast-northwest velocity gradient. The youngest
eruptive bubbles unveiled in the optical HST images are inside of this
molecular expanding structure. Additionally, we report a very compact and
collimated bipolar outflow emanating from XZ Tau A, which indicates that the
eruptive outflow is indeed originating from this object. The mass (3 $\times$
10$^{-7}$ $M_\odot$) and energetics (E$_{kin}$ $=$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{37}$ ergs)
for the collimated outflow are comparable with those found in molecular
outflows associated with young brown dwarfs.
