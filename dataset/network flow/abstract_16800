This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the degree statistics in
models for growing networks where new nodes enter one at a time and attach to
one earlier node according to a stochastic rule. The models with uniform
attachment, linear attachment (the Barab\'asi-Albert model), and generalized
preferential attachment with initial attractiveness are successively
considered. The main emphasis is on finite-size (i.e., finite-time) effects,
which are shown to exhibit different behaviors in three regimes of the
size-degree plane: stationary, finite-size scaling, large deviations.
