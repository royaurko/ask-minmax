We consider closed immersed hypersurfaces in $\R^{3}$ and $\R^4$ evolving by
a class of constrained surface diffusion flows. Our result, similar to earlier
results for the Willmore flow, gives both a positive lower bound on the time
for which a smooth solution exists, and a small upper bound on a power of the
total curvature during this time. By phrasing the theorem in terms of the
concentration of curvature in the initial surface, our result holds for very
general initial data and has applications to further development in asymptotic
analysis for these flows.
