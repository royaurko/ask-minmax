Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is the self organizing collection of mobile
nodes. The communication in MANET is done via a wireless media. Ad hoc wireless
networks have massive commercial and military potential because of their
mobility support. Due to demanding real time multimedia applications, Quality
of Services (QoS) support in such infrastructure less networks have become
essential. QoS routing in mobile Ad-Hoc networks is challenging due to rapid
change in network topology. Consequently, the available state information for
routing is inherently imprecise. QoS routing may suffer badly due to several
factors including radio interference on available bandwidth, and inefficient
flooding of information to the adjacent nodes. As a result the performance of
the network degrades substantially. This paper aims at the solution for energy
efficient QoS routing by best utilization of network resources such as energy
and bandwidth. A comparative study shows that despite the overhead due to QoS
management, this solution performs better than classical OLSR protocol in terms
of QoS and efficient utilization of energy.
