We proved a uniqueness theorem of tangent connections for a
 Yang-Mills connection with an isolated singularity with a quadratic growth of
the curvature at the singularity. We also obtained controls over the rate of
the asymptotic convergence of the connection to the tangent connection under
assumptions that the connection is stationary or the tangent connection is
integrable. There are parallel results for the cones at infinity of a
Yang-Mills connection on an asymptotically flat manifold. We also gave an
application of our methods to the Yang-Mills flow and proved that the
Yang-Mills flow exists for all time and has asymptotic limit if the initial
value is close to a smooth local minimizer of the Yang-Mills functional.
