In this paper, contributor will discuss a practical problem Urban Traffic with
graph theory algorithms. We will study those features, and try to simplify the
complexity of this dynamic system. These contents mainly contain how to analyze
a decivion problem with Combinatorial Formula and graph theory algorithms, how
to optimize our strategy for feasible solution with other method of Computer
Science.
