L.A. Bunimovich and B.Z. Webb developed a theory for isospectral graph
reduction. We make a simple observation regarding the relation between
eigenvectors of the original graph and its reduction, that sheds new light on
this theory. As an application we propose an updating algorithm for the maximal
eigenvector of the Markov matrix associated to a large sparse dynamical
network.
