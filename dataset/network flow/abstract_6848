Let $F:\Sigma^n \times [0,T)\to \R^{n+m}$ be a family of compact immersed
submanifolds moving by their mean curvature vectors. We show the Gauss maps
$\gamma:(\Sigma^n, g_t)\to G(n, m)$ form a harmonic heat flow with respect to
the time-dependent induced metric $g_t$. This provides a more systematic
approach to investigating higher codimension mean curvature flows. A direct
consequence is any convex function on $G(n,m)$ produces a subsolution of the
nonlinear heat equation on $(\Sigma, g_t)$. We also show the condition that the
image of the Gauss map lies in a totally geodesic submanifold of $G(n, m)$ is
preserved by the mean curvature flow. Since the space of Lagrangian subspaces
is totally geodesic in G(n,n), this gives an alternative proof that any
Lagrangian submanifold remains Lagrangian along the mean curvature flow.
