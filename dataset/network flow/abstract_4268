Connection topologies of many networked systems like human brain, biological
cell, world wide web, power grids, human society and ecological food webs
markedly deviate from that of completely random networks indicating the
presence of organizing principles behind their evolution. The five important
features that characterize such networks are scale-free topology, small average
path length, high clustering, hierarchical community structure and assortative
mixing. Till now the generic mechanisms underlying the existence of these
properties are not well understood. Here we show that potentially a single
mechanism, which we call "mediated attachment", where two nodes get connected
through a mediator or common neighbor, could be responsible for the emergence
of all important properties of real networks. The mediated attachment naturally
unifies scale-free topology, high clustering, small world nature, hierarchical
community structure and dissortative nature of networks. Further, with
additional mixing by age, this can also explain the assortative structure of
social networks. The mechanism of mediated attachment seems to be directly
present in acquaintance networks, co-contributorships, World Wide Web, metabolic
networks, co-citations and linguistics. We anticipate that this mechanism will
shed new light on percolation and robustness properties of real world networks
as well as would give new insights in processes like epidemics spreading and
emergent dynamics taking place on them.
