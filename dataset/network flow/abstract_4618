The non-Newtonian character of granular flow in a vertical pipe is analyzed.
The time evolution of the flow velocity and the velocity fluctuations (or
granular temperature) is derived. The steady state velocity has a power law
dependence on the pipe width with an exponent between 3/4 and 3/2. The flow
becomes faster the more efficient the collisional cooling is, provided the
density remains low enough. The dependence of collisional cooling on the solid
fraction, the restitution coefficient and a possible electric charge of all
grains is discussed in detail.
