With the success of P2P file sharing, new emerging P2P applications arise on
the Internet for streaming content like voice (VoIP) or live video (IPTV).
Nowadays, there are lots of works measuring P2P file sharing or P2P telephony
systems, but there is still no comprehensive study about P2P IPTV, whereas it
should be massively used in the future. During the last FIFA world cup, we
measured network traffic generated by P2P IPTV applications like PPlive,
PPstream, TVants and Sopcast. In this paper we analyze some of our results
during the same games for the applications. We focus on traffic statistics and
churn of peers within these P2P networks. Our objectives are threefold: we
point out the traffic generated to understand the impact they will have on the
network, we try to infer the mechanisms of such applications and highlight
differences, and we give some insights about the users' behavior.
