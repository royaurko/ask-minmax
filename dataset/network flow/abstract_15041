In a Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), spike emissions are sparsely and
irregularly distributed both in time and in the network architecture. Since a
current feature of SNNs is a low average activity, efficient implementations of
SNNs are usually based on an Event-Driven Simulation (EDS). On the other hand,
simulations of large scale neural networks can take advantage of distributing
the neurons on a set of processors (either workstation cluster or parallel
computer). This article presents DAMNED, a large scale SNN simulation framework
able to gather the benefits of EDS and parallel computing. Two levels of
parallelism are combined: Distributed mapping of the neural topology, at the
network level, and local multithreaded allocation of resources for simultaneous
processing of events, at the neuron level. Based on the causality of events, a
distributed solution is proposed for solving the complex problem of scheduling
without synchronization barrier.
