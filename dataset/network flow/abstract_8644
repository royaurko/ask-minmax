Different Boolean networks may reveal similar dynamics although their
definition differs, then preventing their distinction from the observations.
This raises the question about the sufficiency of a particular Boolean network
for properly reproducing a modeled phenomenon to make realistic predictions.
The question actually depends on the invariant properties of behaviorally
similar Boolean networks. In this article, we address this issue by considering
that the similarity is formalized by isomorphism on graphs modeling their
dynamics. The similarity also depends on the parameter governing the updating
policy, called the mode. We define a general characterization of the group of
isomorphism preserving the mode. From this characterization, we deduce
invariant structural properties of the interaction graph and conditions to
maintain an equivalence through mode variation.
