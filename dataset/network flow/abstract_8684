The topic of this chapter is the role of expert programming knowledge in the
understanding activity. In the "schema-based approach", the role of semantic
structures is emphasized whereas, in the "control-flow approach", the role of
syntactic structures is emphasized. Data which support schema-based models of
understanding are presented. Data which are more consistent with the
"control-flow approach" allow to discuss the limits of the former kind of
models.
