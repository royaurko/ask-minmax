The thermodynamic and retrieval properties of the Ashkin-Teller neural
network model storing an infinite number of patterns are examined in the
replica-symmetric mean-field approximation. In particular, for linked patterns
temperature-capacity phase diagrams are derived for different values of the
two-neuron and four-neuron coupling strengths. This model can be considered as
a particular non-trivial generalisation of the Hopfield model and exhibits a
number of interesting new features. Some aspects of replica-symmetry breaking
are discussed.
