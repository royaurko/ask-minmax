A 2D tunneling network consisting of nanoclusters placed on a surface is
studied. It is shown that such a network is capable of transferring large
supercurrent at high temperatures. For a realistic set of parameters the
damping is quite small, and the smallness is due to strong renormalization of
the capacitance of a cluster. The critical field also turns out to be lar
