We study the propagation of cascading failures in complex supply networks
with a focus on nonlocal effects occurring far away from the initial failure.
It is shown that a high clustering and a small average path length of a network
generally suppress nonlocal overloads. These properties are typical for many
real-world networks, often called small-world networks, such that cascades
propagate mostly locally in these networks. Furthermore, we analyze the spatial
aspects of countermeasures based on the intentional removal of additional
edges. Nonlocal actions are generally required in networks which have a low
redundancy and are thus especially vulnerable to cascades.
