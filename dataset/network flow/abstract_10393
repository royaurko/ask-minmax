In this paper we present the first variational spatial-temporal decomposition
algorithm for computation of the optical flow of a dynamic sequence. We
consider several applications, such as the extraction of temporal motion
patterns of different scales and motion detection in dynamic sequences under
varying illumination conditions, such as they appear for instance in
psychological flickering experiments. In order to take into account variable
illumination conditions we review the derivation, and modify, the optical flow
equation. Concerning the numerical implementation, we propose a relaxation
approach for the adapted model such that the resulting optimality condition is
an integro-differential equation, which is numerically solved by a fixed point
iteration. For comparison purposes we use the standard time dependent optical
flow algorithm from Weickert-Schn\"orr, which in contrast to our method,
constitutes in solving a spatial-temporal differential equation.
