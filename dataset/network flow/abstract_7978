For Anosov flows preserving a smooth measure on a closed manifold
$\mathcal{M}$, we define a natural self-adjoint operator $\Pi$ which maps into
the space of invariant distributions in $\cap_{u<0} H^{u}(\mathcal{M})$ and
whose kernel is made of coboundaries in $\cup_{s>0} H^{s}(\mathcal{M})$. We
describe relations to Livsic theorem and recover regularity properties of
cohomological equations using this operator. For Anosov geodesic flows on the
unit tangent bundle $\mathcal{M}=SM$ of a compact manifold, we apply this
theory to study questions related to $X$-ray transform on symmetric tensors on
$M$: in particular we prove that injectivity implies surjectivity of X-ray
transform, and we show injectivity for surfaces.
