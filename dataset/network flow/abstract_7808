We found that the spectrum of the linear dispersion mode localized along the
zero-mass line for variable mass Dirac fermions shows the nonzero spectral flow
as a function of the external magnetic field B. This happens due to the
Aharonov--Bohm effect, leading to the linear dependence of every eigenvalue on
B. The nonzero spectral flow allows to use the magnetic field slowly varying in
time to control the energy of the linear dispersion mode.
