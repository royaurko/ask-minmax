We study synchronization dynamics in networks of coupled oscillators with
bimodal distribution of natural frequencies. This setup can be interpreted as a
simple model of frequency synchronization dynamics among generators and loads
working in a power network. We derive the minimum coupling strength required to
ensure global frequency synchronization. This threshold value can be
efficiently found by solving a binary optimization problem, even for large
networks. In order to validate our procedure, we compare its results with
numerical simulations on a realistic network describing the European
interconnected high-voltage electricity system, finding a very good agreement.
Our synchronization threshold can be used to test the stability of frequency
synchronization to link removals. As the threshold value changes only in very
few cases when aplied to the European realistic network, we conclude that
network is resilient in this regard. Since the threshold calculation depends on
the local connectivity, it can also be used to identify critical network
partitions acting as synchronization bottlenecks. In our stability experiments
we observe that when a link removal triggers a change in the critical
partition, its limits tend to converge to national borders. This phenomenon,
which can have important consequences to synchronization dynamics in case of
cascading failure, signals the influence of the uncomplete topological
integration of national power grids at the European scale.
