The elliptic flow measured at RHIC has been interpreted as a signature for
strong partonic interactions early in the collision and as an indication of a
well developed quark-gluon plasma phase. The measured values of elliptic flow,
using methods based on multi-particle correlations, are affected by
fluctuations in the magnitude of the elliptic flow. In this Letter, using a
Monte Carlo Glauber calculation, we estimate what the possible effect of
spatial eccentricity fluctuations is on the determination of elliptic flow.
