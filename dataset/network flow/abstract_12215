Analysing Online Social Networks (OSN), voluntarily maintained and
automatically exploitable databases of electronic personal information,
promises a wealth of insight into their users' behavior, interest, and
utilization of these currently predominant services on the Internet. To
understand popularity in OSN, we monitored a large sample of profiles from a
highly popular network for three months, and analysed the relation between
profile properties and their impression frequency. Evaluating the data
indicates a strong relation between both the number of accepted contacts and
the diligence of updating contacts versus the frequency of requests for a
profile. Counter intuitively, the overall activity, gender, as well as
participation span of users have no remarkable impact on their profile's
popularity.
