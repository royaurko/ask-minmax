A nonlinear small-world network model has been presented to investigate the
effect of nonlinear interaction and time delay on the dynamic properties of
small-world networks. Both numerical simulations and analytical analysis for
networks with time delay and nonlinear interaction show chaotic features in the
system response when nonlinear interaction is strong enough or the length scale
is large enough. In addition, the small-world system may behave very
differently on different scales. Time-delay parameter also has a very strong
effect on properties such as the critical length and response time of
small-world networks.
