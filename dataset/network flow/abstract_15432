The voltage-conductance kinetic equation for integrate and fire neurons has
been used in neurosciences since a decade and describes the probability density
of neurons in a network. It is used when slow conductance receptors are
activated and noticeable applications to the visual cortex have been
worked-out. In the simplest case, the derivation also uses the assumption of
fully excitatory and moderately all-to-all coupled networks; this is the
situation we consider here. We study properties of solutions of the kinetic
equation for steady states and time evolution and we prove several global a
priori bounds both on the probability density and the firing rate of the
network. The main difficulties are related to the degeneracy of the diffusion
resulting from noise and to the quadratic aspect of the nonlinearity. This
result constitutes a paradox; the solutions of the kinetic model, of partially
hyperbolic nature, are globally bounded but it has been proved that the fully
parabolic integrate and fire equation (some kind of diffusion limit of the
former) blows-up in finite time.
