The social media website last.fm provides a detailed snapshot of what its
users in hundreds of cities listen to each week. After suitably normalizing
this data, we use it to test three hypotheses related to the geographic flow of
music. The first is that although many of the most popular artists are listened
to around the world, music preferences are closely related to nationality,
language, and geographic location. We find support for this hypothesis, with a
couple of minor, yet interesting, exceptions. Our second hypothesis is that
some cities are consistently early adopters of new music (and early to snub
stale music). To test this hypothesis, we adapt a method previously used to
detect the leadership networks present in flocks of birds. We find empirical
support for the claim that a similar leadership network exists among cities,
and this finding is the main contribution of the paper. Finally, we test the
hypothesis that large cities tend to be ahead of smaller cities-we find only
weak support for this hypothesis.
