Equations are found for exact g-functions corresponding to integrable bulk
and boundary flows between successive unitary c<1 minimal conformal field
theories in two dimensions, confirming and extending previous perturbative
results. These equations are obtained via an embedding of the flows into a
boundary version of Al. Zamolodchikov's staircase model.
