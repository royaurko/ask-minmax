The $(N,M)$-bigraded Toda hierarchy is an extension of the original Toda
lattice hierarchy. The pair of numbers $(N,M)$ represents the band structure of
the Lax matrix which has $N$ upper and $M$ lower diagonals, and the original
one is referred to as the $(1,1)$-bigraded Toda hierarchy.
  Because of this band structure, one can introduce $M+N-1$ commuting flows
which give a parametrization of a small phase space for a topological field
theory.
  In this paper, we first show that there exists a natural symmetry between the
$(N,M)$- and $(M,N)$-bigraded Toda hierarchies. We then derive the Hirota
bilinear form for those commuting flows, which consists of two-dimensional Toda
hierarchy, the discrete KP hierarchy and its B\"acklund transformations. We
also discuss the solution structure of the $(N,M)$-bigraded Toda equation in
terms of the moment matrix defined via the wave operators associated with the
Lax operator, and construct some of the explicit solutions. In particular, we
give the rational solutions which are expressed by the products of the Schur
polynomials corresponding to non-rectangular Young diagrams.
