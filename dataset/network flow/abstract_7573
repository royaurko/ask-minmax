Velocity differences in the direct enstrophy cascade of two-dimensional
turbulence are correlated with the underlying flow topology. The statistics of
the transverse and longitudinal velocity differences are found to be governed
by different structures. The wings of the transverse distribution are dominated
by strong vortex centers, whereas, the tails of the longitudinal differences
are dominated by saddles. Viewed in the framework of earlier theoretical work
this result suggests that the transfer of enstrophy to smaller scales is
accomplished in regions of the flow dominated by saddles.
