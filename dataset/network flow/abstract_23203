Two-phase flow calculations are presented to investigate the
thermo-hydraulical effects of the interaction between 300 kJ proton pulses (2
ms long, 1.3 GeV) with a closed mercury loop which can be considered as a model
system of the target of the planned European Spallation Source(ESS) facility.
The two-fluid model consists of six first-order partial differential equations
that present one dimensional mass momentum and energy balances for mercury
vapour and liquid phases are capable to describe quick transients like
cavitation effects or shock waves. The absorption of the proton beam is
represented as instantaneous heat source in the energy balance equations.
Densities and internal energies of the mercury liquid-vapour system are
calculated from van der Waals equation, and the general method how to obtain
such properties is also presented. A second order accurate high-resolution
shock-capturing numerical scheme is applied with different kinds of limiters in
the numerical calculations. %Our two-fluid model is very similar to the RELAP5
thermo-hydraulical code %which is used in the nuclear industry to simulate
nuclear power plant accidents. Our analysis show that even 75 degree
temperature heat shocks cannot cause considerable cavitation effects in mercury
in 2ms long pulses
