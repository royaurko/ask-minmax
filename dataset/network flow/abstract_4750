Numerical simulations of rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection are presented
for both no slip and free slip boundaries. The goal is to find a criterion
distinguishing convective flows dominated by the Coriolis force from those
nearly unaffected by rotation. If one uses heat transport as an indicator of
which regime the flow is in, one finds that the transition between the flow
regimes always occurs at the same value of a certain combination of Reynolds,
Prandtl and Ekman numbers for both boundary conditions. If on the other hand
one uses the helicity of the velocity field to identify flows nearly
independent of rotation, one finds the transition at a different location in
parameter space.
