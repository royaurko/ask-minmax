The propagation of plane waves in an isotropic chiral medium (ICM) is
investigated. Simple conditions are derived--in terms of the constitutive
parameters of the ICM--for the phase velocity to be directed opposite to the
direction of power flow. It is demonstrated that phase velocity and power flow
may be oppositely directed provided that the magnetoelectric coupling is
sufficiently strong.
