The effective nonlinear response of films of random composites consisting of
a binary composite with nonlinear particles randomly embedded in a linear host
is theoretically and numerically studied. A theoretical expression for the
effective second harmonic generation susceptibility, incorporating the
thickness of the film, is obtained by combining a modified effective-medium
approximation with the general expression for the effective second harmonic
generation susceptibility in a composite. The validity of the thoretical
results is tested against results obtained by numerical simulations on random
resistor networks. Numerical results are found to be well described by our
theory. The result implies that the effective-medium approximation provides a
convenient way for the estimation of the nonlinear response in films of random
dielectrics.
