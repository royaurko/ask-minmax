In a first order theory of dissipative hydrodynamics, we have simulated
hydrodynamic evolution of QGP fluid with dissipation due to shear viscosity
only. Simulation confirms that compared to an ideal fluid, energy density or
temperature of a viscous fluid evolve slowly. Transverse expansion is also more
in viscous fluid. We also study the effect of viscosity on particle production.
Particle production is enhanced, more at large $p_T$. The elliptic flow on the
otherhand decreases and shows a tendency to saturate at large $p_T$.
