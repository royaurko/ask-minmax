Dynamic Time-division duplex (TDD) can provide efficient and flexible
splitting of the common wireless cellular resources between uplink (UL) and
downlink (DL) users. In this paper, the UL/DL optimization problem is
formulated as a noncooperative game among the small cell base stations (SCBSs)
in which each base station aims at minimizing its total UL and DL flow delays.
To solve this game, a self-organizing UL/DL resource configuration scheme for
TDD-based small cell networks is proposed. Using the proposed scheme, an SCBS
is able to estimate and learn the UL and DL loads autonomously while optimizing
its UL/DL configuration accordingly. Simulations results show that the proposed
algorithm achieves significant gains in terms of packet throughput in case of
asymmetric UL and DL traffic loads. This gain increases as the traffic
asymmetry increases, reaching up to 97% and 200% gains relative to random and
fixed duplexing schemes respectively. Our results also show that the proposed
algorithm is well- adapted to dynamic traffic conditions and different network
sizes, and operates efficiently in case of severe cross-link interference in
which neighboring cells transmit in opposite directions.
