Motivated by the recent experimental observations, we discuss the freeze-out
properties of the fireball created in central heavy ion collisions. We find
that the freeze-out conditions, like temperature, velocity gradient near center
of the fireball, are similar for different colliding systems and beam energies.
This means that the transverse flow is stronger in the collisions of heavy
nuclei than that of the light ones.
