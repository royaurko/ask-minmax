We consider suspensions of neutrally-buoyant finite-size rigid spherical
particles in channel flow and investigate the relation between the particle
dynamics and the mean bulk behavior of the mixture for Reynolds numbers $500
\le Re \le 5000$ and particle volume fraction $0\le \Phi \le 0.3$, via fully
resolved numerical simulations. Analysis of the momentum balance reveals the
existence of three different regimes: laminar, turbulent and inertial
shear-thickening depending on which of the stress terms, viscous, Reynolds or
particle stress, is the major responsible for the momentum transfer across the
channel.
  We show that both Reynolds and particle stress dominated flows fall into the
Bagnoldian inertial regime and that the Bagnold number can predict the bulk
behavior although this is due to two distinct physical mechanisms. A turbulent
flow is characterized by larger particle dispersion and a more uniform particle
distribution, whereas the particulate-dominated flows is associated with a
significant particle migration towards the channel center where the flow is
smooth laminar-like and dispersion low.Interestingly, the collision kernel
shows similar values in the different regimes, although the relative particle
velocity and clustering clearly vary with inertia and particle concentration.
