In SUSY models which violate R-parity, there exist trilinear lepton number
violating (LNV) operators which can lead to neutrino masses. If these operators
are defined at the unification scale, the renormalization group flow becomes
important and generally leads to one neutrino mass much heavier than the
others. We study, in a minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) set-up with two trilinear
LNV operators and three charged lepton mixing angles, numerically how these
parameters may be arranged to be compatible with neutrino oscillation data, and
discuss some phenomenological observations.
