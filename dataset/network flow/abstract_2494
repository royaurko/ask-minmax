Efficiency in passage times is an important issue in designing networks, such
as transportation or computer networks. The small-world networks have
structures that yield high efficiency, while keeping the network highly
clustered. We show that among all networks with the small-world structure, the
most efficient ones have a single ``center'', from which all shortcuts are
connected to uniformly distributed nodes over the network. The networks with
several centers and a connected subnetwork of shortcuts are shown to be
``almost'' as efficient. Genetic-algorithm simulations further support our
results.
