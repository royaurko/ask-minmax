In this paper we present and analyze a queueing-theoretical model for
autonomous mobility-on-demand (MOD) systems where robotic, self-driving
vehicles transport customers within an urban environment and rebalance
themselves to ensure acceptable quality of service throughout the entire
network. We cast an autonomous MOD system within a closed Jackson network model
with passenger loss. It is shown that an optimal rebalancing algorithm
minimizing the number of (autonomously) rebalancing vehicles and keeping
vehicles availabilities balanced throughout the network can be found by solving
a linear program. The theoretical insights are used to design a robust,
real-time rebalancing algorithm, which is applied to a case study of New York
City. The case study shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met
with about 8,000 robotic vehicles (roughly 60% of the size of the current taxi
fleet). Finally, we extend our queueing-theoretical setup to include congestion
effects, and we study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on
overall congestion. Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to
the problem of system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and
provides one of the first characterizations of the sustainability benefits of
robotic transportation networks.
