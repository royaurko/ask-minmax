We study the game of go from a complex network perspective. We construct a
directed network using a suitable definition of tactical moves including local
patterns, and study this network for different datasets of professional
tournaments and amateur games. The move distribution follows Zipf's law and the
network is scale free, with statistical peculiarities different from other real
directed networks, such as e. g. the World Wide Web. These specificities
reflect in the outcome of ranking algorithms applied to it. The fine study of
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices used by the ranking algorithms
singles out certain strategic situations. Our results should pave the way to a
better modelization of board games and other types of human strategic scheming.
