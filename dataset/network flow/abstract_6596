The transmission dynamics of some infectious diseases is related to the
contact structure between individuals in a network. We used five algorithms to
generate contact networks with different topological structure but with the
same scale-free degree distribution. We simulated the spread of acute and
chronic infectious diseases on these networks, using SI (Susceptible -
Infected) and SIS (Susceptible - Infected - Susceptible) epidemic models. In
the simulations, our objective was to observe the effects of the topological
structure of the networks on the dynamics and prevalence of the simulated
diseases. We found that the dynamics of spread of an infectious disease on
different networks with the same degree distribution may be considerably
different.
