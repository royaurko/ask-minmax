This paper presents a numerical study of three-dimensional laminar mixed
convection within a liquid flowing on a horizontal channel heated uniformly
from below. The upper surface is free and assumed to be flat. The coupled
Navier-Stokes and energy equations are solved numerically by the finite volume
method taking into account the thermocapillary effects (Marangoni effect). When
the strength of the buoyancy, thermocapillary effects and forced convective
currents are comparable $(Ri\backsimeq O(1)$ and $Bd=Ra/Ma \backsimeq O(1))$,
the results show that the development of instabilities in the form of steady
longitudinal convective rolls is similar to those encountered in the
Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\'enard flow. The number and spatial distribution of these
rolls along the channel depend on the flow conditions. The objective of this
work is to study the influence of parameters, such as the Reynolds, Rayleigh
and Biot numbers, on the flow patterns and heat transfer characteristics. The
effects of variations in the surface tension with temperature gradients
(Marangoni effect) are also considered.
