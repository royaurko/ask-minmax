We consider scaling laws for maximal energy efficiency of communicating a
message to all the nodes in a wireless network, as the number of nodes in the
network becomes large. Two cases of large wireless networks are studied --
dense random networks and constant density (extended) random networks. In
addition, we also study finite size regular networks in order to understand how
regularity in node placement affects energy consumption.
  We first establish an information-theoretic lower bound on the minimum energy
per bit for multicasting in arbitrary wireless networks when the channel state
information is not available at the transmitters. Upper bounds are obtained by
constructing a simple flooding scheme that requires no information at the
receivers about the channel states or the locations and identities of the
nodes. The gap between the upper and lower bounds is only a constant factor for
dense random networks and regular networks, and differs by a poly-logarithmic
factor for extended random networks. Furthermore, we show that the proposed
upper and lower bounds for random networks hold almost surely in the node
locations as the number of nodes approaches infinity.
