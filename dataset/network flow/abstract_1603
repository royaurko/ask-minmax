We study theoretically the phase diagram of compressible active polar gels
such as the actin network of eukaryotic cells. Using generalized hydrodynamics
equations, we perform a linear stability analysis of the uniform states in the
case of an infinite bidimensional active gel to obtain the dynamic phase
diagram of active polar films. We predict in particular modulated flowing
phases, and a macroscopic phase separation at high activity. This qualitatively
accounts for experimental observations of various active systems, such as
acto-myosin gels, microtubules and kinesins in vitro solutions, or swimming
bacterial colonies.
