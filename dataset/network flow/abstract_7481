Using a hydrodynamic model, we predict the transverse momentum dependence of
the spectra and the elliptic flow for different hadrons in Au+Au collisions at
sqrt(s) = 130 A GeV. The dependence of the differential and p_t-integrated
elliptic flow on the hadron mass, equation of state and freeze-out temperature
is studied both numerically and analytically.
