A new simple mechanism due to cold electron flow to produce strong magnetic
field is proposed. A 600-T strong magnetic field is generated in the free space
at the laser intensity of 5.7x10^15 Wcm^-2. Theoretical analysis indicates that
the magnetic field strength is proportional to laser intensity. Such a strong
magnetic field offers a new experimental test bed to study laser-plasma
physics, in particular, fast-ignition laser fusion research and laboratory
astrophysics.
