Qualitative probabilistic networks have been introduced as qualitative
abstractions of Bayesian belief networks. One of the major drawbacks of these
qualitative networks is their coarse level of detail, which may lead to
unresolved trade-offs during inference. We present an enhanced formalism for
qualitative networks with a finer level of detail. An enhanced qualitative
probabilistic network differs from a regular qualitative network in that it
distinguishes between strong and weak influences. Enhanced qualitative
probabilistic networks are purely qualitative in nature, as regular qualitative
networks are, yet allow for efficiently resolving trade-offs during inference.
