We propose a universal analysis for static routings on networks and describe
the congestion characteristics by the theory. The relation between average
transmission time and transmission capacity is described by inequality
T0Rc0<=1. For large scale sparse networks, the non-trivial upper bond of
transmission capacity Rc0 is limited by Rc0<=1/< 1/k > in some approximate
conditions. the theoretical results agree with simulations on BA Networks.
