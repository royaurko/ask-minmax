With the emergence of 3D mobile devices available in the markets, mobile 3D
video services become increasingly important for video service providers, such
as Youtube and Netflix, while multi-view 3D videos are potential to bring out
varied innovative applications. However, enabling multi-view 3D video services
may overwhelm WiFi networks when we multicast every view of a video. In this
paper, therefore, we propose to incorporate depth-image-based rendering (DIBR),
which allows each mobile client to synthesize the desired view from nearby left
and right views, to effectively reduce the bandwidth consumption. Moreover, due
to varied channel conditions, each client may suffer from different packet loss
probabilities, and retransmissions incur additional bandwidth consumption. To
address this issue, we first analyze the merit of view protection via DIBR for
multi-view video multicast and then design a new protocol, named Multi-View
Group Management Protocol (MVGMP), for the dynamic group management of
multicast users. Simulation results manifest that our protocol effectively
reduces bandwidth consumption and increases the probability for each client to
successfully playback the desired view of a multi-view 3D video.
