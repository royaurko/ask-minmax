Functional dependencies restrict the potential interactions among variables
connected in a probabilistic network. This restriction can be exploited in
qualitative probabilistic reasoning by introducing deterministic variables and
modifying the inference rules to produce stronger conclusions in the presence
of functional relations. I describe how to accomplish these modifications in
qualitative probabilistic networks by exhibiting the update procedures for
graphical transformations involving probabilistic and deterministic variables
and combinations. A simple example demonstrates that the augmented scheme can
reduce qualitative ambiguity that would arise without the special treatment of
functional dependency. Analysis of qualitative synergy reveals that new
higher-order relations are required to reason effectively about synergistic
interactions among deterministic variables.
