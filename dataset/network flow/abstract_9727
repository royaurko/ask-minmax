Current Internet of Things (IoT) development requires service distribution
over Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSAN) to deal with the drastic
increasing of network management complexity. Because of the specific
constraints of WSAN, centralized approaches are strongly limited. Multi-hop
communication used by WSAN introduces transmission latency, packet errors,
router congestion and security issues. As it uses local services, a
decentralized service model avoid long path communications between nodes and
applications. But the main issue is then to have such local services installed
on the desired nodes. Environment Monitoring and Management Agent (EMMA) system
proposes a set of software to deploy and to execute such services over Wireless
Sensor and Actor Networks (WSAN) through a middleware based on Resource
Oriented Architecture (ROA). Its Internet integration and the local management
of data heterogeneity are facilitated through the use of current standard
protocols such as IPv6 LoW Power Wireless Area Networks (6LoWPAN) and
Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). This contribution presents EMMA
middleware, methodology and tools used to determine efficient service mapping
and its deployment.
