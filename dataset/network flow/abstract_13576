The effect of changes in plasma parameters, that are characteristic near or
at an L-H transition in fusion edge plasmas, on fluctuation correlation lengths
are analysed by means of drift-Alfven turbulence computations. Scalings by
density gradient length, collisionality, plasma beta, and by an imposed shear
flow are considered. It is found that strongly sheared flows lead to the
appearence of long-range correlations in electrostatic potential fluctuations
parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field.
