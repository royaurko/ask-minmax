We demonstrate that diffusively coupled limit-cycle oscillators on random
networks can exhibit various complex dynamical patterns. Reducing the system to
a network analog of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, we argue that uniform
oscillations can be linearly unstable with respect to spontaneous phase
modulations due to diffusional coupling - the effect corresponding to the
Benjamin-Feir instability in continuous media. Numerical investigations under
this instability in random scale-free networks reveal a wealth of complex
dynamical regimes, including partial amplitude death, clustering, and chaos. A
dynamic mean-field theory explaining different kinds of nonlinear dynamics is
constructed.
