Networks of chaotic coupled maps are considered as string and language
generators. It is shown that such networks can be used as encrypting systems
where the ciphertext contains information about the evolution of the network
and also about the way to select the plaintext symbols from the string
associated to the network evolution. The secret key provides the network
parameters, such as the coupling strengths.
