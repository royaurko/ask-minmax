Genetic regulation is a key component in development, but a clear
understanding of the structure and dynamics of genetic networks is not yet at
hand. In this paper we investigate these properties within an artificial genome
model originally introduced by Reil (1999). We analyze statistical properties
of randomly generated genomes both on the sequence- and network level, and show
that this model correctly predicts the frequency of genes in genomes as found
in experimental data. Using an evolutionary algorithm based on stabilizing
selection for a phenotype, we show that dynamical robustness against single
base mutations, as well as against random changes in initial states of
regulatory dynamics that mimic stochastic fluctuations in environmental
conditions, can emerge in parallel. Point mutations at the sequence level have
strongly non-linear effects on network wiring, including as well structurally
neutral mutations and simultaneous rewiring of multiple connections, which
occasionally lead to strong reorganization of the attractor landscape and
metastability of evolutionary dynamics. Evolved genomes exhibit characteristic
patterns on both sequence and network level.
