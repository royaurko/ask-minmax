An extended XMM-Newton observation of the Seyfert I galaxy NGC 4051 in 2009
revealed a complex absorption spectrum, with a wide range of outflow velocities
and ionisation states.The main velocity and ionisation structure was
interpreted in Paper I in terms of a decelerating, recombining flow resulting
from the shocking of a still higher velocity wind colliding with the ISM or
slower moving ejecta. The high sensitivity of the XMM-Newton observation also
revealed a number of broad emission lines, all showing evidence of
self-absorption near the line cores. The line profiles are found here to be
consistent with emission from a limb-brightened shell of post-shock gas
building up ahead of the contact discontinuity. While the broad emission lines
remain quasi-constant as the continuum flux changes by an order of magnitude,
recombination continua of several H- and He-like ions are found to vary in
response to the continuum, providing an important key to scaling the ionised
flow.
