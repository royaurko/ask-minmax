Multimedia streaming applications with stringent QoS requirements in 60GHz
mmWave wireless personal area networks (WPANs) demand high rate and low latency
data transfer as well as low service disruption. In this paper, we consider the
problem of robust relay placement in 60GHz WPANs. Relays forward traffic from
transmitter devices to receiver devices facilitating i) the primary
communication path for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) transceiver pairs, and ii)
secondary (backup) communication path for line-of-sight (LOS) transceiver
pairs. We formulate the robust minimum relay placement problem and the robust
maximum utility relay placement problem with the objective to minimize the
number of relays deployed and maximize the network utility, respectively.
Efficient algorithms are developed to solve both problems and have been shown
to incur less service disruption in presence of moving subjects that may block
the LOS paths in the environment.
