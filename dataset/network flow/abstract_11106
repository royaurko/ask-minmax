The topological information of a network can be retrieved equivalently from
its complement consisting of the same nodes but complementary edges. Hence the
partition of a network into certain substructures based on given criteria
should be the same as that of its complement based on the equivalent criteria
if the topological information is considered exclusively. This symmetry of
partitioning between a network and its complement is due to the equivalence of
their topological information and hence should be respected regardless of the
detailed characteristics of the substructures considered. In this work we
suggest this symmetry consideration as a general guideline and propose a
symmetric community detection scheme to show its implications. Our method has
no resolution limit and can be used to detect hierarchical community structures
at different levels. Our study also suggests that the community structure is
unlikely a result of random fluctuations in large networks.
