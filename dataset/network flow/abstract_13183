Elliptic flow measurements at RHIC suggest that quark gluon plasma flows with
very little viscosity compared to weak coupling expectations, challenging
theorists to explain why this fluid is so nearly ``perfect''. It is therefore
vital to find quantitative experimental information on the viscosity of the
plasma. We propose that measurements of transverse momentum fluctuations can be
used to determine the shear viscosity. We use current data to estimate the
viscosity-to-entropy ratio in the range from 0.08 to 0.3, and discuss how
future measurements can reduce this uncertainty.
