We calculate the number of metastable states in the generalized random
orthogonal model. The results obtained are verified by exact numerical
enumeration for small systems sizes but taking into account finite size
effects. These results are compared with those for Hopfield model in order to
examine the effect of strict orthonormality of neural network patterns on the
number of metastable states.
