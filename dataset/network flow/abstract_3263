We present numerical simulations of the magnetic field generated by the flow
of liquid sodium driven by two counter-rotating impellers (VKS experiment).
Using a dynamo kinematic code in cylindrical geometry, it is shown that
different magnetic modes can be generated depending on the flow configuration.
While the time averaged axisymmetric mean flow generates an equatorial dipole,
our simulations show that an axial field of either dipolar or quadrupolar
symmetry can be generated by taking into account non-axisymmetric components of
the flow. Moreover, we show that by breaking a symmetry of the flow, the
magnetic field becomes oscillatory. This leads to reversals of the axial dipole
polarity, involving a competition with the quadrupolar component.
