Ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile nodes that dynamically form
a temporary network without the use of any existing network infrastructure or
centralized administration. A cognitive radio is a radio that can change its
transmitter parameters based on interaction with the environment in which it
operates. The basic idea of cognitive radio networks is that the unlicensed
devices (cognitive radio users or secondary users) need to vacate the spectrum
band once the licensed device (primary user) is detected. Cognitive capability
and reconfigurability are the key characteristics of cognitive radio. Routing
is an important issue in Mobile Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks (MCRAHNs). In
this paper, a survey of routing protocols for mobile cognitive radio ad
networks is discussed.
