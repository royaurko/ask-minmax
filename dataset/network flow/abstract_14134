We study the formation of the spectra in advection dominated accretion flows
(ADAFs) around Kerr black holes. We use a Monte Carlo approach and fully
general relativistic treatment to follow the paths of individual photons and
model their scattering with mildly relativistic, thermal electrons of the two
temperature plasma present in the flow. We study the influence of the accretion
rate, black hole mass, black hole angular momentum, and the strength of the
small scale magnetic field present in the plasma on the resulting spectra. The
impact of the black hole angular momentum on the spectra is present and can be
distinguished from the influence of changes in other parameters. This property
of the models should be taken into account when modeling the individual sources
and the population of inefficiently accreting black holes in the Universe.
