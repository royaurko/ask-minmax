The acoustic behavior of micro-perforated panels (MPP) is studied
theoretically and experimentally at high level of pressure excitation. A model
based on Forcheimer's regime of flow velocity in the perforations is proposed.
This model is valid at relatively high Reynolds numbers and low Mach numbers.
The experimental method consists in measuring the acoustical pressure at three
different positions in an impedance tube, the two measurement positions usually
considered in an impedance tube and one measurement in the vicinity of the rear
surface of the MPP. The impedance tube is equipped with a pressure driver
instead of the usual loudspeaker and capable of delivering a high sound
pressure level up to 160 dB. Several MPP specimens made out of steel and
polypropylene were tested. Measurements using random noise or sinusoidal
excitation in a frequency range between 200 and 1600 Hz were carried out on
MPPs backed by air cavities. It was observed that the maximum of absorption can
be a positive or a negative function of the flow velocity in the perforations.
This suggests the existence of a maximum of absorption as a function of flow
velocity. This behavior was predicted by the model and confirmed
experimentally.
