We study the flow of model experimental hard sphere colloidal suspensions at
high volume fraction $\Phi$ driven through a constriction by a pressure
gradient. Above a particle-size dependent limit $\Phi_0$, direct microscopic
observations demonstrate jamming and unjamming--conversion of fluid to solid
and vice versa--during flow. We show that such a jamming flow produces a
reduction in colloid concentration $\Phi_{x}$ downstream of the constriction.
We propose that this `self-filtration' effect is the consequence of a
combination of jamming of the particulate part of the system and continuing
flow of the liquid part, i.e. the solvent, through the pores of the jammed
solid. Thus we link the concept of jamming in colloidal and granular media with
a 'two-fluid'-like picture of the flow of concentrated suspensions. Results are
also discussed in the light of Osborne Reynolds' original experiments on
dilation in granular materials.
