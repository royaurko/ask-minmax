This paper proposes to model the intracellular signalling networks using a
fusion of behaviour-based systems and the blackboard architecture. In virtue of
this fusion, the model developed by us, which has been named Cellulat, allows
to take account two essential aspects of the intracellular signalling networks:
(1) the cognitive capabilities of certain types of networks' components and (2)
the high level of spatial organization of these networks. A simple example of
modelling of Ca2+ signalling pathways using Cellulat is presented here. An
intracellular signalling virtual laboratory is being developed from Cellulat.
