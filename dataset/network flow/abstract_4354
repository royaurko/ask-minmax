It is shown how to perfectly transfer an arbitrary qudit state in interacting
boson networks. By defining a family of Hamiltonians related to Bose-Hubbard
model, we describe a possible method for state transfer through bosonic atoms
trapped in these networks with different kinds of coupling strengths between
them. Particularly, by taking the underlying networks of so called group
schemes as interacting boson networks, we show how choose suitable coupling
strengths between the nodes, in order that an arbitrary qudit state be
transferred from one node to its antipode, perfectly. In fact, by employing the
group theory properties of these networks, an explicit formula for suitable
coupling strengths has been given in order that perfect state transfer (PST) be
achieved. Finally, as examples, PST on the underlying networks associated with
cyclic group C2m, dihedral group D2n, Clifford group CL(n), and the groups U6n
and V8n has been considered in details. Keywords: Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian,
