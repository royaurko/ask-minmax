We propose a novel approach to automatically detecting and tracking cell
populations in time-lapse images. Unlike earlier ones that rely on linking a
predetermined and potentially under-complete set of detections, we generate an
overcomplete set of competing detection hypotheses. We then perform detection
and tracking simultaneously by solving an integer program to find an optimal
and consistent subset. This eliminates the need for heuristics to handle missed
detections due to occlusions and complex morphology.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a range of challenging
image sequences consisting of clumped cells and show that it outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques.
