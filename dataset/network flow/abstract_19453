The relation between the Evershed flow and moving magnetic features (MMFs) is
studied using high-cadence, simultaneous spectropolarimetric measurements of a
sunspot in visible (630.2 nm) and near-infrared (1565 nm) lines. Doppler
velocities, magnetograms, and total linear polarization maps are calculated
from the observed Stokes profiles. We follow the temporal evolution of two
Evershed clouds that move radially outward along the same penumbral filament.
Eventually, the clouds cross the visible border of the spot and enter the moat
region, where they become MMFs. The flux patch farther from the sunspot has the
same polarity of the spot, while the MMF closer to it has opposite polarity and
exhibits abnormal circular polarization profiles. Our results provide strong
evidence that at least some MMFs are the continuation of the penumbral Evershed
flow into the moat. This, in turn, suggests that MMFs are magnetically
connected to sunspots.
