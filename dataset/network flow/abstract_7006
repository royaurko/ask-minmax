We present several new spatially localized equilibrium and traveling-wave
solutions of plane Couette and channel flows. The solutions exhibit strikingly
concentrated regions of vorticity that are flanked on either side by high-speed
streaks. For several traveling-wave solutions of channel flow, the concentrated
vortex structures are confined to the near-wall region and form particularly
isolated and elemental coherent structures in the near-wall region of shear
flows. The solutions are constructed by a variety of methods: application of
windowing functions to previously known spatially periodic solutions,
continuation from plane Couette to channel flow conditions, and from initial
guesses obtained from turbulent simulation data. We show how the symmetries of
localized solutions derive from the symmetries of their periodic counterparts,
analyze the exponential decay of their tails, examine the scale separation and
scaling of their streamwise Fourier modes, and show that they develop critical
layers for large Reynolds numbers.
