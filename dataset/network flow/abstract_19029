Deploying relays and/or mobile base stations is a major means of extending
the coverage of a wireless network. This paper presents models, analytical
results, and algorithms to answer two related questions: The first is where to
deploy relays in order to extend the reach from a base station to the maximum;
the second is where to deploy a mobile base station and how many relays are
needed to reach any point in a given area. Simple time-division and
frequency-division scheduling schemes as well as an end-to-end data rate
requirement are assumed. An important use case of the results is in the Public
Safety Broadband Network, in which deploying relays and mobile base stations is
often crucial to provide coverage to an incident scene.
