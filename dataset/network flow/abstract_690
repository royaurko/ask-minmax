Recent literature has proved that stable dynamic routing algorithms have
solid theoretical foundation that makes them suitable to be implemented in a
real protocol, and used in practice in many different operational network
contexts. Such algorithms inherit much of the properties of congestion
controllers implementing one of the possible combination of AQM/ECN schemes at
nodes and flow control at sources. In this paper we propose a linear program
formulation of the multi-commodity flow problem with congestion control, under
max-min fairness, comprising demands with or without exogenous peak rates. Our
evaluations of the gain, using path diversity, in scenarios as intra-domain
traffic engineering and wireless mesh networks encourages real implementations,
especially in presence of hot spots demands and non uniform traffic matrices.
We propose a flow aware perspective of the subject by using a natural
multi-path extension to current congestion controllers and show its performance
with respect to current proposals. Since flow aware architectures exploiting
path diversity are feasible, scalable, robust and nearly optimal in presence of
flows with exogenous peak rates, we claim that our solution rethinked in the
context of realistic traffic assumptions performs as better as an optimal
approach with all the additional benefits of the flow aware paradigm.
