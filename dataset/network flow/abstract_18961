In general, sensor nodes are deployed in left unattended area. In such
situation feeding energy to the batteries or replacing the batteries is
difficult or even sometimes impossible too. Therefore, prolonging the network
lifetime is an important optimization goal in this aspect. In this paper, we
propose a new Energy-efficient Datacentric RoUtinG protocol called DRUG. In
this paper, we propose an adaptive Data centric approach to find an optimal
routing path from source to sink when the sensor nodes are deployed randomly
deployed in a restricted service area with single sink. Using the NS-2
Simulator, we compare the performance of DRUG with that of the FLOODING and
SPIN protocol.
