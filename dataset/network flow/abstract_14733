Using both a continuum Navier-Stokes solver, with the mu(I)-flow-law
implemented to model the viscous behavior, and the discrete Contact Dynamics
algorithm, the discharge of granular silos is simulated in two dimensions from
the early stages of the discharge until complete release of the material. In
both cases, the Beverloo scaling is recovered. We first do not attempt
quantitative comparison, but focus on the qualitative behavior of velocity and
pressure at different locations in the flow. A good agreement is obtained in
the regions of rapid flows, while areas of slow creep are not entirely captured
by the continuum model. The pressure field shows a general good agreement. The
evolution of the free surface implies differences, however, the bulk
deformation is essentially identical in both approaches. The influence of the
parameters of the mu(I)-flow-law is systematically investigated, showing the
importance of the dependence on the inertial number I to achieve quantitative
agreement between continuum and discrete discharge. The general ability of the
continuum model to reproduce qualitatively the granular behavior is found to be
very encouraging.
