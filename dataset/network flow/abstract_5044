We search for the dark flow induced diffuse kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ)
effect through CMB-galaxy cross correlation. Such angular correlation is
anisotropic, with a unique $cos(theta_DF)$ angular dependence and hence can be
distinguished from other components. Here, $theta_DF$ is the angle between the
opposite dark flow direction and the direction of the sky where the correlation
is measured. We analyze the KIAS-VAGC galaxy catalog of SDSS-DR7 and the WMAP
seven-year temperature maps, applying an unbiased optimal weighting scheme to
eliminate any statistically isotropic components and to enhance the dark flow
detection signal. Non-zero weighted cross correlations are detected at 3.5
sigma for the redshift bin z<0.1 and at 3 sigma for the bin 0.1<z<0.2, implying
the existence of statistically anisotropic components in CMB. However, further
analysis does not support the dark flow explanation. The observed directional
dependence deviates from the $\propto cos(theta_DF)$ relation expected, and
hence can not be explained by the presence of a single dark flow, and if the
observed cross correlation is generated by the dark flow induced kSZ effect,
the velocity would be too high (> 6000 km/s). We report this work as the first
attempt to search for dark flow through weighted CMB-galaxy cross correlation
and to draw the attention on the sources of the detected anomalous CMB-galaxy
cross correlation.
