We present our new results on the renormalization group coupling flow
obtained i n 3 dimensional coupling space
$(\beta_{11},\beta_{12},\beta_{twist})$. The value of $\beta_{twist}$ turns out
to be small and the coupling flow projected on $(\beta_{11},\beta_{12})$ plane
is very similar with the previous result obtained in the 2 dimensional coupling
space.
