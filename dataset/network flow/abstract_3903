Networks of nonlinear units with time-delayed couplings can synchronize to a
common chaotic trajectory. Although the delay time may be very large, the units
can synchronize completely without time shift. For networks of coupled
Bernoulli maps, analytic results are derived for the stability of the chaotic
synchronization manifold. For a single delay time, chaos synchronization is
related to the spectral gap of the coupling matrix. For networks with multiple
delay times, analytic results are obtained from the theory of polynomials.
Finally, the analytic results are compared with networks of iterated tent maps
and Lang-Kobayashi equations which imitate the behaviour of networks of
semiconductor lasers.
