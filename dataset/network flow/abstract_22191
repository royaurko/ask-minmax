The d-invariant of an integral, positive definite lattice L records the
minimal norm of a characteristic covector in each equivalence class mod 2L. We
prove that the 2-isomorphism type of a connected graph is determined by the
d-invariant of its lattice of integral cuts (or flows). As an application, we
prove that a reduced, alternating link diagram is determined up to mutation by
the Heegaard Floer homology of the link's branched double-cover. Thus,
alternating links with homeomorphic branched double-covers are mutants.
