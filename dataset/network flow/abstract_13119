We investigate turbulence in dilute polymer solutions when polymers are
strongly stretched by the flow. We establish power-law spectrum of velocity,
which is not associated with a flux of a conserved quantity, in two cases. The
first case is the elastic waves range of high Reynolds number turbulence of
polymer solutions above the coil-stretch transition. The second case is the
elastic turbulence, where chaotic flow is excited due to elastic instabilities
at small Reynolds numbers.
