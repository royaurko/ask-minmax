3GPP has introduced LTE Femtocells to manipulate the traffic for indoor users
and to minimize the charge on the Macro cells. A key mechanism in the LTE
traffic handling is the packet scheduler which is in charge of allocating
resources to active flows in both the frequency and time dimension. So several
scheduling algorithms need to be analyzed for femtocells networks. In this
paper we introduce a performance analysis of three distinct scheduling
algorithms of mixed type of traffic flows in LTE femtocells networks. The
particularly study is evaluated in terms of throughput, packet loss ratio,
fairness index and spectral efficiency
