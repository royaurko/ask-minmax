The eukaryotic cell membrane is connected to a dense actin rich cortex. We
present FCS and STED experiments showing that dense membrane bound actin
networks have severe influence on lipid phase separation. A minimal actin
cortex was bound to a supported lipid bilayer via biotinylated lipid
streptavidin complexes (pinning sites). In general, actin binding to ternary
membranes prevented macroscopic liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domain
formation, even at low temperature. Instead, depending on the type of pinning
lipid, an actin correlated multi-domain pattern was observed. FCS measurements
revealed hindered diffusion of lipids in the presence of an actin network. To
explain our experimental findings, a new simulation model is proposed, in which
the membrane composition, the membrane curvature, and the actin pinning sites
are all coupled. Our results reveal a mechanism how cells may prevent
macroscopic demixing of their membrane components, while at the same time
regulate the local membrane composition.
