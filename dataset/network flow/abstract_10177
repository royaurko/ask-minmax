The parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE based on PYTHIA was used to
investigate the charged particle elliptic flow in minimum bias pp collisions at
the LHC energies. The strings were distributed randomly in the transverse
ellipsoid of the pp collision system with major axis of $R$ (proton radius) and
minor axis of $R(1-\xi)$ before parton rescattering. The charged particle
elliptic flow as a function of the random number $\xi$ and transverse momentum
$p_T$ were investigated. The calculated $v_2/\epsilon$ as a function of
reaction energy increases monotonously with increasing reaction energy up to
$\sqrt{s}\sim$7 TeV and then turns to saturation. With the parton-parton cross
section enlarges three times in parton rescattering, the rapidity integrated
charged particle elliptic flow may reach 0.025 at $p_T \sim$2 GeV/c in the
minimum bias pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV.
