In this paper the Solomon network is simulated by means of 1D and 2D Ising
model with additional -- not only geometrical -- neighbors. A "social phase
transition" at a non-zero Curie-like temperature is observed, also in one
dimension. The critical exponent describing the behavior of the magnetization
in the vicinity of the transition is also evaluated.
