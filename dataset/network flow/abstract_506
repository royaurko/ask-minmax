Experimental two-phase invasion percolation flow patterns were observed in
hydrophobic micro-porous networks designed to model fuel cell specific porous
media. In order to mimic the operational conditions encountered in the porous
electrodes of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), micro-porous
networks were fabricated with corresponding microchannel size distributions.
The inlet channels were invaded homogeneously with flow rates corresponding to
fuel cell current densities of 1.0 to 0.1 A/cm2 (Ca 10e-7-10e-8). A variety of
fractal breakthrough patterns were observed and analyzed to quantify flooding
density and geometrical diversity in terms of the total saturation, St, local
saturations, s, and fractal dimension, D. It was found that St increases
monotonically during the invasion process until the breakthrough point is
reached, and s profiles indicate the dynamic distribution of the liquid phase
during the process. Fractal analysis confirmed that the experiments fall within
the flow regime of invasion percolation with trapping. In this work, we propose
to correlate the fractal dimension, D, to the total saturation and use this map
as a parameter for modeling liquid water transport in the GDL.
