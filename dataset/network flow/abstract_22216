The consistency level of LCDM with geometrical data probes has been
increasing with time during the last decade. Despite of these successes, there
are some puzzling conflicts between LCDM predictions and dynamical data probes
(bulk flows, alignment and magnitude of low CMB multipoles, alignment of quasar
optical polarization vectors, cluster halo profiles). Most of these puzzles are
related to the existence of preferred anisotropy axes which appear to be
unlikely close to each other. A few models that predict the existence of
preferred cosmological axes are briefly discussed.
