The article addresses combinatorial evolution and forecasting of
communication protocol for wireless sensor networks (ZigBee). Morphological
tree structure (a version of and-or tree) is used as a hierarchical model for
the protocol. Three generations of ZigBee protocol are examined. A set of
protocol change operations is generated and described. The change operations
are used as items for forecasting based on combinatorial problems (e.g.,
clustering, knapsack problem, multiple choice knapsack problem). Two kinds of
preliminary forecasts for the examined communication protocol are considered:
(i) direct expert (expert judgment) based forecast, (ii) computation of the
forecast(s) (usage of multicriteria decision making and combinatorial
optimization problems). Finally, aggregation of the obtained preliminary
forecasts is considered (two aggregation strategies are used).
