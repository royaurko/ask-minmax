We present a hydrodynamical code for cosmological simulations which uses the
Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) to follow the dynamics of gas component and an
N-body Particle-Mesh algorithm for the evolution of collisionless component.
The gravitational interaction between the two components is regulated by the
Poisson equation which is solved by a standard FFT procedure. In order to
simulate cosmological flows we have introduced several modifications to the
original PPM scheme which we describe in detail. Various tests of the code are
presented including adiabatic expansion, single and multiple pancake formation
and three-dimensional cosmological simulations with initial conditions based on
the cold dark matter scenario.
