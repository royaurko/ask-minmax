The communities of a social network are sets of vertices with more
connections inside the set than outside. We theoretically demonstrate that two
commonly observed properties of social networks, heavy-tailed degree
distributions and large clustering coefficients, imply the existence of vertex
neighborhoods (also known as egonets) that are themselves good communities. We
evaluate these neighborhood communities on a range of graphs. What we find is
that the neighborhood communities often exhibit conductance scores that are as
good as the Fiedler cut. Also, the conductance of neighborhood communities
shows similar behavior as the network community profile computed with a
personalized PageRank community detection method. The latter requires sweeping
over a great many starting vertices, which can be expensive. By using a small
and easy-to-compute set of neighborhood communities as seeds for these PageRank
communities, however, we find communities that precisely capture the behavior
of the network community profile when seeded everywhere in the graph, and at a
significant reduction in total work.
