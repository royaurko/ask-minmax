This contribution reports on numerical simulations of 2D granular flows on
erodible beds. The broad aim is to investigate whether simple flows of model
granular matter exhibits spontaneous oscillatory motion in generic flow
conditions, and in this case, whether the frictional properties of the contacts
between grains may affect the existence or the characteristics of this
oscillatory motion. The analysis of different series of simulations show that
the flow develops an oscillatory motion with a well-defined frequency which
increases like the inverse of the velocity's square root. We show that the
oscillation is essentially a surface phenomena. The amplitude of the
oscillation is higher for lower volume fractions, and can thus be related to
the flow velocity and grains friction properties. The study of the influence of
the periodic geometry of the simulation cell shows no significant effect. These
results are discussed in relation to sonic sands.
