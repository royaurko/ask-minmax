The Grad--Shafranov approach to the problem of the structure of the black
hole magnetosphere is discussed. For the double transonic flow, the number of
boundary conditions in the pair creation region is shown to be sufficient to
determine not only the longitudinal electric current, but also the angular
velocity of a flow as a solution to a problem. As a result, the energy loss is
determined by the physical parameters at the particle creation region rather
than the "boundary conditions" at the event horizon.
