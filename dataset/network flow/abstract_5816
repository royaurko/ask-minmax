Every route of a transport network approaching equilibrium can be represented
by a vector of Euclidean space which length quantifies its segregation from the
rest of the graph. We have empirically observed that the distribution of
lengths over the edge connectivity in many transport networks exhibits scaling
invariance phenomenon. We give an example of the canal network of Veneice to
demonstrate our result. The method is applicable to any transport network.
