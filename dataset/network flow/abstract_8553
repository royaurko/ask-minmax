We consider a symmetrical star-shaped network, in which bandwidth is shared
among the active connections according to the "min" policy. Starting from a
chaos propagation hypothesis, valid when the system is large enough, one can
write equilibrium equations for an arbitrary link of the network. This paper
describes an approach based on functional analysis of nonlinear integral
operators, which allows to characterize quantitatively the behaviour of the
network under heavy load conditions.
