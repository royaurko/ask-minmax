On the basis of gauge invariance, it is proven in an elementary and
straightforward manner, but without invoking any {\it ad hoc} assumption, that
the existence of off-diagonal long-range order in one-particle reduced density
matrix in Bose liquids implies both the irrotational flow in a simply connected
region and the quantization of circulation in a multiply connected region, the
two fundamental properties of a Bose superfluid. The origin for both is the
phase coherence of condensate wave-functions. Some relevant issues are also
addressed.
