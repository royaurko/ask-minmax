We analyze the data stemming from a forced incompressible hydrodynamic
simulation on a grid of 2048^3 regularly spaced points, with a Taylor Reynolds
number of Re~1300. The forcing is given by the Taylor-Green flow, which shares
similarities with the flow in several laboratory experiments, and the
computation is run for ten turnover times in the turbulent steady state. At
this Reynolds number the anisotropic large scale flow pattern, the inertial
range, the bottleneck, and the dissipative range are clearly visible, thus
providing a good test case for the study of turbulence as it appears in nature.
Triadic interactions, the locality of energy fluxes, and structure functions of
the velocity increments are computed. A comparison with runs at lower Reynolds
numbers is performed, and shows the emergence of scaling laws for the relative
amplitude of local and non-local interactions in spectral space. The scalings
of the Kolmogorov constant, and of skewness and flatness of velocity
increments, performed as well and are consistent with previous experimental
results. Furthermore, the accumulation of energy in the small-scales associated
with the bottleneck seems to occur on a span of wavenumbers that is independent
of the Reynolds number, possibly ruling out an inertial range explanation for
it. Finally, intermittency exponents seem to depart from standard models at
high Re, leaving the interpretation of intermittency an open problem.
