TCP is the De facto standard for connection oriented transport layer
protocol, while UDP is the De facto standard for transport layer protocol,
which is used with real time traffic for audio and video. Although there have
been many attempts to measure and analyze the performance of the TCP protocol
in wireless networks, very few research was done on the UDP or the interaction
between TCP and UDP traffic over the wireless link. In this paper, we tudy the
performance of TCP and UDP over IEEE802.11 ad hoc network. We used two
topologies, a string and a mesh topology. Our work indicates that IEEE802.11 as
a ad-hoc network is not very suitable for bulk transfer using TCP. It also
indicates that it is much better for real-time audio. Although one has to be
careful here since real-time audio does require much less bandwidth than the
wireless link bandwidth. Careful and detailed studies are needed to further
clarify that issue.
