Fluid instabilities like Rayleigh-Taylor,Richtmyer-Meshkov and
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can occur in a wide range of physical phenomenon
from astrophysical context to Inertial Confinement Fusion(ICF).Using Layzer's
potential flow model, we derive the analytical expressions of growth rate of
bubble and spike for ideal magnetized fluid in R-T and R-M cases. In presence
of transverse magnetic field the R-M and R-T instability are suppressed or
enhanced depending on the direction of magnetic pressure and hydrodynamic
pressure. Again the interface of two fluid may oscillate if both the fluids are
conducting. However the magnetic field has no effect in linear case.
