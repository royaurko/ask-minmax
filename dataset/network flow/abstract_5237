In this paper we propose to thoroughly investigate asymmetric nuclear
collisions both in the fixed target mode at the laboratory energy below 5 GeV
per nucleon and in the collider mode with a center of mass energy below 11 GeV
per nucleon. Using the UrQMD transport model, we demonstrate a strong
enhancement of directed and elliptic flow coefficients for the midcentral
asymmetric nuclear collisions compared to symmetric collisions. We argue that
such an enhancement is due to the disappearance of the nuclear shadowing effect
on the side of the smaller projectile nucleus. An analysis of the energy and
centrality dependencies of the directed, elliptic and triangular flows at
midrapidity shows us their sensitivity to the details of the employed model of
hadronic interaction. In general, the flow patters found for asymmetric nuclear
collisions have a very rich and complicated structure of energy and centrality
dependencies compared to the flows found for symmetric collisions and are worth
to be investigated experimentally. The directed, elliptic, and triangular flow
coefficients are computed for target nuclei containing high density
fluctuations and thoroughly compared with that ones obtained in the absence of
such fluctuations.
