Drops of active liquid crystal have recently shown the ability to
self-propel, which was associated with topological defects in the orientation
of active filaments [Sanchez {\em et al.}, Nature {\bf 491}, 431 (2013)]. Here,
we study the onset and different aspects of motility of a three-dimensional
drop of active fluid on a planar surface. We analyse theoretically how motility
is affected by orientation profiles with defects of various types and
locations, by the shape of the drop, and by surface friction at the substrate.
In the scope of a thin drop approximation, we derive exact expressions for the
flow in the drop that is generated by a given orientation profile. The flow has
a natural decomposition into terms that depend entirely on the geometrical
properties of the orientation profile, i.e. its bend and splay, and a term
coupling the orientation to the shape of the drop. We find that asymmetric
splay or bend generates a directed bulk flow and enables the drop to move, with
maximal speeds achieved when the splay or bend is induced by a topological
defect in the interior of the drop. In motile drops the direction and speed of
self-propulsion is controlled by friction at the substrate.
