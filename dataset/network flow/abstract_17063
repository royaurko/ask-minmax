A stochastic pump is a Markov model of a mesoscopic system evolving under the
control of externally varied parameters. In the model, the system makes random
transitions among a network of states. For such models, a "no-pumping theorem"
has been obtained, which identifies minimal conditions for generating directed
motion or currents. We provide a derivation of this result using a simple
graphical construction on the network of states.
