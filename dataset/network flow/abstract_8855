Recently, two of these contributors construct dissipative continuous (weak)
solutions to the incompressible Euler equations on the three-dimensional torus
$\mathbb T^3$. The building blocks in their proof are Beltrami flows, which are
inherently three-dimensional. The purpose of this note is to show that the
techniques can nevertheless be adapted to the two-dimensional case.
