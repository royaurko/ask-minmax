A simple model of two-phase flow in porous media is presented. A connection
is made to statistical mechanics by applying capillary power as a constraint.
Stochastic sampling is then used to test the validity of this approach. Good
agreement is found between stochastic sampling and time stepping for flow-rates
above a transition value.
