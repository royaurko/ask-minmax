Realistic mobility models can demonstrate more precise evaluation results
because their parameters are closer to the reality. In this paper a realistic
Fuzzy Mobility Model has been proposed. This model has rules which is
changeable depending on nodes and environment conditions. This model is more
complete and precise than the other mobility models and this is the advantage
of this model. After simulation, it was found out that not only considering
nodes movement as being imprecise (fuzzy) has a positive effects on most of ad
hoc network parameters, but also, more importantly as they are closer to the
real world condition, they can have a more positive effect on the
implementation of ad hoc network protocols.
