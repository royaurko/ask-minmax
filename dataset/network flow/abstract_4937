Given a composition of i.i.d. random orientation-preserving homeomorphisms or
a memoryless stochastic flow of homeomorphisms on the circle, we show that
provided the randomness allows for a sufficient range of possible behaviour on
a finite time-scale, the trajectories of any two given initial conditions will
almost surely mutually converge ("synchronisation"). Specifically, the
following conditions guarantee that synchronisation occurs (and is "stable"):
(i) no point is almost surely fixed under the flow, and (ii) every arc is able
(with positive probability) to contract under the flow to a length less than
its original length. Our result considerably generalises a result of Kleptsyn
and Nalskii from 2004. We also provide geometric descriptions of the flow of a
stably synchronising system.
