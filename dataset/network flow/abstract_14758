Solar flares are one of the main forces behind space weather events. However
the mechanism that drives such energetic phenomena is not fully understood. The
standard eruptive flare model predicts that magnetic reconnection occurs high
in the corona where hot fast flows are created. Some imaging or spectroscopic
observations have indicated the presence of these hot fast flows but there have
been no spectroscopic scanning observation to date to measure the
two-dimensional structure quantitatively. We analyzed a flare that occurred on
the west solar limb on 27 January 2012 observed by the Hinode EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) and found that the hot (~30MK) fast (>500 km/s) component
was located above the flare loop. This is consistent with magnetic reconnection
taking place above the flare loop.
