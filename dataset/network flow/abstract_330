Major challenges for the transition of power systems do not only tackle power
electronics but also communication technology, power market economy and user
acceptance studies. Simulation is an important research method therein, as it
helps to avoid costly failures. A common smart grid simulation platform is
still missing. We introduce a conceptual model of agents in multiple flow
networks. Flow networks extend the depth of established power flow analysis
through use of networks of information flow and financial transactions. We use
this model as a basis for comparing different power system simulators.
Furthermore, a quantitative comparison of simulators is done to facilitate the
decision for a suitable tool in comprehensive smart grid simulation.
