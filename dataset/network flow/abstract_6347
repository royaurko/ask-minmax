The network approach became a widely used tool to understand the behaviour of
complex systems in the last decade. We start from a short description of
structural rigidity theory. A detailed account on the combinatorial rigidity
analysis of protein structures, as well as local flexibility measures of
proteins and their applications in explaining allostery and thermostability is
given. We also briefly discuss the network aspects of cytoskeletal tensegrity.
Finally, we show the importance of the balance between functional flexibility
and rigidity in protein-protein interaction, metabolic, gene regulatory and
neuronal networks. Our summary raises the possibility that the concepts of
flexibility and rigidity can be generalized to all networks.
