We show that a variety of complex processes can be viewed from the unified
standpoint of scale-free nonlinear conservative cascades. Examples include
certain turbulence models, percolation, cluster coagulation (aggregation) and
fragmentation, `coarse-grained' forest fire model of self-organized
criticality, and scale-free network growth. We classify such cascades by the
values of three indices, and show how power-law steady spectra may arise. The
power-law exponent is proven to depend only on the values of the three indices
by a simple algebraic formula.
