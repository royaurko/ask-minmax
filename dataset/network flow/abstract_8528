We consider the scenario in which a set of sources generate messages in a
network and a receiver node demands an arbitrary linear function of these
messages. We formulate an algebraic test to determine whether an arbitrary
network can compute linear functions using linear codes. We identify a class of
linear functions that can be computed using linear codes in every network that
satisfies a natural cut-based condition. Conversely, for another class of
linear functions, we show that the cut-based condition does not guarantee the
existence of a linear coding solution. For linear functions over the binary
field, the two classes are complements of each other.
