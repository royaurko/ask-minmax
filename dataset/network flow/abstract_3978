An asset network systemic risk (ANWSER) model is presented to investigate the
impact of how shadow banks are intermingled in a financial system on the
severity of financial contagion. Particularly, the focus of this study is the
impact of the following three representative topologies of an interbank loan
network between shadow banks and regulated banks. (1) Random mixing network:
shadow banks and regulated banks are intermingled randomly. (2)
Asset-correlated mixing network: banks having bigger assets are a regulated
bank and other banks are shadow banks. (3) Layered mixing network: banks in a
shadow bank layer are connected to banks in a regulated bank layer with some
interbank loans.
