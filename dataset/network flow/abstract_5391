In this paper, a simply rule that generates scale-free networks with very
large clustering coefficient and very small average distance is presented.
These networks are called {\bf Multistage Random Growing Networks}(MRGN) as the
adding process of a new node to the network is composed of two stages. The
analytic results of power-law exponent $\gamma=3$ and clustering coefficient
$C=0.81$ are obtained, which agree with the simulation results approximately.
In addition, the average distance of the networks increases logarithmical with
the number of the network vertices is proved analytically. Since many real-life
networks are both scale-free and small-world networks, MRGN may perform well in
mimicking reality.
