We develop a theory for the temporal integration of visual motion motivated
by psychophysical experiments. The theory proposes that input data are
temporally grouped and used to predict and estimate the motion flows in the
image sequence. This temporal grouping can be considered a generalization of
the data association techniques used by engineers to study motion sequences.
Our temporal-grouping theory is expressed in terms of the Bayesian
generalization of standard Kalman filtering. To implement the theory we derive
a parallel network which shares some properties of cortical networks. Computer
simulations of this network demonstrate that our theory qualitatively accounts
for psychophysical experiments on motion occlusion and motion outliers.
