Regularisation of deep neural networks (DNN) during training is critical to
performance. By far the most popular method is known as dropout. Here, cast
through the prism of signal processing theory, we compare and contrast the
regularisation effects of dropout with those of dither. We illustrate some
serious inherent limitations of dropout and demonstrate that dither provides a
more effective regulariser.
