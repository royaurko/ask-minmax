Complex functional brain network analyses have exploded over the last eight
years, gaining traction due to their profound clinical implications. The
application of network science (an interdisciplinary offshoot of graph theory)
has facilitated these analyses and enabled examining the brain as an integrated
system that produces complex behaviors. While the field of statistics has been
integral in advancing activation analyses and some connectivity analyses in
functional neuroimaging research, it has yet to play a commensurate role in
complex network analyses. Fusing novel statistical methods with network-based
functional neuroimage analysis will engender powerful analytical tools that
will aid in our understanding of normal brain function as well as alterations
due to various brain disorders. Here we survey widely used statistical and
network science tools for analyzing fMRI network data and discuss the
challenges faced in filling some of the remaining methodological gaps. When
applied and interpreted correctly, the fusion of network scientific and
statistical methods has a chance to revolutionize the understanding of brain
function.
