In this paper we investigate the role of causal heat transport in a spatially
homogeneous, locally-rotationally symmetric Bianchi type-V cosmological model.
In particular, the causal temperature profile of the cosmological fluid is
obtained within the framework of extended irreversible thermodynamics. We
demonstrate that relaxational effects can alter the temperature profile when
the cosmological fluid is out of hydrostatic equilibrium.
