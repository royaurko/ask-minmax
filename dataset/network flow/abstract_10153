The dynamics of fluid vesicles is studied under flow in microchannels, in
which the width varies periodically along the channel. Three types of flow
instabilities of prolate vesicles are found. For small quasi-spherical vesicles
-- compared to the average channel width -- perturbation theory predicts a
transition from a state with orientational oscillations of a fixed prolate
shape to a state with shape oscillations of symmetrical ellipsoidal or
bullet-like shapes with increasing flow velocity. Experimentally, such
orientational oscillations are observed during the slow migration of a vesicle
towards the centerline of the channel. For larger vesicles, mesoscale
hydrodynamics simulations and experiments show similar symmetric shape
oscillation at reduced volumes $V^* \gtrsim 0.9$. However, for non-spherical
vesicles with $V^* \lesssim 0.9$, shapes are found with two symmetric or a
single asymmetric tail.
