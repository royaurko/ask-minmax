We introduce an application of the Quasi-Gasdynamic method for a solution of
ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations in the modeling of compressible conductive
gas flows. A time-averaging procedure is applied for all physical parameters in
order to obtain the quasi-gas-dynamic system of equations for
magnetohydrodynamics. Evolution of all physical variables is presented in an
unsplit divergence form. Divergence-free evolution of the magnetic field is
provided by using a constrained transport method based on Stokes theorem.
Accuracy and convergence of this method are verified on a large set of standard
1D and 2D test cases.
