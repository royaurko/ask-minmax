This article produces a theoretically informed model for predicting electoral
results based on Wikipedia page view data. Responding to previous critiques of
work using social data to predict elections, which have argued that these
predictions take place without any understanding of the mechanism which enables
them, we first develop a theoretical model which highlights why people might
seek information at election time, and how this activity might relate to
overall electoral outcomes, focussing especially on the activity of swing
voters and the difference between overall electoral outcomes and how the vote
share of individual parties changes. We test this model on electoral data drawn
from 5 countries in the 2009 and 2014 European Parliament elections, showing
that social data does have good potential for predictive accuracy if
theoretically informed corrections are applied.
