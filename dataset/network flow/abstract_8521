We pose a novel cellular network planning problem, considering the use of
renewable energy sources and a fundamentally new concept of energy balancing,
and propose a novel algorithm to solve it. In terms of the network capital and
operational expenditure, we conclude that savings can be made by enriching
cellular infrastructure with energy harvesting sources, in comparison to
traditional deployment methods.
