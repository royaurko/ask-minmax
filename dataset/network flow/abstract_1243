Central to the functioning of a living cell is its ability to control the
readout or expression of information encoded in the genome. In many cases, a
single transcription factor protein activates or represses the expression of
many genes. As the concentration of the transcription factor varies, the target
genes thus undergo correlated changes, and this redundancy limits the ability
of the cell to transmit information about input signals. We explore how
interactions among the target genes can reduce this redundancy and optimize
information transmission. Our discussion builds on recent work [Tkacik et al,
Phys Rev E 80, 031920 (2009)], and there are connections to much earlier work
on the role of lateral inhibition in enhancing the efficiency of information
transmission in neural circuits; for simplicity we consider here the case where
the interactions have a feed forward structure, with no loops. Even with this
limitation, the networks that optimize information transmission have a
structure reminiscent of the networks found in real biological systems.
