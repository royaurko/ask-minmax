We study the effects of uniform time delays on the extreme fluctuations in
stochastic synchronization and coordination problems with linear couplings in
complex networks. We obtain the average size of the fluctuations at the nodes
from the behavior of the underlying modes of the network. We then obtain the
scaling behavior of the extreme fluctuations with system size, as well as the
distribution of the extremes on complex networks, and compare them to those on
regular one-dimensional lattices. For large complex networks, when the delay is
not too close to the critical one, fluctuations at the nodes effectively
decouple, and the limit distributions converge to the Fisher-Tippett-Gumbel
density. In contrast, fluctuations in low-dimensional spatial graphs are
strongly correlated, and the limit distribution of the extremes is the Airy
density.
