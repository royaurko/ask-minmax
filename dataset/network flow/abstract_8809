We consider graphical solutions to mean curvature flow and obtain a stability
result for homothetically expanding solutions coming out of cones of positive
mean curvature: If another solution is initially close to the cone at infinity,
then the difference to the homothetically expanding solution becomes small for
large times. The proof involves the construction of appropriate barriers.
