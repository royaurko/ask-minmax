Very recently a new algorithm to the nonnegative single-source shortest path
problem on road networks has been discovered. It is very cache-efficient, but
only on static road networks. We show how to augment it to the time-dependent
scenario. The advantage if the new approach is that it settles nodes, even for
a profile query, by scanning all downward edges. We improve the scanning of the
downward edges with techniques developed for time-dependent many-to-many
computations.
