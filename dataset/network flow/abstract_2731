We present an algorithm for generating random networks with arbitrary degree
distribution and Clustering (frequency of triadic closure). We use this
algorithm to generate networks with exponential, power law, and poisson degree
distributions with variable levels of clustering. Such networks may be used as
models of social networks and as a testable null hypothesis about network
structure. Finally, we explore the effects of clustering on the point of the
phase transition where a giant component forms in a random network, and on the
size of the giant component. Some analysis of these effects is presented.
