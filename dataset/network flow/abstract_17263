With the development of convolution neural network, more and more researchers
focus their attention on the advantage of CNN for face recognition task. In
this paper, we propose a deep convolution network for learning a robust face
representation. The deep convolution net is constructed by 4 convolution
layers, 4 max pooling layers and 2 fully connected layers, which totally
contains about 4M parameters. The Max-Feature-Map activation function is used
instead of ReLU because the ReLU might lead to the loss of information due to
the sparsity while the Max-Feature-Map can get the compact and discriminative
feature vectors. The model is trained on CASIA-WebFace dataset and evaluated on
LFW dataset. The result on LFW achieves 97.77% on unsupervised setting for
single net.
