We use a stochastic approach to show how Taylor dispersion is affected by
kinetic processes of adsorption and desorption onto surfaces. A general theory
is developed, from which we derive explicitly the dispersion coefficients of
canonical examples like Poiseuille flows in planar and cylindrical geometries,
both in constant and sinusoidal velocity fields. These results open the way for
the measurement of adsorption and desorption rate constants using stationary
flows and molecular sorting using the stochastic resonance of the adsorption
and desorption processes with the oscillatory velocity field.
