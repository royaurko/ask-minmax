We show that strategy independent adaptations of random interaction networks
can induce powerful mechanisms, ranging from the Red Queen to group selection,
that promote cooperation in evolutionary social dilemmas. These two mechanisms
emerge spontaneously as dynamical processes due to deletions and additions of
links, which are performed whenever players adopt new strategies and after a
certain number of game iterations, respectively. The potency of cooperation
promotion, as well as the mechanism responsible for it, can thereby be tuned
via a single parameter determining the frequency of link additions. We thus
demonstrate that coevolving random networks may evoke an appropriate mechanism
for each social dilemma, such that cooperation prevails even by highly
unfavorable conditions.
