Recent work in modeling the coupling between disease dynamics and dynamic
social network geometry has led to the examination of how human interactions
force a rewiring of connections in a population. Rewiring of the network may be
considered an adaptive response to social forces due to disease spread, which
in turn feeds back to the disease dynamics. Such epidemic models, called
adaptive networks, have led to new dynamical instabilities along with the
creation of multiple attracting states. The co-existence of several attractors
is sensitive to internal and external fluctuations, and leads to enhanced
stochastic oscillatory outbreaks and disease extinction. The aim of this paper
is to explore the bifurcations of adaptive network models in the presence of
fluctuations and to review some of the new fluctuation phenomena induced in
adaptive networks.
