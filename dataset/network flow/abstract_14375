We present a bridge between the KP soliton equations and the Calogero-Moser
many-body systems through noncommutative algebraic geometry. The Calogero-Moser
systems have a natural geometric interpretation as flows on spaces of spectral
curves on a ruled surface. We explain how the meromorphic solutions of the KP
hierarchy have an interpretation via a noncommutative ruled surface. Namely, we
identify KP Lax operators with vector bundles on quantized cotangent spaces
(formulated technically in terms of D-modules). A geometric duality (a variant
of the Fourier-Mukai transform) then identifies the parameter space for such
vector bundles with that for the spectral curves and sends the KP flows to the
Calogero-Moser flows. It follows that the motion and collisions of the poles of
the rational, trigonometric, and elliptic solutions of the KP hierarchy, as
well as of its multicomponent analogs, are governed by the (spin)
Calogero-Moser systems on cuspidal, nodal, and smooth genus one curves. This
provides a geometric explanation and generalizations of results of
Airault-McKean-Moser, Krichever, and Wilson.
