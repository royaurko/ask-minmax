Mobile networks are vulnerable to signalling attacks and storms that are
caused by traffic patterns that overload the control plane, and differ from
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in the Internet since they
directly attack the control plane, and also reserve wireless bandwidth without
actually using it. Such attacks can result from malware and mobile botnets, as
well as from poorly designed applications, and can cause service outages in 3G
and 4G networks which have been experienced by mobile operators. Since the
radio resource control (RRC) protocol in 3G and 4G networks is particularly
susceptible to such attacks, we analyze their effect with a mathematical model
that helps to predict the congestion that is caused by an attack. A detailed
simulation model of a mobile network is used to better understand the temporal
dynamics of user behavior and signalling in the network and to show how RRC
based signalling attacks and storms cause significant problems in the control
plane and the user plane of the network. Our analysis also serves to identify
how storms can be detected, and to propose how system parameters can be chosen
to mitigate their effect.
