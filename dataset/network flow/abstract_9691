Explicit derivation of interferences in hexagonal wireless networks has been
widely considered intractable and requires extensive computations with system
level simulations. In this paper, we fundamentally tackle this problem and
explicitly evaluate interference factor $f$ for any mobile location $m$ in a
hexagonal network composed of omni-directional or tri-sectorized sites. The
explicit formula of $f$ is a very convergent series on $m$ and involves the use
of hypergeometric and Hurwitz Riemann zeta functions. Besides, we establish
simple identities that well approximate this convergent series and turn out
quite useful compared to other approximations in literature. The derived
expression of $f$ is used to show further that the SINR distribution is
explicit as well and it is provided for any arbitrary mobile location
distribution, reflecting the spatial traffic density in the network. Knowing
explicitly about interferences and SINR distribution is very useful information
in capacity and coverage planning of wireless cellular networks and
particularly for macro-cells' layer that forms almost a regular point pattern.
