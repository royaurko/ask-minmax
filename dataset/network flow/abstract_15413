In flocking models, the collective motion of self-driven individuals leads to
the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns. The Standard Vicsek Model
(SVM) considers individuals that tend to adopt the direction of movement of
their neighbors under the influence of noise. By performing an extensive
complex network characterization of the structure of SVM flocks, we show that
flocks are highly clustered, assortative, and non-hierarchical networks with
short-tailed degree distributions. Moreover, we also find that the SVM dynamics
leads to the formation of complex structures with an effective dimension higher
than that of the space where the actual displacements take place. Furthermore,
we show that these structures are capable of sustaining mean-field-like
orientationally ordered states when the displacements are suppressed, thus
suggesting a linkage between the onset of order and the enhanced dimensionality
of SVM flocks.
