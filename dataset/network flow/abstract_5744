We investigate the interaction between a chirally imprinted network and a
solvent of chiral molecules. We find, a liquid crystalline polymer network is
preferentially swollen by one component of a racemic solvent. This ability to
separate is linked to the chiral order parameter of the network, and can be
reversibly controlled via temperature or a mechanical deformation. It is
maximal near the point at which the network loses its imprinted structure. One
possible practical application of this effect would be a mechanical device for
sorting mixed chiral molecules.
