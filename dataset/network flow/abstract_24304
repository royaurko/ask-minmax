Using data on the Berlin public transport network, the present study extends
previous observations of fractality within public transport routes by showing
that also the distribution of inter-station distances along routes displays
non-trivial power law behaviour. This indicates that the routes may in part
also be described as L\'evy-flights. The latter property may result from the
fact that the routes are planned to adapt to fluctuating demand densities
throughout the served area. We also relate this to optimization properties of
L\'evy flights.
