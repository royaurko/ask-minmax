We consider an edge-weighted uniform random graph with a given degree
sequence (Repeated Configuration Model) which is a useful approximation for
many real-world networks. It has been observed that the vertices which are
separated from the rest of the graph by a distance exceeding certain threshold
play an important role in determining some global properties of the graph like
diameter, flooding time etc., in spite of being statistically rare. We give a
convergence result for the distribution of the number of such far-out vertices.
We also make a conjecture about how this relates to the longest edge of the
minimal spanning tree on the graph under consideration.
