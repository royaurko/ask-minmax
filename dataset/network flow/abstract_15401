Device-to-device(D2D) underlaying communication brings great benefits to the
cellular networks from the improvement of coverage and spectral efficiency at
the expense of complicated transceiver design. With frequency spectrum sharing
mode, the D2D user generates interference to the existing cellular networks
either in downlink or uplink. Thus the resource allocation for D2D pairs should
be designed properly in order to reduce possible interference, in particular
for uplink. In this paper, we introduce a novel bandwidth allocation scheme to
maximize the utilities of both D2D users and cellular users. Since the
allocation problem is strongly NP-hard, we apply a relaxation to the
association indicators. We propose a low-complexity distributed algorithm and
prove the convergence in a static environment. The numerical result shows that
the proposed scheme can significant improve the performance in terms of
utilities.The performance of D2D communications depends on D2D user locations,
the number of D2D users and QoS(Quality of Service) parameters.
