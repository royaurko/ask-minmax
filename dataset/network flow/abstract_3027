In this contribution we give an overview over recent work on the theory of
interacting neural networks. The model is defined in Section 2. The typical
teacher/student scenario is considered in Section 3. A static teacher network
is presenting training examples for an adaptive student network. In the case of
multilayer networks, the student shows a transition from a symmetric state to
specialisation. Neural networks can also generate a time series. Training on
time series and predicting it are studied in Section 4. When a network is
trained on its own output, it is interacting with itself. Such a scenario has
implications on the theory of prediction algorithms, as discussed in Section 5.
When a system of networks is trained on its minority decisions, it may be
considered as a model for competition in closed markets, see Section 6. In
Section 7 we consider two mutually interacting networks. A novel phenomenon is
observed: synchronisation by mutual learning. In Section 8 it is shown, how
this phenomenon can be applied to cryptography: Generation of a secret key over
a public channel.
