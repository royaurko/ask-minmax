For Anosov flows on compact Riemann manifolds we study the rate of decay
along the flow of diameters of balls $B^s(x,\ep)$ on local stable manifolds at
Lyapunov regular points $x$. We prove that this decay rate is similar for all
sufficiently small values of $\epsilon > 0$. From this and the main result in
\cite{kn:St1}, we derive strong spectral estimates for Ruelle transfer
operators for contact Anosov flows with Lipschitz local stable holonomy maps.
These apply in particular to geodesic flows on compact locally symmetric
manifolds of strictly negative curvature. As is now well known, such spectral
estimates have deep implications in some related areas, e.g. in studying
analytic properties of Ruelle zeta functions and partial differential
operators, asymptotics of closed orbit counting functions, etc.
