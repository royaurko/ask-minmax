An accurate impact parameter determination in a heavy ion collision is
crucial for almost all further analysis. The capabilities of an artificial
neural network are investigated to that respect. A novel input generation for
the network is proposed, namely the transverse and longitudinal momentum
distribution of all outgoing (or actually detectable) particles. The neural
network approach yields an improvement in performance of a factor of two as
compared to classical techniques. To achieve this improvement simple network
architectures and a 5 by 5 input grid in (p_t,p_z) space are sufficient.
