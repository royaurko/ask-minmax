We report on the possibilities of using the method of normal fundamental
systems for solving some problems of oscillation theory. Large elastic
dynamical systems with continuous and discrete parameters are considered, which
have many different engineering applications. Intensive oscillations in such
systems are possible, but not desirable. Therefore, it is very important to
obtain conditions for which oscillations take or not-take place.
Mathematically, one needs to search for the solutions of partial differential
equations satisfying both boundary and conjugation conditions. In this paper we
overview the methodology of normal fundamental systems for the study of such
oscillation problems, which provide an efficient and reliable computational
method. The obtained results permit to analyze the influence of different
system parameters on oscillations as well as to compute the optimal feedback
parameters for the active vibration control of the systems.
