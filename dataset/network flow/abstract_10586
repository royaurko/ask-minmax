Femtocells have been considered by the wireless industry as a cost-effective
solution not only to improve indoor service providing, but also to unload
traffic from already overburdened macro networks. Due to spectrum availability
and network infrastructure considerations, a macro network may have to share
spectrum with overlaid femtocells. In spectrum-sharing macro and femto
networks, inter-cell interference caused by different transmission powers of
macrocell base stations (MBS) and femtocell access points (FAP), in conjunction
with potentially densely deployed femtocells, may create dead spots where
reliable services cannot be guaranteed to either macro or femto users. In this
paper, based on a thorough analysis of downlink (DL) outage probabilities (OP)
of collocated spectrum-sharing orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA) based macro and femto networks, we devise a decentralized strategy for
an FAP to self-regulate its transmission power level and usage of radio
resources depending on its distance from the closest MBS. Simulation results
show that the derived closed-form lower bounds of DL OPs are tight, and the
proposed decentralized femtocell self-regulation strategy is able to guarantee
reliable DL services in targeted macro and femto service areas while providing
superior spatial reuse, for even a large number of spectrum-sharing femtocells
deployed per cell site.
