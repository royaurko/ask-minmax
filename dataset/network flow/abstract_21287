Metabolic control analysis is a biochemical formalism defined by Kacser and
Burns in 1973, and given firm mathematical basis by Reder in 1988. The
algorithm defined by Reder for calculating the control matrices is still used
by software programs today, but is only valid for some biochemical models. We
show that, with slight modification, the algorithm may be applied to all
models.
