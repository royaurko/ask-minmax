This paper addresses the cell association problem in the downlink of a
multi-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet), where base stations (BSs) have
finite number of resource blocks (RBs) available to distribute among their
associated users. Two problems are defined and treated in this paper: sum
utility of long term rate maximization with long term rate quality of service
(QoS) constraints, and global outage probability minimization with outage QoS
constraints. The first problem is well-suited for low mobility environments,
while the second problem provides a framework to deal with environments with
fast fading. The defined optimization problems in this paper are solved in two
phases: cell association phase followed by the optional RB distribution phase.
We show that the cell association phase of both problems have the same
structure. Based on this similarity, we propose a unified distributed algorithm
with low levels of message passing to for the cell association phase. This
distributed algorithm is derived by relaxing the association constraints and
using Lagrange dual decomposition method. In the RB distribution phase, the
remaining RBs after the cell association phase are distributed among the users.
Simulation results show the superiority of our distributed cell association
scheme compared to schemes that are based on maximum signal to interference
plus noise ratio (SINR).
