Deterministic diffusion in temporally oscillating convection is studied for
particles with finite mass. The particles are assumed to obey a simple
dissipative dynamical system and the particle diffusion is induced by the
strange attractor. The diffusion constants are numerically calculated for
convection models with free and rigid boundary conditions.
