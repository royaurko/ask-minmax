Diffusion of information and viral content, social contagion and influence
are still topics of broad evaluation. As theory explaining the role of
influentials moves slightly to reduce their importance in the propagation of
viral content, contributors of the following paper have studied the information
epidemic in a social networking platform in order to confirm recent theoretical
findings in this area. While most of related experiments focus on the level of
individuals, the elementary entities of the following analysis are dyads. The
contributors study behavioral motifs that are possible to observe at the dyadic
level. The study shows significant differences between dyads that are more vs
less engaged in the diffusion process. Dyads that fuel the diffusion proccess
are characterized by stronger relationships (higher activity, more common
friends), more active and networked receiving party (higher centrality
measures), and higher contributority centrality of person sending a viral message.
