We propose a procedure to generate dynamical networks with bursty, possibly
repetitive and correlated temporal behaviors. Regarding any weighted directed
graph as being composed of the accumulation of paths between its nodes, our
construction uses random walks of variable length to produce time-extended
structures with adjustable features. The procedure is first described in a
general framework. It is then illustrated in a case study inspired by a
transportation system for which the resulting synthetic network is shown to
accurately mimic the empirical phenomenology.
