We investigated the dependence of the solar magnetic parity between the
hemispheres on two important parameters, the turbulent diffusivity and the
meridional flow, by means of axisymmetric kinematic dynamo simulations based on
the flux-transport dynamo model. It is known that the coupling of the magnetic
field between hemispheres due to turbulent diffusivity is an important factor
for the solar parity issue, but the detailed criterion for the generation of
the dipole field has not been investigated. Our conclusions are as follows. (1)
The stronger diffusivity near the surface is more likely to cause the magnetic
field to be a dipole. (2) The thinner layer of the strong diffusivity near the
surface is also more apt to generate a dipolar magnetic field. (3) The faster
meridional flow is more prone to cause the magnetic field to be a quadrupole,
i.e., symmetric about the equator. These results show that turbulent
diffusivity and meridional flow are crucial for the configuration of the solar
global magnetic field.
