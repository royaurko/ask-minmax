We construct a stochastic model showing the relationship between noise,
gradient flows and rate-independent systems. The model consists of a
one-dimensional birth-death process on a lattice, with rates derived from
Kramers' law as an approximation of a Brownian motion on a wiggly energy
landscape. Taking various limits we show how to obtain a whole family of
generalized gradient flows, ranging from quadratic to rate-independent ones,
connected via '$L \log L$' gradient flows. This is achieved via
Mosco-convergence of the renormalized large-deviations rate functional of the
stochastic process.
