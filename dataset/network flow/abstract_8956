By proving a weighted contraction estimate for the flow of gravity water
waves, we show that this nonlocal system is in fact pseudo-local in the
following sense: locally in time, the dynamic far away from a given bounded
region has a small effect on that region (again, in a sense that we will make
precise in the article). Our estimate on the flow also implies a new spatial
decay property of the waves.
