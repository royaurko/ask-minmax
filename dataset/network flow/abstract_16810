We decompose the exchange rates returns of 41 currencies (incl. gold) into
their sign and amplitude components. Then we group together all exchange rates
with a common base currency, construct Minimal Spanning Trees for each group
independently, and analyze properties of these trees. We show that both the
sign and the amplitude time series have similar correlation properties as far
as the core network structure is concerned. There exist however interesting
peripheral differences that may open a new perspective to view the Forex
dynamics.
