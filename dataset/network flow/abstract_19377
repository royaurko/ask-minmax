I discuss a new gravitational potential, Phi(r) ~ (r_0^n+r^n)^(-1/n), for
modeling the mass distribution of spherical systems. This potential has a
finite mass and generates a density profile with adjustable inner slope 2-n. A
gas embedded in this potential has hydrostatic temperature and gas density
distributions that are elementary functions of n, greatly simplifying the task
of measuring the slope from X-ray data. I show that this model is successful in
describing the rising temperature profile and steep gas density profile often
seen in cooling flow clusters. An application to the Abell 478 cluster of
galaxies yields an inner slope 2-n = 1.0 +/- 0.2 (90%), consistent with the
inner regions of collisionless dark matter halos first simulated by Navarro,
Frenk, and White. The potential is also useful for cluster dynamics: it is a
generalization of the familiar Hernquist and Plummer potentials, and because it
is invertible, it allows for easy analytic calculation of particle phase space
distribution functions in terms of n.
