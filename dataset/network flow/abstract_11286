We consider wireless mesh networks and the problem of routing end-to-end
traffic over multiple paths for the same origin-destination pair with minimal
interference. We introduce a heuristic for path determination with two
distinguishing characteristics. First, it works by refining an extant set of
paths, determined previously by a single- or multi-path routing algorithm.
Second, it is totally local, in the sense that it can be run by each of the
origins on information that is available no farther than the node's immediate
neighborhood. We have conducted extensive computational experiments with the
new heuristic, using AODV and OLSR, as well as their multi-path variants, as
underlying routing methods. For two different CSMA settings (as implemented by
802.11) and one TDMA setting running a path-oriented link scheduling algorithm,
we have demonstrated that the new heuristic is capable of improving the average
throughput network-wide. When working from the paths generated by the
multi-path routing algorithms, the heuristic is also capable to provide a more
evenly distributed traffic pattern.
