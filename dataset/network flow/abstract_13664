Given a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and a geodesic $\gamma$, the
perpendicular part of the derivative of the geodesic flow $\phi_g^t: SM
\rightarrow SM$ along $\gamma$ is a linear symplectic map. We give an
elementary proof of the following Franks' lemma, originally found in [G.
Contreras and G. Paternain, 2002] and [G. Contreras, 2010]: this map can be
perturbed freely within a neighborhood in $Sp(n)$ by a $C^2$-small perturbation
of the metric $g$ that keeps $\gamma$ a geodesic for the new metric. Moreover,
the size of these perturbations is uniform over fixed length geodesics on the
manifold. When $\dim M \geq 3$, the original metric must belong to a
$C^2$--open and dense subset of metrics.
