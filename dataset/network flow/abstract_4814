In this paper we prove existence, uniqueness and regularity of certain
perturbed (subsonic--supersonic) transonic potential flows in a two-dimensional
Riemannian manifold with "convergent-divergent" metric, which is an approximate
model of the de Laval nozzle in aerodynamics. The result indicates that
transonic flows obtained by quasi-one-dimensional flow model in fluid dynamics
are stable with respect to the perturbation of the velocity potential function
at the entry (i.e., tangential velocity along the entry) of the nozzle. The
proof is based upon linear theory of elliptic-hyperbolic mixed type equations
in physical space and a nonlinear iteration method.
