We report the detection of the HI line at 21 cm from the circumstellar shell
around the AGB star X Her using the position-switching technique with the
Nancay Radio Telescope. At the star position the line shows 2 components: (i) a
broad one (FWHM ~ 13 km/s) centered at -72.2 km/s, and (ii) a narrow one (FWHM
\~ 4 km/s) centered at ~ -70.6 km/s. Our map shows that the source associated
to the broad component is asymmetric with material flowing preferentially
towards the North-East. This source extends to ~ 10 arcmin. (~ 0.4 pc) from the
star in that direction. On the other hand, the narrow component is detected
only at the star position and indicates material flowing away from the
observer. The total mass of atomic hydrogen is ~ 6.5 10^{-3} solar mass which,
within a factor 2, agrees with the estimate obtained from IRAS data at 60
microns.
