We observe that at the Large Hadron Collider, using forward + central
detectors, it becomes possible for the first time to carry out calorimetric
measurements of the transverse energy flow due to "minijets" accompanying
production of two jets separated by a large rapidity interval. We present
parton-shower calculations of energy flow observables in a high-energy
factorized Monte Carlo framework, designed to take into account QCD logarithmic
corrections both in the large rapidity interval and in the hard transverse
momentum. Considering events with a forward and a central jet, we examine the
energy flow in the interjet region and in the region away from the jets. We
discuss the role of these observables to analyze multiple parton collision
effects.
