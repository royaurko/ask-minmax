Wave resonance is the fundamental mechanism of non-linear instabilities of
fluid flows, and affects the long-time evolution of fluid motions and other
physical problems described by non-linear differential equations. Some
significant consequences, not well known and completely different from linear
instabilities, are summarized in this paper from the studies of past two
decades.
