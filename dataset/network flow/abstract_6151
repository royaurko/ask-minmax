Most centralities proposed for identifying influential spreaders on social
networks to either spread a message or to stop an epidemic require the full
topological information of the network on which spreading occurs. In practice,
however, collecting all connections between agents in social networks can be
hardly achieved. As a result, such metrics could be difficult to apply to real
social networks. Consequently, a new approach for identifying influential
people without the explicit network information is demanded in order to provide
an efficient immunization or spreading strategy, in a practical sense. In this
study, we seek a possible way for finding influential spreaders by using the
social mechanisms of how social connections are formed in real networks. We
find that a reliable immunization scheme can be achieved by asking people how
they interact with each other. From these surveys we find that the
probabilistic tendency to connect to a hub has the strongest predictive power
for influential spreaders among tested social mechanisms. Our observation also
suggests that people who connect different communities is more likely to be an
influential spreader when a network has a strong modular structure. Our finding
implies that not only the effect of network location but also the behavior of
individuals is important to design optimal immunization or spreading schemes.
