I reflect on the statistical methods of the Christakis-Fowler studies on
network-based contagion of traits by checking the sensitivity of these kinds of
results to various alternate specifications and generative mechanisms. Despite
the honest efforts of all involved, I remain pessimistic about establishing
whether binary health outcomes or product adoptions are contagious if the
evidence comes from simultaneously observed data.
