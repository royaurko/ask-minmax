We discuss the simultaneous resummation of threshold and recoil enhancements
to partonic cross sections due to soft radiation. Our method is based on a
refactorization of the parton cross section near its partonic threshold. It
avoids double counting, conserves the flow of partonic energy, and reproduces
either threshold or recoil resummation when the other enhancements are
neglected.
