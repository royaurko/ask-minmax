We consider a model for diffusion in a network that captures both the scope
of infection and its propagation time: The edges of the network have associated
lengths which model transmission times, and influence scores are higher for
faster propagation. We propose an intuitive measure of {\it timed influence},
which extends and unifies several classic measures, including the well-studied
"binary" influence [Richardson and Domingos 2002; Kempe et al. 2003] (which
only measures scope), a recently-studied {\it threshold} model of timed
influence [Gomez-Rodriguez et al. 2011] (which considers a node influenced only
within a fixed time horizon), and {\it closeness centrality} (which is extended
from being defined for a single node to multiple seed nodes and from a fixed
network to distributions). Finally, we provide the first highly scalable
algorithms for timed influence computation and maximization. In particular, we
improve by orders of magnitude the scalability of state-of-the-art threshold
timed influence computation. Moreover, our design provides robust guarantees
and is novel also as a theoretical contribution.
