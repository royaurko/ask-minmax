The functioning of a living cell is largely determined by the structure of
its regulatory network, comprising non-linear interactions between regulatory
genes. An important factor for the stability and evolvability of such
regulatory systems is neutrality - typically a large number of alternative
network structures give rise to the necessary dynamics. Here we study the
discretized regulatory dynamics of the yeast cell cycle [Li et al., PNAS, 2004]
and the set of networks capable of reproducing it, which we call functional.
Among these, the empirical yeast wildtype network is close to optimal with
respect to sparse wiring. Under point mutations, which establish or delete
single interactions, the neutral space of functional networks is fragmented
into 4.7 * 10^8 components. One of the smaller ones contains the wildtype
network. On average, functional networks reachable from the wildtype by
mutations are sparser, have higher noise resilience and fewer fixed point
attractors as compared with networks outside of this wildtype component.
