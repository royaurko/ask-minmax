This paper aims at analyzing the problems related to collaborative work using
a PLM system. This research is mainly focused on the organisational aspects of
SMEs involved in networks composed of large companies, subcontractors and other
industrial partners. From this analysis, we propose the deployment of an
approach based on an observation process of tracks generated by PLM system. The
specific contributions are of two fold. First is to identify the brake points
of collaborative work. The second, thanks to the exploitation of generated
tracks, it allows reducing risks by reacting in real time to the incidents or
dysfunctions that may occur. The overall system architecture based on services
technology and supporting the proposed approach is described, as well as
associated prototype developed using an industrial PLM system.
