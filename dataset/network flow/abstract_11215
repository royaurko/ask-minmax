Wireless Sensor networks are dense networks of small, low-cost sensors, which
collect and disseminate environmental data and thus facilitate monitoring and
controlling of physical environment from remote locations with better accuracy.
The major challenge is to achieve energy efficiency during the communication
among the nodes. This paper aims at proposing a solution to schedule the node's
activities to reduce the energy consumption. We propose the construction of a
decentralized lifetime maximizing tree within clusters. We aim at minimizing
the distance of transmission with minimization of energy consumption. The
sensor network is distributed into clusters based on the close proximity of the
nodes. Data transfer among the nodes is done with a hybrid technique of both
TDMA/ FDMA which leads to efficient utilization of bandwidth and maximizing
throughput.
