A classification of critical behavior is provided in systems for which the
renormalization group equations are control-parameter dependent. It describes
phase transitions in networks with a recursive, hierarchical structure but
appears to apply also to a wider class of systems, such as conformal field
theories. Although these transitions generally do not exhibit universality,
three distinct regimes of characteristic critical behavior can be discerned
that combine an unusual mixture of finite- and infinite-order transitions. In
the spirit of Landau's description of a phase transition, the problem can be
reduced to the local analysis of a cubic recursion equation, here, for the
renormalization group flow of some generalized coupling. Among other insights,
this theory explains the often-noted prevalence of the so-called inverted
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in complex networks. As a
demonstration, a one-parameter family of Ising models on hierarchical networks
is considered.
