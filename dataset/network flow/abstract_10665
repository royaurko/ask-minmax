Caching popular contents at the base station (BS) can reduce the backhaul
cost and improve the network throughput. Yet whether locally caching at the BSs
can improve the energy efficiency (EE), a major goal for 5th-generation
cellular networks, remains unclear. Due to the entangled impact of various
factors on EE such as interference level, backhaul capacity, BS density, power
consumption parameters, BS sleeping, content popularity and cache capacity,
another important question is what are the key factors that contribute more to
the EE gain from caching. In this paper, we attempt to explore the potential of
EE of the cache-enabled wireless access networks and identify the key factors.
By deriving the closed-form expression of the EE, we provide the condition when
the EE can benefit from caching, find the optimal cache capacity that maximizes
the network EE, and analyze the maximal EE gain brought by caching. We show
that caching at the BSs can improve the network EE when power efficient cache
hardware is used. When local caching has EE gain over not caching, caching more
files at the BSs may not provide higher EE. Numerical and simulation results
validate our analysis and show that the caching EE gain is large when the
backhaul capacity is stringent, interference level is low, cached files are
popular, and when caching at pico BSs instead of macro BSs.
