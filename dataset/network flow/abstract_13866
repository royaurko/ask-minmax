An experimental investigation of the acoustical behaviour of a liner in a
rectangu- lar channel with grazing flow has been conducted. The liner consists
of a ceramic structure of parallel square channels: 1mm by 1 mm in cross
section, 65 mm in length, and a surface density of 400 channels/inch square.
The channels are rigidly terminated, thus constituting a locally reacting
structure. In the absence of flow the liner reacts classically: There is a
significant decrease in transmission coefficient around the frequency of
minimal impedance. When the wall is exposed to a grazing flow this behaviour is
changed: an increase in transmission coefficient appears at this resonance
frequency. The transmission coefficient can be even rise above 1 (up to 3 for a
Mach number of 0.3). This behaviour is caused by the appearance of a
hydrodynamic instability above the liner. Furthermore, the stationary pressure
drop induced by this liner is deeply affected by its acoustic behaviour. When a
sound wave is added, at the resonance frequency of the liner, the pressure drop
can increase by a factor 3 when the Mach number is 0.3. This effect is
attributed to a modification of the turbulent boundary layer induced by the
acoustic wave.
