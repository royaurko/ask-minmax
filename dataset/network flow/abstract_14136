The spatial emission from the core of cooling flow clusters of galaxies is
inadequately described by a beta-model(Cavaliere and Fusco-Femiano 1976).
Spectrally, the central region of these clusters are well approximated with a
two-temperature model, where the inner temperature represents the multiphase
status of the core and the outer temperature is a measure of the ambient gas
temperature.Following this observational evidence, I extend the use of the
beta-model to a two-phase gas emission, where the two components coexist within
a boundary radius r_cool and the ambient gas alone fills the volume shell at
radius above r_cool. This simple model still provides an analytic expression
for the total surface brightness profile. Based upon a physically meaningful
model for the X-ray emission, this formula can be used (i) to improve
significantly the modeling of the surface brightness profile of cooling flow
clusters of galaxies when compared to the standard beta-model results, (ii) to
constrain properly the physical characteristics of the intracluster plasma in
the outskirts, like, e.g., the ambient gas temperature.
