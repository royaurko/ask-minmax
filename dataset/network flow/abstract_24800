Boolean network models have gained popularity in computational systems
biology over the last dozen years. Many of these networks use canalizing
Boolean functions, which has led to increased interest in the study of these
functions. The canalizing depth of a function describes how many canalizing
variables can be recursively picked off, until a non-canalizing function
remains. In this paper, we show how every Boolean function has a unique
algebraic form involving extended monomial layers and a well-defined core
polynomial. This generalizes recent work on the algebraic structure of nested
canalizing functions, and it yields a stratification of all Boolean functions
by their canalizing depth. As a result, we obtain closed formulas for the
number of n-variable Boolean functions with depth k, which simultaneously
generalizes enumeration formulas for canalizing, and nested canalizing
functions.
