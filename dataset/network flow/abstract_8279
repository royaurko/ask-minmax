We show, both analytically and numerically, that erroneous data transmission
generates a global transition within a competitive population playing the
Minority Game on a network. This transition, which resembles a phase
transition, is driven by a `temporal symmetry breaking' in the global outcome
series. The phase boundary, which is a function of the network connectivity $p$
and the error probability $q$, is described quantitatively by the
Crowd-Anticrowd theory.
