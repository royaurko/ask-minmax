Turbulence driven zonal flows play an important role in fusion devices since
they improve plasma confinement by limiting the level of anomalous transport.
Current theories mostly focus on flow excitation but do not self-consistently
describe the nearly stationary zonal flow turbulence equilibrium state.
First-principles two-fluid turbulence studies are used to construct a Reynolds
stress response functional from observations in turbulent states. This permits,
for the first time, a reliable charting of zonal flow turbulence equilibria.
