Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) are expected to have great potential to
improve both traffic safety and comfort in the future. When many vehicles want
to access data through roadside unit, data scheduling become an important
issue. In this paper, we identify some challenges in roadside based data
access. To address these challenges we first review some existing scheduling
schemes. We then propose a priority scheduling and finally show that using this
idea can increase QOS compare to previous algorithms.
