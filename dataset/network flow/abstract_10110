We study large scale structure in the cosmology of Coleman-de Luccia bubble
collisions. Within a set of controlled approximations we calculate the effects
on galaxy motion seen from inside a bubble which has undergone such a
collision. We find that generically bubble collisions lead to a coherent bulk
flow of galaxies on some part of our sky, the details of which depend on the
initial conditions of the collision and redshift to the galaxy in question.
With other parameters held fixed the effects weaken as the amount of inflation
inside our bubble grows, but can produce measurable flows past the number of
efolds required to solve the flatness and horizon problems.
