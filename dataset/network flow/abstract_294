We introduce a parabolic blow-up method to study the asymptotic behavior of
an integral Brakke flow of planar networks (i.e. a 1-dimensional integral
Brakke flow in a two dimensional region) weakly close in a space-time region to
a static multiplicity 1 triple junction $J$. We show that such a network flow
is regular in a smaller space-time region, in the sense that it consists of
three curves coming smoothly together at a single point at 120 degree angles,
staying smoothly close to $J$ and moving smoothly. Using this result and
White's stratification theorem, we deduce that whenever an integral Brakke flow
of networks in a space-time region ${\mathcal R}$ has no static tangent flow
with density $\geq2$, there exists a closed subset $\Sigma \subset {\mathcal
R}$ of parabolic Hausdorff dimension at most 1 such that the flow is classical
in ${\mathcal R} \setminus \Sigma$, i.e. near every point in ${\mathcal R}
\setminus \Sigma$, the flow, if non-empty, consists of either an embedded curve
moving smoothly or three embedded curves meeting smoothly at a single point at
120 degree angles and moving smoothly. In particular, such a flow is classical
at all times except for a closed set of times of ordinary Hausdorff dimension
at most $\frac{1}{2}$.
