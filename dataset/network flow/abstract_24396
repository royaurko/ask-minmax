We study distributed optimization where nodes cooperatively minimize the sum
of their individual, locally known, convex costs $f_i(x)$'s, $x \in {\mathbb
R}^d$ is global. Distributed augmented Lagrangian (AL) methods have good
empirical performance on several signal processing and learning applications,
but there is limited understanding of their convergence rates and how it
depends on the underlying network. This paper establishes globally linear
(geometric) convergence rates of a class of deterministic and randomized
distributed AL methods, when the $f_i$'s are twice continuously differentiable
and have a bounded Hessian. We give explicit dependence of the convergence
rates on the underlying network parameters. Simulations illustrate our
analytical findings.
