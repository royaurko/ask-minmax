Randomising networks using a naive `accept-all' edge-swap algorithm is
generally biased. Building on recent results for nondirected graphs, we
construct an ergodic detailed balance Markov chain with non-trivial acceptance
probabilities for directed graphs, which converges to a strictly uniform
measure and is based on edge swaps that conserve all in- and out-degrees. The
acceptance probabilities can also be generalized to define Markov chains that
target any alternative desired measure on the space of directed graphs, in
order to generate graphs with more sophisticated topological features. This is
demonstrated by defining a process tailored to the production of directed
graphs with specified degree-degree correlation functions. The theory is
implemented numerically and tested on synthetic and biological network
examples.
