We propose a numerical method for stationary Mean Field Games defined on a
network. In this framework a correct approximation of the transition conditions
at the vertices plays a crucial role. We prove existence, uniqueness and
convergence of the scheme and we also propose a least squares method for the
solution of the discrete system. Numerical experiments are carried out.
