An explicit reciprocal transformation between a 2-component generalization of
the Camassa-Holm equation, called the 2-CH system, and the first negative flow
of the AKNS hierarchy is established, this transformation enables one to obtain
solutions of the 2-CH system from those of the first negative flow of the AKNS
hierarchy. Interesting examples of peakon and multi-kink solutions of the 2-CH
system are presented.
