Recent Microsoft security bulletins show that kernel vulnerabilities are
becoming more and more important security threats. Despite the pretty extensive
security mitigations many of the kernel vulnerabilities are still exploitable.
Successful kernel exploitation typically grants the attacker maximum privilege
level and results in total machine compromise.
  To protect against kernel exploitation, we have developed a tool which
statically rewrites the Microsoft Windows kernel as well as other kernel level
modules. Such rewritten binary files allow us to monitor control flow transfers
during operating system execution. At this point we are able to detect whether
selected control transfer flow is valid or should be considered as an attack
attempt. Our solution is especially directed towards preventing remote kernel
exploitation attempts. Additionally, many of the local privilege escalation
attacks are also blocked (also due to additional mitigation techniques we have
implemented). Our tool was tested with Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista and
Windows 7 (under both virtual and physical machines) on IA-32 compatible
processors. Our apparatus is also completely standalone and does not require
any third party software.
