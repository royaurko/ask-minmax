The Bianconi-Barabasi model of a growing network is revisited. This model,
defined by a preferential attachment rule involving both the degrees of the
nodes and their intrinsic fitnesses, has the fundamental property to undergo a
phase transition to a condensed phase below some finite critical temperature,
for an appropriate choice of the distribution of fitnesses. At high temperature
it exhibits a crossover to the Barabasi-Albert model, and at low temperature,
where the fitness landscape becomes very rugged, a crossover to the recently
introduced record-driven growth process. We first present an analysis of the
history of leaders, the leader being defined as the node with largest degree at
a given time. In the generic finite-temperature regime, new leaders appear
endlessly, albeit on a doubly logarithmic time scale, i.e., extremely slowly.
We then give a novel picture for the dynamics in the condensed phase. The
latter is characterized by an infinite hierarchy of condensates, whose sizes
are non-self-averaging and keep fluctuating forever.
