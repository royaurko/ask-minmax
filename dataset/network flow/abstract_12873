The stretching of a polymer chain by a large scale chaotic flow is
considered. The steady state which emerges as a balance of the turbulent
stretching and anharmonic resistance of the chain is quantitatively described,
i.e. the dependency on the flow parameters (Lyapunov exponent statistics) and
the chain characteristics (the number of beads and the inter-bead elastic
potential) is made explicit.
