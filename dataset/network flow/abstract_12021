We show that current localization in polycrystalline varistors occurs on
paths which are, usually, in the universality class of the directed polymer in
a random medium. We also show that in ceramic superconductors, voltage
localizes on a surface which maps to an Ising domain wall. The emergence of
these manifolds is explained and their structure is illustrated using direct
solution of non-linear resistor networks.
