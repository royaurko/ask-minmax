An analytical approach to calculating bond percolation thresholds, sizes of
$k$-cores, and sizes of giant connected components on structured random
networks with non-zero clustering is presented. The networks are generated
using a generalization of Trapman's [P. Trapman, Theor. Pop. Biol. {\bf 71},
160 (2007)] model of cliques embedded in tree-like random graphs. The resulting
networks have arbitrary degree distributions and tunable degree-dependent
clustering. The effect of clustering on the bond percolation thresholds for
networks of this type is examined and contrasted with some recent results in
the literature. For very high levels of clustering the percolation threshold in
these generalized Trapman networks is increased above the value it takes in a
randomly-wired (unclustered) network of the same degree distribution. In
assortative scale-free networks, where the variance of the degree distribution
is infinite, this clustering effect can lead to a non-zero percolation
(epidemic) threshold.
