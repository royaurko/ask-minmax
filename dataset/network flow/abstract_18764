Transmission capacity of an ad hoc wireless network is analyzed when each
node of the network harvests energy from nature, e.g. solar, wind, vibration
etc. Transmission capacity is the maximum allowable density of nodes,
satisfying a per transmitter-receiver rate, and an outage probability
constraint. Energy arrivals at each node are assumed to follow a Bernoulli
distribution, and each node stores energy using an energy buffer/battery. For
ALOHA medium access protocol (MAP), optimal transmission probability that
maximizes the transmission capacity is derived as a function of the energy
arrival distribution. Game theoretic analysis is also presented for ALOHA MAP,
where each transmitter tries to maximize its own throughput, and symmetric Nash
equilibrium is derived. For CSMA MAP, back-off probability and outage
probability are derived in terms of input energy distribution, thereby
characterizing the transmission capacity.
