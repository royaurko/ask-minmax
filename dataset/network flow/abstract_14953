A Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free network is constructed whose nodes are the
Poisson distributed random points within a unit square and links are the
straight line connections among the nodes. The cost function, which is the
total wiring length associated with a such a network defined on a two
dimensional plane is optimized. The optimization process consists of random
selection of a pair of links and rewiring them to reduce the total length of
the pair but with the constraint that the degree as well as the out-degree and
in-degree of each node are precisely maintained. The resulting optimized
network has a small diameter as well as high clustering and the link length
distribution has a stretched exponential tail.
