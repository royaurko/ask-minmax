We develop a model for gels and entangled solutions of semiflexible
biopolymers such as F-actin. Such networks play a crucial structural role in
the cytoskeleton of cells. We show that the rheologic properties of these
networks can result from nonclassical rubber elasticity. This model can explain
a number of elastic properties of such networks {\em in vitro}, including the
concentration dependence of the storage modulus and yield strain.
