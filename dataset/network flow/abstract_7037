We study the impact of including the self-energy feedback and
frequency-dependent interactions on functional renormalization group grows for
the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice at weak to moderate
coupling strength. Previous studies using the functional renormalization group
had ignored these two ingredients to large extent, and the question is how much
the flows to strong coupling analyzed by this method depend on these
approximations. Here we include the imaginary part of the self-energy on the
imaginary axis and the frequency-dependence of the running interactions on a
frequency mesh of 10 frequencies on the Matsubara axis. We find that i) the
critical scales for the flows to strong coupling are shifted downwards by a
factor that is usually of order one but can get larger in specific parameter
regions, and ii) that the leading channel in this flow does not depend strongly
on whether self-energies and frequency-dependence is included or not. We also
discuss the main features of the self-energies developing during the flows.
