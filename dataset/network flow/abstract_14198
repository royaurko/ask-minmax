Heat conduction plays an important role in the balance between heating and
cooling in many astrophysical objects, e.g. cooling flows in clusters of
galaxies. Here we investigate the effect of heat conduction on the interaction
between a cool disk and a hot corona around black holes. Using the
one-radial-zone approximation, we study the vertical structure of the disk
corona and derive evaporation and coronal mass flow rates for various reduced
thermal conductivities. We find lower evaporation rates and a shift in the
evaporation maxima to smaller radii. This implies that the spectral state
transition occurs at a lower mass flow rate and a disk truncation closer to the
black hole. Reductions of thermal conductivity are thought to be magnetically
caused and might vary from object to object by a different configuration of the
magnetic fields.
