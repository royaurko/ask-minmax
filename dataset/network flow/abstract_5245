Flows between concentric, counter rotating spherical boundaries are under
investigation in the gap with size equal to inner sphere radius. Outer sphere
rotational rate is fixed, while inner sphere rotational rate has time periodic
variations. The amplitudes and frequencies of these variations are small
relative to both spheres averaged rotational rates. With amplitude increase
transition from initial periodical flow to chaos is occurred. To determine
state of the flow time series of azimuthal velocity, taken with laser Doppler
anemometry, were used. We demonstrate appearance of flow states in the form of
chaos-chaos and cycle-chaos-chaos intermittency. A procedure is considered
which allow quantitatively confirm distinct properties of different patterns of
time alternating flow state with intermittency.
