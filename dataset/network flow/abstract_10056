An analytical model for zonal flow generation by toroidal
ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) modes, including finite $\beta$ electromagnetic
effects, is derived. The derivation is based on a fluid model for ions and
electrons and takes into account both linear and nonlinear $\beta$ effects. The
influence of finite plasma $\beta$ on the zonal flow growth rate
($\gamma_{ZF}$) scaling is investigated for typical tokamak plasma parameters.
The results show the importance of the zonal flows close to marginal stability
where $\gamma_{ZF}/\gamma_{ITG}>>1$ is obtained. In this region the parameter
$\gamma_{ZF}/\gamma_{ITG}$ increases with $\beta$, indicating that the ITG
turbulence and associated transport would decrease with $\beta$ at a faster
rate than expected from a purely linear or quasi-linear analysis.
