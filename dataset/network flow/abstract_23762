Single node failures represent more than 85% of all node failures in the
today's large communication networks such as the Internet. Also, these node
failures are usually transient. Consequently, having the routing paths globally
recomputed does not pay off since the failed nodes recover fairly quickly, and
the recomputed routing paths need to be discarded. Instead, we develop
algorithms and protocols for dealing with such transient single node failures
by suppressing the failure (instead of advertising it across the network), and
routing messages to the destination via alternate paths that do not use the
failed node. We compare our solution to that of Ref. [11] wherein the contributors
have presented a "Failure Insensitive Routing" protocol as a proactive recovery
scheme for handling transient node failures. We show that our algorithms are
faster by an order of magnitude while our paths are equally good. We show via
simulation results that our paths are usually within 15% of the optimal for
randomly generated graph with 100-1000 nodes.
