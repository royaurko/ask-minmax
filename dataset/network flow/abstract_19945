Area-preserving diffeomorphisms of a 2-disc can be regarded as time-1 maps of
(non-autonomous) Hamiltonian flows on solid tori, periodic flow-lines of which
define braid (conjugacy) classes, up to full twists. We examine the dynamics
relative to such braid classes and define a braid Floer homology. This
refinement of the Floer homology originally used for the Arnol'd Conjecture
yields a Morse-type forcing theory for periodic points of area-preserving
diffeomorphisms of the 2-disc based on braiding.
  Contributions of this paper include (1) a monotonicity lemma for the behavior
of the nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equations with respect to algebraic lengths of
braids; (2) establishment of the topological invariance of the resulting braid
Floer homology; (3) a shift theorem describing the effect of twisting braids in
terms of shifting the braid Floer homology; (4) computation of examples; and
(5) a forcing theorem for the dynamics of Hamiltonian disc maps based on braid
Floer homology.
