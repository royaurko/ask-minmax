Using only the assumption that all interactions between particles in an
accretion flow are electromagnetically mediated, it is shown that the time to
establish equipartition between ions and electrons is shorter than the
characteristic accretion time. Consequently, two-temperature fits to the
spectra of accreting objects are unphysical, and models in which significant
thermal energy is carried across the event horizon are effectively ruled out.
