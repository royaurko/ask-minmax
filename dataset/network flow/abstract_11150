Security and Privacy are two important parameters that need to be considered
when dealing with wireless sensor networks as WSN operate in an unattended
environment and carry sensitive information critical to the application.
However, applying security techniques that consume minimum resources is still a
challenge and this paper makes an attempt to address the same. One of the major
attacks in sensor network is denial of service attack that not only diminishes
the network capacity but also affects the reliability of information being
transmitted. This work is an extension of our previous work which could
successfully detect DDoS using ants. However, no emphasis was made towards the
prevention mechanism. In this paper an ant-based framework that exploits the
significance of stateless and stateful signatures and hence preserving the
legtimate packets only, thereby discarding the contaminated packets has been
proposed.
