Because of their large size, several real-world complex networks can only be
represented and computationally handled in a sampled version. One of the most
common sampling schemes is breadth-first where, after starting from a given
node, its neighbors are taken, and then the neighbors of neighbors, and so on.
Therefore, it becomes an important issue, given a specific network sampled by
the breadth-first method, to try to identify the original node. In addition to
providing a clue about how the sampling was performed, the identification of
the original node also paves the way for the reconstruction of the sampling
dynamics provided the original networks is available. In the current article,
we propose and validate a new and effective methodology for the identification
of the original nodes. The method is based on the calculation of the
accessibility of the nodes in the sampled network. We show that the original
node tends to have the highest values of accessibility. The potential of the
methodology is illustrated with respect to three theoretical complex networks
model as well as a real-world network, namely the United States patent network.
