We present self-similar solutions for advection-dominated accretion flows
with radial viscous force in the presence of outflows from the accretion flow
or infall. The axisymmetric flow is treated in variables integrated over polar
sections and the effects of infall and outflows on the accretion flow are
parametrised for possible configurations compatible with the self-similar
solution. We investigate the resulting accretion flows for three different
viscosity laws and derive upper limits on the viscosity parameter alpha. In
addition, we find a natural connection to non-rotating and spherical accretion
with turbulent viscosity, which is assumed to persist even without differential
rotation. Positive Bernoulli numbers for advection-dominated accretion allow a
fraction of the gas to be expelled in an outflow and the upper limit on the
viscosity predicts that outflows are inevitable for equations of state close to
an ideal gas.
