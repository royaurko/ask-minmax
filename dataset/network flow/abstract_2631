We report measurements of charged particle elliptic flow %($v_2$) at
mid-rapidity in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=62$ and 200
GeV. Using correlations between main STAR TPC and Forward TPCs ensures minimal
bias due to non-flow effects. We further investigate the effect of flow
fluctuations on $v_2/\eps$ scaling studying initial geometry eccentricity
fluctuations in Monte-Carlo Glauber model, consistent with STAR direct
measurements of elliptic flow fluctuations. It is found that accounting for the
effect of flow fluctuations improves $v_2/\eps$ scaling.
