We prove uniform sup-norm estimates for the Monge-Ampere equation with
respect to a family of Kahler metrics which degenerate towards a pull-back of a
metric from a lower dimensional manifold. This is then used to show the
existence of generalized Kahler-Einstein metrics as the limits of the
Kahler-Ricci flow for some holomorphic fibrations (in the spirit of Song and
Tian "The Kahler-Ricci flow on surfaces of positive Kodaira dimension",
arXiv:math/0602150).
