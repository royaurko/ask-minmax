We show that the density of states of random wave equations, normalized by
the square of the frequency, has a peak - sometimes narrow and sometimes broad
- in the range of wave vectors between the disorder correlation length and the
interatomic spacing. The results of this letter may be relevant for
understanding vibrational spectra and light propagation in disordered solids.
