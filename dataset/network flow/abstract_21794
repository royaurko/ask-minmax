In this paper we are interested in the mathematical and numerical analysis of
the time-dependent Galbrun equa- tion in a rigid duct. This equation models the
acoustic propagation in presence of flow [1]. We propose a regu- larized
variational formulation of the problem, in the sub- sonic case, suitable for an
approximation by Lagrange finite elements, and corresponding absorbing boundary
conditions.
