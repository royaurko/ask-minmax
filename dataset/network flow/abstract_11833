A Wireless Sensor Networks is a network formed with sensors that have
characteristics to sensor an area to extract a specific metric, depending of
the application. We would like to analyse the feasibility to use sensors in a
coffee crop. In this work we are evaluating routing protocols using real
dimensions and characteristics of a coffee crop. We evaluate, through
simulation, AODV, DSDV and AOMDV and two variants known in this work as AODVMOD
and AOMDVMOD with 802.15.4 MAC Protocol. For this comparison, we defined three
performance metrics: Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End -to-End Delay and Average
Energy Consumption. Simulation results show that AOMDVMOD overall, outperforms
others routing protocols evaluated, showing that is possible to use WSN in a
real coffee crop environment.
