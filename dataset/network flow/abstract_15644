In this letter, the coexisting coverage and throughput of a wireless network
consisting of multiple subnetworks of different radio access technologies
(RATs) are investigated. The coexisting coverage probability that is defined as
the sum of the density-weighted coverage probabilities of all subnetworks is
found in closed-form and it will be shown to have the concavity over the number
of channels in the unlicensed band. The optimal deployment densities of all
access points (APs) of different RATs that maximize the coexisting coverage
probability will be shown to uniquely exist and found under the derived
constraint on network parameters. The coexisting throughput is defined as the
sum of the throughputs of all subnetworks and numerical results show that it is
significantly higher than the throughput of the unlicensed band only accessed
by WiFi APs.
