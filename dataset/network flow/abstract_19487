The recent development of the lattice gas automata method and its extension
to the lattice Boltzmann method have provided new computational schemes for
solving a variety of partial differential equations and modeling chemically
reacting systems. The lattice gas method, regarded as the simplest microscopic
and kinetic approach which generates meaningful macroscopic dynamics, is fully
parallel and can, as a result, be easily programmed on parallel machines. In
this paper, we introduce the basic principles of the lattice gas method and the
lattice Boltzmann method, their numerical implementations and applications to
chemically reacting systems. Comparisons of the lattice Boltzmann method with
the lattice gas technique and other traditional numerical schemes, including
the finite difference scheme and the pseudo-spectral method, for solving the
Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic fluid flows will be discussed. Recent developments
of the lattice gas and the lattice Boltzmann method and their applications to
pattern formation in chemical reaction-diffusion systems, multiphase fluid
flows and polymeric dynamics will be presented.
