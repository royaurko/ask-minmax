In this paper we derive a hierarchy of integral equations from the 4PI
effective action which have the form of Bethe-Salpeter equations. We show that
the vertex functions defined by these equations can be used to truncate the
exact renormalization group flow equations. This truncation has the property
that the flow is a total derivative with respect to the flow parameter. We also
show that the truncation is equivalent to solving the $n$PI equations of
motion. This result establishes a direct connection between two
non-perturbative methods.
