We take a worldsheet point of view on the relation between Ramond-Ramond
charges, invariants of boundary renormalization group flows and K-theory. In
compact super Wess-Zumino-Witten models, we show how to associate invariants of
the generalized Kondo renormalization group flows to a given supersymmetric
boundary state. The procedure involved is reminiscent of the way one can probe
the Ramond-Ramond charge carried by a D-brane in conformal field theory, and
the set of these invariants is isomorphic to the twisted K-theory of the Lie
group. We construct various supersymmetric boundary states, and we compute the
charges of the corresponding D-branes, disproving two conjectures on this
subject. We find a complete agreement between our algebraic charges and the
geometry of the D-branes.
