In contrast to the standard derivation of Kirchhoff's loop law, which invokes
electric potential, we show, for the linear planar electric network in a
stationary state at the fixed temperature,that loop law can be derived from the
maximum entropy production principle. This means that the currents in network
branches are distributed in such a way as to achieve the state of maximum
entropy production.
