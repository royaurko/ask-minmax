In most wireless networks, nodes have only limited local information about
the state of the network, which includes connectivity and channel state
information. With limited local information about the network, each node's
knowledge is mismatched; therefore, they must make distributed decisions. In
this paper, we pose the following question - if every node has network state
information only about a small neighborhood, how and when should nodes choose
to transmit? While link scheduling answers the above question for
point-to-point physical layers which are designed for an interference-avoidance
paradigm, we look for answers in cases when interference can be embraced by
advanced PHY layer design, as suggested by results in network information
theory.
  To make progress on this challenging problem, we propose a constructive
distributed algorithm that achieves rates higher than link scheduling based on
interference avoidance, especially if each node knows more than one hop of
network state information. We compare our new aggressive algorithm to a
conservative algorithm we have presented in [1]. Both algorithms schedule
sub-networks such that each sub-network can employ advanced
interference-embracing coding schemes to achieve higher rates. Our innovation
is in the identification, selection and scheduling of sub-networks, especially
when sub-networks are larger than a single link.
