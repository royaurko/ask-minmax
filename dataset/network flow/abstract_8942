We construct examples of ergodic vertical flows in periodic configurations of
Eaton lenses of fixed radius. We achieve this by studying a family of infinite
translation surfaces that are $\mathbb{Z}^2$-covers of slit tori. We show that
the Hausdorff dimension of lattices for which the vertical flow is ergodic is
bigger than 3/2. Moreover, the lattices are explicitly constructed.
