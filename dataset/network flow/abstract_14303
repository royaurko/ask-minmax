We introduce a model constitutive law for the dissipative stress tensor of
lamellar phases to account for low frequency and long wavelength flows. Given
the uniaxial symmetry of these phases, we argue that the stress tensor must be
the same as that of a nematic but with the local order parameter being the
slowly varying lamellar wavevector. This assumption leads to a dependence of
the effective dynamic viscosity on orientation of the lamellar phase. We then
consider a model configuration comprising a domain boundary separating
laterally unbounded domains of so called parallel and perpendicularly oriented
lamellae in a uniform, oscillatory, shear flow, and show that the configuration
can be hydrodynamically unstable for the constitutive law chosen. It is argued
that this instability and the secondary flows it creates can be used to infer a
possible mechanism for orientation selection in shear experiments.
