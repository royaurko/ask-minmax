Cygnus A, the nearest truly powerful radio galaxy, resides at the centre of a
massive galaxy cluster. Chandra X-ray observations reveal its cocoon shocks,
radio lobe cavities and an X-ray jet, which are discussed here. It is argued
that X-ray emission from the outer regions of the cocoon shocks is nonthermal.
The X-ray jets are best interpreted as synchrotron emission, suggesting that
they, rather than the radio jets, are the path of energy flow from the nucleus
to the hotspots. In that case, a model shows that the jet flow is
non-relativistic and carries in excess of one solar mass per year.
