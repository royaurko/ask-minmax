We consider a data aggregating wireless network where all nodes have data to
send to a single destination node, the sink. We consider a linear placement of
nodes with the sink at one end. The nodes communicate directly to the sink
(single hop transmission) and we assume that the nodes are scheduled one at a
time by a central scheduler (possibly the sink). The wireless nodes are power
limited and our network objective (notion of fairness) is to maximize the
minimum throughput of the nodes subject to the node power constraints. In this
work, we consider network designs that permit adapting node transmission time,
node transmission power and node placements, and study cross- layer strategies
that seek to maximize the network throughput. Using simulations, we
characterize the performance of the dif- ferent strategies and comment on their
applicability for various network scenarios.
