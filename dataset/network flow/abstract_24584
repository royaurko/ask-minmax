Cooperation and data sharing among national networks and International Meteor
Organization Video Meteor Database (IMO VMDB) resulted in European viDeo MeteOr
Network Database (EDMOND). The current version of the database (EDMOND 5.0)
contains 144 751 orbits collected from 2001 to 2014. In our survey we used
EDMOND database in order to identify existing and new meteor showers in the
database.
  In the first step of the survey, using Dsh criterion we found groups around
each meteor within similarity threshold. Mean parameters of the groups were
calculated and compared using a new function based on geocentric parameters
(solar longitude, right ascension, declination, and geocentric velocity).
Similar groups were merged into final clusters (representing meteor showers),
and compared with IAU Meteor Data Center list of meteor showers. This paper
presents the results obtained by the proposed methodology.
