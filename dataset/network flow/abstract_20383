The diffuse interface model of Cahn-Hilliard-van der Waals is often used to
study various aspects of multi-phase flows such as droplets coalescence and
contact line dynamics. The original model of Cahn-Hilliard-van der Waals uses
an approximation which neglects some surface contributions to the free energy
of the system and is justified by the large distance between the region of
observation and the outer surface of the system. This is not a priori accurate
when considering the dynamics of the contact line on a solid surface. A
modification of the so called natural compositional boundary conditions
obtained by minimization of the surface contribution to the free energy of the
system is proposed for the vapor-liquid interface of a single component and for
a quasi-incompressible binary mixture of partially miscible liquids. The
results are obtained for a stagnant fluid in thermodynamic equilibrium but
should be valid in a flow if local thermodynamic equilibrium can be assumed.
