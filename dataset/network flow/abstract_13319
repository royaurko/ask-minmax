Bulk viscosity suppresses elliptic flow v_2, as does shear viscosity. It can
thus not be neglected when extracting the shear viscosity from elliptic flow
data. We here explore uncertainties in the bulk viscous contribution to viscous
v_2 suppression that arise from presently uncontrolled uncertainties in the
initial value of the bulk viscous pressure and its microscopic relaxation time.
