Investigation of the final hadronic state properties of ultra-relativistics
pp and Au+Au collisions supplies information on freeze-out conditions at RHIC
and possible insights into early stages of these collisions. A variety of
particle spectra measured by STAR are studied within the framework of chemical
and local kinetic equlibrium models. Here we present the extracted chemical and
final kinetic freeze-out temperatures, strangeness saturation factor, final
collective flow velocity, and the inferred flow velocity at chemical
freeze-out. In light of those measurements we disscuss dynamical evoution of
the collission system.
