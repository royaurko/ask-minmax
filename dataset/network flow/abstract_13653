We theoretically explore the notion of nonreciprocal near-zone manipulation
of electromagnetic fields within subwavelength plasmonic nanostructures
embedded in magneto-optical materials. We derive an analytical model predicting
a strong, magneto-optically induced time-reversal symmetry breaking of
localized plasmonic resonances in topologically symmetric structures. Our
numerical simulations of plasmon excitations reveal a considerable near-zone
power flow rotation within such hybrid nanostructures, demonstrating nanoscale
nonreciprocity. This can be considered as another mechanism for tuning
plasmonic phenomena at the nanoscale.
