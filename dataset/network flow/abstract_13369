We report the observation of energetic jet production in proton-proton
collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV, based on about 1 nb^-1 of integrated luminosity
collected by the ATLAS detector. The anti-kT algorithm is used to reconstruct
jets with pT > 30 GeV and |y| < 2.8. Jets with pT up to ~500 GeV and events
with dijet mass up to ~1 TeV are observed. The jet shapes and charged particle
flow confirm that the observed jet signal corresponds to collimated flows of
particles in the final state.
