Network science methods have proved to be able to provide useful insights
from both a theoretical and a practical point of view in that they can better
inform governance policies in complex dynamic environments. The tourism
research community has provided an increasing number of works that analyse
destinations from a network science perspective. However, most of the studies
refer to relatively small samples of actors and linkages. With this note we
provide a full network study, although at a preliminary stage, that reports a
complete analysis of a Romanian destination (Sibiu). Our intention is to
increase the set of similar studies with the aim of supporting the
investigations in structural and dynamical characteristics of tourism
destinations.
