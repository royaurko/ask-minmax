We define a notion of network capacity region of networks that generalizes
the notion of network capacity defined by Cannons et al. and prove its notable
properties such as closedness, boundedness and convexity when the finite field
is fixed. We show that the network routing capacity region is a computable
rational polytope and provide exact algorithms and approximation heuristics for
computing the region. We define the semi-network linear coding capacity region,
with respect to a fixed finite field, that inner bounds the corresponding
network linear coding capacity region, show that it is a computable rational
polytope, and provide exact algorithms and approximation heuristics. We show
connections between computing these regions and a polytope reconstruction
problem and some combinatorial optimization problems, such as the minimum cost
directed Steiner tree problem. We provide an example to illustrate our results.
The algorithms are not necessarily polynomial-time.
