Multi-tier cellular communication networks constitute a promising approach to
expand the coverage of cellular networks and enable them to offer higher data
rates. In this paper, an uplink two-tier communication network is studied, in
which macro users, femto users and femto access points are geometrically
located inside the coverage area of a macro base station according to Poisson
point processes. Each femtocell is assumed to have a fixed backhaul constraint
that puts a limit on the maximum number of femto and macro users it can
service. Under this backhaul constraint, the network adopts a special open
access policy, in which each macro user is either assigned to its closest femto
access point or to the macro base station, depending on the ratio between its
distances from those two. Under this model, upper and lower bounds on the
outage probabilities experienced by users serviced by femto access points are
derived as functions of the distance between the macro base station and the
femto access point serving them. Similarly, upper and lower bounds on the
outage probabilities of the users serviced by the macro base station are
obtained. The bounds in both cases are confirmed via simulation results.
