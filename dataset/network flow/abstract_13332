This paper introduces a spatially continuous force-based model for simulating
pedestrian dynamics. The main intention of this work is the quantitative
description of pedestrian movement through bottlenecks and in corridors.
Measurements of flow and density at bottlenecks will be presented and compared
with empirical data. Furthermore the fundamental diagram for the movement in a
corridor is reproduced. The results of the proposed model show a good agreement
with empirical data.
