Free and open source software (FOSS) is considered by many, along with
Wikipedia, the proof of an ongoing paradigm shift from hierarchically-managed
and market-driven production of knowledge to heterarchical, collaborative and
commons-based production styles. In such perspective, it has become common
place to refer to FOSS as a manifestation of collective intelligence where
deliverables and artefacts emerge by virtue of mere cooperation, with no need
for supervising leadership. The paper argues that this assumption is based on
limited understanding of the software development process, and may lead to
wrong conclusions as to the potential of peer production. The development of a
less than trivial piece of software, irrespective of whether it be FOSS or
proprietary, is a complex cooperative effort requiring the participation of
many (often thousands of) individuals. A subset of the participants always play
the role of leading system and subsystem designers, determining architecture
and functionality; the rest of the people work "underneath" them in a logical,
functional sense. While new and powerful forces, including FOSS, are clearly at
work in the post-industrial, networked econ-omy, the currently ingenuous stage
of research in the field of collective intelligence and networked cooperation
must give way to a deeper level of consciousness, which requires an
understanding of the software development process.
