We investigate the Robust Multiperiod Network Design Problem, a
generalization of the Capacitated Network Design Problem (CNDP) that, besides
establishing flow routing and network capacity installation as in a canonical
CNDP, also considers a planning horizon made up of multiple time periods and
protection against fluctuations in traffic volumes. As a remedy against traffic
volume uncertainty, we propose a Robust Optimization model based on Multiband
Robustness (B\"using and D'Andreagiovanni, 2012), a refinement of classical
Gamma-Robustness by Bertsimas and Sim that uses a system of multiple deviation
bands. Since the resulting optimization problem may prove very challenging even
for instances of moderate size solved by a state-of-the-art optimization
solver, we propose a hybrid primal heuristic that combines a randomized fixing
strategy inspired by ant colony optimization, which exploits information coming
from linear relaxations of the problem, and an exact large neighbourhood
search. Computational experiments on a set of realistic instances from the
SNDlib show that our original heuristic can run fast and produce solutions of
extremely high quality associated with low optimality gaps.
