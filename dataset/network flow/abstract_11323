This work deals with the construction of networks of topological defects in
models described by a single complex scalar field. We take advantage of the
deformation procedure recently used to describe kinklike defects in order to
build networks of topological defects, which appear from complex field models
with potentials that engender a finite number of isolated minima, both in the
case where the minima present discrete symmetry, and in the non symmetric case.
We show that the presence of symmetry guide us to the construction of regular
networks, while the non symmetric case gives rise to irregular networks which
spread throughout the complex field space. We also discuss bifurcation, a
phenomenon that appear in the non symmetric case, but is washed out by the
deformation procedure used in the present work.
