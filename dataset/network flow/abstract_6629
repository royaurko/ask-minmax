Bootstrap percolation is a well-known model to study the spreading of rumors,
new products or innovations on social networks. The empirical studies show that
community structure is ubiquitous among various social networks. Thus, studying
the bootstrap percolation on the complex networks with communities can bring us
new and important insights of the spreading dynamics on social networks. It
attracts a lot of scientists' attentions recently. In this letter, we study the
bootstrap percolation on Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi networks with communities and
observed second order, hybrid (both second and first order) and multiple hybrid
phase transitions, which is rare in natural system. Moreover, we have
analytically solved this system and obtained the phase diagram, which is
further justified well by the corresponding simulations.
