We present a new architecture to handle the ongoing explosive increase in the
demand for video content in wireless networks. It is based on distributed
caching of the content in femto-basestations with small or non-existing
backhaul capacity but with considerable storage space, called helper nodes. We
also consider using the mobile terminals themselves as caching helpers, which
can distribute video through device-to-device communications. This approach
allows an improvement in the video throughput without deployment of any
additional infrastructure. The new architecture can improve video throughput by
one to two orders-of-magnitude.
