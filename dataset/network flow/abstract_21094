Motivated by the problem of sorting, we introduce two simple combinatorial
models with distinct Hamiltonians yet identical spectra (and hence partition
function) and show that the local dynamics of these models are very different.
After a deep quench, one model slowly relaxes to the sorted state whereas the
other model becomes blocked by the presence of stable local minima.
