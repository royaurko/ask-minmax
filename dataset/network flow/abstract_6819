In a previous paper [I. Bena, M. Malek Mansour, and F. Baras, ``Hydrodynamic
fluctuations in the Kolmogorov flow: Linear regime", Phys. Rev. E 59, 5503 -
5510 (1999)] the statistical properties of the linearized Kolmogorov flow have
been studied, using the formalism of fluctuating hydrodynamics. In this paper
the nonlinear regime is considered, with emphasis on the statistical properties
of the flow near the first instability. The normal form amplitude equation is
derived for the case of an incompressible fluid and the velocity field is
constructed explicitly above (but closed to) the instability. The relative
simplicity of this flow allows one to analyze the compressible case as well.
Using a perturbative technique, it is shown that close to the instability
threshold the stochastic dynamics of the system is governed by two coupled non
linear Langevin equations in the Fourier space. The solution of these equations
can becast into the exponential of a Landau Ginzburg functional, which proves
to be identical to the one obtained for the case of the incompressible fluid.
The theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the
nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic equations.
