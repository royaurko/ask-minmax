The first example of a turbulent system where the failure of the hypothesis
of small-scale isotropy restoration is detectable both in the `flattening' of
the inertial-range scaling exponent hierarchy, and in the behavior of odd-order
dimensionless ratios, e.g., skewness and hyperskewness, is presented.
Specifically, within the kinematic approximation in magnetohydrodynamical
turbulence, we show that for compressible flows, the isotropic contribution to
the scaling of magnetic correlation functions and the first anisotropic ones
may become practically indistinguishable. Moreover, skewness factor now
diverges as the P\'eclet number goes to infinity, a further indication of
small-scale anisotropy.
