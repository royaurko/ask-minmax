Network service providers and customers are often concerned with aggregate
performance measures that span multiple network paths. Unfortunately, forming
such network-wide measures can be difficult, due to the issues of scale
involved. In particular, the number of paths grows too rapidly with the number
of endpoints to make exhaustive measurement practical. As a result, it is of
interest to explore the feasibility of methods that dramatically reduce the
number of paths measured in such situations while maintaining acceptable
accuracy.
  We cast the problem as one of statistical prediction--in the spirit of the
so-called `kriging' problem in spatial statistics--and show that end-to-end
network properties may be accurately predicted in many cases using a
surprisingly small set of carefully chosen paths. More precisely, we formulate
a general framework for the prediction problem, propose a class of linear
predictors for standard quantities of interest (e.g., averages, totals,
differences) and show that linear algebraic methods of subset selection may be
used to effectively choose which paths to measure. We characterize the
performance of the resulting methods, both analytically and numerically. The
success of our methods derives from the low effective rank of routing matrices
as encountered in practice, which appears to be a new observation in its own
right with potentially broad implications on network measurement generally.
