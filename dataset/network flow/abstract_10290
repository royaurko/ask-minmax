We report experiments on slow granular flows in a split-bottom Couette cell
that show novel strain localization features. Nontrivial flow profiles have
been observed which are shown to be the consequence of simultaneous formation
of shear zones in the bulk and at the boundaries. The fluctuating band model
based on a minimization principle can be fitted to the experiments over a large
variation of morphology and filling height with one single fit parameter, the
relative friction coefficient between wall and bulk. The possibility of
multiple shear zone formation is controlled by the relative friction. Moreover,
we observe that the symmetry of an initial state, with coexisting shear zones
at both side walls, breaks spontaneously below a threshold value of the shear
velocity. A dynamical transition between two asymmetric flow states happens
over a characteristic time scale which depends on the shear strength.
