We have investigated theoretically the influence of an AC drive on heat
transport in a hybrid normal metal - superconductor tunnel junction in the
photon-assisted tunneling regime. We find that the useful heat flux out from
the normal metal is always reduced as compared to its magnitude under the
static and quasi-static drive conditions. Our results are useful to predict the
operative conditions of AC driven superconducting electron refrigerators.
