We present a class of singularity free exact cosmological solutions of
Einstein's equations describing a perfect fluid with heat flow. It is obtained
as generalization of the Senovilla class [1] corresponding to incoherent
radiation field. The spacetime is cylindrically symmetric and globally regular.
