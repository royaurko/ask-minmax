We describe a model of cytoskeletal mechanics based on the force-induced
conformational change of protein cross-links in a stressed polymer network.
Slow deformation of simulated networks containing cross-links that undergo
repeated, serial domain unfolding leads to an unusual state--with many
cross-links accumulating near the critical force for further unfolding. Thermal
activation of these links gives rise to power-law rheology resembling the
previously unexplained mechanical response of living cells. Moreover, we
hypothesize that such protein cross-links function as biochemical
mechano-sensors of cytoskeletal deformation.
