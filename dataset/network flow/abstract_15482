We study how firms select partners using a large database of publicly
announced R&D alliances over a period of 25 years. We identify, for the first
time, two distinct behavioral strategies of firms in forming these alliances.
By reconstructing and analysing the temporal R&D network of 14,000
international firms and 21.000 publicly announced alliances, we find a
"universal" behavior in firms changing between these strategies. In the first
strategy, newcomers and nodes of low centrality initially establish links to
nodes of similar or higher centrality. After these firms have consolidated
their position and increased their centrality, they switch to the second
strategy, and preferably form links to less central nodes. In addition, we show
that $k$-core centrality can be established as a measure of firm's success that
correlates e.g. with the number of patents (obtained from a dataset of 3 Mio
patents). To synthesize our findings, we provide a network growth model based
on $k$-core centrality which reproduces the strategic behavior of firms, as
well as other properties of the empirical network.
