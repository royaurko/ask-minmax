Community detection is a fundamental problem in the domain of complex-network
analysis. It has received great attention, and many community detection methods
have been proposed in the last decade. In this paper, we propose a divisive
spectral method for identifying community structures from networks, which
utilizes a sparsification operation to pre-process the networks first, and then
uses a repeated bisection spectral algorithm to partition the networks into
communities. The sparsification operation makes the community boundaries more
clearer and more sharper, so that the repeated spectral bisection algorithm
extract high-quality community structures accurately from the sparsified
networks. Experiments show that the combination of network sparsification and
spectral bisection algorithm is highly successful, the proposed method is more
effective in detecting community structures from networks than the others.
