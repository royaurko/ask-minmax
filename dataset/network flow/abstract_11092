Computing string or sequence alignments is a classical method of comparing
strings and has applications in many areas of computing, such as signal
processing and bioinformatics. Semi-local string alignment is a recent
generalisation of this method, in which the alignment of a given string and all
substrings of another string are computed simultaneously at no additional
asymptotic cost. In this paper, we show that there is a close connection
between semi-local string alignment and a certain class of traditional
comparison networks known as transposition networks. The transposition network
approach can be used to represent different string comparison algorithms in a
unified form, and in some cases provides generalisations or improvements on
existing algorithms. This approach allows us to obtain new algorithms for
sparse semi-local string comparison and for comparison of highly similar and
highly dissimilar strings, as well as of run-length compressed strings. We
conclude that the transposition network method is a very general and flexible
way of understanding and improving different string comparison algorithms, as
well as their efficient implementation.
