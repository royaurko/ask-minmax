The rise of social media allowed for rich analyses of their content and their
network structure. As traditional media (i.e. newspapers and magazines) are
being digitized, similar analyses can be undertaken. This provides a glimpse of
the elite, as the news mostly revolves around the more influential members of
society. We here focus on a network structure derived from co-occurrences of
people in the media. This network has a strong core with peripheral clusters
being connected to the core. Nonetheless, these characteristics seem to be
mainly a result from the bipartite structure of the data. We employ a simple
growing bipartite model that can qualitatively reproduce such a core-periphery
structure. Two self-reinforcing processes are vital: (1) more frequently
occurring persons are more likely to occur again; and (2) if two people
co-occur frequently, they are more likely to co-occur again. This suggests that
the core-periphery structure is not necessarily reflective of the elite network
in society, but might be an artefact of how they are portrayed in the media.
