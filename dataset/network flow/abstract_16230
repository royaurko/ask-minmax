In this paper we develop a model of an order-driven market where traders set
bids and asks and post market or limit orders according to exogenously fixed
rules. Agents are assumed to have three components to the expectation of future
asset returns, namely-fundamentalist, chartist and noise trader. Furthermore
agents differ in the characteristics describing these components, such as time
horizon, risk aversion and the weights given to the various components. The
model developed here extends a great deal of earlier literature in that the
order submissions of agents are determined by utility maximisation, rather than
the mechanical unit order size that is commonly assumed. In this way the order
flow is better related to the ongoing evolution of the market. For the given
market structure we analyze the impact of the three components of the trading
strategies on the statistical properties of prices and order flows and observe
that it is the chartist strategy that is mainly responsible of the fat tails
and clustering in the artificial price data generated by the model. The paper
provides further evidence that large price changes are likely to be generated
by the presence of large gaps in the book.
