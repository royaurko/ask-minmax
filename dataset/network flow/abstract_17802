The amorphous aluminium silicate (Al2O3)2(SiO2) [AS2] is investigated by
means of large scale molecular dynamics computer simulations. We consider fully
equilibrated melts in the temperature range 6100K >= T >= 2300K as well as
glass configurations that were obtained from cooling runs from T=2300K to 300K
with a cooling rate of about 10^12K/s. Already at temperatures as high as
4000K, most of the Al and Si atoms are four-fold coordinated by oxygen atoms.
Thus, the structure of AS2 is that of a disordered tetrahedral network. The
packing of AlO4 tetrahedra is very different from that of SiO4 tetrahedra in
that Al is involved with a relatively high probability in small-membered rings
and in triclusters in which an O atom is surrounded by four cations. We find as
typical configurations two-membered rings with two Al atoms in which the shared
O atoms form a tricluster. On larger length scales, the system shows a
microphase separation in which the Al-rich network structure percolates through
the SiO2 network. The latter structure gives rise to a prepeak in the static
structure factor at a wavenumber q=0.5\AA^{-1}. The comparison of experimental
X-ray data with the results from the simulation shows a good agreement for the
structure function. The diffusion dynamics in AS2 is found to be much faster
than in SiO2. We show that the self-diffusion constants for O and Al are very
similar and that they are by a factor of 2-3 larger than the one for Si.
