The problem of the Darrieus-Landau instability at a discontinuous
deflagration front in a compressible flow is solved. Numerous previous attempts
to solve this problem suffered from the deficit of boundary conditions. Here,
the required additional boundary condition is derived rigorously taking into
account the internal structure of the front. The derived condition implies a
constant mass flux at the front; it reduces to the classical Darrieus-Landau
condition in the limit of an incompressible flow. It is demonstrated that in
general the solution to the problem depends on the type of energy source
present in the system. In the common case of a strongly localized source,
compression effects make the Darrieus-Landau instability considerably weaker.
In particular, the Darrieus-Landau instability growth rate is reduced for laser
ablation in comparison with the classical incompressible case. The instability
disappears completely in the Chapman-Jouguet regime of ultimately fast
deflagration.
