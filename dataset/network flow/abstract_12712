We report the fabrication and properties of a polymeric memristor, i.e. an
electronic element with memory of its previous history. We show how this
element can be viewed as a functional analog of a synaptic junction and how it
can be used as a critical node in adaptive networks capable of bioinspired
intelligent signal processing.
