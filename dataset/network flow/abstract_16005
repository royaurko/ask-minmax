ZigBee has been recently drawing a lot of attention as a promising solution
for ubiquitous computing. The ZigBee devices are normally resource-limited,
making the network susceptible to a variety of security threats. This paper
presents a severe attack on ZigBee networks termed as ghost, which leverages
the underlying vulnerabilities of the IEEE 802.15.4 security suites to deplete
the energy of the devices. We manifest that the impact of ghost is severe as it
can reduce the lifetime of devices from years to days and facilitate a variety
of threats including denial of service and replay attacks. We highlight that
merely deploying a standard suite of advanced security techniques does not
necessarily guarantee improved security, but instead might be leveraged by
adversaries to cause severe disruption in the network. We propose several
recommendations on how to localize and withstand the ghost and other related
attacks in ZigBee networks. Extensive simulations are provided to show the
impact of the ghost and the performance of the proposed recommendations.
Moreover, physical experiments also have been conducted and the observations
confirm the severity of the impact by the ghost attack. We believe that the
presented work will aid the researchers to improve the security of ZigBee
further.
