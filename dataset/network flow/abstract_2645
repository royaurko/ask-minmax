Deforming a two dimensional conformal field theory on one side of a trivial
defect line gives rise to a defect separating the original theory from its
deformation. The Casimir force between these defects and other defect lines or
boundaries is used to construct flows on bulk moduli spaces of CFTs. It turns
out, that these flows are constant reparametrizations of gradient flows of the
g-functions of the chosen defect or boundary condition. The special flows
associated to supersymmetric boundary conditions in N=(2,2) superconformal
field theories agree with the attractor flows studied in the context of black
holes in N=2 supergravity.
