Network reconstruction helps us understand, diagnose and control complex
networked systems by inferring properties of their interaction matrices, which
characterize how nodes in the systems directly interact with each other.
Despite a decade of extensive studies, network reconstruction remains an
outstanding challenge. The fundamental limitations on which properties of the
interaction matrix can be inferred from accessing the dynamics of individual
nodes remain unknown. Here we characterize these fundamental limitations by
deriving the necessary and sufficient condition to reconstruct any property of
the interaction matrix. Counterintuitively, we prove that inferring less
information ---such as the sign/connectivity pattern or the degree sequence---
does not make the network reconstruction problem easier than recovering the
interaction matrix itself (i.e. the traditional parameter identification
problem). Our analysis also reveals that using prior information of the
interaction matrix ---such as bound on the edge-weights--- is the only way to
circumvent these fundamental limitations of network reconstruction. This sheds
light on designing new algorithms with practical improvements over parameter
identification methods.
