Despite the importance of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) as a
fundamental mechanism for angular momentum transport in magnetized accretion
disks, it has yet to be demonstrated in the laboratory. A liquid sodium
alpha-omega dynamo experiment at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology provides an ideal environment to study the MRI in a rotating metal
annulus (Couette flow). A local stability analysis is performed as a function
of shear, magnetic field strength, magnetic Reynolds number, and turbulent
Prandtl number. The later takes into account the minimum turbulence induced by
the formation of an Ekman layer against the rigidly rotating end walls of a
cylindrical vessel. Stability conditions are presented and unstable conditions
for the sodium experiment are compared with another proposed MRI experiment
with liquid gallium. Due to the relatively large magnetic Reynolds number
achievable in the sodium experiment, it should be possible to observe the
excitation of the MRI for a wide range of wavenumbers and further to observe
the transition to the turbulent state.
