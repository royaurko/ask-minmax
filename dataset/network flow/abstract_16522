A decade of observations in geodetic mode with the VLBA network gave valuable
results. Approximately 1/5 of all geodetic observations are recorded in VLBA
mode and processed at the Socorro correlator. Ten years of observations allowed
us to reliably measure slow intra-plate motion of the VLBA stations located on
the North-American plate. It also helped us to achieve scientific objectives of
geodetic programs: verify models of harmonic and anharmonic site position
variations caused by various loadings, improve models of core-mantle boundary,
investigate mantle rheology and solve other tasks.
