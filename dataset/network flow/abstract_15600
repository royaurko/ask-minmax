In mobile computing systems, users can access network services anywhere and
anytime using mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones. These devices
connect to the Internet via network or telecommunications operators. Users
usually have some expectations about the services provided to them by different
operators. Users' expectations along with additional factors such as cognitive
and behavioural states, cost, and network quality of service (QoS) may
determine their quality of experience (QoE). If users are not satisfied with
their QoE, they may switch to different providers or may stop using a
particular application or service. Thus, QoE measurement and prediction
techniques may benefit users in availing personalized services from service
providers. On the other hand, it can help service providers to achieve lower
user-operator switchover. This paper presents a review of the state-the-art
research in the area of QoE modelling, measurement and prediction. In
particular, we investigate and discuss the strengths and shortcomings of
existing techniques. Finally, we present future research directions for
developing novel QoE measurement and prediction techniques
