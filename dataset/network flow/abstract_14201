The term ``dynamo'' means different things to the laboratory fusion plasma
and astrophysical plasma communities. To alleviate the resulting confusion and
to facilitate interdisciplinary progress, we pinpoint conceptual differences
and similarities between laboratory plasma dynamos and astrophysical dynamos.
We can divide dynamos into three types: 1. magnetically dominated helical
dynamos which sustain a large scale magnetic field against resistive decay and
drive the magnetic geometry toward the lowest energy state, 2. flow-driven
helical dynamos which amplify or sustain large scale magnetic fields in an
otherwise turbulent flow, and 3. flow-driven nonhelical dynamos which amplify
fields on scales at or below the driving turbulence. We discuss how all three
types occur in astrophysics whereas plasma confinement device dynamos are of
the first type. Type 3 dynamos requires no magnetic or kinetic helicity of any
kind. Focusing on type 1 and 2 dynamos, we show how different limits of a
unified set of equations for magnetic helicity evolution reveal both types. We
explicitly describe a steady-state example of a type 1 dynamo, and three
examples of type 2 dynamos: (i) closed volume and time dependent; (ii)
steady-state with open boundaries; (iii) time dependent with open boundaries.
