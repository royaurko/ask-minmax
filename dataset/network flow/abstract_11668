Network traffic data is huge, varying and imbalanced because various classes
are not equally distributed. Machine learning (ML) algorithms for traffic
analysis uses the samples from this data to recommend the actions to be taken
by the network administrators as well as training. Due to imbalances in
dataset, it is difficult to train machine learning algorithms for traffic
analysis and these may give biased or false results leading to serious
degradation in performance of these algorithms. Various techniques can be
applied during sampling to minimize the effect of imbalanced instances. In this
paper various sampling techniques have been analysed in order to compare the
decrease in variation in imbalances of network traffic datasets sampled for
these algorithms. Various parameters like missing classes in samples,
probability of sampling of the different instances have been considered for
comparison.
