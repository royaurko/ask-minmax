Many sunspots are surrounded by a radial outflow called the moat flow. We
investigate the moat flow at two different heights of the solar atmosphere for
a sunspot whose magnetic properties were reported in the first paper of this
series. We use two simultaneous time series taken with the Transition Region
And Coronal Explorer (TRACE) in white light and in the UV at 170 nm. The
field-of-view is centered on the small sunspot NOAA 10886 located near disk
center. Horizontal velocities are derived by applying two different local
correlation tracking techniques. Outflows are found everywhere in the moat. In
the inner moat, the velocities from the UV series are larger than those from
white light, whereas in the outer part of the moat we find the converse result.
The results imply that the white light velocities represent a general outflow
of the quiet sun plasma in the moat, while UV velocities are dominated by small
bright points that move faster than the general plasma flow.
