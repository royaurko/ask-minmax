Interference alignment (IA) was shown effective for interference management
to improve transmission rate in terms of the degree of freedom (DoF) gain. On
the other hand, orthogonal space-time block codes (STBCs) were widely used in
point-to-point multi-antenna channels to enhance transmission reliability in
terms of the diversity gain. In this paper, we connect these two ideas, i.e.,
IA and space-time block coding, to improve the designs of alignment precoders
for multi-user networks. Specifically, we consider the use of Alamouti codes
for IA because of its rate-one transmission and achievability of full diversity
in point-to-point systems. The Alamouti codes protect the desired link by
introducing orthogonality between the two symbols in one Alamouti codeword, and
create alignment at the interfering receiver. We show that the proposed
alignment methods can maintain the maximum DoF gain and improve the ergodic
mutual information in the long-term regime, while increasing the diversity gain
to 2 in the short-term regime. The presented examples of interference networks
have two antennas at each node and include the two-user X channel, the
interferring multi-access channel (IMAC), and the interferring broadcast
channel (IBC).
