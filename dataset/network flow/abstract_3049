Empirical studies on the spatial structures in several real transport
networks reveal that the distance distribution in these networks obeys power
law. To discuss the influence of the power-law exponent on the network's
structure and function, a spatial network model is proposed. Based on a regular
network and subject to a limited cost $C$, long range connections are added
with power law distance distribution $P(r)=ar^{-\delta}$. Some basic
topological properties of the network with different $\delta$ are studied. It
is found that the network has the smallest average shortest path when
$\delta=2$. Then a traffic model on this network is investigated. It is found
that the network with $\delta=1.5$ is best for the traffic process. All of
these results give us some deep understandings about the relationship between
spatial structure and network function.
