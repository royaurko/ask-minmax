We prove that the space of coinvariants of functions on an affine variety by
a Lie algebra of vector fields whose flow generates finitely many leaves is
finite-dimensional. Cases of the theorem include Poisson (or more generally
Jacobi) varieties with finitely many symplectic leaves under Hamiltonian flow,
complete intersections in Calabi-Yau varieties with isolated singularities
under the flow of incompressible vector fields, quotients of Calabi-Yau
varieties by finite volume-preserving groups under the incompressible vector
fields, and arbitrary varieties with isolated singularities under the flow of
all vector fields. We compute this quotient explicitly in many of these cases.
The proofs involve constructing a natural D-module representing the invariants
under the flow of the vector fields, which we prove is holonomic if it has
finitely many leaves (and whose holonomicity we study in more detail). We give
many counterexamples to naive generalizations of our results. These examples
have been a source of motivation for us.
