Recent progresses in understanding the behavior of dense granular flows are
presented. After presenting a bulk rheology of granular materials, I focus on
the new developments to account for non-local effects, and on ongoing research
concerning the surface rheology and the evolution of mechanical properties for
heterogeneous systems.
