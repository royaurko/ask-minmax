We consider the Teichmuller flow on the unit cotangent bundle of the moduli
space of compact Riemann surfaces with punctures. We show that it is
exponentially mixing for the Ratner class of observables. More generally, this
result holds for the restriction of the Teichmuller flow to an arbitrary
connected component of stratum. This result generalizes [AGY] which considered
the case of strata of squares.
