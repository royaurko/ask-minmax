We present a new method for articulating scale-dependent topological
descriptions of the network structure inherent in many complex systems. The
technique is based on "Partition Decoupled Null Models,'' a new class of null
models that incorporate the interaction of clustered partitions into a random
model and generalize the Gaussian ensemble. As an application we analyze a
correlation matrix derived from four years of close prices of equities in the
NYSE and NASDAQ. In this example we expose (1) a natural structure composed of
two interacting partitions of the market that both agrees with and generalizes
standard notions of scale (eg., sector and industry) and (2) structure in the
first partition that is a topological manifestation of a well-known pattern of
capital flow called "sector rotation.'' Our approach gives rise to a natural
form of multiresolution analysis of the underlying time series that naturally
decomposes the basic data in terms of the effects of the different scales at
which it clusters. The equities market is a prototypical complex system and we
expect that our approach will be of use in understanding a broad class of
complex systems in which correlation structures are resident.
