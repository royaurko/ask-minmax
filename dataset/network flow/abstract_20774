We study a social network consisting of agents organized as a hierarchical
M-ary rooted tree, common in enterprise and military organizational structures.
The goal is to aggregate information to solve a binary hypothesis testing
problem. Each agent at a leaf of the tree, and only such an agent, makes a
direct measurement of the underlying true hypothesis. The leaf agent then makes
a decision and sends it to its supervising agent, at the next level of the
tree. Each supervising agent aggregates the decisions from the M members of its
group, produces a summary message, and sends it to its supervisor at the next
level, and so on. Ultimately, the agent at the root of the tree makes an
overall decision. We derive upper and lower bounds for the Type I and II error
probabilities associated with this decision with respect to the number of leaf
agents, which in turn characterize the converge rates of the Type I, Type II,
and total error probabilities. We also provide a message-passing scheme
involving non-binary message alphabets and characterize the exponent of the
error probability with respect to the message alphabet size.
