If two parties, Alice and Bob, share some number, n, of partially entangled
pairs of qubits, then it is possible for them to concentrate these pairs into
some smaller number of maximally entangled states. We present a simplified
version of the algorithm for such entanglement concentration, and we describe
efficient networks for implementing these operations.
