In this paper, a maximum-principle-satisfying finite volume compact scheme is
proposed for solving scalar hyperbolic conservation laws. The scheme combines
WENO schemes (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) with a class of compact
schemes under a finite volume framework, in which the nonlinear WENO weights
are coupled with lower order compact stencils. The maximum-principle-satisfying
polynomial rescaling limiter in [Zhang and Shu, JCP, 2010] is adopted to
construct the present schemes at each stage of an explicit Runge-Kutta method,
without destroying high order accuracy and conservativity. Numerical examples
for one and two dimensional problems including incompressible flows are
presented to assess the good performance, maximum principle preserving,
essentially non-oscillatory and highly accurate resolution of the proposed
method.
