In this work we solve the dynamics of pattern diluted associative networks,
evolving via sequential Glauber update. We derive dynamical equations for the
order parameters, that quantify the simultaneous pattern recall of the system,
and analyse the nature and stability of the stationary solutions by means of
linear stability analysis as well as Monte Carlo simulations. We investigate
the parallel retrieval capabilities of the system in different regions of the
phase space, in particular in the low and medium storage regimes and for finite
and extreme pattern dilution. Results show that in the absence of patterns
cross-talk, all patterns are recalled symmetrically for any temperature below
criticality, while in the presence of pattern cross-talk, symmetric retrieval
becomes unstable as temperature is lowered and a hierarchical retrieval takes
over. The shape of the hierarchical retrieval occurring at zero temperature is
provided. The parallel retrieval capabilities of the network are seen to
degrade gracefully in the regime of strong interference, but they are not
destroyed.
