In many cognitive radio applications, there are multiple types of message
queues. Existing queueing analysis works in underlay CR networks failed to
discuss packets heterogeneity. Therefore high priority packets with impatient
waiting time that have preemptive transmission opportunities over low class are
investigated. We model the system behavior as a M/M/1+GI queue which is
represented by a two dimensional state transition graph. The reneging
probability of high priority packets and the average waiting time in two-class
priority queues is analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the average
waiting time of high priority packets decreases with the growing interference
power threshold and the average waiting time of the low priority packet is
proportional to the arrival rate of the high priority packet. This work may lay
the foundation to design efficient MAC protocols and optimize long term system
performance by carefully choosing system parameters.
