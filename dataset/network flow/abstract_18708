An unknown-position sensor can be localized if there are three or more
anchors making time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements of a signal from it. However,
the location errors can be very large due to the fact that some of the
measurements are from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths. In this paper, we propose
a semi-definite programming (SDP) based node localization algorithm in NLOS
environment for ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless sensor networks. The positions of
sensors can be estimated using the distance estimates from location-aware
anchors as well as other sensors. However, in the absence of LOS paths, e.g.,
in indoor networks, the NLOS range estimates can be significantly biased. As a
result, the NLOS error can remarkably decrease the location accuracy.
  And it is not easy to efficiently distinguish LOS from NLOS measurements. In
this paper, an algorithm is proposed that achieves high location accuracy
without the need of identifying NLOS and LOS measurement.
