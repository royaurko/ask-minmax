The WA98 experiment at the CERN SPS measures Pb+Pb Collisions at 158 AGeV.
The scaling properties of the charged particle multiplicity at midrapidity with
the number of participants are studied using the SPMD and the MIRAC detector.
Neutral pion spectra obtained from the LEDA detector are compared to
hydrodynamical parametrizations. The collective flow in the target
fragmentation region has been studied using the Plastic Ball detector. The
results exhibit a strong dependence on centrality and rapidity.
