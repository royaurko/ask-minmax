Little's law allows to express the mean user throughput in any region of the
network as the ratio of the mean traffic demand to the steady-state mean number
of users in this region. Corresponding statistics are usually collected in
operational networks for each cell. Using ergodic arguments and Palm theoretic
formalism, we show that the global mean user throughput in the network is equal
to the ratio of these two means in the steady state of the "typical cell".
Here, both means account for double averaging: over time and network geometry,
and can be related to the per-surface traffic demand, base-station density and
the spatial distribution of the SINR. This latter accounts for network
irregularities, shadowing and idling cells via cell-load equations. We validate
our approach comparing analytical and simulation results for Poisson network
model to real-network cell-measurements.
