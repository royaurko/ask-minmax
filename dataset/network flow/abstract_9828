Spherical accretion flows are simple enough for analytical study, by solution
of the corresponding fluid dynamic equations. The solutions of stationary
spherical flow are due to Bondi. The questions of the choice of a physical
solution and of stability have been widely discussed. The answer to these
questions is very dependent on the problem of boundary conditions, which vary
according to whether the accretor is a compact object or a black hole. We
introduce a particular, simple form of stationary spherical flow, namely,
self-similar Bondi flow, as a case with physical interest in which analytic
solutions for perturbations can be found. With suitable no
matter-flux-perturbation boundary conditions, we will show that acoustic modes
are stable in time and have no spatial instability at r=0. Furthermore, their
evolution eventually becomes ergodic-like and shows no trace of instability or
of acquiring any remarkable pattern.
