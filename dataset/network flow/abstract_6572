Recently multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks are considered a
reliable and cost effective way for internet access in wide area. A major
research challenge in this network is selecting least interference channel from
available channel and then assigning it to radio efficiently. Many algorithms
and methods have been developed for channel assignment to maximize network
throughput using orthogonal channels. Recent research and testbed experiments
proved that POC based channel assignment allows more flexibility in wireless
spectrum sharing. In this paper, we represent the channel assignment as a graph
edge coloring problem using POC. The signal-to-noise interference ratio is
measured to avoid interference from neighbouring transmission, when we assign
channel to link. Simulation result shows that our proposed method improves
network throughput and performance. Keywords:
