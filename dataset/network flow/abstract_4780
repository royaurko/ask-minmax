In the first part of the paper we survey some nonlocal flows of convex plane
curves ever studied so far and discuss properties of the flows related to
enclosed area and length, especially the isoperimetric ratio and the
isoperimetric difference. We also study a new nonlocal flow of convex plane
curves and discuss its evolution behavior. In the second part of the paper we
discuss necessary and sufficient conditions (in terms of the (mixed)
isoperimetric ratio or (mixed) isoperimetric difference) for two convex closed
curves to be homothetic or parallel.
