The Saffman-Taylor problem addresses the morphological instability of an
interface separating two immiscible, viscous fluids when they move in a narrow
gap between two flat parallel plates (Hele-Shaw cell). In this work, we extend
the classic Saffman-Taylor situation, by considering the flow between two
curved, closely spaced, concentric spheres (spherical Hele-Shaw cell). We
derive the mode-coupling differential equation for the interface perturbation
amplitudes and study both linear and nonlinear flow regimes. The effect of the
spherical cell (positive) spatial curvature on the shape of the interfacial
patterns is investigated. We show that stability properties of the fluid-fluid
interface are sensitive to the curvature of the surface. In particular, it is
found that positive spatial curvature inhibits finger tip-splitting. Hele-Shaw
flow on weakly negative, curved surfaces is briefly discussed.
