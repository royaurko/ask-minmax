Within a self-consistent proper-time Renormalization Group (RG) approach we
investigate an effective QCD trace anomaly realization with dilatons and
determine the finite-temperature behavior of the gluon condensate. Fixing the
effective model at vanishing temperature to the glueball mass and the bag
constant a possible gluonic phase transition is explored in detail. Within the
RG framework the full non-truncated dilaton potential analysis is compared with
a truncated potential version.
