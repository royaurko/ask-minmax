We consider reaction-diffusion equations with combustion-type non-linearities
in two dimensions and study speed-up of their pulsating fronts by general
periodic incompressible flows with a cellular structure. We show that the
occurence of front speed-up in the sense $\lim_{A\to\infty} c_*(A)=\infty$,
with $A$ the amplitude of the flow and $c_*(A)$ the (minimal) front speed, only
depends on the geometry of the flow and not on the reaction function. In
particular, front speed-up happens for KPP reactions if and only if it does for
ignition reactions. We also show that the flows which achieve this speed-up are
precisely those which, when scaled properly, are able to quench any ignition
reaction.
