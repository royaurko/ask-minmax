Stretching of a protein by a fluid flow is compared to that in a force-clamp
apparatus. The comparison is made within a simple topology-based dynamical
model of a protein in which the effects of the flow are implemented using
Langevin dynamics. We demonstrate that unfolding induced by a uniform flow
shows a richer behavior than that in the force clamp. The dynamics of unfolding
is found to depend strongly on the selection of the amino acid, usually one of
the termini, which is anchored. These features offer potentially wider
diagnostic tools to investigate structure of proteins compared to experiments
based on the atomic force microscopy.
