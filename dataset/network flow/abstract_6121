Networks are a general language for representing relational information among
objects. An effective way to model, reason about, and summarize networks, is to
discover sets of nodes with common connectivity patterns. Such sets are
commonly referred to as network communities. Research on network community
detection has predominantly focused on identifying communities of densely
connected nodes in undirected networks.
  In this paper we develop a novel overlapping community detection method that
scales to networks of millions of nodes and edges and advances research along
two dimensions: the connectivity structure of communities, and the use of edge
directedness for community detection. First, we extend traditional definitions
of network communities by building on the observation that nodes can be densely
interlinked in two different ways: In cohesive communities nodes link to each
other, while in 2-mode communities nodes link in a bipartite fashion, where
links predominate between the two partitions rather than inside them. Our
method successfully detects both 2-mode as well as cohesive communities, that
may also overlap or be hierarchically nested. Second, while most existing
community detection methods treat directed edges as though they were
undirected, our method accounts for edge directions and is able to identify
novel and meaningful community structures in both directed and undirected
networks, using data from social, biological, and ecological domains.
