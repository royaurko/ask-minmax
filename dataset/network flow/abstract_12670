We discuss and summarise the predictions of a model for the non-equilibrium
evolution of a network of cosmic strings initially containing {\em only loops}
and {\em no infinite strings}. The results are of interest given recent work
highlighting the problems with structure formation from the standard cosmic
string scenario.
