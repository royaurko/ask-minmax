In this paper, we propose a new method of channel estimation for asynchronous
additive white Gaussian noise channels in satellite communications. This method
is based on signals correlation and multiuser interference cancellation which
adopts a successive structure. Propagation delays and signals amplitudes are
jointly estimated in order to be used for data detection at the receiver. As, a
multiuser detector, a single stage successive interference cancellation (SIC)
architecture is analyzed and integrated to the channel estimation technique and
the whole system is evaluated. The satellite access method adopted is the
direct sequence code division multiple access (DS CDMA) one. To evaluate the
channel estimation and the detection technique, we have simulated a satellite
uplink with an asynchronous multiuser access.
