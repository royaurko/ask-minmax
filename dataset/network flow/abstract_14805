In this paper we investigate the asymptotic validity of boundary layer
theory. For a flow induced by a periodic row of point-vortices, we compare
Prandtl's solution to Navier-Stokes solutions at different $Re$ numbers. We
show how Prandtl's solution develops a finite time separation singularity. On
the other hand Navier-Stokes solution is characterized by the presence of two
kinds of viscous-inviscid interactions between the boundary layer and the outer
flow. These interactions can be detected by the analysis of the enstrophy and
of the pressure gradient on the wall. Moreover we apply the complex singularity
tracking method to Prandtl and Navier-Stokes solutions and analyze the previous
interactions from a different perspective.
