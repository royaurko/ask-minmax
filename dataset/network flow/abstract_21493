We use the new method of infinitesimal unitary transformations to calculate
zero temperature correlation functions in the strong-coupling phase of the
anisotropic Kondo model. We find the dynamics on all energy scales including
the crossover behaviour from weak to strong coupling. The integrable structure
of the Hamiltonian is not used in our approach. Our method should also be
useful in other strong-coupling models since few other analytical methods allow
the evaluation of their correlation functions on all energy scales.
