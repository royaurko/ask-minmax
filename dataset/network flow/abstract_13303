We present theoretical results on the deterministic and stochastic motion of
a dumbbell carried by a uniform flow through a three-dimensional spatially
periodic potential. Depending on parameters like the flow velocity, there are
two different kinds of movement: transport along a potential valley and
stair-like motion oblique to the potential trenches. The crossover between
these two regimes, as well as the deflection angle, depends on the size of the
dumbbell. Moreover, thermal fluctuations cause a resonance-like variation in
the deflection angle as a function of the dumbbell extension.
