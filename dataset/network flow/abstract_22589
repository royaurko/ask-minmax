We demonstrate that spatially inhomogeneous defocusing nonlinear landscapes
with the nonlinearity coefficient growing toward the periphery as [1+abs(r)]**a
support one- and two-dimensional fundamental and higher-order bright solitons,
as well as vortex solitons, with algebraically decaying tails. The energy flow
of the solitons converges as long as nonlinearity growth rate exceeds the
dimensionality, i.e., a>D. Fundamental solitons are always stable, while
multipoles and vortices are stable if the nonlinearity growth rate is large
enough.
