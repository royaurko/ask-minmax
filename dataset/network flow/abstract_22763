We examine splitting the heat flow in a low-dimensional junction under
influence an external d.c. magnetic field. The junction is a crossing between
the narrow single atomic layer stripe (or a nanotube) of a semiconductor C with
a metal stripe N (C/N-knot). External source of heat injects the
non-equilibrium (NE) phonons, electrons, and holes into C which then propagate
in direction the C/N-knot. Most of the heat is carried by NE phonons which drag
additional electron and hole excitations along C. In vicinity the C/N-knot, the
Lorentz force pulls the charge carriers from C to N thus inducing a substantial
lateral magneto-thermoelectric electric current (MTEC) along N.
