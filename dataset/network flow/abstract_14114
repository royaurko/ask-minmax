Results of numerical simulations of matter flows in a semidetached binary
system similar to the low-mass X-ray binary X1822--371 are presented.
Three-dimensional modeling of the mass transfer gas dynamics makes it possible
to investigate gas streams in the system and to study the influence of a common
envelope. The presence of the common envelope leads to the absence of shock
interaction between the stream of matter flowing from the inner Lagrange point
and the gas in the accretion disk. The stream is deflected by the gas in the
common envelope and approaches the disk tangentially, so that it does not cause
any shock perturbation ("hot spot") on the disk. At the same time, the
interaction of the stream with the common envelope leads to the formation of an
extended shock wave along the edge of the stream. The observational
manifestation of this shock is estimated to be equivalent to that of a hot spot
in the disk. The calculated accretion disk parameters are presented.
