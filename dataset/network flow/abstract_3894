We consider the problem of link scheduling for wireless networks with fading
channels, where the link rates are varying with time. Due to the high
computational complexity of the throughput optimal scheduler, we provide a low
complexity greedy link scheduler GFS, with provable performance guarantees. We
show that the performance of our greedy scheduler can be analyzed using the
Local Pooling Factor (LPF) of a network graph, which has been previously used
to characterize the stability of the Greedy Maximal Scheduling (GMS) policy for
networks with static channels. We conjecture that the performance of GFS is a
lower bound on the performance of GMS for wireless networks with fading
channels
