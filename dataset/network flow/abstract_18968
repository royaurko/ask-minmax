The subject of this work is the modification and specification of an approach
to detail the estimation of soil crack network characteristics. The
modification aims at accounting for the corrected soil crack volume based on
the corrected shrinkage geometry factor compared to known estimates of crack
volume and shrinkage geometry factor. The mode of the correction relies on
recent results of the soil reference shrinkage curve. The main exposition
follows the preliminary brief review of available approaches to dealing with
the geometry of soil crack networks and gives a preliminary brief summary of
the approach to be modified and specified. To validate and illustrate the
modified approach the latter is used in the analysis of available data on soil
cracking in a lysimeter.
