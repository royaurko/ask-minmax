Recent experiments by Baxter et al. showed the existence of density waves in
granular material flowing out of a hopper. We show, using Molecular Dynamics
Simulations, that this effect is a consequence of static friction and find that
these density fluctuations follow a $1/f$ spectrum. The effect is enhanced when
the opening angle of the hopper decreases.
