The new dynamic phase diagram for driven vortices with varying lattice
softness we present here indicates that, at high driving currents, at least two
distinct dynamic phases of flux flow appear depending on the vortex-vortex
interaction strength. When the flux lattice is soft, the vortices flow in
independently moving channels with smectic structure. For stiff flux lattices,
adjacent channels become locked together, producing crystalline-like order in a
coupled channel phase. At the crossover lattice softness between these phases,
the system produces a maximum amount of voltage noise. Our results relate
spatial order with transport and are in agreement with experiments.
