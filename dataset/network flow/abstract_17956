There has been a tremendous rise in the growth of online social networks all
over the world in recent years. This has facilitated users to generate a large
amount of real-time content at an incessant rate, all competing with each other
to attract enough attention and become trends. While Western online social
networks such as Twitter have been well studied, characteristics of the popular
Chinese microblogging network Sina Weibo have not been. In this paper, we
analyze in detail the temporal aspect of trends and trend-setters in Sina
Weibo, constrasting it with earlier observations on Twitter. First, we look at
the formation, persistence and decay of trends and examine the key topics that
trend in Sina Weibo. One of our key findings is that retweets are much more
common in Sina Weibo and contribute a lot to creating trends. When we look
closer, we observe that a large percentage of trends in Sina Weibo are due to
the continuous retweets of a small amount of fraudulent accounts. These fake
accounts are set up to artificially inflate certain posts causing them to shoot
up into Sina Weibo's trending list, which are in turn displayed as the most
popular topics to users.
