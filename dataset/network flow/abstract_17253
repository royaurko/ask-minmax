Bayesian models provide a framework for probabilistic modelling of complex
datasets. However, many of such models are computationally demanding especially
in the presence of large datasets. On the other hand, in sensor network
applications, statistical (Bayesian) parameter estimation usually needs
distributed algorithms, in which both data and computation are distributed
across the nodes of the network. In this paper we propose a general framework
for distributed Bayesian learning using Bregman Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (B-ADMM). We demonstrate the utility of our framework, with Mean
Field Variational Bayes (MFVB) as the primitive for distributed Matrix
Factorization (MF) and distributed affine structure from motion (SfM).
