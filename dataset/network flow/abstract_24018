Using a new dynamical network model of society in which pairwise interactions
are weighted according to mutual satisfaction, we show that cooperation is the
norm in the Hawks-Doves game when individuals are allowed to break ties with
undesirable neighbors and to make new acquaintances in their extended
neighborhood. Moreover, cooperation is robust with respect to rather strong
strategy perturbations. We also discuss the empirical structure of the emerging
networks, and the reasons that allow cooperators to thrive in the population.
Given the metaphorical importance of this game for social interaction, this is
an encouraging positive result as standard theory for large mixing populations
prescribes that a certain fraction of defectors must always exist at
equilibrium.
