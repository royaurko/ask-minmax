We consider Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms $\phi$ of the unit cotangent bundle
over a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ which extend to Hamiltonian
diffeomorphisms of $T^*M$ equal to the time-1-map of the geodesic flow for $|p|
\ge 1$. For such diffeomorphisms we establish uniform lower bounds for the
fiberwise volume growth of $\phi$ which were previously known for geodesic
flows and which depend only on $(M,g)$ or on the homotopy type of $M$.
  More precisely, we show that for each $q \in M$ the volume growth of the unit
ball in $T_q^*M$ under the iterates of $\phi$ is at least linear if $M$ is
rationally elliptic, is exponential if $M$ is rationally hyperbolic, and is
bounded from below by the growth of the fundamental group of $M$.
  In the case that all geodesics of $g$ are closed, we conclude that the slow
volume growth of every symplectomorphism in the symplectic isotopy class of the
Dehn--Seidel twist is at least 1, completing the main result of \cite{FS:GAFA}.
The proofs use the Lagrangian Floer homology of $T^*M$ and the
Abbondandolo--Schwarz isomorphism from this homology to the homology of the
based loop space of $M$.
