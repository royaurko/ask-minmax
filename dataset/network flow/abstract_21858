Stability of droplets of $ud$ matter, {\it viz} udilets, is studied using
non-relativistic and relativistic bag models. It is found that there is a
strong possibility for forming hypercharged metastable udilets with charge
fraction $Z/A \ge 1$ in semicentral relativistic heavy ion collisions. It is
then speculated that protons hadronised from these hypercharged udilets may be
contributing towards the directed sideward flow observed recently in
experiment. This exotic state with large charge to mass ratio presents an
unique possibility for the spontaneous emission of positrons due to the
`sparking' of the vacuum.
