We present a novel approach to accurate real-time estimation of wireless link
quality using simple matched-filtering techniques. Our approach is based on the
simple observation that there is a portion of each packet transmission from any
given node that does not change from one packet to another; this includes
preamble sequences used to synchronize the receiver and also address
information in the packet header used for medium access control and routing.
Our approach can be thought of as a generalized and simplified variant of
standard signal processing techniques that are commonly used for preamble
detection, automatic gain control, carrier sensing and other functions in many
packet wireless networks. By using a combination of energy detection and
correlation techniques, we show that we can effectively detect packet
transmissions in real-time with low complexity, without decoding the packets
themselves, and indeed, even without detailed knowledge of the packet format.
We present extensive experimental results from a software-defined radio testbed
to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach for 802.15.4 (Zigbee) networks
even in the presence of strong interference signals and low SNR.
