The equation of state (EOS) is an important issue in numerical simulation
codes for relativistic hydrodynamics. We describe a code for adiabatic flows,
employing an EOS which is simple and yet approximates very closely the EOS of
perfect gas in relativistic regime. We also describe a new code for isothermal
flows, where the EoS is trivially given.
