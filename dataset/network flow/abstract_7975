We construct symbolic dynamics on sets of full measure (w.r.t. an ergodic
measure of positive entropy) for $C^{1+\epsilon}$ flows on compact smooth
three-dimensional manifolds. One consequence is that the geodesic flow on the
unit tangent bundle of a compact $C^\infty$ surface has at least const
$\times(e^{hT}/T)$ simple closed orbits of period less than $T$, whenever the
topological entropy $h$ is positive -- and without further assumptions on the
curvature.
