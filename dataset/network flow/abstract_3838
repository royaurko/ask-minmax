We propose a general method to predict functions of vertices where: 1. The
wiring of the network is somehow related to the vertex functionality. 2. A
fraction of the vertices are functionally classified. The method is influenced
by role-similarity measures of social network analysis. The two versions of our
prediction scheme is tested on model networks were the functions of the
vertices are designed to match their network surroundings. We also apply these
methods to the proteome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and find the
results compatible with more specialized methods.
