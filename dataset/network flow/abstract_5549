In most social and information systems the activity of agents generates
rapidly evolving time-varying networks. The temporal variation in networks'
connectivity patterns and the ongoing dynamic processes are usually coupled in
ways that still challenge our mathematical or computational modelling. Here we
analyse a mobile call dataset and find a simple statistical law that
characterize the temporal evolution of users' egocentric networks. We encode
this observation in a reinforcement process defining a time-varying network
model that exhibits the emergence of strong and weak ties. We study the effect
of time-varying and heterogeneous interactions on the classic rumour spreading
model in both synthetic, and real-world networks. We observe that strong ties
severely inhibit information diffusion by confining the spreading process among
agents with recurrent communication patterns. This provides the
counterintuitive evidence that strong ties may have a negative role in the
spreading of information across networks.
