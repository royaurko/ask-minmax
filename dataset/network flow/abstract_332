In this paper we study the uniqueness of expanding self-similar solutions to
the network flow in a fixed topological class. We prove the result via the
parabolic Allen-Cahn approximation proved in \cite{triodginz}.
  Moreover, we prove that any regular evolution of connected tree-like network
(with an initial condition that might be not regular) is unique in a given a
topological class.
