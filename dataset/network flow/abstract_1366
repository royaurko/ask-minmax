Bloom filter (BF) based forwarding is an effective approach to implement
scalable multicasting in distributed systems. The forwarding BF carried by each
packet can encode either multicast tree or destination IP addresses, which are
termed as tree oriented approach (TOA) and destination oriented approach (DOA),
respectively. Recent studies have indicated that TOA based protocols have
serious vulnerabilities under some distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
attacks, and raised doubt about deployability of BF based multicasting.
However, security analysis for DOA based protocols is still unavailable. In
this paper, we present a systematic analysis of security performance of BF
based multicasting. Important DDoS attacks and the corresponding defending
mechanisms are studied in the context of DOA. We have positive findings that
DOA, with convenient enhancement, has a robust performance in resisting a
variety of DDoS attacks that can deny service of TOA based protocols. Moreover,
we reveal that TOA based protocols are prone to flow duplication attack when
applied in the data center network (DCN). We propose a dynamic-sized BF
mechanism to defend against flow duplication attack for TOA based protocols in
the DCN. Simulation results are presented to validate our theoretical analysis.
