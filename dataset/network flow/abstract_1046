We study the microscopic time fluctuations of traffic-load and the global
statistical properties of a dense traffic of particles on scale-free cyclic
graphs. For a wide range of driving rates $R$ the traffic is stationary and the
load timeseries exhibit anti-persistence due to the regulatory role of the
super-structure associated with two hub nodes in the network. We discuss how
the super-structure effects the functioning of the network at high traffic
density and at the jamming threshold. The degree of correlations systematically
decreases with increasing traffic density and eventually disappears when
approaching a jamming density $R_c$. Already before jamming we observe
qualitative changes in the global network-load distributions and the particle
queuing-times. These changes are related to the occurrence of temporary crises
in which the network-load increases dramatically, and then slowly falls back to
a value characterizing free-flow.
