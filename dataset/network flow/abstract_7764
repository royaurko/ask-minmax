We predict a novel flow regime in liquid metals under the influence of a
magnetic field. It is characterised by long periods of nearly steady,
two-dimensional flow interrupted by violent three-dimensional bursts. Our
prediction has been obtained from direct numerical simulations in a channel
geometry at low magnetic Reynolds number and translates into physical
parameters which are amenable to experimental verification under laboratory
conditions. The new regime occurs in a wide range of parameters and may have
implications for metallurgical applications.
