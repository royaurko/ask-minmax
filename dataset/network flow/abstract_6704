Community detection is of great importance for understand-ing graph structure
in social networks. The communities in real-world networks are often
overlapped, i.e. some nodes may be a member of multiple clusters. How to
uncover the overlapping communities/clusters in a complex network is a general
problem in data mining of network data sets. In this paper, a novel algorithm
to identify overlapping communi-ties in complex networks by a combination of an
evidential modularity function, a spectral mapping method and evidential
c-means clustering is devised. Experimental results indicate that this
detection approach can take advantage of the theory of belief functions, and
preforms good both at detecting community structure and determining the
appropri-ate number of clusters. Moreover, the credal partition obtained by the
proposed method could give us a deeper insight into the graph structure.
