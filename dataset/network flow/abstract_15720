In this paper, a class of neutral type high-order Hopfield neural networks
with mixed time-varying delays and leakage delays on time scales is proposed.
Based on the exponential dichotomy of linear dynamic equations on time scales,
Banach's fixed point theorem and the theory of calculus on time scales, some
sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence and global exponential
stability of pseudo almost periodic solutions for this class of neural
networks. Our results are completely new. Finally, we present an example to
illustrate our results are effective. Our example also shows that the
continuous-time neural network and its discrete-time analogue have the same
dynamical behaviors for the pseudo almost periodicity.
