This problem is a series of biddings and auctions. Each round of bidding and
auction are different from previous ones because of the change of network
topology, variance of budget set by the sender, and possible evolution of
strategies of other nodes. The huge strategy space of relay nodes makes the
formulation to a game very difficult. We present a brief qualitative analysis
in this paper, and propose a bidding strategy based on learning algorithms.
