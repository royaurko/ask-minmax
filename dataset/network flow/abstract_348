Consider the complete n-vertex graph whose edge-lengths are independent
exponentially distributed random variables. Simultaneously for each pair of
vertices, put a constant flow between them along the shortest path. Each edge
gets some random total flow. In the $n \to \infty$ limit we find explicitly the
empirical distribution of these edge-flows, suitably normalized.
