We have identified a new type of transition from extended to localized
vibrational states in one-dimensional graded elastic chains of coupled harmonic
oscillators, in which the vibrating masses or nearest-coupling force constants
vary linearly along the chain. We found that the delocalization transition
occurs at the maximum frequency of the corresponding homogeneous chain, which
is in a continuous single band. Although each state in the localized phase,
called gradon, can be regarded as an impurity localized mode, the localization
profile is clearly distinct from usual impurity modes or the Anderson localized
modes. We also argue how gradons may affect the macroscopic properties of
graded systems. Our results can provide insights into many analogous systems
with graded characters.
