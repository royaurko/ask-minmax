In this paper, we present an approach to minimize the energy consumption of
multihop wireless packet networks, while achieving the required level of
reliability. We consider networks that use Cooperative Network Coding (CNC),
which is a synergistic combination of Cooperative Communications and Network
Coding. Our approach is to optimize and balance the use of forward error
control, error detection, and retransmissions at the packet level for these
networks. Additionally, we introduce Cooperative Diversity Coding (CDC), which
is a novel means to code the information packets, with the aim of minimizing
the energy consumed for coding operations. The performance of CDC is similar to
CNC in terms of the probability of successful reception at the destination and
expected number of correctly received information packets at the destination.
However, CDC requires less energy at the source node because of its
implementation simplicity. Achieving minimal energy consumption, with the
required level of reliability is critical for the optimum functioning of many
wireless sensor and body area networks. For representative applications, the
optimized CDC or CNC network achieves >= 25% energy savings compared to the
baseline CNC scheme.
