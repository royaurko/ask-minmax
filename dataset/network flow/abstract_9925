Faraday surface instability measurements of the critical acceleration, a_c,
and wavenumber, k_c, for standing surface waves on a tetracosanol (C_24H_50)
melt exhibit abrupt changes at T_s=54degC above the bulk freezing temperature.
The measured variations of a_c and k_c vs. temperature and driving frequency
are accounted for quantitatively by a hydrodynamic model, revealing a change
from a free-slip surface flow, generic for a free liquid surface (T>T_s), to a
surface-pinned, no-slip flow, characteristic of a flow near a wetted solid wall
(T < T_s). The change at T_s is traced to the onset of surface freezing, where
the steep velocity gradient in the surface-pinned flow significantly increases
the viscous dissipation near the surface.
