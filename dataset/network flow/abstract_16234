This paper is based on a formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations developed
by P. Constantin and the first contributor (\texttt{arxiv:math.PR/0511067}, to
appear), where the velocity field of a viscous incompressible fluid is written
as the expected value of a stochastic process. In this paper, we take $N$
copies of the above process (each based on independent Wiener processes), and
replace the expected value with $\frac{1}{N}$ times the sum over these $N$
copies. (We remark that our formulation requires one to keep track of $N$
stochastic flows of diffeomorphisms, and not just the motion of $N$ particles.)
  We prove that in two dimensions, this system of interacting diffeomorphisms
has (time) global solutions with initial data in the space
$\holderspace{1}{\alpha}$ which consists of differentiable functions whose
first derivative is $\alpha$ H\"older continuous (see Section \ref{sGexist} for
the precise definition). Further, we show that as $N \to \infty$ the system
converges to the solution of Navier-Stokes equations on any finite interval
$[0,T]$. However for fixed $N$, we prove that this system retains roughly
$O(\frac{1}{N})$ times its original energy as $t \to \infty$. Hence the limit
$N \to \infty$ and $T\to \infty$ do not commute. For general flows, we only
provide a lower bound to this effect. In the special case of shear flows, we
compute the behaviour as $t \to \infty$ explicitly.
