Collective dynamics on small-world networks emerge in a broad range of
systems with their spectra characterizing fundamental asymptotic features. Here
we derive analytic mean field predictions for the spectra of small-world models
that systematically interpolate between regular and random topologies by
varying their randomness. These theoretical predictions agree well with the
actual spectra (obtained by numerical diagonalization) for undirected and
directed networks and from fully regular to strongly random topologies. These
results may provide analytical insights to empirically found features of
dynamics on small-world networks from various research fields, including
biology, physics, engineering and social science.
