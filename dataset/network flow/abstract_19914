We study spin-orbital coupling effect on the Josephson current through a
superconductor (SC) heterojunction, consisting of two s-wave superconductors
and a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) layer between them. The Rashba-type
(RSOC) and/or Dresselhaus-type (DSOC) of spin-orbital coupling are considered
in the 2DEG region. By using the lattice Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation and the
Keldysh formalism, we calculate the DC supercurrent flowing through the
junction and find that the critical current $I_c$ exhibits a damped oscillation
with both the strength of SOC and the layer length of 2DEG; especially, the
strength ratio between RSOC and DSOC can also induce switching between the $0$
state and the $\pi$ state of the SC/2DEG/SC junction as well. This $0$-$\pi$
transition results from the fact that SOC in a two-dimension system can lead to
a pseudo-magnetic effect on the flowing electrons like the effect of a
ferromagnet, since the time reversal symmetry of the system has already been
broken by two SC leads with different macroscopic phases.
