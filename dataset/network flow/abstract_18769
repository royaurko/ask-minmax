Oscillatory chemical reactions often serve as a timing clock of cellular
processes in living cells. The temporal dynamics of protein concentration
levels is thus of great interest in biology. Here we propose a theoretical
framework to analyze the frequency, phase and amplitude of oscillatory protein
concentrations in gene regulatory networks with negative cyclic feedback. We
first formulate the analysis framework of oscillation profiles based on
multivariable harmonic balance. With this framework, the frequency, phase and
amplitude are obtained analytically in terms of kinetic constants of the
reactions despite the nonlinearity of the dynamics. These results are
demonstrated with the Pentilator and Hes7 self-repression network, and it is
shown that the developed analysis method indeed predicts the profiles of the
oscillations. A distinctive feature of the presented result is that the
waveform of oscillations is analytically obtained for a broad class of
biochemical systems. Thus, it is easy to see how the waveform is determined
from the system's parameters and structures. We present general biological
insights that are applicable for any gene regulatory networks with negative
cyclic feedback.
