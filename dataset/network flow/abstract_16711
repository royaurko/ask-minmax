This paper considers the problem of rate function identification for
multidimensional queueing models with feedback. A set of techniques are
introduced which allow this identification when the model possesses certain
structural properties. The main tools used are representation formulas for
exponential integrals, weak convergence methods, and the regularity properties
of associated Skorokhod Problems. Two examples are treated as special cases of
the general theory: the classical Jackson network and a model for processor
sharing.
