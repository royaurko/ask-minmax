Traffic forecasting from past observed traffic data with small calculation
complexity is one of important problems for planning of servers and networks.
Focusing on World Wide Web (WWW) traffic as fundamental investigation, this
paper would deal with Bayesian forecasting of network traffic on the time
varying Poisson model from a viewpoint from statistical decision theory. Under
this model, we would show that the estimated forecasting value is obtained by
simple arithmetic calculation and expresses real WWW traffic well from both
theoretical and empirical points of view.
