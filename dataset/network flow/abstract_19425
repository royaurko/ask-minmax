We deduce new constraints on the entropy per baryon ($s/k$), dynamical
timescale ($\tau_{dyn}$), and electron fraction ($Y_{e}$) consistent with heavy
element nucleosynthesis in the r-process. We show that the previously neglected
reaction flow throu gh the reaction sequence \atg (n,$\gamma$)\Li~
significantly enhances the production of seed nuclei. We analyze the r-process
nucleosynthesis in the context of a schematic exponential wi nd model. We show
that fewer neutrons per seed nucleus implies that the entropy per baryon
required for successful r-process nucleosynthesis must be more than a factor of
two higher than previous estimates. This places new constraints on dynamical mo
dels for the r-process.
