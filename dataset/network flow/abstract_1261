Intracellular cargo transport can arise from passive diffusion, active
motor-driven transport along cytoskeletal filament networks, and passive
advection by fluid flows entrained by such motor/cargo motion. Active and
advective transport are thus intrinsically coupled as related, yet different
representations of the same underlying network structure. A
reaction-advection-diffusion system is used here to show that this coupling
affects the transport and localization of a passive tracer in a confined
geometry. For sufficiently low diffusion, cargo localization to a target zone
is optimized either by low reaction kinetics and decoupling of bound and
unbound states, or by a mostly disordered cytoskeletal network with only weak
directional bias. These generic results may help to rationalize subtle features
of cytoskeletal networks, for example as observed for microtubules in fly
oocytes.
