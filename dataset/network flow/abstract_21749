We study the BRST quantization of bosonic and NSR strings propagating in
AdS(3) x N backgrounds. The no-ghost theorem is proved using the
Frenkel-Garland-Zuckerman method. Regular and spectrally-flowed representations
of affine SL(2,R) appear on an equal footing. Possible generalizations to
related curved backgrounds are discussed.
