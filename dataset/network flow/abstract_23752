We report the results of a successful 12 hour 22 GHz VLBI experiment using a
heterogeneous network that includes radio telescopes of the Long Baseline Array
(LBA) in Australia and several VLBI stations that regularly observe in geodetic
VLBI campaigns. We have determined positions of three VLBI stations, ATCA-104,
CEDUNA and MOPRA, with an accuracy of 4-30mm using a novel technique of data
analysis. These stations have never before participated in geodetic
experiments. We observed 105 radio sources, and amongst them 5 objects which
have not previously been observed with VLBI. We have determined positions of
these new sources with the accuracy of 2-5 mas. We make conclusion that the LBA
network is capable of conducting absolute astrometry VLBI surveys with accuracy
better than 5 mas.
