A new effect of electromagnetic radiation generated by heat flow in
superfluid helium has been detected experimentally. The generating heat flow
was produced using hydrodynamic thermal guns. Electromagnetic radiation was
registered with a dielectric disk resonator in the interval 1.4-2.17K. The
power of the thermal gun heater varied within Q up to 1mW. A distinct signal of
electromagnetic radiation was registered when the thermal gun was on and there
was no signal at Q=0. The frequency of the generated electromagnetic radiation
was measured with a Fabry-Perrot interferometer. It was about 180GHz at T=1.4K
and decreased with a rising temperature practically following the temperature
dependence of a roton gap. The detected signal was investigated as a function
of the heat flow temperature, direction and power Q. The results obtained show
that He II behaves as a two - level system in which the difference between the
levels is equal to the roton energy.
