Recent results on the total production and angular distribution of charged
particles originated from the fragmentation of quark and gluon jets are
presented. Experimental studies of the multiplicity as a function of the quark
and gluon jet energy, the inter-jet particle flow and the individual
fragmentation fucntions are reviewed and compared to expectations from QCD.
