A select collection of pseudorandom number generators is applied to a Monte
Carlo study of the two dimensional square site percolation model. A generator
suitable for high precision calculations is identified from an application
specific test of randomness. After extended computation and analysis, an
ostensibly reliable value of pc = 0.59274598(4) is obtained for the percolation
threshold.
