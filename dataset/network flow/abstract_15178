"Evolution behaves like a tinkerer" (Francois Jacob, Science, 1977). Software
systems provide a unique opportunity to understand biological processes using
concepts from network theory. The Debian GNU/Linux operating system allows us
to explore the evolution of a complex network in a novel way. The modular
design detected during its growth is based on the reuse of existing code in
order to minimize costs during programming. The increase of modularity
experienced by the system over time has not counterbalanced the increase in
incompatibilities between software packages within modules. This negative
effect is far from being a failure of design. A random process of package
installation shows that the higher the modularity the larger the fraction of
packages working properly in a local computer. The decrease in the relative
number of conflicts between packages from different modules avoids a failure in
the functionality of one package spreading throughout the entire system. Some
potential analogies with the evolutionary and ecological processes determining
the structure of ecological networks of interacting species are discussed.
