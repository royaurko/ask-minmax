We describe techniques for the robust detection of community structure in
some classes of time-dependent networks. Specifically, we consider the use of
statistical null models for facilitating the principled identification of
structural modules in semi-decomposable systems. Null models play an important
role both in the optimization of quality functions such as modularity and in
the subsequent assessment of the statistical validity of identified community
structure. We examine the sensitivity of such methods to model parameters and
show how comparisons to null models can help identify system scales. By
considering a large number of optimizations, we quantify the variance of
network diagnostics over optimizations (`optimization variance') and over
randomizations of network structure (`randomization variance'). Because the
modularity quality function typically has a large number of nearly-degenerate
local optima for networks constructed using real data, we develop a method to
construct representative partitions that uses a null model to correct for
statistical noise in sets of partitions. To illustrate our results, we employ
ensembles of time-dependent networks extracted from both nonlinear oscillators
and empirical neuroscience data.
