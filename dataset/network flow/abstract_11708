A wide range of networked systems exhibit highly connected nodes (hubs) as
prominent structural elements. The functional roles of hubs in the collective
nonlinear dynamics of many such networks, however, are not well understood.
Here we propose that hubs in neural circuits may activate local signal
transmission along sequences of specific subnetworks. Intriguingly, in contrast
to previous suggestions of the functional roles of hubs, here not the hubs
themselves, but non-hub subnetworks transfer the signals. The core mechanism
relies on hubs and non-hubs providing activating feedback to each other. It may
thus induce the propagation of specific pulse and rate signals in neuronal and
other communication networks.
