The stationary phase technique is used to calculate asymptotic formulae for
SO(4) Relativistic Spin Networks. For the tetrahedral spin network this gives
the square of the Ponzano-Regge asymptotic formula for the SU(2) 6j symbol. For
the 4-simplex (10j-symbol) the asymptotic formula is compared with numerical
calculations of the Spin Network evaluation. Finally we discuss the asymptotics
of the SO(3,1) 10j-symbol.
