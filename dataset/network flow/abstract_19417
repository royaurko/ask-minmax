We propose an analytical 3-D model of the open field-line region of a neutron
star (NS) magnetosphere. We construct an explicit analytic solution for
arbitrary obliquity (angle between the rotation and magnetic axes)
incorporating the effects of magnetospheric rotation, relativistic flow of
charges (e.g. primary electron beam) along the open field lines, and E X B
drift of these charges. Our solution employs the space-charge-limited
longitudinal current calculated in the electrodynamic model of Muslimov &
Tsygan (1992) and is valid up to very high altitudes nearly approaching the
light cylinder. We assume that in the innermost magnetosphere, the NS magnetic
field can be well represented by a static magnetic dipole configuration. At
high altitudes the open magnetic field lines significantly deviate from those
of a static dipole and tend to focus into a cylindrical bundle, swept back in
the direction opposite to the rotation, and also bent towards the rotational
equator. We briefly discuss some implications of our study to spin-powered
pulsars.
