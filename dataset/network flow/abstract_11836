Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis which is
made more challenging by overlaps between communities which often occur in
practice. Here we propose a general, flexible, and interpretable generative
model for overlapping communities, which can be thought of as a generalization
of the degree-corrected stochastic block model. We develop an efficient
spectral algorithm for estimating the community memberships, which deals with
the overlaps by employing the K-medians algorithm rather than the usual K-means
for clustering in the spectral domain. We show that the algorithm is
asymptotically consistent when networks are not too sparse and the overlaps
between communities not too large. Numerical experiments on both simulated
networks and many real social networks demonstrate that our method performs
very well compared to a number of benchmark methods for overlapping community
detection.
