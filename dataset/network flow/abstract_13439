A dynamical phase transition from reversible to irreversible behavior occurs
when particle suspensions are subjected to uniform oscillatory shear, even in
the Stokes flow limit. We consider a more general situation with non-uniform
strain (e.g. oscillatory channel flow), which is observed to exhibit markedly
different dynamics. Self-organization and shear-induced migration only
partially explain the delayed, simultaneous onset of irreversibility across the
channel. The onset of irreversibility is accompanied by long-range correlated
particle motion. This motion leads to particle activity even at the channel
center, where the strain is negligible, and prevents the system from evolving
into a reversible state.
