This paper demonstrates a method for using belief-network algorithms to solve
influence diagram problems. In particular, both exact and approximation
belief-network algorithms may be applied to solve influence-diagram problems.
More generally, knowing the relationship between belief-network and
influence-diagram problems may be useful in the design and development of more
efficient influence diagram algorithms.
