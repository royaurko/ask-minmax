We demonstrate the advantages of feedforward loops using a Boolean network,
which is one of the discrete dynamical models for transcriptional regulatory
networks. After comparing the dynamical behaviors of network embedded feedback
and feedforward loops, we found that feedforward loops can provide higher
temporal order (coherence) with lower entropy (randomness) in a temporal
program of gene expression. In addition, complexity of the state space that
increases with longer length of attractors and greater number of attractors is
also reduced for networks with more feedforward loops. Feedback loops show
opposite effects on dynamics of the networks. These results suggest that
feedforward loops are one of the favorable local structures in biomolecular and
neuronal networks.
