The transition of the flow in a duct of square cross-section is studied. Like
in the similar case of the pipe flow, the motion is linearly stable for all
Reynolds numbers; this flow is thus a good candidate to investigate the
'bypass' path to turbulence. Initially the so-called 'linear optimal
perturbation problem' is formulated and solved, yielding optimal disturbances
in the form of longitudinal vortices. Such optimals, however, fail to elicit a
significant response from the system in the nonlinear regime. Thus,
streamwise-inhomogeneous, sub-optimal disturbances are focussed upon; nonlinear
quadratic interactions are immediately evoked by such initial perturbations and
an unstable streamwise-homogeneous large amplitude mode rapidly emerges. The
subsequent evolution of the flow, at a value of the Reynolds number at the edge
between fully developed turbulence and relaminarization, shows the alternance
of patterns with two pairs of large scale vortices near opposing parallel
walls. Such edge states bear a resemblance to optimal disturbances
