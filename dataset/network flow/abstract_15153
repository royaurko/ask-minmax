In this work, we investigate the optimal dynamic packet scheduling policy in
a wireless relay network (WRN). We model this network by two sets of parallel
queues, that represent the subscriber stations (SS) and the relay stations
(RS), with random link connectivity. An optimal policy minimizes, in stochastic
ordering sense, the process of cost function of the SS and RS queue sizes. We
prove that, in a system with symmetrical connectivity and arrival
distributions, a policy that tries to balance the lengths of all the system
queues, at every time slot, is optimal. We use stochastic dominance and
coupling arguments in our proof. We also provide a low-overhead algorithm for
optimal policy implementation.
