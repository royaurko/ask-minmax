The bursting aggregation assembly in edge nodes is one of the key
technologies in OBS (Optical Burst Switching) network, which has a direct
impact on flow characteristics and packet loss rate. An optical burst assembly
technique supporting QoS is presented through this paper, which can
automatically adjust the threshold along with the increasing and decreasing
volume of business, reduce the operational burst, and generate corresponding
BDP (Burst Data Packet) and BCP (Burst Control Packet). In addition to the
burst aggregation technique a packet recovery technique by restoration method
is also described. The data packet loss due to the physical optical link
failure is not currently included in the QoS descriptions. This link failure is
also a severe problem which reduces the data throughput of the transmitter
node. A mechanism for data recovery from this link failure is vital for
guaranteeing the QoS demanded by each user. So this paper will also discusses a
specific protocol for reducing the packet loss by utilizing the features of
both optical circuit switching (OCS) and Optical Burst switching (OBS)
techniques.
