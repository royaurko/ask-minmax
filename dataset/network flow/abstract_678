We propose a model of random diffusion to investigate flow fluctuations in
complex networks. We derive an analytical law showing that the dependence of
fluctuations with the mean traffic in a network is ruled by the delicate
interplay of three factors, respectively of dynamical, topological and
statistical nature. In particular, we demonstrate that the existence of a
power-law scaling characterizing the flow fluctuations at every node in the
network can not be claimed for. We show the validity of this scaling breakdown
under quite general topological and dynamical situations by means of different
traffic algorithms and by analyzing real data.
