We perform a quasi-normal mode analysis of black hole configurations in
Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). In this analysis we use the full Bogoliubov
dispersion relation, not just the hydrodynamic or geometric approximation. We
restrict our attention to one-dimensional flows in BEC with step-like
discontinuities. For this case we show that in the hydrodynamic approximation
quasi-normal modes do not exist. The full dispersion relation, however, allows
the existence of quasi-normal modes. Remarkably, the spectrum of these modes is
not discrete but continuous.
