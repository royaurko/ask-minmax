The Sun supports a rich spectrum of internal waves that are continuously
excited by turbulent convection. The GONG network and the MDI/SOHO space
instrument provide an exceptional data base of spatially-resolved observations
of solar oscillations, covering an entire sunspot cycle (11 years). Local
helioseismology is a set of tools for probing the solar interior in three
dimensions using measurements of wave travel times and local mode frequencies.
Local helioseismology has discovered (i) near-surface vector flows associated
with convection (ii) 250 m/s subsurface horizontal outflows around sunspots
(iii) ~50 m/s extended horizontal flows around active regions (converging near
the surface and diverging below), (iv) the effect of the Coriolis force on
convective flows and active region flows (v) the subsurface signature of the 15
m/s poleward meridional flow, (vi) a +/-5 m/s time-varying depth-dependent
component of the meridional circulation around the mean latitude of activity,
and (vii) magnetic activity on the far side of the Sun.
