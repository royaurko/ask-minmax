Using a network of seismometers and sets of optimal filters, we implemented a
feed-forward control technique to minimize the seismic contribution to multiple
interferometric degrees of freedom of the LIGO interferometers. The filters are
constructed by using the Levinson-Durbin recursion relation to approximate the
optimal Wiener filter. By reducing the RMS of the interferometer feedback
signals below \sim10 Hz, we have improved the stability and duty cycle of the
joint network of gravitational wave detectors. By suppressing the large control
forces and mirror motions, we have dramatically reduced the rate of
non-Gaussian transients in the gravitational wave signal stream.
