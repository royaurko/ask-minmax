We propose an efficient strategy to suppress epidemic explosion in
heterogeneous metapopulation networks, wherein each node represents a
subpopulation with any number of individuals and is assigned a curing rate that
is proportional to $k^{\alpha}$ with $k$ the node degree and $\alpha$ an
adjustable parameter. We have performed stochastic simulations of the dynamical
reaction-diffusion processes associated with the
susceptible-infected-susceptible model in scale-free networks. We found that
the epidemic threshold reaches a maximum when the exponent $\alpha$ is tuned to
be $\alpha_{opt}\simeq 1.3$. This nontrivial phenomenon is robust to the change
of the network size and the average degree. In addition, we have carried out a
mean field analysis to further validate our scheme, which also demonstrates
that epidemic explosion follows different routes for $\alpha$ larger or less
than $\alpha_{opt}$. Our work suggests that in order to effectively suppress
epidemic spreading on heterogeneous complex networks, subpopulations with
higher degrees should be allocated more resources than just being linearly
dependent on the degree $k$.
