Basic notions and mathematical tools in continuum media mechanics are
recalled. The notion of exponent of a covariant differential operator is
introduced and on its basis the geometrical interpretation of the curvature and
the torsion in $(\bar{L}_n,g)$-spaces is considered. The Hodge (star) operator
is generalized for $(\bar{L}_n,g)$-spaces. The kinematic characteristics of a
flow are outline in brief. PACS numbers: 11.10.-z; 11.10.Ef; 7.10.+g; 47.75.+f;
