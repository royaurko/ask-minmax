We present results on the connection between the vorticity equation and the
shape of the single-point vorticity PDF. The statistical framework for these
observations is cast in form of conditional averages. The numerical evaluation
of these conditional averages provides insights into the intimate relation of
dynamical effects like vortex stretching and vorticity diffusion and
non-Gaussian vorticity statistics.
