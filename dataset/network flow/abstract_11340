We develop an approach aimed at optimizing the parameters of a network of
biochemical logic gates for reduction of the "analog" noise buildup.
Experiments for three coupled enzymatic AND gates are reported, illustrating
our procedure. Specifically, starch - one of the controlled network inputs - is
converted to maltose by beta-amylase. With the use of phosphate (another
controlled input), maltose phosphorylase then produces glucose. Finally,
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) - the third controlled input - is
reduced under the action of glucose dehydrogenase to yield the optically
detected signal. Network functioning is analyzed by varying selective inputs
and fitting standardized few-parameters "response-surface" functions assumed
for each gate. This allows a certain probe of the individual gate quality, but
primarily yields information on the relative contribution of the gates to noise
amplification. The derived information is then used to modify our experimental
system to put it in a regime of a less noisy operation.
