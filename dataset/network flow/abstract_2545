It is now clear that AGN heat cooling flows, largely by driving winds. The
winds may contain a relativistic component that generates powerful synchrotron
radiation, but it is not clear that all winds do so. The spatial and temporal
stability of the AGN/cooling flow interaction are discussed. Collimation of the
winds probably provides spatial stability. Temporal stability may be possible
only for black holes with masses above a critical value. Both the failure of
cooling flows to have adiabatic cores and the existence of X-ray cavities
confirm the importance of collimated outflows. I quantify the scale of the
convective flow that the AGN Hydra would need to drive if it balanced radiative
inward flow by outward flow parallel to the jets. At least in Virgo any such
flow must be confined to r<~20 kpc. Hydrodynamical simulations suggest that AGN
outbursts cannot last longer than ~25 Myr. Data for four clusters with well
studied X-ray cavities suggests that heating associated with cavity formation
approximately balances radiative cooling. The role of cosmic infall and the
mechanism of filament formation are briefly touched on.
