A new dynamical clustering algorithm for the identification of modules in
complex networks has been recently introduced \cite{BILPR}. In this paper we
present a modified version of this algorithm based on a system of chaotic
Roessler oscillators and we test its sensitivity on real and computer generated
networks with a well known modular structure.
