We study closed string tachyon condensation using the RG flow of the
worldsheet theory. In many cases the worldsheet theory enjoys N=2
supersymmetry, which provides analytic control over the flow, due to
non-renormalization theorems. Moreover, Mirror symmetry sheds light on the RG
flow in such cases.
  We discuss the relevant tachyon condensation in the context of both compact
and non-compact situations which lead to very different conclusions.
Furthermore, the tachyon condensation leads to non-trivial dualities for
non-supersymmetric probe theories.
