Ion Beam Sputtering (IBS) is known to produce surface nanopatterns over
macroscopic areas on a wide range of materials. However, in spite of the
technological potential of this route to nanostructuring, the physical process
by which these surfaces self-organize remains poorly under- stood. We have
performed detailed experiments of IBS on Si substrates that validate dynamical
and morphological predictions from a hydrodynamic description of the
phenomenon. Our results elucidate flow of a nanoscopically thin and highly
viscous surface layer, driven by the stress created by the ion-beam, as a
description of the system. This type of slow relaxation is akin to flow of
macroscopic solids like glaciers or lead pipes, that is driven by defect
dynamics.
