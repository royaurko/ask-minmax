The beauty of Information Technology (IT) is with its multifunction nature;
it is a support system, a networking system, a storage system, as well as an
information facilitator. Aided with their broad line of services, an IT system
aims to support or even drive organizations towards desired paths. Trends of IT
and information security awareness (ISA) in society today, particularly within
the business environment is quite interesting phenomenon. The overviews of the
role of IT in the modern world as well as the perception towards ISA are
initially introduced. A series of scope are outlined, and also further
examination on matter of IT and ISA in the business environment-emphasis on
revolution of business with ISA, security threats such as identity thefts,
hacking and web harassment, and the different mode of protections that are
applied in different business environments. Unfortunately, the advancement of
IT is not followed by the awareness of its security issues properly, especially
in the context of the business settings and functions. This research and review
is expected to influence the awareness of information security issues in
business processes.
