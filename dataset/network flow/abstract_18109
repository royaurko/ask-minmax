The widespread availability of networked multimedia potentials embedded in an
infrastructure of qualitative superior kind gives rise to new approaches in the
areas of teleteaching and internet presentation: The distribution of
professionally styled multimedia streams has fallen in the realm of
possibility. This paper presents a prototype - both model and runtime
environment - of a time directed media system treating any kind of
presentational contribution as reusable media object components. The plug-in
free runtime system is based on a database and allows for a flexible support of
static media types as well as for easy extensions by streaming media servers.
The prototypic implementation includes a preliminary Web Authoring platform.
