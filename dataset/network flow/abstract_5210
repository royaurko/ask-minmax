The first calculation of triangular flow $v_3$ in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200A$ GeV from an event-by-event (3+1)-d
transport+hydrodynamics hybrid approach is presented. As a response to the
initial triangularity $\epsilon_3$ of the collision zone, $v_3$ is computed in
a similar way to the standard event-plane analysis for elliptic flow $v_2$. It
is found that the triangular flow exhibits weak centrality dependence and is
roughly equal to elliptic flow in most central collisions. We also explore the
transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of $v_2$ and $v_3$ for charged
particles as well as identified particles. We conclude that an event-by-event
treatment of the ideal hydrodynamic evolution starting with realistic initial
conditions generates the main features expected for triangular flow.
