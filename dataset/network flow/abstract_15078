Exchange arrangements among different countries over the world are
foundations of the world economy, which generally stand behind the daily
economic evolution. As the first study of the world exchange arrangements web
(WEAW), we built a bipartite network with countries as one type of nodes and
currencies as the other, and found it to have a prominent scale-free feature
with a power-law degree distribution. In a further empirical study of the
currency section of the WEAW, we calculated the clustering coefficients,
average nearest-neighbors degree, and average shortest distance. As an
essential economic network, the WEAW is found to be a correlated disassortative
network with a hierarchical structure, possessing a more prominent scale-free
feature than the world trade web (WTW).
