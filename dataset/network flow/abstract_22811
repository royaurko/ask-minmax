Pseudo-spectral method is one of the most accurate techniques for simulating
turbulent flows. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an integral part of this
method. In this paper, we present a new procedure to compute FFT in which we
save operations during interprocess communications by avoiding transpose of the
array. As a result, our transpose-free FFT is 15\% to 20\% faster than FFTW.
