We investigate the relationship between complexity, information transfer and
the emergence of collective behaviors, such as synchronization and nontrivial
collective behavior, in a network of globally coupled chaotic maps as a simple
model of a complex system. We calculate various quantities for this system: the
mean field, a measure of statistical complexity, the information transfer, as
well as the information shared, between the macroscopic and local levels as
functions of the strength of a coupling parameter in the system. Our results
show that the emergence of nontrivial collective behavior is associated to
higher values of complexity. Little transference of information from the global
to the local level occurs when the system settles into nontrivial collective
behavior while no information at all flows between these two scales in a
synchronized collective state. As the parameter values for the onset of
nontrivial collective behavior or chaos synchronization are approached, the
information transfer from the macroscopic level to the local level is higher,
in comparison to the situation where those collective states are already
established in the system. Our results add support to the view of complexity as
an emergent collective property that is absent at the local level in systems of
interacting elements.
