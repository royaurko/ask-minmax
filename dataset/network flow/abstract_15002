We study the statistics of the optimal path in both random and scale free
networks, where weights $w$ are taken from a general distribution $P(w)$. We
find that different types of disorder lead to the same universal behavior.
Specifically, we find that a single parameter ($S \equiv AL^{-1/\nu}$ for
$d$-dimensional lattices, and $S\equiv AN^{-1/3}$ for random networks)
determines the distributions of the optimal path length, including both strong
and weak disorder regimes. Here $\nu$ is the percolation connectivity exponent,
and $A$ depends on the percolation threshold and $P(w)$. For $P(w)$ uniform,
Poisson or Gaussian the crossover from weak to strong does not occur, and only
weak disorder exists.
