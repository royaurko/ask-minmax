To describe the flow of a miscible quantity on a network, we introduce the
graph wave equation where the standard continuous Laplacian is replaced by the
graph Laplacian. This is a natural description of an array of inductances and
capacities, of fluid flow in a network of ducts and of a system of masses and
springs. The structure of the graph influences strongly the dynamics which is
naturally described using the basis of the eigenvectors. In particular, we show
that if two outer nodes are connected to a common third node with the same
coupling, then this coupling is an eigenvalue of the Laplacian. Assuming the
graph is forced and damped at specific nodes, we derive the amplitude
equations. These are analyzed for two simple non trivial networks: a tree and a
graph with a cycle. Forcing the network at a resonant frequency reveals that
damping can be ineffective if applied to the wrong node, leading to a
disastrous resonance and destruction of the network. These results could be
useful for complex physical networks and engineering networks like power grids.
