We propose a novel method for sorting events of multiparticle production
according to the anisotropy of their momentum distribution. The particular
application presented here is in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. Our
method can automatically sort out samples of events with similar histograms. It
takes into account the whole measured histograms with all orders of anisotropy
instead of a specific observable, e.g. $q_2$. It can be used for more exclusive
experimental studies of flow anisotropies which are then more easily compared
to theoretical calculations. It may also be useful in the construction of
mixed-events background for correlation studies as it allows to select events
with similar momentum distribution.
