Large-scale motions, important in turbulent shear flows, are frequently
attributed to the interaction of structures at smaller scale. Here we show
that, in a turbulent channel at Re_{\tau} \approx 550, large-scale motions can
self-sustain even when smaller-scale structures populating the near-wall and
logarithmic regions are artificially quenched. This large-scale self-sustained
mechanism is not active in periodic boxes of width smaller than Lz ~ 1.5h or
length shorter than Lx ~ 3h which correspond well to the most energetic large
scales observed in the turbulent channel.
