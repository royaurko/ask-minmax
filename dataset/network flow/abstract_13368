We consider one-dimensional model of the interaction between surface and the
internal gravity water waves. The internal wave is modeled by its basic form: a
non-dispersive field with a horizontal current that is uniform over all depth,
insignificantly affected by the surface waves, while ignoring surface tension
and wind growth/decay effects. The depth is infinite. Approximation for the
height of the surface wave on the flow by the "elementary quasi stationary"
solutions was found. It was shown that the flow acts as a frequency filter for
gravitational waves on water.
