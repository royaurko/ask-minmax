We analyze the uplink of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) networks in which
cooperation can be amongst 2 or 3 base stations (BSs). We consider a 2D network
of BSs on a regular hexagonal lattice wherein the cooperation tessellates the
2D plane into cooperation regions (CRs); specifically, we analyze the impact of
the interference between the CRs in the network. Our model accounts realistic
propagation conditions, particularly including shadowing. We obtain accurate,
closed-form, approximations for the user capacity coverage probability (CCP)
and the ergodic capacity at each point within the CR. To provide a
network-level analysis, we focus on the locations within each CR with the
minimum CCP, the worstcase point(s). The worst-case CCP and or ergodic capacity
can be used in parametric studies for network design. Here, the analysis is
applied to obtain the relationship between cell size and CCP and, thereby, the
required density of BSs to achieve a chosen target capacity coverage. The
analysis also allows for a comparison between different orders of BS
cooperation, quantifying the reduced required BS density from higher orders of
cooperation. Comprehensive simulations are used to illustrate the accuracy of
our analysis, including the approximations used for analytic tractability.
