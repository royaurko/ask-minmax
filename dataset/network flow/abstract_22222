We study untriggered di-hadron correlations in Pb+Pb at 2.76 TeV, based on an
event-by-event simulation of a hydrodynamic expansion starting from flux tube
initial conditions. The correlation function shows interesting structures as a
function of the pseudorapidity difference $\Delta\eta$ and the azimuthal angle
difference $\Delta\phi$, in particular comparing different centralities. We can
clearly identify a peak-like nearside structure associated with very low
momentum components of jets for peripheral collisions, which disappears towards
central collisions. On the other hand, a very broad ridge structure from
asymmetric flow seen at central collisions, gets smaller and finally disappears
towards peripheral collisions.
