We live in a modern world supported by large, complex networks. Examples
range from financial markets to communication and transportation systems. In
many realistic situations the flow of physical quantities in the network, as
characterized by the loads on nodes, is important. We show that for such
networks where loads can redistribute among the nodes, intentional attacks can
lead to a cascade of overload failures, which can in turn cause the entire or a
substantial part of the network to collapse. This is relevant for real-world
networks that possess a highly heterogeneous distribution of loads, such as the
Internet and power grids. We demonstrate that the heterogeneity of these
networks makes them particularly vulnerable to attacks in that a large-scale
cascade may be triggered by disabling a single key node. This brings obvious
concerns on the security of such systems.
