We present a theory for the elasticity of cross-linked stiff polymer
networks. Stiff polymers, unlike their flexible counterparts, are highly
anisotropic elastic objects. Similar to mechanical beams stiff polymers easily
deform in bending, while they are much stiffer with respect to tensile forces
(``stretching''). Unlike in previous approaches, where network elasticity is
derived from the stretching mode, our theory properly accounts for the soft
bending response. A self-consistent effective medium approach is used to
calculate the macroscopic elastic moduli starting from a microscopic
characterization of the deformation field in terms of ``floppy modes'' --
low-energy bending excitations that retain a high degree of non-affinity. The
length-scale characterizing the emergent non-affinity is given by the ``fiber
length'' $l_f$, defined as the scale over which the polymers remain straight.
The calculated scaling properties for the shear modulus are in excellent
agreement with the results of recent simulations obtained in two-dimensional
model networks. Furthermore, our theory can be applied to rationalize bulk
rheological data in reconstituted actin networks.
