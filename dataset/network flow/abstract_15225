In the present paper, high transmission bit rate of a thermal arrayed
waveguide grating (AWG) which is composed of lithium niobate
(LiNbO3)/polymethyl metha acrylate (PMMA) hybrid materials on a silicon
substrate in Passive Optical Networks (PONs) has parametrically analyzed and
investigated over wide range of the affecting parameters. We have theoretically
investigated the temperature dependent wavelength shift of the arrayed
waveguide grating (AWG) depends on the refractive-indices of the materials and
the size of the waveguide. A thermalization of the AWG can be realized by
selecting proper values of the material and structural parameters of the
device. Moreover, we have analyzed the data transmission bit rate of a thermal
AWG in passsive optical networks (PONs) based on Maximum Time Division
Multiplexing (MTDM) technique.
