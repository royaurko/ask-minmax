The search space of rooted phylogenetic trees is vast and a major research
focus of recent decades has been the development of algorithms to effectively
navigate this space. However this space is tiny when compared with the space of
rooted phylogenetic networks, and navigating this enlarged space remains a
poorly understood problem. This, and the difficulty of biologically
interpreting such networks, obstructs adoption of networks as tools for
modelling reticulation. Here, we argue that the superimposition of biologically
motivated constraints, via an SQL-style language, can both stimulate use of
network software by biologists and potentially significantly prune the search
space.
