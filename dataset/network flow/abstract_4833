Presently flow and nonflow cannot be separated experimentally. Using Pythia
simulations of p+p collisions we show that nonflow approximately factorizes.
This fact may be used to disentangle flow and nonflow in heavy ion data by
performing a two-component factorization fit to Fourier coefficients of
two-particle correlations.
