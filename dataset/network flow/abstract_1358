We study the problem of scheduling maintenance on arcs of a capacitated
network so as to maximize the total flow from a source node to a sink node over
a set of time periods. Maintenance on an arc shuts down the arc for the
duration of the period in which its maintenance is scheduled, making its
capacity zero for that period. A set of arcs is designated to have maintenance
during the planning period, which will require each to be shut down for exactly
one time period. In general this problem is known to be NP-hard, and several
special instance classes have been studied. Here we propose an additional
constraint which limits the number of maintenance jobs per time period, and we
study the impact of this on the complexity.
