By varying the wave number over a large interval of values and by keeping the
Reynolds number constant, we analyze the phase and group velocity of linear
three-dimensional traveling waves in two sheared flows, the plane channel and
wake flows. Evidences are given about the possible compresence of dispersive
and nondispersive effects which are associated to the long and short ranges of
wavelength, respectively. We solve the Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire eigenvalue
problem and observe the least stable mode. At low wave numbers, a dispersive
behavior amenable to the least stable eigenmodes belonging to the left branch
of the eigenvalue spectrum is observed. By rising the wave number, in both
flows, we observe a sharp dispersive to nondispersive transition which is
located at a nondimensional wave number of the order of the unity. Beyond the
transition, the asymptotically dominant mode belongs to the right branch of the
spectrum. The Reynolds number was varied in the ranges 20-100, 1000-8000 for
the wake and channel flow, respectively. We also consider the transient
behavior of the phase velocity of small three dimensional traveling waves.
Given an arbitrary initial condition, we show that the shape of the transient
highly depends on the wavelength value with respect to that of the
dispersion/nondispersion transition. Furthermore, we show that the phase
velocity can oscillate with a frequency which is equal to the width of the real
part of the eigenvalue spectrum.
