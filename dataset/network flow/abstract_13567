We construct new examples of cylinder flows, given by skew product extensions
of irrational rotations on the circle, that are ergodic and rationally ergodic
along a subsequence of iterates. In particular, they exhibit law of large
numbers. This is accomplished by explicitly calculating, for a subsequence of
iterates, the number of visits to zero, and it is shown that such number has a
gaussian distribution.
