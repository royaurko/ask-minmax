We study the maximum flow problem in directed H-minor-free graphs where H can
be drawn in the plane with one crossing. If a structural decomposition of the
graph as a clique-sum of planar graphs and graphs of constant complexity is
given, we show that a maximum flow can be computed in O(n log n) time. In
particular, maximum flows in directed K_{3,3}-minor-free graphs and directed
K_5-minor-free graphs can be computed in O(n log n) time without additional
assumptions.
