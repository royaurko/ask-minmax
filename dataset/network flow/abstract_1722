The data acquisition (DAQ) system of the SND detector successfully operated
during four data-taking seasons (2010-2013) at the e+e- collider VEPP-2000.
Currently the collider is shut down for planned reconstruction, which is
expected to increase the VEPP-2000 luminosity and data flow from the SND
detector electronics by up to 10 times. Since current DAQ system implementation
(electronics and computer part) does not have enough reserve for selection of
events in the new environment without compromising quality, there arose the
need for the system upgrade. Here we report on the major SND data acquisition
system upgrade which includes developing new electronics for digitization and
data transfer, complete redesign of the data network, increasing of the DAQ
computer farm processing capacity and making the event building process
concurrent. These measures will allow us to collect data flow from the most
congested detector subsystems in parallel in contrast to the current situation.
We would like to discuss also the possibility to implement full software
trigger solution in the future.
