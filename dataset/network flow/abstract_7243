In a single hop broadcast packet erasure network, we demonstrate that it is
possible to provide multirate packet delivery outside of what is given by the
network min-cut. This is achieved by using a deterministic non-block-based
network coding scheme, which allows us to sidestep some of the limitations put
in place by the block coding model used to determine the network capacity.
  Under the network coding scheme we outline, the sender is able to transmit
network coded packets above the channel rate of some receivers, while ensuring
that they still experience nonzero delivery rates. Interestingly, in this
generalised form of asynchronous network coded broadcast, receivers are not
required to obtain knowledge of all packets transmitted so far. Instead, causal
feedback from the receivers about packet erasures is used by the sender to
determine a network coded transmission that will allow at least one, but often
multiple receivers, to deliver their next needed packet.
  Although the analysis of deterministic coding schemes is generally a
difficult problem, by making some approximations we are able to obtain
tractable estimates of the receivers' delivery rates, which are shown to match
reasonably well with simulation. Using these estimates, we design a fairness
algorithm that allocates the sender's resources so all receivers will
experience fair delivery rate performance.
