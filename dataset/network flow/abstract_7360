In this presentation, we introduce sparsity methods for networked control
systems and show the effectiveness of sparse control. In networked control,
efficient data transmission is important since transmission delay and error can
critically deteriorate the stability and performance. We will show that this
problem is solved by sparse control designed by recent sparse optimization
methods.
