We present simulation results for the contact process on regular, cubic
networks that are composed of a one-dimensional lattice and a set of long edges
with unbounded length. Networks with different sets of long edges are
considered, that are characterized by different shortest-path dimensions and
random-walk dimensions. We provide numerical evidence that an absorbing phase
transition occurs at some finite value of the infection rate and the
corresponding dynamical critical exponents depend on the underlying network.
Furthermore, the time-dependent quantities exhibit log-periodic oscillations in
agreement with the discrete scale invariance of the networks. In case of
spreading from an initial active seed, the critical exponents are found to
depend on the location of the initial seed and break the hyper-scaling law of
the directed percolation universality class due to the inhomogeneity of the
networks. However, if the cluster spreading quantities are averaged over
initial sites the hyper-scaling law is restored.
