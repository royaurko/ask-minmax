A Cartesian grid method combined with a simplified gas kinetic scheme is
presented for subsonic and supersonic viscous flow simulation on complex
geometries. Under the Cartesian mesh, the computational grid points are
classified into four different categories, the fluid point, the solid point,
the drop point, and the interpolation point. The boundaries are represented by
a set of direction-oriented boundary points. A constrained weighted least
square method is employed to evaluate the physical quantities at the
interpolation points. Different boundary conditions, including isothermal
boundary, adiabatic boundary, and Euler slip boundary, are presented by
different interpolation strategies. We also propose a simplified gas kinetic
scheme as the flux solver for both subsonic and supersonic flow computations.
The methodology of constructing a simplified kinetic flux function can be
extended to other flow systems. A few numerical examples are used to validate
the Cartesian grid method and the simplified flux function. The reconstruction
scheme for recovering the boundary conditions of compressible viscous and heat
conducting flow with a Cartesian mesh can provide a smooth distribution of
physical quantities at solid boundary, and present an accurate solution for the
flow study with complex geometry.
