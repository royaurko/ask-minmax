We present an algorithm to store binary memories in a Hopfield neural network
using minimum probability flow, a recent technique to fit parameters in
energy-based probabilistic models. In the case of memories without noise, our
algorithm provably achieves optimal pattern storage (which we show is at least
one pattern per neuron) and outperforms classical methods both in speed and
memory recovery. Moreover, when trained on noisy or corrupted versions of a
fixed set of binary patterns, our algorithm finds networks which correctly
store the originals. We also demonstrate this finding visually with the
unsupervised storage and clean-up of large binary fingerprint images from
significantly corrupted samples.
