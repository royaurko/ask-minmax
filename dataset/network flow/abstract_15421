Common problems affecting modern email usage include spam, lack of sender
verification, lack of built-in security and lack of message integrity. This
paper looks at how we can utilise the extensible messaging and presence
protocol also known as XMPP to, in time, replace email facilities. We present
several methods for initiating a transition away from SMTP for email to rely
upon the inherent benefits of XMPP with minimal disruption to existing networks
and email infrastructure. We look at how a program might be used to open an
existing POP3/IMAP account, scan for messages that can be sent to a XMPP
network user, extract the message and then deliver it the XMPP user's client.
We show that the system can be implemented and then deployed with a minimum of
hassle and network disruption to demonstrate XMPP as a reliable and fast
replacement for email as we know it today.
