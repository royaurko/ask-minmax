One of the important issues in wireless networks is the Routing problem that
is effective on system performance, in this article the attempt is made to
propose a routing algorithm using the bee colony in order to reduce energy
consumption in wireless relay networks. In EBCD algorithm, through combined of
energy, distance and traffic parameters a routing algorithm for wireless
networks is presented with more efficiency than its predecessor. Applying the
bee colony method would allow the placement of the parameters under
conventional conditions and to get closer to a mechanism with a better
adaptability than that of the existing algorithm. According to the parameters
considered, the proposed algorithm provides a fitness function that can be
applied as a multi-hop. Unlike other algorithms of its kind this can increase
service quality based on environmental conditions through its multiple
services. This new method can store the energy accumulated in the nodes and
reduce the hop restrictions.
