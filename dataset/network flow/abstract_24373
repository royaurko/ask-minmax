Path planning of Robot is one of the challenging fields in the area of
Robotics research. In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm to find path
between starting and ending position for an intelligent system. An intelligent
system is considered to be a device/robot having an antenna connected with
sensor-detector system. The proposed algorithm is based on Neural Network
training concept. The considered neural network is Adapti ve to the knowledge
bases. However, implementation of this algorithm is slightly expensive due to
hardware it requires. From detailed analysis, it can be proved that the
resulted path of this algorithm is efficient.
