We perform a local stability analysis of rotational flows in the presence of
a constant vertical magnetic field and an azimuthal magnetic field with a
general radial dependence. Employing the short-wavelength approximation we
develop a unified framework for the investigation of the standard, the helical,
and the azimuthal version of the magnetorotational instability, as well as of
current-driven kink-type instabilities. Considering the viscous and resistive
setup, our main focus is on the case of small magnetic Prandtl numbers which
applies, e.g., to liquid metal experiments but also to the colder parts of
accretion disks. We show that the inductionless versions of MRI that were
previously thought to be restricted to comparably steep rotation profiles
extend well to the Keplerian case if only the azimuthal field slightly deviates
from its current-free (in the fluid) profile. We find an explicit criterion
separating the pure azimuthal inductionless magnetorotational instability from
the regime where this instability is mixed with the Tayler instability. We
further demonstrate that for particular parameter configurations the azimuthal
MRI originates as a result of a dissipation-induced instability of the
Chandrasekhar's equipartition solution of ideal magnetohydrodynamics.
