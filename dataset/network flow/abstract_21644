We give evidence that the production of DCC's during a non-equilibrium phase
transition can lead to an anomalous transverse distribution of secondary pions
when compared to a more conventional boost invariant hydrodynamic flow in local
thermal equilibrium. Our results pertain to the linear $\sigma$ model,treated
in leading order in large-$N$, in a boost invariant approximation. We also show
that the interpolating number density of the field theory calculation plays the
role of a classical relativistic phase space number distribution in determining
the momentum distribution of pions in the center of mass frame.
