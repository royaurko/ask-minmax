Thermodynamic and magnetic properties of Ising models defined on the
triangular Apollonian network are investigated. This and other similar networks
are inspired by the problem of covering an Euclidian domain with circles of
maximal radii. Maps for the thermodynamic functions in two subsequent
generations of the construction of the network are obtained by formulating the
problem in terms of transfer matrices. Numerical iteration of this set of maps
leads to exact values for the thermodynamic properties of the model. Different
choices for the coupling constants between only nearest neighbors along the
lattice are taken into account. For both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic
constants, long range magnetic ordering is obtained. With exception of a size
dependent effective critical behavior of the correlation length, no evidence of
asymptotic criticality was detected.
