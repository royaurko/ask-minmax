Recent large-scale peculiar velocity surveys suggest that large matter
volumes could be moving with appreciable velocity with respect to the CMB rest
frame. If confirmed, such results could conflict with the Cosmological
Principle according to which the matter and CMB rest frames should converge on
very large scales. In this work we explore the possibility that such large
scale bulk flows are due, not to the motion of matter with respect to the CMB,
but to the flow of dark energy with respect to matter. Indeed, when dark energy
is moving, the usual definition of the CMB rest frame as that in which the CMB
dipole vanishes is not appropriate. We find instead that the dipole vanishes
for observers at rest with respect to the cosmic center of mass, i.e. in motion
with respect to the background radiation.
