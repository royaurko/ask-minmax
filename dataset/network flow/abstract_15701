We study the effect of turnover of cross linkers, motors and filaments on the
generation of a contractile stress in a network of filaments connected by
passive crosslinkers and subjected to the forces exerted by molecular motors.
We perform numerical simulations where filaments are treated as rigid rods and
molecular motors move fast compared to the timescale of exchange of
crosslinkers. We show that molecular motors create a contractile stress above a
critical number of crosslinkers. When passive crosslinkers are allowed to turn
over, the stress exerted by the network vanishes, due to the formation of
clusters. When both filaments and passive crosslinkers turn over, clustering is
prevented and the network reaches a dynamic contractile steady-state. A maximum
stress is reached for an optimum ratio of the filament and crosslinker turnover
rates.
