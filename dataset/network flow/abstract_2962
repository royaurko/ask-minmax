We investigated the degree distribution of brain networks extracted from
functional magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain. In particular, the
distributions are compared between macroscopic brain networks using
region-based nodes and mesoscopic brain networks using voxel-based nodes. We
found that the distribution from these networks follow the same family of
distributions and represent a continuum of exponentially truncated power law
distributions.
