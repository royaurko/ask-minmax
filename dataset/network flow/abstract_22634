The scale factors of an arbitrary orthogonal space are a measure of its
content of homogeneous orthogonal space. In the present study, it is shown,
that their spatial and temporal rates of variation do not contribute to the
differential calculus of arbitrary functions in orthogonal space. Based on
this, the Navier-Stokes equations are formulated accordingly, to provide a
method of studying the kinematics of fluid motion in orthogonal plane space.
Employing this formulation and regular perturbation theory, the kinematic
physical measures of the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid around two
identical circular cylinders, which move with equal and opposite velocity
towards central impact are evaluated. For this case, the space is parametrised
according to the bipolar transformation of the cartesian plane.
