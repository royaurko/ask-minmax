A perceptron that learns the opposite of its own output is used to generate a
time series. We analyse properties of the weight vector and the generated
sequence, like the cycle length and the probability distribution of generated
sequences. A remarkable suppression of the autocorrelation function is
explained, and connections to the Bernasconi model are discussed. If a
continuous transfer function is used, the system displays chaotic and
intermittent behaviour, with the product of the learning rate and amplification
as a control parameter.
