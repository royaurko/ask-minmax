This paper presents an extensive data-based analysis of the non-profit
democratic hospitality exchange service bewelcome.org. We hereby pursuit the
goal of determining the factors influencing its growth. It also provides
general insights on internet-based hospitality exchange services. The other
investigated services are hospitalityclub.org and couchsurfing.org. Communities
using the three services are interconnected -- comparing their data provides
additional information.
