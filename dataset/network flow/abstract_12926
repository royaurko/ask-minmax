We present a method to calculate the magnetic moments of the high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) samples which consist of a few welded HTS parts. The
approach is generalized for the samples of various geometrical shapes and an
arbitrary number of welds. The obtained relations between the sample moment and
the density of critical current, which flows through the welds, allow to use
the magnetization loops for a quantitative characterization of the weld quality
in a wide range of temperatures and/or magnetic fields.
