We study the impact of disruptions on road networks, and the recovery process
after the disruption is removed from the system. Such disruptions could be
caused by vehicle breakdown or illegal parking. We analyze the transient
behavior using domain wall theory, and compare these predictions with
simulations of a stochastic cellular automaton model. We find that the domain
wall model can reproduce the time evolution of flow and density during the
disruption and the recovery processes, for both one-dimensional systems and
two-dimensional networks.
