We detected the spin polarization due to charge flow in the spin
non-degenerate surface state of a three dimensional topological insulator by
means of an all-electrical method. The charge current in the bulk-insulating
topological insulator Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3 (BSTS) was injected/extracted
through a ferromagnetic electrode made of Ni80Fe20, and an unusual
current-direction-dependent magnetoresistance gives evidence for the appearance
of spin polarization which leads to a spin-dependent resistance at the
BSTS/Ni80Fe20 interface. In contrast, our control experiment on Bi2Se3 gave
null result. These observations demonstrate the importance of the Fermi-level
control for the electrical detection of the spin polarization in topological
insulators.
