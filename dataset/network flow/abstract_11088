Previous work showed that the X network with M transmitters, N receivers has
MN/(M+N-1) degrees of freedom. In this work we study the degrees of freedom of
the X network with secrecy constraints, i.e. the X network where some/all
messages are confidential. We consider the $M \times N$ network where all
messages are secured and show that N(M-1)/(M+N-1) degrees of freedom can be
achieved. Secondly, we show that if messages from only M-1 transmitters are
confidential, then MN/(M+N-1) degrees of freedom can be achieved meaning that
there is no loss of degrees of freedom because of secrecy constraints. We also
consider the achievable secure degrees of freedom under a more conservative
secrecy constraint. We require that messages from any subset of transmitters
are secure even if other transmitters are compromised, i.e., messages from the
compromised transmitter are revealed to the unintended receivers. We also study
the achievable secure degrees of freedom of the K user Gaussian interference
channel under two different secrecy constraints where 1/2 secure degrees of
freedom per message can be achieved. The achievable scheme in all cases is
based on random binning combined with interference alignment.
