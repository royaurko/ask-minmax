We propose a model for solar prominences based on converging flow observed in
the chromosphere and photosphere. In contrast with existing models we do not
apply a shearing motion along the neutral line. Instead we assume that bipolar
loops approaching on different sides of the neutral line have a non-vanishing
magnetic helicity of the SAME sign. In the converging flow the individual loops
kink and develop a skew. For loops of the same helicity the skew is in the same
sense. As a result the `chiral' symmetry of an aligned distribution of loops is
broken and the reconnecting loop system forms a filament with the observed
magnetic orientation and anchoring of the barbs in regions of parasytic
polarity. The filament consists of a number of individual strands of coaxial
coronal electric currents each of which is current neutralised. The filament
material is suspended in dips in the magnetic field and the transverse field
direction coincides with that in the Kuperus-Raadu model. Above the filament a
cavity forms with an overlying arcade consisting of the outer portions of the
reconnected loops.
