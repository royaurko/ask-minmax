Generalised degrees provide a natural bridge between local and global
topological properties of networks. We define the generalised degree to be the
number of neighbours of a node within one and two steps respectively. Tailored
random graph ensembles are used to quantify and compare topological properties
of networks in a systematic and precise manner, using concepts from information
theory. We calculate the Shannon entropy of random graph ensembles constrained
with a specified generalised degree distribution. We find that the outcome has
a natural connection with the degree-degree correlation which is implied by
specifying a generalised degree distribution. We demonstrate how generalised
degrees can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively describe a network.
