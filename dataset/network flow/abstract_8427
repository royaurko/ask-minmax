We show that a complex network of phase oscillators may display interfaces
between domains (clusters) of synchronized oscillations. The emergence and
dynamics of these interfaces are studied in the general framework of
interacting phase oscillators composed of either dynamical domains (influenced
by different forcing processes), or structural domains (modular networks). The
obtained results allow to give a functional definition of overlapping
structures in modular networks, and suggest a practical method to identify
them. As a result, our algorithm could detect information on both single
overlapping nodes and overlapping clusters.
