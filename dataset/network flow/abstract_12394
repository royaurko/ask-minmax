The network metaphor in the analysis of urban and territorial cases has a
long tradition especially in transportation/land-use planning and economic
geography. More recently, urban design has brought its contribution by means of
the "space syntax" methodology. All these approaches, though under different
terms like accessibility, proximity, integration,connectivity, cost or effort,
focus on the idea that some places (or streets) are more important than others
because they are more central. The study of centrality in complex
systems,however, originated in other scientific areas, namely in structural
sociology, well before its use in urban studies; moreover, as a structural
property of the system, centrality has never been extensively investigated
metrically in geographic networks as it has been topologically in a wide range
of other relational networks like social, biological or technological. After
two previous works on some structural properties of the dual and primal graph
representations of urban street networks (Porta et al. cond-mat/0411241;
Crucitti et al. physics/0504163), in this paper we provide an in-depth
investigation of centrality in the primal approach as compared to the dual one,
with a special focus on potentials for urban design.
