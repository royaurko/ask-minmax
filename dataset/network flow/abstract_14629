There is a well established theory of Ballooning modes in a toroidal plasma.
The cornerstone of this is a local eigenvalue lambda on each magnetic surface -
which also depends on the ballooning phase angle k. In stationary plasmas
lambda(k) is required only near its maximum, but in rotating plasmas its
average over k is required. Unfortunately in many case lambda(k) does not exist
for some range of k, because the spectrum there contains only a stable
continuum. This limits the application of the theory, and raises the important
question of whether this "stable interval" gives rise to significant damping.
This question is re-examined using a new, simplified, model - which leads to
the conclusion that there is no appreciable damping at small shear flow. In
particular, therefore, a small shear flow should not affect Ballooning mode
stability boundaries.
