Many biological oscillators are arranged in networks composed of many
inter-coupled cellular oscillators. However, results are still lacking on the
collective oscillation period of inter-coupled gene regulatory oscillators,
which, as has been reported, may be different from the oscillation period of an
autonomous cellular oscillator. Based on the Goodwin oscillator, we analyze the
collective oscillation pattern of coupled cellular oscillator networks. First
we give a condition under which the oscillator network exhibits oscillatory and
synchronized behavior, then we estimate the collective oscillation period based
on a multivariable harmonic balance technique. Analytical results are derived
in terms of biochemical parameters, thus giving insight into the basic
mechanism of biological oscillation and providing guidance in synthetic biology
design. Simulation results are given to confirm the theoretical predictions.
