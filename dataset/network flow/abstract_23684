We solve the following problem of Z. F\"uredi, J. C. Lagarias and F. Morgan
[FLM]: Is there an upper bound polynomial in $n$ for the largest cardinality of
a set S of unit vectors in an n-dimensional Minkowski space (or Banach space)
such that the sum of any subset has norm less than 1? We prove that |S|\leq 2n
and that equality holds iff the space is linearly isometric to \ell^n_\infty,
the space with an n-cube as unit ball. We also remark on similar questions
raised in [FLM] that arose out of the study of singularities in
length-minimizing networks in Minkowski spaces.
