The self-consistent signal-to-noise analysis (SCSNA) is an alternative to the
replica method for deriving the set of order parameter equations for
associative memory neural network models and is closely related with the
Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equation (TAP) approach. In the recent paper by Shiino
and Yamana the Onsager reaction term of the TAP equation has been found to be
obtained from the SCSNA for Hopfield neural networks with 2-body interaction.
We study the TAP equation for an associative memory stochastic analog neural
network with 3-body interaction to investigate the structure of the Onsager
reaction term, in connection with the term proportional to the output
characteristic to the SCSNA. We report the SCSNA framework for analog networks
with 3-body interactions as well as a novel recipe based on the cavity concept
that involves two cavities and the hybrid use of the SCSNA to obtain the TAP
equation.
