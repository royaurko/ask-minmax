We present and discuss \emph{Spitzer} and near-infrared H$_{2}$ observations
of a new bi-polar protostellar outflow in the Rosette Molecular Cloud. The
outflow is seen in all four IRAC bands and partially as diffuse emission in the
MIPS 24 $\mu$m band. An embedded MIPS 24 $\mu$m source bisects the outflow and
appears to be the driving source. This source is coincident with a dark patch
seen in absorption in the 8 $\mu$m IRAC image. \emph{Spitzer} IRAC color
analysis of the shocked emission was performed from which thermal and column
density maps of the outflow were constructed. Narrow-band near-infrared (NIR)
images of the flow reveal H$_2$ emission features coincident with the high
temperature regions of the outflow. This outflow has now been given the
designation MHO 1321 due to the detection of NIR H$_2$ features. We use these
data and maps to probe the physical conditions and structure of the flow.
