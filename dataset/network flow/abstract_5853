We present a family of networks, expanded deterministic Apollonian networks,
which are a generalization of the Apollonian networks and are simultaneously
scale-free, small-world, and highly clustered. We introduce a labeling of their
vertices that allows to determine a shortest path routing between any two
vertices of the network based only on the labels.
