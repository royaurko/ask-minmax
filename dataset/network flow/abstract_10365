A three-dimensional model is proposed for Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii swimming
with a breaststroke-like beating of its two flagella. The model reveals unusual
angular orbits of the active swimmer under a linear shear flow. Namely, the
swimmer sustains orientation transiently across the flow when flagella plane is
perpendicular to the shear plane, and amplify the shear-induced rotation along
the flow. Such behavior is a result of the interplay between shear-induced
deformation and swimmer's periodic beating motion that exerts internal torques
on the torque-free swimmer. This particular behavior has some significant
consequences on the rheological properties of the suspension that tends to
confirm previous experimental results [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 098102 (2010)]. We
calculated the intrinsic viscosity of the suspension with such isolated modeled
microswimmers (dilute case) in shear flow using numerical simulations based on
Rotne-Prager approximation. The results show an increased intrinsic viscosity
for active swimmer suspensions in comparison to non-active ones in accordance
with previous experimental measurements. A major enhancement of the active
swimmer viscosity occurs due to the effectively extended shape of the
deformable swimming cells. We also recover the experimentally observed shear
thinning behavior.
