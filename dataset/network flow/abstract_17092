The distributions of the random distances associated with hexagons, rhombuses
and triangles have been derived and verified in the existing work. All of these
geometric shapes are related to each other and have various applications in
wireless communications, transportation, etc. Hexagons are widely used to model
the cells in cellular networks, while trapezoids can be utilized to model the
edge users in a cellular network with a hexagonal tessellation. In this report,
the distributions of the random distances associated with unit trapezoids are
derived, when two random points are within a unit trapezoid or in two neighbor
unit trapezoids. The mathematical expressions are verified through simulation.
Further, we present the polynomial fit for the PDFs, which can be used to
simplify the computation.
