The VKS experiment has evidenced dynamo action in a highly turbulent liquid
sodium von K\'arm\'an flow [R. Monchaux et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98},
044502 (2007)]. However, the existence and the onset of a dynamo happen to
depend on the exact experimental configuration. By performing kinematic dynamo
simulations on real flows, we study their influence on dynamo action, in
particular the sense of rotation and the presence of an annulus in the shear
layer plane. The 3 components of the mean velocity fields are measured in a
water prototype for different VKS configurations through Stereoscopic Particle
Imaging Velocimetry. Experimental data are then processed in order to use them
in a periodic cylindrical kinematic code. Even if the kinematic predicted mode
appears to be different from the experimental saturated one, the results
concerning the existence of a dynamo and the thresholds are in qualitative
agreement, showing the importance of the flow characteristics.
