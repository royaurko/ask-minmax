One of the most important aspects of detector development for the ILC is a
good jet energy resolution sigma_E/E. To achieve the goal of high precision
measurements sigma_E/E = 0.30/sqrt(E(GeV)} is proposed. The particle flow
approach together with highly granular calorimeters is able to reach this goal.
This paper presents a new particle flow algorithm, called Track-Based particle
flow, and shows first performance results for 45 GeV jets based on full
detector simulation of the Tesla TDR detector model.
