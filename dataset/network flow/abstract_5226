The organizational knowledge is one of the most important and valuable assets
of organizations. In such environment, organizations with broad, specialized
and up-to-date knowledge, adequately using knowledge resources, will be more
successful than their competitors. For effective use of knowledge, dynamic
knowledge flow from the sources to destinations is essential. In this regard, a
novel complex concept in knowledge management is the analysis, design and
implementation of knowledge flow management systems. One of the major
challenges in such systems is to explore the knowledge flow from the source to
the recipient and control the flow for quality improvements concerning the
users' needs as possible. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide an
architecture in order to solve this challenge. For this purpose, in addition to
the architecture for knowledge flow management systems, a new node selection
strategy is provided with higher success rate compared to previous strategies.
