The problem of supervised classification of the satellite image is considered
to be the task of grouping pixels into a number of homogeneous regions in space
intensity. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines a radial basic
function clustering network with a growing neural gas include utility factor
classifier to yield improved solutions, obtained with previous networks. The
double objective technique is first used to the development of a method to
perform the satellite images classification, and finally, the implementation to
address the issue of the number of nodes in the hidden layer of the classic
Radial Basis functions network. Results demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed technique are provided for numeric remote sensing imagery. Moreover,
the remotely sensed image of Oran city in Algeria has been classified using the
proposed technique to establish its utility.
