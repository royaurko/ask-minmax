Empirical data on the dynamics of human face-to-face interactions across a
variety of social venues have recently revealed a number of context-independent
structural and temporal properties of human contact networks. This universality
suggests that some basic mechanisms may be responsible for the unfolding of
human interactions in the physical space. Here we discuss a simple model that
reproduces the empirical distributions for the individual, group and collective
dynamics of face-to-face contact networks. The model describes agents that move
randomly in a two-dimensional space and tend to stop when meeting "attractive"
peers, and reproduces accurately the empirical distributions.
