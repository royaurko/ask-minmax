Pattern formation and self-organization are phenomena commonly observed
experimentally in diverse types of plasma systems, including
atmospheric-pressure electric arc discharges. However, numerical simulations
reproducing anode pattern formation in arc discharges have proven exceedingly
elusive. Time-dependent three-dimensional thermodynamic nonequilibrium
simulations reveal the spontaneous formation of self-organized patterns of
anode attachment spots in the free-burning arc, a canonical thermal plasma flow
established by a constant DC current between an axi-symmetric electrodes
configuration in the absence of external forcing. The number of spots, their
size, and distribution within the pattern depend on the applied total current
and on the resolution of the spatial discretization, whereas the main
properties of the plasma flow, such as maximum temperatures, velocity, and
voltage drop, depend only on the former. The sensibility of the solution to the
spatial discretization stresses the computational requirements for
comprehensive arc discharge simulations. The obtained anode patterns
qualitatively agree with experimental observations and confirm that the spots
originate at the fringes of the arc - anode attachment. The results imply that
heavy-species - electron energy equilibration, in addition to thermal
instability, has a dominant role in the formation of anode spots in arc
discharges.
