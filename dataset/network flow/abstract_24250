We introduce a graph-theoretic approach to extract clusters and hierarchies
in complex data-sets in an unsupervised and deterministic manner, without the
use of any prior information. This is achieved by building topologically
embedded networks containing the subset of most significant links and analyzing
the network structure. For a planar embedding, this method provides both the
intra-cluster hierarchy, which describes the way clusters are composed, and the
inter-cluster hierarchy which describes how clusters gather together. We
discuss performance, robustness and reliability of this method by first
investigating several artificial data-sets, finding that it can outperform
significantly other established approaches. Then we show that our method can
successfully differentiate meaningful clusters and hierarchies in a variety of
real data-sets. In particular, we find that the application to gene expression
patterns of lymphoma samples uncovers biologically significant groups of genes
which play key-roles in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of some of the most
relevant human lymphoid malignancies.
