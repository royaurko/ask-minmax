A death of oscillation is reported in a network of coupled synchronized
oscillators in presence of additional repulsive coupling. The repulsive link
evolves as an averaging effect of mutual interaction between two neighboring
oscillators due to a local fault and the number of repulsive links grows in
time when the death scenario emerges. Analytical condition for oscillation
death is derived for two coupled Landau-Stuart systems. Numerical results also
confirm oscillation death in chaotic systems such as a Sprott system and the
R\"ossler oscillator. We explore the effect in large networks of globally
coupled oscillators and find that the number of repulsive links is always fewer
than the size of the network.
