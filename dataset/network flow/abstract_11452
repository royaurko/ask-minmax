The social recommender system that supports the creation of new relations
between users in the multimedia sharing system is presented in the paper. To
generate suggestions the new concept of the multirelational social network was
introduced. It covers both direct as well as object-based relationships that
reflect social and semantic links between users. The main goal of the new
method is to create the personalized suggestions that are continuously adapted
to users' needs depending on the personal weights assigned to each layer from
the social network. The conducted experiments confirmed the usefulness of the
proposed model.
