We investigate a recently proposed family of positive-definite kernels that
mimic the computation in large neural networks. We examine the properties of
these kernels using tools from differential geometry; specifically, we analyze
the geometry of surfaces in Hilbert space that are induced by these kernels.
When this geometry is described by a Riemannian manifold, we derive results for
the metric, curvature, and volume element. Interestingly, though, we find that
the simplest kernel in this family does not admit such an interpretation. We
explore two variations of these kernels that mimic computation in neural
networks with different activation functions. We experiment with these new
kernels on several data sets and highlight their general trends in performance
for classification.
