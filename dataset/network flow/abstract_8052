This article provides an attempt to extend concepts from the theory of
Riemannian manifolds to piecewise linear spaces. In particular we propose an
analogue of the Ricci tensor. On a given set of piecewise linear spaces we
define and discuss (normalized) Ricci flows. Piecewise linear Einstein metrics
are defined and examples are provided. Criteria for flows to approach Einstein
metrics are formulated. Second variations of the total scalar curvature at a
specific Einstein space are calculated.
