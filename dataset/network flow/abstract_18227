We study a version of the Tangled Nature model of evolutionary ecology
redefined in a phenotype space where mutants have properties correlated to
their parents. The model has individual-based dynamics whilst incorporating
species scale competitive constraints and a system scale resource constraint.
Multiple species arise that coexist in a species interaction network with
evolving global properties. Both the mean interaction strength and the network
connectance increase relative to the null system as mutualism becomes more
extensive. From a study of the dependence of average degree on the resource
level we extract the diversity-connectance relationship which conforms to the
hyperbolic form seen in field data. This is adjudged to arise as a consequence
of the evolutionary pressure to achieve positive interactions. The network
degree distributions conform more strongly to exponential than to the null
binomial distributions in all cases. This effect is believed to be caused by
correlations in the reproductive process. We also study how resource
availability influences the phenotypical lifetime distribution which is
approximately of power law form. We observe that the mean lifetime is inversely
related to the resource level.
