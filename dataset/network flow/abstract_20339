The paper considers heat transfer characteristics of thin film flow over a
hot horizontal flat plate resulting from a cold vertical jet of liquid falling
onto the surface. A numerical solution of high accuracy is obtained for large
Reynolds numbers using the modified Keller box method. For the flat plate,
solutions for axisymmetric jets are obtained. In a parallel approximation
theory an advanced polynomial approximation for the velocity and temperature
distribution is employed and results are good agreement with those obtained
using a simple Pohlhausen polynomial and the numerical solutions.
