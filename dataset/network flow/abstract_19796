Simulation results on dynamic yaw stability derivatives of a gull bird by
means of computational fluid dynamics are presented. Two different kinds of
motions are used for determining the dynamic yaw stability derivatives CNr and
CNbeta . Concerning the first one, simple lateral translation and yaw rotary
motions in yaw are considered. The second one consists of combined motions. To
determine dynamic yaw stability derivatives of the bird, the simulation of an
unsteady flow with a bird model showing a harmonic motion is performed. The
unsteady flow solution for each time step is obtained by solving unsteady Euler
equations based on a finite volume approach for a smaller reduced frequency.
Then, an evaluation of unsteady forces and moments for one cycle is conducted
using harmonic Fourier analysis. The results on the dynamic yaw stability
derivatives for both simulations of the model motion show a good agreement.
