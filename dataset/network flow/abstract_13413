A non-equilibrium theory of isothermal and diffusionless evolution of
incoherent interfaces within a plastically deforming solid is developed. The
irreversible dynamics of the interface are driven by its normal motion,
incoherency (slip and misorientation), and an intrinsic plastic flow; and
purely by plastic deformation in the bulk away from the interface. Using the
continuum theory for defect distribution (in bulk and over the interface) we
formulate a general kinematical framework, derive relevant balance laws and
jump conditions, and prescribe a thermodynamically consistent
constitutive/kinetic structure for interface evolution.
