Co-simulation platforms are necessary to study the interactions of complex
systems integrated in future smart grids. The Virtual Grid Integration
Laboratory (VirGIL) is a modular co-simulation platform designed to study
interactions between demand response strategies, building comfort,
communication networks, and power system operation. This paper presents the
coupling of power systems, buildings, communications and control under a master
algorithm. There are two objectives. First, to use a modular architecture for
VirGIL, based on the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI), where several
different modules can be added, exchanged, and tested. Second, to use a
commercial power system simulation platform, familiar to power system
operators, such as DIgSILENT Powerfactory. This will help reduce the barriers
to the industry for adopting such platforms, investigate and subsequently
deploy demand response strategies in their daily operation. VirGIL further
introduces the integration of the Quantized State System (QSS) methods for
simulation in this co-simulation platform. Results on how these systems
interact using a real network and consumption data are also presented.
