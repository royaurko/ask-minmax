I consider a bistable reaction-diffusion system on the interface of deep
fluid interacting with Marangoni flow. The method of matched asymptotic
expansions is used to resolve the singularity at a sharp interface between the
alternative states, and to compute the self-induced flow velocity advecting the
domain boundary. It is shown that Marangoni flow serves as an efficient
mechanism preventing the spread of the state with a higher surface tension when
it is dynamically favorable.
