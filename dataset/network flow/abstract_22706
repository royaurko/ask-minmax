In this paper, we first establish the regularity theorem for suitable weak
solutions to the Ericksen-Leslie system in dimensions two. Building on such a
regularity, we then establish the existence of a global weak solution to the
Ericksen-Leslie system in $\mathbb R^2$ for any initial data in the energy
space, under the physical constraint conditions on the Leslie coefficients
ensuring the dissipation of energy of the system, which is smooth away from at
most finitely many times. This extends earlier works by Lin,Lin, and Wang on a
simplified nematic liquid crystal flow in dimensions two.
