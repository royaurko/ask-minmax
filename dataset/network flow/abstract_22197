A combined density functional theory and functional renormalization group
method is introduced which takes into account orbital-dependent interaction
parameters to derive the effective low-energy theory of weakly to
intermediately correlated Fermi systems. As an application, the competing
fluctuations in LiFeAs are investigated, which is the main representative of
the 111 class of iron pnictides displaying no magnetic order, but
superconductivity, for the parent compound. The superconducting order parameter
is found to be of s+- type driven by collinear antiferromagnetic fluctuations.
They eventually exceed the ferromagnetic fluctuations stemming from the small
hole pocket at the Gamma point, as the system flows to low energies.
