We apply a recently proposed novel thermostating mechanism to an interacting
many-particle system where the bulk particles are moving according to
Hamiltonian dynamics. At the boundaries the system is thermalized by
deterministic and time-reversible scattering. We show how this scattering
mechanism can be related to stochastic boundary conditions. We subsequently
simulate nonequilibrium steady states associated to thermal conduction and
shear flow for a hard disk fluid. The bulk behavior of the model is studied by
comparing the transport coefficients obtained from computer simulations to
theoretical results. Furthermore, thermodynamic entropy production and
exponential phase-space contraction rates in the stationary nonequilibrium
states are calculated showing that in general these quantities do not agree.
