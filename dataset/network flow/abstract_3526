We consider the problem of in-network compressed sensing from distributed
measurements. Every agent has a set of measurements of a signal $x$, and the
objective is for the agents to recover $x$ from their collective measurements
using only communication with neighbors in the network. Our distributed
approach to this problem is based on the centralized Iterative Hard
Thresholding algorithm (IHT). We first present a distributed IHT algorithm for
static networks that leverages standard tools from distributed computing to
execute in-network computations with minimized bandwidth consumption. Next, we
address distributed signal recovery in networks with time-varying topologies.
The network dynamics necessarily introduce inaccuracies to our in-network
computations. To accommodate these inaccuracies, we show how centralized IHT
can be extended to include inexact computations while still providing the same
recovery guarantees as the original IHT algorithm. We then leverage these new
theoretical results to develop a distributed version of IHT for time-varying
networks. Evaluations show that our distributed algorithms for both static and
time-varying networks outperform previously proposed solutions in time and
bandwidth by several orders of magnitude.
