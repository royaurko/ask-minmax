We introduce the notion of Fermi flow for hypersurfaces in Riemannian
manifolds. It turns out that this is a powerful tool to study the geometry of
distance surfaces about a given initial hypersurface. Some of the results in
this paper are known in one form or another, however the aim is to demonstrate
how they can all be derived by the same method and proved in a very simple
manner. In addition we obtain some new results and results that are stronger
than those stated in the literature.
