Distance bounding protocols are used by nodes in wireless networks to
calculate upper bounds on their distances to other nodes. However, dishonest
nodes in the network can turn the calculations both illegitimate and inaccurate
when they participate in protocol executions. It is important to analyze
protocols for the possibility of such violations. Past efforts to analyze
distance bounding protocols have only been manual. However, automated
approaches are important since they are quite likely to find flaws that manual
approaches cannot, as witnessed in literature for analysis pertaining to key
establishment protocols. In this paper, we use the constraint solver tool to
automatically analyze distance bounding protocols. We first formulate a new
trace property called Secure Distance Bounding (SDB) that protocol executions
must satisfy. We then classify the scenarios in which these protocols can
operate considering the (dis)honesty of nodes and location of the attacker in
the network. Finally, we extend the constraint solver so that it can be used to
test protocols for violations of SDB in these scenarios and illustrate our
technique on some published protocols.
