The hydrodynamic lift force that polymers experience near boundaries is known
to be a crucial element when considering rheological flows of dilute polymer
solutions. Here we develop theory to describe the hydrodynamic lift force on
extended polymers flowing near flat surfaces. The lift force is shown to
display a non-monotonic character increasing linearly with the distance to the
wall $Z$ in the near-surface regime defined as $Z<L$, with $L$ being the
contour length of the polymer. At heights $Z \sim L$ the lift force displays a
maximum, and for $Z>L$ we recover the well known far-field result in which the
force decays as $Z^{-2}$. Our analytical theory has important implications in
understanding adsorption, desorption, and depletion layers of highly extended
objects in flow.
