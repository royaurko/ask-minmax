A theory of the weak field Hall effect of Bloch electrons based on the
analysis of the forces acting on electrons is presented. It is argued that the
electric current is composed of two contributions, that driven by the electric
field along current flow and the non-dissipative contribution originated in
demagnetization currents. The Hall resistance as a function of the electron
concentration for the tight-binding model of a crystal with square lattice and
body-centered cubic lattice is described in detail. For comparison the effect
of strong magnetic fields is also discussed.
