Understanding dynamics of evolution in large social networks is an important
problem. In this paper, we characterize evolution in large multi-relational
social networks. The proliferation of online media such as Twitter, Facebook,
Orkut and MMORPGs\footnote{Massively Multi-player Online Role Playing Games}
have created social networking data at an unprecedented scale. Sony's Everquest
2 is one such example. We used game multi-relational networks to reveal the
dynamics of evolution in a multi-relational setting by macroscopic study of the
game network. Macroscopic analysis involves fragmenting the network into
smaller portions for studying the dynamics within these sub-networks, referred
to as `communities'. From an evolutionary perspective of multi-relational
network analysis, we have made the following contributions. Specifically, we
formulated and analyzed various metrics to capture evolutionary properties of
networks. We find that co-evolution rates in trust based `communities' are
approximately $60\%$ higher than the trade based `communities'. We also find
that the trust and trade connections within the `communities' reduce as their
size increases. Finally, we study the interrelation between the dynamics of
trade and trust within `communities' and find interesting results about the
precursor relationship between the trade and the trust dynamics within the
`communities'.
