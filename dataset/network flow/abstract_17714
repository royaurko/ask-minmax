A relation between the Goldstein-Petrich hierarchy for plane curves and the
Toda lattice hierarchy is investigated. A representation formula for plane
curves is given in terms of a special class of $\tau$-functions of the Toda
lattice hierarchy. A representation formula for discretized plane curves is
also discussed.
