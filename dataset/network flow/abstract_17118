We consider the height of random k-trees and k-Apollonian networks. These
random graphs are not really trees, but instead have a tree-like structure. The
height will be the maximum distance of a vertex from the root. We show that
w.h.p. the height of random k-trees and k-Apollonian networks is asymptotic to
clog t, where t is the number of vertices, and c=c(k) is given as the solution
to a transcendental equation. The equations are slightly different for the two
types of process. In the limit as k-->oo the height of both processes is
asymptotic to log t/(k log 2).
