We discuss a natural form of Ricci--flow conjugation between two distinct
general relativistic data sets given on a compact $n\geq 3$-dimensional
manifold $\Sigma$. We establish the existence of the relevant entropy
functionals for the matter and geometrical variables, their monotonicity
properties, and the associated convergence in the appropriate sense. We show
that in such a framework there is a natural mode expansion generated by the
spectral resolution of the Ricci conjugate Hodge--DeRham operator. This mode
expansion allows to compare the two distinct data sets and gives rise to a
computable heat kernel expansion of the fluctuations among the fields defining
the data. In particular this shows that Ricci flow conjugation entails a form
of $L^2$ averaging of one data set with respect to the other with a number of
desiderable properties: (i) It preserves the dominant energy condition; (ii) It
is localized by a heat kernel whose support sets the scale of averaging; (iii)
It is characterized by a set of balance functionals which allow the analysis of
its entropic stability.
