This paper gives an essentially self-contained exposition (except for an
appeal to the Lojasiewicz gradient inequality) of geometric invariant theory
from a differential geometric viewpoint. Central ingredients are the
moment-weight inequality (relating the Mumford numerical invariants to the norm
of the moment map), the negative gradient flow of the moment map squared, and
the Kempf-Ness function.
