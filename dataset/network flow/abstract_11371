The proliferation of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing protocols is due to
their efficient and scalable methods for data dissemination to numerous users.
But many of these networks have no provisions to provide users with long term
access to files after the initial interest has diminished, nor are they able to
guarantee protection for users from malicious clients that wish to implicate
them in incriminating activities. As such, users may turn to supplementary
measures for storing and transferring data in P2P systems. We present a new
file sharing paradigm, called a Graffiti Network, which allows peers to harness
the potentially unlimited storage of the Internet as a third-party
intermediary. Our key contributions in this paper are (1) an overview of a
distributed system based on this new threat model and (2) a measurement of its
viability through a one-year deployment study using a popular web-publishing
platform. The results of this experiment motivate a discussion about the
challenges of mitigating this type of file sharing in a hostile network
environment and how web site operators can protect their resources.
