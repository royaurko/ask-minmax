We investigate the dripping of liquids around solid surfaces in the regime of
inertial flows, a situation commonly encountered with the so-called "teapot
effect". We demonstrate that surface wettability is an unexpected key factor in
controlling flow separation and dripping, the latter being completely
suppressed in the limit of superhydrophobic substrates. This unforeseen
coupling is rationalized in terms of a novel hydro-capillary adhesion
framework, which couples inertial flows to surface wettability effects. This
description of flow separation successfully captures the observed dependence on
the various experimental parameters - wettability, flow velocity, solid surface
edge curvature-. As a further illustration of this coupling, a real-time
control of dripping is demonstrated using electro-wetting for contact angle
actuation.
