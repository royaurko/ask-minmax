A problem by Diestel is to extend algebraic flow theory of finite graphs to
infinite graphs with ends. In order to pursue this problem, we define an A-flow
and non-elusive H-flow for arbitrary graphs and for abelian topological
Hausdorff groups H and compact subsets A of H. We use these new definitions to
extend several well-known theorems of flows in finite graphs to infinite
graphs.
