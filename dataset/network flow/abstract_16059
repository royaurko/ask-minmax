The calculation of the SIR distribution at the typical receiver (or,
equivalently, the success probability of transmissions over the typical link)
in Poisson bipolar and cellular networks with Rayleigh fading is relatively
straightforward, but it only provides limited information on the success
probabilities of the individual links. This paper introduces the notion of the
meta distribution of the SIR, which is the distribution of the conditional
success probability $P$ given the point process, and provides bounds, an exact
analytical expression, and a simple approximation for it. The meta distribution
provides fine-grained information on the SIR and answers questions such as
"What fraction of users in a Poisson cellular network achieve 90% link
reliability if the required SIR is 5 dB?". Interestingly, in the bipolar model,
if the transmit probability $p$ is reduced while increasing the network density
$\lambda$ such that the density of concurrent transmitters $\lambda p$ stays
constant as $p\to 0$, $P$ degenerates to a constant, i.e., all links have
exactly the same success probability in the limit, which is the one of the
typical link. In contrast, in the cellular case, if the interfering base
stations are active independently with probability $p$, the variance of $P$
approaches a non-zero constant when $p$ is reduced to $0$ while keeping the
mean success probability constant.
