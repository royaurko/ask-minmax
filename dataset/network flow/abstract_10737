We study the accretion processes on a black hole by numerical simulation. We
use a grid based finite difference code for this purpose. We scan the parameter
space spanned by the specific energy and the angular momentum and compare the
time-dependent solutions with those obtained from theoretical considerations.
We found several important results (a) The time dependent flow behaves close to
a constant height model flow in the pre-shock region and a flow with vertical
equilibrium in the post-shock region. (c) The infall time scale in the
post-shock region is several times higher than the free-fall time scale. (b)
There are two discontinuities in the flow, one being just outside of the inner
sonic point. Turbulence plays a major role in determining the locations of
these discontinuities. (d) The two discontinuities oscillate with two different
frequencies and behave as a coupled harmonic oscillator. A Fourier analysis of
the variation of the outer shock location indicates higher power at the lower
frequency and lower power at the higher frequency. The opposite is true when
the analysis of the inner shock is made. These behaviours will have
implications in the spectral and timing properties of black hole candidates.
