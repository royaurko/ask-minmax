We investigate numerically the Self Organized Criticality (SOC) properties of
the dissipative Olami-Feder-Christensen model on small-world and scale-free
networks. We find that the small-world OFC model exhibits self-organized
criticality. Indeed, in this case we observe power law behavior of earthquakes
size distribution with finite size scaling for the cut-off region. In the
scale-free OFC model, instead, the strength of disorder hinders synchronization
and does not allow to reach a critical state.
