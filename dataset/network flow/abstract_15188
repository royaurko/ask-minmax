In this paper we study the macroscopic conduction properties of large but
finite binary networks with conducting bonds. By taking a combination of a
spectral and an averaging based approach we derive asymptotic formulae for the
conduction in terms of the component proportions p and the total number of
components N. These formulae correctly identify both the percolation limits and
also the emergent power law behaviour between the percolation limits and show
the interplay between the size of the network and the deviation of the
proportion from the critical value of p = 1/2. The results compare excellently
with a large number of numerical simulations.
