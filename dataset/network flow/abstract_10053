We propose to make use of the off-shell recursive relations with the
color-flow decomposition in the calculation of QCD amplitudes on MadGraph. We
introduce colored quarks and their interactions with nine gluons in the
color-flow basis plus an Abelian gluon on MadGraph, such that it generates
helicity amplitudes in the color-flow basis with off-shell recursive formulae
for multi-gluon sub-amplitudes. We demonstrate calculations of up to 5-jet
processes such as $gg\rightarrow 5g$, $u\bar{u}\rightarrow 5g$ and
$uu\rightarrow uuggg$. Although our demonstration is limited, it paves the way
to evaluate amplitudes with more quark lines and gluons with Madgraph.
