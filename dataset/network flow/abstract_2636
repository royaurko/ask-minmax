Two, the most simple cases of special-relativistic flows of a viscous,
incompressible fluid are considered: plane Couette flow and plane Poiseuille
flow. Considering only the regular motion of the fluid we found the
distribution of velocity in the fluid (velocity profiles) and the friction
force, acting on immovable wall. The results are expressed through simple
analytical functions for the Couette flow, while for the Poiseiulle flow they
are expressed by higher transcendental functions (Jacobi's elliptic functions).
