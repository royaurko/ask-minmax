We present a model for the dispersal of protoplanetary disks by winds from
either the central star or the inner disk. These winds obliquely strike the
flaring disk surface and strip away disk material by entraining it in an
outward radial-moving flow at the wind-disk interface which lies several disk
scale heights above the mid-plane. The disk dispersal time depends on the
entrainment velocity at which disk material flows into this turbulent shear
layer interface. If the entrainment efficiency is ~10% of the local sound
speed, a likely upper limit, the dispersal time at 1 AU is ~6 Myr for a disk
with a surface density of 10^3 g cm^{-2}, a solar mass central star, and a wind
with an outflow rate 10^{-8} Msun/yr and terminal velocity 200 km/s. When
compared to photoevaporation and viscous evolution, wind stripping can be a
dominant mechanism only for the combination of low accretion rates (< 10^{-8}
Msun/yr) and wind outflow rates approaching these accretion rates. This case is
unusual since generally outflow rates are < 0.1 of of accretion rates.
