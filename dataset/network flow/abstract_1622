We develop a framework for optimizing a novel approach to extending the
linear range of bioanalytical systems and biosensors by utilizing two enzymes
with different kinetic responses to the input chemical as their substrate. Data
for the flow-injection amperometric system devised for detection of lysine
based on the function of L-Lysine-alpha-Oxidase and Lysine-2-monooxygenase are
analyzed. Lysine is a homotropic substrate for the latter enzyme. We elucidate
the mechanism for extending the linear response range and develop optimization
techniques for future applications of such systems.
