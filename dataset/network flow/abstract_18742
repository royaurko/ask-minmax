We study the critical effect of an intermittent social distancing strategy on
the propagation of epidemics in adaptive complex networks. We characterize the
effect of our strategy in the framework of the susceptible-infected-recovered
model. In our model, based on local information, a susceptible individual
interrupts the contact with an infected individual with a probability $\sigma$
and restores it after a fixed time $t_{b}$. We find that, depending on the
network topology, in our social distancing strategy there exists a cutoff
threshold $\sigma_{c}$ beyond which the epidemic phase disappears. Our results
are supported by a theoretical framework and extensive simulations of the
model. Furthermore we show that this strategy is very efficient because it
leads to a "susceptible herd behavior" that protects a large fraction of
susceptibles individuals. We explain our results using percolation arguments.
