It has been shown in recent ALICE@LHC measurements that the odd flow
harmonics, in particular a directed flow, v1, occurred to be weak and dominated
by random fluctuations. In this work we propose a new method, which makes the
measurements more sensitive to the flow patterns showing global collective
symmetries. We demonstrate how the longitudinal center of mass rapidity
fluctuations can be identified, and then the collective flow analysis can be
performed in the event-by-event center of mass frame. Such a method can be very
effective in separating the flow patterns originating from random fluctuations,
and the flow patterns originating from the global symmetry of the initial
state.
