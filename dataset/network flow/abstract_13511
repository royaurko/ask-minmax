We show that in hydrodynamic simulations for relativistic heavy-ion
collisions, strong resonance decay calculations can be performed with fewer
species of particle resonances while preserving good accuracy in single
particle spectra and flow anisotropies. Such partial resonance calculations
boost computation efficiency by a factor of 10 which is essential for large
scale event-by-event simulations.
