Robust optimization is concerned with constructing solutions that remain
feasible also when a limited number of resources is removed from the solution.
Most studies of robust combinatorial optimization to date made the assumption
that every resource is equally vulnerable, and that the set of scenarios is
implicitly given by a single budget constraint. This paper studies a robustness
model of a different kind. We focus on \textbf{bulk-robustness}, a model
recently introduced~\cite{bulk} for addressing the need to model non-uniform
failure patterns in systems.
  We significantly extend the techniques used in~\cite{bulk} to design
approximation algorithm for bulk-robust network design problems in planar
graphs. Our techniques use an augmentation framework, combined with linear
programming (LP) rounding that depends on a planar embedding of the input
graph. A connection to cut covering problems and the dominating set problem in
circle graphs is established. Our methods use few of the specifics of
bulk-robust optimization, hence it is conceivable that they can be adapted to
solve other robust network design problems.
