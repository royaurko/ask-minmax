We investigate how network structure influences evolutionary games on
networks. We extend the pair approximation to study the effects of degree
fluctuation and clustering of the network. We find that a larger fluctuation of
the degree is equivalent to a larger mobility of the players. In addition, a
larger clustering coefficient is equivalent to a smaller number of neighbors.
