Polysilicon fuses are one time programmable memory elements which allow the
calibration of integrated circuits at wafer and package level. We present a
zero dimensional lumped parameter model of the programming of fuses made from a
combination of tungsten silicide and polycrystalline silicon. The components of
the model are an electrical model, a thermal model and a flow model. The
electrical model describes the temperature and geometry dependent resistance of
the fuse. The thermal model describes the heating and melting of the fuse and
its surroundings. The flow model describes the disconnection of the fuse by
electromigration driven flow of silica. The model generates quantitatively
accurate results and reproduces trends with applied voltage and fuse size.
