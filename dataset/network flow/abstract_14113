We have analyzed the ROSAT HRI image and PSPC spectra of Abell~4059. The most
striking feature of the X-ray image is the two X-ray holes and an orthogonal
X-ray bar in the center of the cluster. It is likely that the radio plasma from
the cD galaxy may have displaced the X-ray gas and created the X-ray holes, or
we may be seeing a rotationally supported disk of the X-ray emitting gas. There
may also be a moderate cooling flow in the center of the cluster,
Mdot=184^{+22}_{-25} Msolar/yr, as suggested by the X-ray surface brightness
profile. However, such a cooling flow is not needed in the spectral fitting of
the PSPC data. It may be that the cooling flow has just begun in the center of
the cluster. In addition, very little intrinsic absorption was found in the
center of the cluster.
