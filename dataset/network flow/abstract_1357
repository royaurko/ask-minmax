In this work, we propose a novel power allocation mechanism which allows one
to optimize the energy-efficiency of base stations operating in the downlink.
The energy-efficiency refers to the amount of bits that can be transmitted by
the base station per unit of energy consumed. This work studies the impact of
flow-level dynamics on the energy efficiency of base stations, by considering
user arrivals and departures. Our proposed power allocation scheme optimizes
the energyefficiency, accounting for the dynamic nature of users (referred to
as the global energy-efficiency). We emphasize our numerical results that study
the influence of the radio conditions, transmit power and the user traffic on
the energy-efficiency in an LTE compliant framework. Finally, we show that the
power allocation scheme that considers traffic dynamics, is significantly
different from the power allocation scheme when the number of users is
considered as constant, and that it has a better performance.
