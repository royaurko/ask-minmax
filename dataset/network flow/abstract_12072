In this paper, we study diagnosabilities of multiprocessor systems under two
diagnosis models: the PMC model and the comparison model. In each model, we
further consider two different diagnosis strategies: the precise diagnosis
strategy proposed by Preparata et al. and the pessimistic diagnosis strategy
proposed by Friedman. The main result of this paper is to determine
diagnosabilities of regular networks with certain conditions, which include
several widely used multiprocessor systems such as variants of hypercubes and
many others.
