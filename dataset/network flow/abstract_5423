This paper suggests a system architecture for wireless widearea- networking
access using adhoc networking between a mobile Client node without direct
connectivity to a wirelesswide- area-network and a mobile Service Provider node
with connectivity to a wireless-wide-area-network. It provides a means for
securely providing such adhoc wireless networking services using a Server for
tunneling and routing, registration and authentication. The architecture also
provides support for handoff of a Client node from one Service Provider to
another with persistence of a tunnel between the Client and the Server enabling
a soft-handoff. Different wireless protocols may be used for adhoc networking,
with filtered interconnection of authenticated Clients implemented at a Service
Provider node. The architecture is applicable across different wide-areanetwork
protocols, and provides simultaneous support for multiple wide-area-network
protocols.
