Today's large-scale enterprise networks, data center networks, and wide area
networks can be decomposed into multiple administrative or geographical
domains. Domains may be owned by different administrative units or
organizations. Hence protecting domain information is an important concern.
Existing general-purpose Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) methods that
preserves privacy for domains are extremely slow for cross-domain routing
problems. In this paper we present PYCRO, a cryptographic protocol specifically
designed for privacy-preserving cross-domain routing optimization in Software
Defined Networking (SDN) environments. PYCRO provides two fundamental routing
functions, policy-compliant shortest path computing and bandwidth allocation,
while ensuring strong protection for the private information of domains. We
rigorously prove the privacy guarantee of our protocol. We have implemented a
prototype system that runs PYCRO on servers in a campus network. Experimental
results using real ISP network topologies show that PYCRO is very efficient in
computation and communication costs.
