Mobile network operators are facing the difficult task of significantly
increasing capacity to meet projected demand while keeping CAPEX and OPEX down.
We argue that infrastructure sharing is a key consideration in operators'
planning of the evolution of their networks, and that such planning can be
viewed as a stage in the cognitive cycle. In this paper, we present a framework
to model this planning process while taking into account both the ability to
share resources and the constraints imposed by competition regulation (the
latter quantified using the Herfindahl index). Using real-world demand and
deployment data, we find that the ability to share infrastructure essentially
moves capacity from rural, sparsely populated areas (where some of the current
infrastructure can be decommissioned) to urban ones (where most of the
next-generation base stations would be deployed), with significant increases in
resource efficiency. Tight competition regulation somewhat limits the ability
to share but does not entirely jeopardize those gains, while having the
secondary effect of encouraging the wider deployment of next-generation
technologies.
