In Stokes flows, symmetry considerations dictate that a neutrally-buoyant
spherical particle will not migrate laterally with respect to the local flow
direction. We show that a loss of symmetry due to flow-induced surfactant
redistribution leads to cross-stream drift of a spherical drop in Poiseuille
flow. We derive analytical expressions for the migration velocity in the limit
of small non-uniformities in the surfactant distribution, corresponding to
weak-flow conditions or a high-viscosity drop. The analysis predicts that the
direction of migration is always towards the flow centerline.
