The frequency allocation problem that appeared in the design of cellular
telephone networks can be regarded as a multicoloring problem on a weighted
hexagonal graph, which opened some still interesting mathematical problems. We
generalize the multicoloring problem into higher dimension and present the
first \jz{approximation} algorithms for multicoloring of so called cannonball
graphs.
