We give a sufficient condition ensuring that the mean curvature flow commutes
with a Riemannian submersion and we use this result to create new examples of
evolution by mean curvature flow. In particular we consider evolution of
pinched submanifolds of the sphere, of the complex projective space, of the
Heisenberg group and the tangent sphere bundle equipped with the Sasaki metric.
