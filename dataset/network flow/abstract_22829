We predict parametrically strong enhancement of the thermoelectric effect in
metallic bilayers consisting of two superconductors separated by a spin-active
interface. The physical mechanism for such an enhancement is directly related
to electron-hole imbalance generated by spin-sensitive quasiparticle scattering
at the interface between superconducting layers. We explicitly evaluate the
thermoelectric currents flowing in the system and demonstrate that they can
reach maximum values comparable to the critical ones for superconductors under
consideration.
