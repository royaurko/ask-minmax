We study the symmetry classes for the random Dirac fermions in 2 dimensions.
We consider $N_f$ species of fermions, coupled by different types of disorder.
We analyse the renormalisation group flow at the order of one loop. At $N_f$
large, the disorder distribution flows to an isotropic distribution and the
effective action is a sigma model.
