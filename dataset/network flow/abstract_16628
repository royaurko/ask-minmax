We use molecular dynamics computer simulations to investigate the relaxation
dynamics of a simple model for a colloidal gel at a low volume fraction. We
find that due to the presence of the open spanning network this dynamics shows
at low temperature a non-trivial dependence on the wave-vector which is very
different from the one observed in dense glass-forming liquids. At high wave
vectors the relaxation is due to the fast cooperative motion of the branches of
the gel network, whereas at low wave vectors the overall rearrangements of the
heterogeneous structure produce the relaxation process.
