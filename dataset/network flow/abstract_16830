In this paper, we have given an idea of area specification and its
corresponding sensing of nodes in a dynamic network. We have applied the
concept of Monte Carlo methods in this respect. We have cited certain
statistical as well as artificial intelligence based techniques for realizing
the position of a node. We have also applied curve fitting concept for node
detection and relative verification.
