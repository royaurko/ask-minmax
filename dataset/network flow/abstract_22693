We explore the effect of curvature-square corrections on Lifshitz solutions
to the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton system. After exhibiting the renormalized
Lifshitz scaling solution to the system with parameterized R^2 corrections, we
turn to a toy model with coupling g(\phi)C_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}^2 and demonstrate
that such a term can both stabilize the dilaton and resolve the Lifshitz
horizon to AdS_2 x R^2. As an example, we construct numerical flows from AdS_4
in the UV to an intermediate Lifshitz region and then to AdS_2 x R^2 in the
deep IR.
