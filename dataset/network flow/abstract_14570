Large-scale particle-in-cell calculations of the plasma wake interactions of
two negatively charged grains smaller than the Debye length are carried out
using the COPTIC code over a wide range of subsonic plasma flow velocities. In
plasmas with temperature ratio $T_e/T_i=100$, it is found that a single grain's
oscillatory wake disappears for flow Mach numbers ($M$) less than approximately
0.3, which is the parameter regime where Landau damping is expected to be
strong. Neutral collisions suppress potential oscillations above $M=0.3$, but
not the trailing attractive potential peak caused by ion focussing. The
transverse (grain-aligning) force on a downstream particle in the wake of
another is obtained rigorously from the code in three-dimensional simulations.
It shows general agreement with the force that would be deduced from the
single-grain wake potential gradient. Except for relatively large grains in the
nonlinear collisional regime, the grain-aligning force is very small for slow
flow.
