Elliptic flow (v_2) of \phi-meson is shown to be a sensitive probe of the
partonic collectivity using A Multi Phase Transport (AMPT) model. Within the
ambit of the AMPT model with partonic interactions (string melting version),
the \phi-meson v_2 at midrapidity is found to have negligible contribution from
hadronic interactions for Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV per nucleon. Changing the
hadron cascade time in the model calculations does not change the \phi-meson
v_2, while it reduces the v_2 of proton at low transverse momentum (pT). These
observations indicate that a substantial reduction in \phi-mesons v_2 as a
function of colliding beam energy would suggest the dominance of hadronic
interactions over partonic interactions.
