We consider a set of flows passing through a set of servers. The injection
rate into each flow is governed by a flow control that increases the injection
rate when all the servers on the flow's path are empty and decreases the
injection rate when some server is congested. We show that if each server's
congestion is governed by the arriving traffic at the server then the system
can *oscillate*. This is in contrast to previous work on flow control where
congestion was modeled as a function of the flow injection rates and the system
was shown to converge to a steady state that maximizes an overall network
utility.
