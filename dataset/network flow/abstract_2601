Our society nowadays is governed by complex networks, examples being the
power grids, telecommunication networks, biological networks, and social
networks. It has become of paramount importance to understand and characterize
the dynamic events (e.g. failures) that might happen in these complex networks.
For this reason, in this paper, we propose two measures to evaluate the
vulnerability of complex networks in two different dynamic multiple failure
scenarios: epidemic-like and cascading failures. Firstly, we present
\emph{epidemic survivability} ($ES$), a new network measure that describes the
vulnerability of each node of a network under a specific epidemic intensity.
Secondly, we propose \emph{cascading survivability} ($CS$), which characterizes
how potentially injurious a node is according to a cascading failure scenario.
Then, we show that by using the distribution of values obtained from $ES$ and
$CS$ it is possible to describe the vulnerability of a given network. We
consider a set of 17 different complex networks to illustrate the suitability
of our proposals. Lastly, results reveal that distinct types of complex
networks might react differently under the same multiple failure scenario.
