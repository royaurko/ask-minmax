We consider a setting where multiple users share multiple channels modeled as
a multi-user multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. The characteristics of each
channel are initially unknown and may differ between the users. Each user can
choose between the channels, but her success depends on the particular channel
as well as on the selections of other users: if two users select the same
channel their messages collide and none of them manages to send any data. Our
setting is fully distributed, so there is no central control and every user
only observes the channel she currently uses. As in many communication systems
such as cognitive radio networks, the users cannot communicate among themselves
so coordination must be achieved without direct communication. We develop
algorithms for learning a stable configuration for the multiple user MAB
problem. We further offer both convergence guarantees and experiments inspired
by real communication networks.
