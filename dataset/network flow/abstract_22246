Multi agent consensus algorithms with update steps based on so-called
balanced asymmetric chains, are analyzed. For such algorithms it is shown that
(i) the set of accumulation points of states is finite, (ii) the asymptotic
unconditional occurrence of single consensus or multiple consensuses is
directly related to the property of absolute infinite flow for the underlying
update chain. The results are applied to well known consensus models.
