We present a stochastic neural automata in which activity fluctuations and
synaptic intensities evolve at different temperature, the latter moving through
a set of stored patterns. The network thus exhibits various retrieval phases,
including one which depicts continuous switching between attractors. The
switching may be either random or more complex, depending on the system
parameters values.
