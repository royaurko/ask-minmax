We demonstrate that the uniqueness of solutions to a broad class of parabolic
geometric evolution equations can be proven via a direct and essentially
classical energy argument which avoids the DeTurck trick entirely. Previously,
we have used a variation of this technique to give an alternative proof and
slight extension to the basic uniqueness result for complete solutions to the
Ricci flow of uniformly bounded curvature. Here we extend this approach to
curvature flows of all orders, including the $L^2$-curvature flow and a class
of quasilinear higher-order flows related to the obstruction tensor. We also
detail its application to the fully nonlinear cross-curvature flow.
