When a solid plate is withdrawn from a liquid bath, a receding contact line
is formed where solid, liquid, and gas meet. Above a critical speed $U_{cr}$, a
stationary contact line can no longer exist and the solid will eventually be
covered completely by a liquid film. Here we show that the bifurcation diagram
of this coating transition changes qualitatively, from discontinuous to
continuous, when decreasing the inclination angle of the plate. We show that
this effect is governed by the presence of capillary waves, illustrating that
the large scale flow strongly effects the maximum speed of dewetting.
