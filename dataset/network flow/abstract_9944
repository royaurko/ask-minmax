We investigate the flow generated by a magnetic stirrer in cylindrical
containers by optical observations, PIV measurements and particle and dye
tracking methods. The tangential flow is that of an ideal vortex outside of a
core, but inside downwelling occur with a strong jet in the very middle. In the
core region dye patterns remain visible over minutes indicating a pure stirring
and mixing property in this region. The results of quantitative measurements
can be described by simple formulas in the investigated region of the stirring
bar's rotation frequency. The tangential flow turns out to be dynamically
similar to that of big atmospheric vortices like dust devils and tornadoes.
