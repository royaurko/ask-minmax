Internet of Things (IoT) will comprise billions of devices that can sense,
communicate, compute and potentially actuate. Data streams coming from these
devices will challenge the traditional approaches to data management and
contribute to the emerging paradigm of big data. This paper discusses emerging
Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, large scale sensor network applications,
federating sensor networks, sensor data and related context capturing
techniques, challenges in cloud-based management, storing, archiving and
processing of sensor data.
