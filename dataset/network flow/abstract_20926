We investigate the unicast problem for ad-hoc networks in the plane using
MIMO techniques. In particular, we use the multi-node beamforming gain and
present a self-synchronizing algorithm for the necessary carrier phase
synchronization. First, we consider $n$ nodes in a grid where the transmission
power per node is restricted to reach the neighboring node. We extend the idea
of multi-hop routing and relay the message by multiple nodes attaining joint
beamforming gain with higher reception range. In each round, the message is
repeated by relay nodes at dedicated positions after a fixed waiting period.
Such simple algorithms can send a message from any node to any other node in
time $\mathcal{O}(\log \log n - \log \lambda)$ and with asymptotical energy
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$, the same energy an optimal multi-hop routing strategy
needs using short hops between source and target. Here, $\lambda$ denotes the
wavelength of the carrier. For $\lambda \in \Theta(1)$ we prove a tight lower
time bound of $\Omega(\log \log n)$. Then, we consider $n$ randomly distributed
nodes in a square of area $n$ and we show for a transmission range of
$\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$ and for a wavelength of $\lambda =
\Omega(\log^{-1/2}n)$ that the unicast problem can be solved in
$\mathcal{O}(\log \log n)$ rounds as well. The corresponding transmission
energy increases to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n} \log n)$. Finally, we present
simulation results visualizing the nature of our algorithms.
