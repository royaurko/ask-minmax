We investigate the decay of vortices in a rotating cylindrical sample of
3He-B, after rotation has been stopped. With decreasing temperature vortex
annihilation slows down as the damping in vortex motion, the mutual friction
dissipation \alpha(T), decreases almost exponentially. Remanent vortices then
survive for increasingly long periods, while they move towards annihilation in
zero applied flow. After a waiting period \Delta t at zero flow, rotation is
reapplied and the remnants evolve to rectilinear vortices. By counting these
lines, we measure at temperatures above the transition to turbulence ~0.6T_c
the number of remnants as a function of \alpha(T) and \Delta t. At temperatures
below the transition to turbulence T \lesssim 0.55 T_c, remnants expanding in
applied flow become unstable and generate in a turbulent burst the equilibrium
number of vortices. Here we measure the onset temperature T_on of turbulence as
a function of \Delta t, applied flow velocity, and length of sample L.
