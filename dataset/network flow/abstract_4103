In this paper we prove a conjecture by Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf in \cite{FIK}
that the gradient shrinking soliton metric they constructed on the tautological
line bundle over $\CP^1$ is the uniform limit of blow-ups of a type I Ricci
flow singularity on a closed manifold. We use this result to show that limits
of blow-ups of Ricci flow singularities on closed four dimensional manifolds do
not necessarily have non-negative Ricci curvature.
