Solution of a problem on the interaction mechanics of a free liquid jet with
a flat plate, body and with other jet has been achieved by means of a
graphic-analytical method, developed by contributor of the given article. This
method has allowed physically adequately and visually to describe the flow
field near the streamlined surface and to give expressions for quantitative
evaluation of the jet pressure profile onto this surface. This method is
equally correct for both a flat jet and a jet with a round cross-section.
Analysis of the flow field has allowed to detect a jet component, induced by
the body fore part in the unrestricted fluid stream and determining the body
form drag. Besides that, it has been ascertained that a friction also induces
the jet component in the potential boundary layer. It has been introduced a new
notion of the stream total head vector, determining an origin of the possible
jet flow in the stream.
