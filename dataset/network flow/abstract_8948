We prove exponential decay of correlations for a class of C^{1+\alpha}
uniformly hyperbolic skew product flows, subject to a uniform nonintegrability
condition. In particular, this establishes exponential decay of correlations
for an open and dense set of geometric Lorenz attractors in a neighborhood of
the classical Lorenz attractor.
