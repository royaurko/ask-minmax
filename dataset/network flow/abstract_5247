Results from a new series of experiments on flows generated by localized
heating in the presence of a background zonal current on the polar beta-plane
are presented. The flow induced by a heater without the background zonal flow
is in the form of a beta-plume. Zonal jets of alternating directions are formed
within the plume. The westward transport velocity in the plume is proportional
to the upwelling velocity above the heater in agreement with linear theory.
When the background flow in the form of the eastward zonal current is present,
the beta-plume can be overwhelmed by the eastward current. The main control
parameters of the experiment are the strength of the heater and strength of the
sink which is used to create the background flow. The regime diagram shows the
area where a beta-plume can exist in the parameter space. The critical value of
the velocity of the zonal flow below which the beta-plume can exist is obtained
by considering barotropic Rossby waves emitted by the baroclinic eddies in the
heated area.
