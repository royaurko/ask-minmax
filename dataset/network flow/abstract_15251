We consider the impact of the elastomer network on the structure and
fluctuations in the isotropic-genesis nematic elastomer, via a phenomenological
model that underscores the role of network compliance. The model contains a
network-mediated nonlocal interaction as well as a new kind of random field,
which reflects the memory of the nematic order present at cross-linking, and
also encodes local anisotropy due to localized polymers. Thus, we predict a
regime of short-ranged oscillatory spatial correlations (both thermal and
glassy) in the nematic alignment trapped into the network.
