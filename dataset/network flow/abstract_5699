We present a model for the growth of the transportation network inside nests
of the social insect subfamily Termitinae (Isoptera, termitidae). These nests
consist of large chambers (nodes) connected by tunnels (edges). The model based
on the empirical nest network description combined with pruning (edge removal)
and a memory effect (preferential growth from the latest added chambers)
successfully predicts emergent nest properties (degree distribution, average
path lengths and backbone link ratios). A sensitivity analysis on the pruning
and memory parameters indicates that Termitinae networks favor fast internal
transportation over efficient defense strategies against ant predators. Our
results provide an example of how complex network organization and efficient
network properties can be generated from simple building rules and local
interactions and contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that come
into play for the formation of termite networks and of biological
transportation networks in general.
