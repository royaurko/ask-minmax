I discuss two examples of time-dependent flow which can be described in terms
of an AdS Schwarzschild black hole via holography. The first example involves
Bjorken hydrodynamics which should be applicable to the formation of the quark
gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions. The second example is the cosmological
evolution of our Universe.
