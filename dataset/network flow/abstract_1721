Transitions in the qualitative behavior of chemical reaction dynamics with a
decrease in molecule number have attracted much attention. Here, a method based
on a Markov process with a tridiagonal transition matrix is applied to the
analysis of this transition in reaction dynamics. The transition to bistability
due to the small-number effect and the mean switching time between the bistable
states are analytically calculated in agreement with numerical simulations. In
addition, a novel transition involving the reversal of the chemical reaction
flow is found in the model under an external flow, and also in a
three-component model. The generality of this transition and its correspondence
to biological phenomena are also discussed.
