We study the statistics and scaling of extreme fluctuations in noisy
task-completion landscapes, such as those emerging in synchronized
distributed-computing networks, or generic causally-constrained queuing
networks, with scale-free topology. In these networks the average size of the
fluctuations becomes finite (synchronized state) and the extreme fluctuations
typically diverge only logarithmically in the large system-size limit ensuring
synchronization in a practical sense. Provided that local fluctuations in the
network are short-tailed, the statistics of the extremes are governed by the
Gumbel distribution. We present large-scale simulation results using the exact
algorithmic rules, supported by mean-field arguments based on a coarse-grained
description.
