In this paper, a multi-source multi-relay cooperative wireless network with
binary modulation and binary network coding is studied. The system model
encompasses: i) a demodulate-and-forward protocol at the relays, where the
received packets are forwarded regardless of their reliability; and ii) a
maximum-likelihood optimum demodulator at the destination, which accounts for
possible demodulations errors at the relays. An asymptotically-tight and
closed-form expression of the end-to-end error probability is derived, which
clearly showcases diversity order and coding gain of each source. Unlike other
papers available in the literature, the proposed framework has three main
distinguishable features: i) it is useful for general network topologies and
arbitrary binary encoding vectors; ii) it shows how network code and two-hop
forwarding protocol affect diversity order and coding gain; and ii) it accounts
for realistic fading channels and demodulation errors at the relays. The
framework provides three main conclusions: i) each source achieves a diversity
order equal to the separation vector of the network code; ii) the coding gain
of each source decreases with the number of mixed packets at the relays; and
iii) if the destination cannot take into account demodulation errors at the
relays, it loses approximately half of the diversity order.
