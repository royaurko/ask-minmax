The inviscid limit of the stochastic Burgers equation is discussed in terms
of the level surfaces of the minimising Hamilton-Jacobi function, the classical
mechanical caustic and the Maxwell set and their algebraic pre-images under the
classical mechanical flow map. The problem is analysed in terms of a reduced
(one dimensional) action function. We demonstrate that the geometry of the
caustic, level surfaces and Maxwell set can change infinitely rapidly causing
turbulent behaviour which is stochastic in nature. The intermittence of this
turbulence is demonstrated in terms of the recurrence of two processes.
