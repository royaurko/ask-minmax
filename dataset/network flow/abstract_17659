Solutions of $(d+1)$-dimensional gravity coupled to a scalar field are
obtained, which holographically realize interface and boundary CFTs. The
solution utilizes a Janus-like $\mathrm{AdS}_d$ slicing ansatz and corresponds
to a deformation of the CFT by a spatially-dependent coupling of a relevant
operator. The BCFT solutions are singular in the bulk, but physical quantities
such as the holographic entanglement entropy can be calculated.
