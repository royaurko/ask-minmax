Video streaming is in high demand by mobile users, as recent studies
indicate. In cellular networks, however, the unreliable wireless channel leads
to two major problems. Poor channel states degrade video quality and interrupt
the playback when a user cannot sufficiently fill its local playout buffer:
buffer underruns occur. In contrast to that, good channel conditions cause
common greedy buffering schemes to pile up very long buffers. Such
over-buffering wastes expensive wireless channel capacity.
  To keep buffering in balance, we employ a novel approach. Assuming that we
can predict data rates, we plan the quality and download time of the video
segments ahead. This anticipatory scheduling avoids buffer underruns by
downloading a large number of segments before a channel outage occurs, without
wasting wireless capacity by excessive buffering. We formalize this approach as
an optimization problem and derive practical heuristics for segmented video
streaming protocols (e.g., HLS or MPEG DASH). Simulation results and testbed
measurements show that our solution essentially eliminates playback
interruptions without significantly decreasing video quality.
