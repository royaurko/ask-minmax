The recognition of optical characters is known to be one of the earliest
applications of Artificial Neural Networks, which partially emulate human
thinking in the domain of artificial intelligence. In this paper, a simplified
neural approach to recognition of optical or visual characters is portrayed and
discussed. The document is expected to serve as a resource for learners and
amateur investigators in pattern recognition, neural networking and related
disciplines.
