In an affiliation network vertices are linked to attributes and two vertices
are declared adjacent whenever they share a common attribute. For example, two
customers of an internet shop are called adjacent if they have purchased the
same or similar items. Assuming that each newly arrived customer is linked
preferentially to already popular items we obtain a preferred attachment model
of an evolving affiliation network. We show that the network has a scale-free
property and establish the asymptotic degree distribution.
