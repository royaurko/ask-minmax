We show in this note that by deterministic packet sampling, the tail of the
distribution of the original flow size can be obtained by rescaling that of the
sampled flow size. To recover information on the flow size distribution lost
through packet sampling, we propose some heuristics based on measurements from
different backbone IP networks. These heuristic arguments allow us to recover
the complete flow size distribution.
