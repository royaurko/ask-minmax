The efficiency of wireless technology depends upon the seamless connectivity
to the user at anywhere any time.Heterogeneous wireless networks are an
integration of different networks with diversified technologies. The most
essential requirement for Seamless vertical handover is that the received
signal strength should always be healthy. Mobile device enabled with multiple
wireless technologies makes it possible to maintain seamless connectivity in
highly dynamic environment.Since the available bandwidth is limited and the
number of users is growing rapidly, it is a real challenge to maintain the
received signal strength in a healthy stage.In this work, the proposed, cost
effective parametric estimation for vertical handover shows that the received
signal strength maintains a healthy level by considering the novel concept.
