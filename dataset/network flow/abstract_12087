Leaf degree keeping process of Gnutella is discussed in this paper. Queue
system based on rules of Gnutella protocol are introduced to modeling this
process. The leaf degree distributions resulted from the queue system and from
our real measurement are compared. The well match of those distributions reveal
that the leaf degree distribution in Gnutella network should not be power law
or power law like as reported before. It is more likely a distribution driven
by certain queue process specified by the protocol.
