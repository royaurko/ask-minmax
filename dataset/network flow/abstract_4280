In this lecture I will present some models of neural networks that have been
developed in the recent years. The aim is to construct neural networks which
work as associative memories. Different attractors of the network will be
identified as different internal representations of different objects. At the
end of the lecture I will present a comparison among the theoretical results
and some of the experiments done on real mammal brains.
