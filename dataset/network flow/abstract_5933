We study the dependence of the largest component in regular networks on the
clustering coefficient, showing that its size changes smoothly without
undergoing a phase transition. We explain this behaviour via an analytical
approach based on the network structure, and provide an exact equation
describing the numerical results. Our work indicates that intrinsic structural
properties always allow the spread of epidemics on regular networks.
