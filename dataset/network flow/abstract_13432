We propose a systematic method to generalize the integrable Rosochatius
deformations for finite dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems to
integrable Rosochatius deformations for infinite dimensional integrable
equations. Infinite number of the integrable Rosochatius deformed higher-order
constrained flows of some soliton hierarchies, which includes the generalized
integrable H$\acute{e}$non-Heiles system, and the integrable Rosochatius
deformations of the KdV hierarchy with self-consistent sources, of the AKNS
hierarchy with self-consistent sources and of the mKdV hierarchy with
self-consistent sources as well as their Lax representations are presented.
