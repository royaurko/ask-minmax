In this paper we investigate a tachyon field model in cosmology, provided its
interaction with the quintessence or phantom fields.The model takes into
account this interaction beyond the usual approach, in which the interaction is
phenomenologically described by the energy flow between the matter components.
In our model, the interaction of tachyon field with a canonical scalar field is
taken into account through the interaction potential in the total Lagrangian of
the system, like in the case of two or more canonical scalar fields. We obtain
the different types of exact solution for the model by employing the so-called
"first order formalism" procedures.
