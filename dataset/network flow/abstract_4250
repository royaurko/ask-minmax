Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are dynamic networks populated by mobile
stations, or mobile nodes (MNs). Specifically, MANETs consist of a collection
of nodes randomly placed in a line (not necessarily straight). Mobile Ad hoc
Networks do appear in many real-world network applications such as a vehicular
Mobile Ad hoc Networks built along a highway in a city environment or people in
a particular location. Mobile Nodes in Mobile Ad hoc Networks are usually
laptops, Personal Digital Assistants or mobile phones. These devices may use
Blue-tooth and/or IEEE 802.11 network interfaces and communicate in a
decentralized manner. Mobility is a key feature of Mobile Ad hoc Networks. Each
node may work as a router and the network can dynamically change with time;
when new nodes can join, and other nodes can leave the network. This paper
presents comparative results that have been carried out via Matrix lab software
simulation. The study investigates the impact of mobile nodes parameters such
as the speed, the arrival rate and the size of mobile nodes in a given area
using Poisson distribution. The results have indicated that mobile nodes
arrival rates may have influence on Mobile Nodes population (as a larger
number) in a location.
