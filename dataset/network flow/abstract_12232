The stucture determination of a neural network for the modelisation of a
system remain the core of the problem. Within this framework, we propose a
pruning algorithm of the network based on the use of the analysis of the
sensitivity of the variance of all the parameters of the network. This
algorithm will be tested on two examples of simulation and its performances
will be compared with three other algorithms of pruning of the literature
