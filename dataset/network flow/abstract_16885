The RTS/CTS handshake mechanism in WLAN is studied using stochastic geometry.
The effect of RTS/CTS is treated as a thinning procedure for a spatially
distributed point process that models the potential transceivers in a WLAN, and
the resulting concurrent transmission processes are described. Exact formulas
for the intensity of the concurrent transmission processes and the mean
interference experienced by a typical receiver are established. The analysis
yields useful results for understanding how the design parameters of RTS/CTS
affect the network interference.
