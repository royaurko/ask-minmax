We examine numerically the three-way relationships among structure, Laplacian
spectra and frequency synchronization dynamics on complex networks. We study
the effects of clustering, degree distribution and a particular type of
coupling asymmetry (input normalization), all of which are known to have
effects on the synchronizability of oscillator networks. We find that these
topological factors produce marked signatures in the Laplacian eigenvalue
distribution and in the localization properties of individual eigenvectors.
Using a set of coordinates based on the Laplacian eigenvectors as a diagnostic
tool for synchronization dynamics, we find that the process of frequency
synchronization can be visualized as a series of quasi-independent transitions
involving different normal modes. Particular features of the partially
synchronized state can be understood in terms of the behavior of particular
modes or groups of modes. For example, there are important partially
synchronized states in which a set of low-lying modes remain unlocked while
those in the main spectral peak are locked. We find therefore that spectra
influence dynamics in ways that go beyond results relating a single threshold
to a single extremal eigenvalue.
