Multi-hop random access networks have received much attention due to their
distributed nature which facilitates deploying many new applications over the
sensor and computer networks. Recently, utility maximization framework is
applied in order to optimize performance of such networks however delay is not
limited and proposed algorithms result in very large transmission delays. In
this paper, we will analyze delay in random access multi-hop networks and solve
the delay-constrained utility maximization problem. We define the network
utility as a combination of rate utility and energy cost functions and solve
the following two problems: 'optimal medium access control with link delay
constraint' and, 'optimal congestion and contention control with end-to-end
delay constraint'. The optimal tradeoff between delay, rate, and energy is
achieved for different values of delay constraint and the scaling factors
between rate and energy. Different distributed solutions will be proposed for
each problem and their performance will be compared in terms of convergence and
complexity.
