Radio Frequency (RF) Energy Harvesting holds a promising future for
generating a small amount of electrical power to drive partial circuits in
wirelessly communicating electronics devices. Reducing power consumption has
become a major challenge in wireless sensor networks. As a vital factor
affecting system cost and lifetime, energy consumption in wireless sensor
networks is an emerging and active research area. This chapter presents a
practical approach for RF Energy harvesting and management of the harvested and
available energy for wireless sensor networks using the Improved Energy
Efficient Ant Based Routing Algorithm (IEEABR) as our proposed algorithm. The
chapter looks at measurement of the RF power density, calculation of the
received power, storage of the harvested power, and management of the power in
wireless sensor networks. The routing uses IEEABR technique for energy
management. Practical and real-time implementations of the RF Energy using
Powercast harvesters and simulations using the energy model of our Libelium
Waspmote to verify the approach were performed. The chapter concludes with
performance analysis of the harvested energy, comparison of IEEABR and other
traditional energy management techniques, while also looking at open research
areas of energy harvesting and management for wireless sensor networks.
