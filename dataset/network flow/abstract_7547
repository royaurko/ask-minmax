In this paper we construct an object which we call the full Brownian web
(FBW) and prove that the collection of all space-time trajectories of a class
of one-dimensional stochastic flows converges weakly, under diffusive
rescaling, to the FBW. The (forward) paths of the FBW include the coalescing
Brownian motions of the ordinary Brownian web along with bifurcating paths.
Convergence of rescaled stochastic flows to the FBW follows from general
characterization and convergence theorems that we present here combined with
earlier results of Piterbarg.
