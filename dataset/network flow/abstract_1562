We observe ripples forming on the surface of a granular powder in a container
submitted from below to a series of brief and distinct shocks. After a few
taps, the pattern turns out to be stable against any further shock of the same
amplitude. We find experimentally that the characteristic wavelength of the
pattern is proportional to the amplitude of the shocks. Starting from
consideration involving Darcy's law for air flow through the porous granulate
and avalanche properties, we build up a semi-quantitative model which fits
satisfactorily the set of experimental observations as well as a couple of
additional experiments.
