The rheological properties of a strongly non-parallel two-dimensional
granular flow is investigated experimentally. Using a combination of
photoelastic and standard tessellation techniques, the strain and stress
tensors are estimated at the grain scale in the time-averaged flow field of an
intruder pulled at constant velocity in a granular assembly. On the one hand,
one observes inhomogeneous shear strain rate and strongly localized shear
stress and pressure fields. On the other hand, a significant dilation rate,
which has the same magnitude than the shear strain rate, is reported. Some
significant deviations are observed with local rheology that justify the need
of searching for a non-local rheology.
