A photon correlation method is introduced for measuring components of the
shear rate tensor in a turbulent soap film. This new scheme, which is also
applicable to three-dimensional flows, is shown to give the same results as
Laser Doppler velocimetry, but with less statistical noise. The technique
yields the mean shear rate s, its standard deviation, and a simple mathematical
transform of the probability density function P(s) of the shear rate itself.
