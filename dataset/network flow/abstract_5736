A correspondence is established between the elements of logic reasoning
systems (knowledge bases, rules, inference and queries) and the hardware and
dynamical operations of neural networks. The correspondence is framed as a
general translation dictionary which, hopefully, will allow to go back and
forth between symbolic and network formulations, a desirable step in
learning-oriented systems and multicomputer networks. In the framework of Horn
clause logics it is found that atomic propositions with n arguments correspond
to nodes with n-th order synapses, rules to synaptic intensity constraints,
forward chaining to synaptic dynamics and queries either to simple node
activation or to a query tensor dynamics.
