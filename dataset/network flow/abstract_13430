We calculate transverse-momentum ($p_t$) spectra and elliptic flow of
$J/\psi$'s in $Au$-$Au$ and $Cu$-$Cu$ collisions at RHIC. We employ an earlier
constructed 2-component approach for direct and regenerated charmonia which is
fairly consistent with the centrality dependence of inclusive $J/\psi$ yields
at SPS and RHIC. Discrepancies with high-$p_t$ data in $Cu$-$Cu$ collisions are
addressed by implementing effects of a finite formation time and an estimate of
$B$ meson feeddown, which largely resolve the problem. The sensitivity of the
spectra to the Cronin effect and different in-medium dissociation rates is
studied. The predicted elliptic flow in semicentral $Au$-$Au$ collisions is
rather small, $\sim$2-3%.
