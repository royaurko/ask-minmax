This paper studies normalized Ricci flow on a nonparabolic surface, whose
scalar curvature is asymptotically -1 in an integral sense. By a method
initiated by R. Hamilton, the flow is shown to converge to a metric of constant
scalar curvature -1. A relative estimate of Green's function is proved as a
tool.
