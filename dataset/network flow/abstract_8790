We prove that a stochastic flow of reflected Brownian motions in a smooth
multidimensional domain is differentiable with respect to its initial position.
The derivative is a linear map represented by a multiplicative functional for
reflected Brownian motion. The method of proof is based on excursion theory and
analysis of the deterministic Skorokhod equation.
