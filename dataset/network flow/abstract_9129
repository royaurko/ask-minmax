Based on the framework of network equivalence theory developed by Koetter et
al., this paper presents scalable capacity upper and lower bounding models for
wireless networks by construction of noiseless networks that can be used to
calculate outer and inner bounds, respectively, for the original networks. A
channel decoupling method is proposed to decompose wireless networks into
point-to-point channels, and (potentially) coupled multiple-access channels
(MACs) and broadcast channels (BCs). The upper bounding model, consisting of
only point-to-point bit-pipes, is constructed by firstly extending the
"one-shot" bounding models developed by Calmon et al. and then integrating them
with network equivalence tools. The lower bounding model, consisting of both
point-to-point and point-to-points bit-pipes, is constructed based on a
two-step update of the one-shot models to incorporate the broadcast nature of
wireless transmission. The main advantages of the proposed methods are their
simplicity and the fact that they can be extended easily to large networks with
a complexity that grows linearly with the number of nodes. It is demonstrated
that the gap between the resulting upper and lower bounds is usually not large,
and they can approach the capacity in some setups.
