The decision process requires information about the present state of the
system, but in economy acquiring data and processing them is an expensive and
time consuming process. Therefore the state of the system is measured and
announced at the end of the well defined time intervals. The model of a stock
market coupled with an economy is investigated and the role of the length of
the time delay of information flow investigated. It is shown that increasing
the time delay leads to collective behavior of agents and oscillations of
autocorrelations in absolute log-returns.
