Numerous studies in the past 40 years have established that turbulent flow
fields are populated by transient coherent structures that represent patches of
fluids moving cohesively for significant distances before they are worn out by
momentum exchange with the surrounding fluid. Two particular well-documented
structures are the hairpin vortices that move longitudinally above the wall and
ejections inclined with respect to the wall that bring the fluid from the
transient viscous layers underneath these vortices into the outer region of the
boundary layer.
  It is proposed that the Karman universal constant in the logarithmic law the
sine of the angle between the transient ejections and the direction normal to
the wall. The edge of the buffer layer is represented by a combination of the
Karman constant and the damping function in the wall layer.
  Computation of this angle from experimental data of velocity distributions in
turbulent shear flows matches published traces of fronts of turbulence obtained
from the time shifts in the peak of the correlation function of the velocity.
