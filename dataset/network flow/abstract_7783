The first part of the paper discusses a second-order quasilinear parabolic
equation in a vector bundle over a compact manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial
M$. We establish a short-time existence theorem for this equation. The second
part of the paper is devoted to the investigation of the Ricci flow on $M$. We
propose a new boundary condition for the flow and prove two short-time
existence results.
