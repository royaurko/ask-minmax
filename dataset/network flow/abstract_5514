Due to the ever rising importance of the network paradigm across several
areas of science, comparing and classifying graphs represent essential steps in
the networks analysis of complex systems. Both tasks have been recently tackled
via quite different strategies, even tailored ad-hoc for the investigated
problem. Here we deal with both operations by introducing the
Hamming-Ipsen-Mikhailov (HIM) distance, a novel metric to quantitatively
measure the difference between two graphs sharing the same vertices. The new
measure combines the local Hamming distance and the global spectral
Ipsen-Mikhailov distance so to overcome the drawbacks affecting the two
components separately. Building then the HIM kernel function derived from the
HIM distance it is possible to move from network comparison to network
classification via the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Applications of
HIM distance and HIM kernel in computational biology and social networks
science demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed functions as a general
purpose solution.
