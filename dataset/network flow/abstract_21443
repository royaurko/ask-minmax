Relativistic outflows, or `Jets', represent one of the most obvious,
important and yet poorly-explained phenomena associated with accreting
relativistic objects, including X-ray binaries. In the past decade we have
observed highly relativistic flows, the resultant in-situ particle acceleration
in the ISM, and begun to unearth the subtleties of the accretion -- outflow
coupling on timescales from seconds to years. In this chapter I shall attempt,
subjectively, to describe the state of research into jets from X-ray binaries
as it stands at the beginning of 2003.
