In this paper, we study the broadcast decoding delay performance of
generalized instantly decodable network coding (G-IDNC) in the lossy feedback
scenario. The problem is formulated as a maximum weight clique problem over the
G-IDNC graph in [1]. In order to further minimize the decoding delay, we
introduce in this paper the lossy G-IDNC graph (LG-IDNC). Whereas the G-IDNC
graph represents only doubtless combinable packets, the LG-IDNC graph
represents also uncertain packet combinations when the expected decoding delay
of the encoded packet is lower than the individual expected decoding delay of
each packet encoded in it. Since the maximum weight clique problem is known to
be NP-hard, we use the heuristic introduced in [2] to discover the maximum
weight clique in the LG-IDNC graph and finally we compare the decoding delay
performance of LG-IDNC and G-IDNC graphs through extensive simulations.
Numerical results show that our new LG-IDNC graph formulation outperforms the
G-IDNC graph formulation in all situations and achieves significant improvement
in the decoding delay especially when the feedback erasure probability is
higher than the packet erasure probability.
