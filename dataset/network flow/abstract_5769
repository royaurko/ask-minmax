We present a novel type of weighted scale-free network model, in which the
weight grows independently of the attachment of new nodes. The evolution of
this network is thus determined not only by the preferential attachment of new
nodes to existing nodes but also by self-growing weight of existing links based
on a simple weight-driven rule. This model is analytically tractable, so that
the various statistical properties, such as the distribution of weight, can be
derived. Finally, we found that some type of social networks is well described
by this model.
