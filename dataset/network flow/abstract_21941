SWITZERLAND Experiments on two cones of different taper ratios have been
performed in the periodic Reynolds number range between 40 and 180. The
visualizations of the plan view of the wake with hydrogen bubbles allow to
determine local instantaneous frequencies, wavelengths and shedding angles from
digital movie. The shedding frequency adjusts in a stepwise manner to the
continuous variation of the cone diameter. Our results lead to revisit the
original work of Gaster.
