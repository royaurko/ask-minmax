We study the fundamental limits on learning latent community structure in
dynamic networks. Specifically, we study dynamic stochastic block models where
nodes change their community membership over time, but where edges are
generated independently at each time step. In this setting (which is a special
case of several existing models), we are able to derive the detectability
threshold exactly, as a function of the rate of change and the strength of the
communities. Below this threshold, we claim that no algorithm can identify the
communities better than chance. We then give two algorithms that are optimal in
the sense that they succeed all the way down to this limit. The first uses
belief propagation (BP), which gives asymptotically optimal accuracy, and the
second is a fast spectral clustering algorithm, based on linearizing the BP
equations. We verify our analytic and algorithmic results via numerical
simulation, and close with a brief discussion of extensions and open questions.
