Bouchet conjectured in 1983 that each signed graph that admits a nowhere-zero
flow has a nowhere-zero 6-flow. We prove that the conjecture is true for all
signed series-parallel graphs. Unlike the unsigned case, the restriction to
series-parallel graphs is nontrivial; in fact, the result is tight for
infinitely many graphs.
