Linear stability analysis of strongly coupled incompressible dusty plasma in
presence of shear flow has been carried out using Generalized
Hydrodynamical(GH) model. With the proper Galilean invariant GH model, a
nonlocal eigenvalue analysis has been done using different velocity profiles.
It is shown that the effect of elasticity enhances the growth rate of shear
flow driven Kelvin- Helmholtz (KH) instability. The interplay between viscosity
and elasticity not only enhances the growth rate but the spatial domain of the
instability is also widened. The growth rate in various parameter space and the
corresponding eigen functions are presented.
