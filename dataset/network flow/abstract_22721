In this paper we investigate the compressible Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard
equations (the so-called NSCH model) derived by Lowengrub and Truskinowsky.
This model describes the flow of a binary compressible mixture; the fluids are
supposed to be macroscopically immiscible, but partial mixing is permitted
leading to narrow transition layers. The internal structure and macroscopic
dynamics of these layers are induced by a Cahn-Hilliard law that the mixing
ratio satisfies. The PDE constitute a strongly coupled hyperbolic-parabolic
system. We establish a local existence and uniqueness result for strong
solutions.
