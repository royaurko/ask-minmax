We introduce and study the first model of an experimentally realizable
three-dimensional time-dependent nonturbulent fluid flow to display the
phenomenon of global diffusion of passive-scalar particles at arbitrarily small
values of the nonintegrable perturbation. This type of chaotic advection,
termed {\it resonance-induced diffusion\/}, is generic for a large class of
flows.
