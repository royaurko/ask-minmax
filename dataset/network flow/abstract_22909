In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm for the Biot problem based on a
Hybrid High-Order discretization of the mechanics and a Symmetric Weighted
Interior Penalty discretization of the flow. The method has several assets,
including, in particular, the support of general polyhedral meshes and
arbitrary space approximation order. Our analysis delivers stability and error
estimates that hold also when the specific storage coefficient vanishes, and
shows that the constants have only a mild dependence on the heterogeneity of
the permeability coefficient. Numerical tests demonstrating the performance of
the method are provided.
