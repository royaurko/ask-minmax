We experimentally characterize the fluctuations of the non-homogeneous
non-isotropic turbulence in an axisymmetric von K\'arm\'an flow. We show that
these fluctuations satisfy relations analogous to classical
Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations (FDRs) in statistical mechanics. We use these
relations to measure statistical temperatures of turbulence. The values of
these temperatures are found to be dependent on the considered observable as
already evidenced in other far from equilibrium systems.
