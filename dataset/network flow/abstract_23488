By employing the adaptive network simulation method, we demonstrate that the
ensemble-averaged stress caused by a local force for packings of frictionless
rigid beads is concentrated along rays whose slope is consistent with unity:
forces propagate along lines at 45 degrees to the horizontal or vertical. This
slope is shown to be independent of polydispersity or the degree to which the
system is sheared. Further confirmation of this result comes from fitting the
components of the stress tensor to the null stress constitutive equation. The
magnitude of the response is also shown to fall off with the -1/2 power of
distance. We argue that our findings are a natural consequence of a system that
preserves its volume under small perturbations.
