This paper gives two results that show that the dynamics of a time-periodic
Lagrangian system on a hyperbolic manifold are at least as complicated as the
geodesic flow of a hyperbolic metric. Given a hyperbolic geodesic in the
Poincar\'e ball, Theorem A asserts that there are minimizers of the lift of
the Lagrangian system that are a bounded distance away and have a variety of
approximate speeds. Theorem B gives the existence of a collection of compact
invariant sets of the Euler-Lagrange flow that are semiconjugate to the
geodesic flow of a hyperbolic metric. These results can be viewed as a
generalization of the Aubry-Mather theory of twist maps and the
Hedlund-Morse-Gromov theory of minimal geodesics on closed surfaces and
hyperbolic manifolds.
