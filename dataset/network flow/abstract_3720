We investigate the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic perturbations in presence
of stochastic noise in rotating shear flows. The particular emphasis is the
flows whose angular velocity decreases but specific angular momentum increases
with increasing radial coordinate. Such flows, however, are Rayleigh stable,
but must be turbulent in order to explain astrophysical observed data and,
hence, reveal a mismatch between the linear theory and
observations/experiments. The mismatch seems to have been resolved, at least in
certain regimes, in presence of weak magnetic field revealing magnetorotational
instability. The present work explores the effects of stochastic noise on such
magnetohydrodynamic flows, in order to resolve the above mismatch generically
for the hot flows. It is found that such stochastically driven flows exhibit
large temporal and spatial autocorrelations and cross-correlations of
perturbation and hence large energy dissipations of perturbation, which
generate instability.
