We consider the Degree-Bounded Survivable Network Design Problem: the
objective is to find a minimum cost subgraph satisfying the given connectivity
requirements as well as the degree bounds on the vertices. If we denote the
upper bound on the degree of a vertex v by b(v), then we present an algorithm
that finds a solution whose cost is at most twice the cost of the optimal
solution while the degree of a degree constrained vertex v is at most 2b(v) +
2. This improves upon the results of Lau and Singh and that of Lau, Naor,
Salavatipour and Singh.
