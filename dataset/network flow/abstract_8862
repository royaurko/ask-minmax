In this paper, we use the distance comparison principle, first been developed
by G. Huisken, to study the spatial curve shortening flow. We have got the
result that if the initial curve is the helix, then the local minimum of the
ratio of the extrinsic and intrinsic distance is non-decreasing. And we have
proved a Grayson type theorem for a variety of spatial curves.
