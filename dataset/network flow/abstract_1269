We consider allcast and multicast flow problems where either all of the nodes
or only a subset of the nodes may be in session. Traffic from each node in the
session has to be sent to every other node in the session. If the session does
not consist of all the nodes, the remaining nodes act as relays. The nodes are
connected by undirected links whose capacities are independent and identically
distributed random variables. We study the asymptotics of the capacity region
(with network coding) in the limit of a large number of nodes, and show that
the normalized sum rate converges to a constant almost surely. We then provide
a decentralized push-pull algorithm that asymptotically achieves this
normalized sum rate without network coding.
