All dynamical systems of biological interest--be they food webs, regulation
of genes, or contacts between healthy and infectious individuals--have complex
network structure. Wigner's semicircular law and Girko's circular law describe
the eigenvalues of systems whose structure is a fully connected network.
However, these laws fail for systems with complex network structure. Here we
show that in these cases the eigenvalues are described by superellipses. We
also develop a new method to analytically estimate the dominant eigenvalue of
complex networks.
