By rearrangements of waveguide arrays with gain and losses one can simulate
transformations among parity-time (PT-) symmetric systems not affecting their
pure real linear spectra. Subject to such transformations, however, the
nonlinear properties of the systems undergo significant changes. On an example
of an array of four waveguides described by the discrete nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation with dissipation and gain, we show that the equivalence
of the underlying linear spectra implies similarity of neither structure nor
stability of the nonlinear modes in the arrays. Even the existence of
one-parametric families of nonlinear modes is not guaranteed by the PT symmetry
of a newly obtained system. Neither the stability is directly related to the PT
symmetry: stable nonlinear modes exist even when the spectrum of the linear
array is not purely real. We use graph representation of PT-symmetric networks
allowing for simple illustration of linearly equivalent networks and indicating
on their possible experimental design.
