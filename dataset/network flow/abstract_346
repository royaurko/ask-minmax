A classical result in undirected wireline networks is the near optimality of
routing (flow) for multiple-unicast traffic (multiple sources communicating
independent messages to multiple destinations): the min cut upper bound is
within a logarithmic factor of the number of sources of the max flow. In this
paper we "extend" the wireline result to the wireless context.
  Our main result is the approximate optimality of a simple layering principle:
{\em local physical-layer schemes combined with global routing}. We use the
{\em reciprocity} of the wireless channel critically in this result. Our formal
result is in the context of channel models for which "good" local schemes, that
achieve the cut-set bound, exist (such as Gaussian MAC and broadcast channels,
broadcast erasure networks, fast fading Gaussian networks).
  Layered architectures, common in the engineering-design of wireless networks,
can have near-optimal performance if the {\em locality} over which
physical-layer schemes should operate is carefully designed. Feedback is shown
to play a critical role in enabling the separation between the physical and the
network layers. The key technical idea is the modeling of a wireless network by
an undirected "polymatroidal" network, for which we establish a max-flow
min-cut approximation theorem.
