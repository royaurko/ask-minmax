We study renormalization group flows in unitary two dimensional sigma models
with asymptotically flat target spaces. Applying an infrared cutoff to the
target space, we use the Zamolodchikov c-theorem to demonstrate that the target
space ADM energy of the UV fixed point is greater than that of the IR fixed
point: spacetime energy decreases under world-sheet RG flow. This result
mirrors the well understood decrease of spacetime Bondi energy in the time
evolution process of tachyon condensation.
