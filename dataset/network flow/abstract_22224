We show that for many strata of Abelian differentials in low genus the sum of
Lyapunov exponents for the Teichmueller geodesic flow is the same for all
Teichmueller curves in that stratum, hence equal to the sum of Lyapunov
exponents for the whole stratum. This behavior is due to the disjointness
property of Teichmueller curves with various geometrically defined divisors on
moduli spaces of curves.
