The dynamo instability is investigated in the limit of infinite magnetic
Prandtl number. In this limit the fluid is assumed to be very viscous so that
the inertial terms can be neglected and the flow is slaved to the forcing. The
forcing consist of an external forcing function that drives the dynamo flow and
the resulting Lorentz force caused by the back reaction of the magnetic field.
The flows under investigation are the Archontis flow, and the ABC flow forced
at two different scales. The investigation covers roughly three orders of
magnitude of the magnetic Reynolds number above onset. All flows show a weak
increase of the averaged magnetic energy as the magnetic Reynolds number is
increased. Most of the magnetic energy is concentrated in flat elongated
structures that produce a Lorentz force with small solenoidal projection so
that the resulting magnetic field configuration was almost force-free. Although
the examined system has zero kinetic Reynolds number at sufficiently large
magnetic Reynolds number the structures are unstable to small scale
fluctuations that result in a chaotic temporal behavior.
