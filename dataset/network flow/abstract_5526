Inspired by experiments on the actin driven propulsion of micrometer sized
beads we develop and study a minimal mechanical model of a two-dimensional
network of stiff elastic filaments grown from the surface of a cylinder.
Starting out from a discrete model of the network structure and of its
microscopic mechanical behavior we derive a macroscopic constitutive law by
homogenization techniques. We calculate the axisymmetric equilibrium state and
study its linear stability depending on the microscopic mechanical properties.
We find that thin networks are linearly stable, whereas thick networks are
unstable. The critical thickness for the change in stability depends on the
ratio of the microscopic elastic constants. The instability is induced by the
increase in the compressive load on the inner network layers as the thickness
of the network increases. The here employed homogenization approach combined
with more elaborate microscopic models can serve as a basis to study the
evolution of polymerizing actin networks and the mechanism of actin driven
motion.
