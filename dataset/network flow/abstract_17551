We derive restrictions on collisional reconnection under the conditions in
near-Earth space. The arguments are based on the precise definition and
estimates of the resistive scale $L_\eta$ at the ion inertial site in
collisionless reconnection, i.e. in the so-called `ion diffusion region' which
is the region of Hall-current flow.
