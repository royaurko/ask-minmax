Turbulent bands are a ubiquitous feature of transition in wall-bounded shear
flows. We show that these are also a robust feature of Waleffe flow -- a shear
flow driven by a sinusoidal body force between stress-free boundaries -- thus
demonstrating that rigid walls are not a prerequisite for band formation.
Exploiting the Fourier dependence of Waleffe forcing, we construct a model flow
that uses only four wavenumbers in the shear direction and yet captures uniform
turbulence, turbulent bands, and spot expansion. The model is simultaneously a
reduction of the full Navier-Stokes equations and an extension of minimal
models of the self-sustaining process of shear turbulence.
