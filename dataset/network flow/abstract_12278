In this article we examine a variety of quantitative models for describing
archaeological networks, with particular emphasis on the maritime networks of
the Aegean Middle Bronze Age. In particular, we discriminate between those
gravitational networks that are most likely (maximum entropy) and most
efficient (best cost/benefit outcomes).
