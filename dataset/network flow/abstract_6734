Rumor source identification in large social networks has received significant
attention lately. Most recent works deal with the scale of the problem by
observing a subset of the nodes in the network, called sensors, to estimate the
source. This paper addresses the problem of locating the source of a rumor in
large social networks where some of these sensor nodes have failed. We estimate
the missing information about the sensors using doubly non-negative (DN) matrix
completion and compressed sensing techniques. This is then used to identify the
actual source by using a maximum likelihood estimator we developed earlier, on
a large data set from Sina Weibo. Results indicate that the estimation
techniques result in almost as good a performance of the ML estimator as for
the network for which complete information is available. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first research work on source identification with
incomplete information in social networks.
