We combine Gromov's amenable localization technique with the Poincar\'{e}
duality to study the traversally generic vector flows on smooth compact
manifolds $X$ with boundary. Such flows generate well-understood
stratifications of $X$ by the trajectories that are tangent to the boundary in
a particular canonical fashion. Specifically, we get lower estimates of the
numbers of connected components of these flow-generated strata of any given
codimension. These universal bounds are basically expressed in terms of the
normed homology of the fundamental groups $\pi_1(D(X))$, where $D(X)$ denotes
the double of $X$. The norm here is the Gromov simplicial semi-norm in
homology. It turns out that some close relatives of the normed spaces
$H_\ast(D(X); \R)$ form obstructions to the existence of $k$-convex traversally
generic vector flows on $X$.
