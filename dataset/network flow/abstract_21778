We deform the contact form by the amount of the Tanaka-Webster curvature on a
closed spherical $CR$ three-manifold. We show that if a contact form evolves
with free torsion and positive Tanaka-Webster curvature as initial data, then a
certain Harnack inequality for the Tanaka-Webster curvature holds.
