We investigate the impact of community structure on information diffusion
with the linear threshold model. Our results demonstrate that modular structure
may have counter-intuitive effects on information diffusion when social
reinforcement is present. We show that strong communities can facilitate global
diffusion by enhancing local, intra-community spreading. Using both analytic
approaches and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the existence of an
optimal network modularity, where global diffusion require the minimal number
of early adopters.
