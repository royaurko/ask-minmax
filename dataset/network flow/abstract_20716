We consider a Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANET) formed by "n" nodes that move
independently at random over a finite square region of the plane. Nodes
exchange data if they are at distance at most "r" within each other, where r>0
is the node transmission radius. The "flooding time" is the number of time
steps required to broadcast a message from a source node to every node of the
network. Flooding time is an important measure of the speed of information
spreading in dynamic networks.
  We derive a nearly-tight upper bound on the flooding time which is a
decreasing function of the maximal "velocity" of the nodes. It turns out that,
when the node velocity is sufficiently high, even if the node transmission
radius "r" is far below the "connectivity threshold", the flooding time does
not asymptotically depend on "r". This implies that flooding can be very fast
even though every "snapshot" (i.e. the static random geometric graph at any
fixed time) of the MANET is fully disconnected. Data reach all nodes quickly
despite these ones use very low transmission power.
  Our result is the first analytical evidence of the fact that high, random
node mobility strongly speed-up information spreading and, at the same time,
let nodes save energy.
