The global structure of the renormalization-group flows of a model with
isotropic and cubic interactions is studied using the massive field theory
directly in three dimensions. The four-loop expansions of the $\bt$-functions
are calculated for arbitrary $N$. The critical dimensionality $N_c=2.89 \pm
0.02$ and the stability matrix eigenvalues estimates obtained on the basis of
the generalized Pad$\acute{\rm e}$-Borel-Leroy resummation technique are shown
to be in a good agreement with those found recently by exploiting the five-loop
$\ve$-expansions.
