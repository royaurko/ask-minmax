In this announcement, we exhibit the second variation of Perelman's $\lambda$
and $\nu$ functionals for the Ricci flow, and investigate the linear stability
of examples. We also define the "central density" of a shrinking Ricci soliton
and compute its values for certain examples in dimension 4. Using these tools,
one can sometimes predict or limit the formation of singularities in the Ricci
flow. In particular, we show that certain Einstein manifolds are unstable for
the Ricci flow in the sense that generic perturbations acquire higher entropy
and thus can never return near the original metric.
