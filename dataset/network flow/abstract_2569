In this paper, subgraphs and complementary graphs are used to analyze the
network synchronizability. Some sharp and attainable bounds are provided for
the eigenratio of the network structural matrix, which characterizes the
network synchronizability, especially when the network's corresponding graph
has cycles, chains, bipartite graphs or product graphs as its subgraphs.
