The dynamics and rheology of suspensions of fluid vesicles or red blood cells
is investigated by a combination of molecular dynamics and mesoscale
hydrodynamics simulations in two dimensions. The vesicle suspension is confined
between two no-slip walls, which are driven externally to generate a shear flow
with shear rate $\dot\gamma$. The flow behavior is studied as a function of
$\dot\gamma$, the volume fraction of vesicles, and the viscosity contrast
between inside and outside fluids. Results are obtained for the encounter and
interactions of two vesicles, the intrinsic viscosity of the suspension, and
the cell-free layer near the walls.
