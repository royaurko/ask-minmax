Now a day ad hoc mobile networks (MANETs) have lots of routing protocols, but
no one can meet maximum performance. Some are good in a small network; some are
suitable in large networks, and some give better performance in location or
global networks. Today modern and innovative applications for health care
environments based on a wireless network are being developed in the commercial
sectors. The emerging wireless networks are rapidly becoming a fundamental part
of every single field of life. Our proposed DEERP framework gives a better
performance as compared to other routing protocol.
