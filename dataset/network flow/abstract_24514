Transmit optimization and resource allocation for wireless cooperative
networks with channel state information (CSI) uncertainty are important but
challenging problems in terms of both the uncertainty modeling and performance
op- timization. In this paper, we establish a generic stochastic coordinated
beamforming (SCB) framework that provides flex- ibility in the channel
uncertainty modeling, while guaranteeing optimality in the transmission
strategies. We adopt a general stochastic model for the CSI uncertainty, which
is applicable for various practical scenarios. The SCB problem turns out to be
a joint chance constrained program (JCCP) and is known to be highly
intractable. In contrast to all the previous algo- rithms for JCCP that can
only find feasible but sub-optimal solutions, we propose a novel stochastic DC
(difference-of-convex) programming algorithm with optimality guarantee, which
can serve as the benchmark for evaluating heuristic and sub-optimal algorithms.
The key observation is that the highly intractable probability constraint can
be equivalently reformulated as a DC constraint. This further enables efficient
algorithms to achieve optimality. Simulation results will illustrate the
convergence, conservativeness, stability and performance gains of the proposed
algorithm.
