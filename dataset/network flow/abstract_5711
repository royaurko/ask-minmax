Development of information technology, especially in the field of computer
network allows the exchange of information faster and more complex and the data
that is exchanged can vary. Security of data on communication in the network is
a major thing. Secure socket layer (SSL) is the solution to the problem, but
further research on the security of the SSL protocol transactions should be
done to determine the extent of SSL can secure the data on the network. When
the computer sends data across the network, the data is transmitted in packets.
Sniffing is a technique of monitoring of every packet traversing the network.
Security threat presented by sniffers is their ability to capture all incoming
and outgoing packets through the network, which includes the passwords,
usernames and other sensitive issues. Packet sniffer captures the data
addressed to other devices, which will then be stored for later analysis later.
Sniffing can also be used by system administrators to monitor the network and
solve problems in the network.
