Increasingly, with the data collected at the LHC we are confronted with the
possible existence of flow in pp collisions. In this work we show that PYTHIA 8
produces flow-like effects in events with multiple hard subcollisions due to
color string formations between final partons from independent hard
scatterings, the so called color reconnection. We present studies of different
identified hadron observables in pp collisions at 7 TeV with the tune 4C.
Studies have been done both for minimum bias and multiplicity intervals in
events with and without color reconnection to isolate the flow-like effect.
