In this paper, we investigate the implementation of a Python code for a
Kalman Filter using the Numpy package. A Kalman Filtering is carried out in two
steps: Prediction and Update. Each step is investigated and coded as a function
with matrix input and output. These different functions are explained and an
example of a Kalman Filter application for the localization of mobile in
wireless networks is given.
