The results of 2D MHD simulations of solar magnetogranulation are used to
analyze the horizontal magnetic fields and the response of the synthesized
Stokes profiles of the FeI 1564.85 nm line to the magnetic fields. Selected
1.5-h series of the 2D MHD models reproduces a region of the network fields
with their immediate surrounding on the solar surface with the unsigned
magnetic flux density of 192 G. According to the magnetic field distribution
obtained, the most probable absolute strength of the horizontal magnetic field
at an optical depth of tau_5 = 1 (tau_5 denotes tau at lambda = 500 nm) is 50
G, while the mean value is 244 G. On average, the horizontal magnetic fields
are stronger than the vertical fields to heights of about 400 km in the
photosphere due to their higher density and the larger area they occupy. The
maximum factor by which the horizontal fields are greater is 1.5. Strong
horizontal magnetic flux tubes emerge at the surface as spots with field
strengths of more than 500 G. These are smaller than granules in size, and have
lifetimes of 3.6 min. They form in the photosphere due to the expulsion of
magnetic fields by convective flows coming from deep subphotospheric layers.
The data obtained qualitatively agree with observations with the Hinode space
observatory.
