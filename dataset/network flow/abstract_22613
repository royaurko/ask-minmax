In this paper, we derive UWB version of (i) general best achievable rate for
the relay channel with decode-andforward strategy and (ii) max-flow min-cut
upper bound, such that the UWB relay channel can be studied considering the
obtained lower and upper bounds. Then, we show that by appropriately choosing
the noise correlation coefficients, our new upper bound coincides with the
lower bound in special cases of degraded and reversely degraded UWB relay
channels. Finally, some numerical results are illustrated.
