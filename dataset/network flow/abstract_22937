The radio source Hercules A resides at the center of a cooling flow cluster
of galaxies at redshift z = 0.154. A Chandra X-ray image reveals a shock front
in the intracluster medium (ICM) surrounding the radio source, about 160 kpc
from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) that hosts it. The shock has a Mach
number of 1.65, making it the strongest of the cluster-scale shocks driven by
an AGN outburst found so far. The age of the outburst ~5.9e7 y, its energy
about 3e61 erg and its mean power ~1.6e46 erg/s. As for the other large AGN
outbursts in cooling flow clusters, this outburst overwhelms radiative losses
from the ICM of the Hercules A cluster by a factor of ~100. It adds to the case
that AGN outbursts are a significant source of preheating for the ICM. Unless
the mechanical efficiency of the AGN in Hercules A exceeds 10%, the central
black hole must have grown by more than 1.7e8 Msun to power this one outburst.
