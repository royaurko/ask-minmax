We consider a scenario where multiple event-based systems use a wireless
network to communicate with their respective controllers. These systems use a
contention resolution mechanism (CRM) to arbitrate access to the network. We
present a Markov model for the network interactions between the event-based
systems. Using this model, we obtain an analytical expression for the
reliability, or the probability of successfully transmitting a packet, in this
network. There are two important aspects to our model. Firstly, our model
captures the joint interactions of the event-triggering policy and the CRM.
This is required because event-triggering policies typically adapt to the CRM
outcome. Secondly, the model is obtained by decoupling interactions between the
different systems in the network, drawing inspiration from Bianchi's analysis
of IEEE 802.11. This is required because the network interactions introduce a
correlation between the system variables. We present Monte-Carlo simulations
that validate our model under various network configurations, and verify our
performance analysis as well.
