A few of evolving models in hypernetworks have been proposed based on uniform
growth. In order to better depict the growth mechanism and competitive aspect
of real hypernetworks, we propose a model in term of the non-uniform growth.
Besides hyperdegrees, the other two important factors are introduced to
underlie preferential attachment. One dimension is the brand effect and the
other is the competitiveness. Our model can accurately describe the evolution
of real hypernetworks. The paper analyzes the model and calculates the
stationary average hyperdegree distribution of the hypernetwork by using
Poisson process theory and a continuous technique. We also address the limit in
which this model has a condensation. The theoretical analyses agree with
numerical simulations. Our model is universal, in that the standard
preferential attachment, the fitness model in complex networks and scale-free
model in hypernetworks can all be seen as degenerate cases of the model.
