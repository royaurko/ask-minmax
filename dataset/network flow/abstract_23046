We present three dimensional fluid simulation results on the temporal
evolution and nonlinear saturation of the magnetic curvature driven
Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability. The model set of coupled nonlinear equations
evolve the scalar electric field potential $\phi$, plasma density $n$ and the
parallel component of the magnetic vector potential $\psi$. The simulations
have been carried out in two limits, (i) a low resistivity case in which RT is
the only linearly growing mode, and (ii) a high resistivity case where the
drift wave is unstable and for which the magnetic curvature parameter is set to
zero to ensure the absence of the RT growth. Our simulations show nonlinear
stabilization in both these limits. The stabilization mechanism is similar to
that observed in earlier two dimensional simulations, namely the generation of
zonal shear flows which decorrelate the radially extended unstable modes.
However the nature of the saturated nonlinear state in the 3d case differs from
that of 2d in some important ways such as by having significant levels of power
in short scales and by the presence of electromagnetic fluctuations. Though, in
the linear regime the electromagnetic effects reduce the growth rates, in the
nonlinear regime their presence hinders the process of stabilization by
inhibiting the process of zonal flow formation. Thus the parameter regime for
which nonlinear stabilization takes place is considerably reduced in three
dimensions.
