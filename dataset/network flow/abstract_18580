Maintaining connectivity among a group of autonomous agents exploring an area
is very important, as it promotes cooperation between the agents and also helps
message exchanges which are very critical for their mission. Creating an
underlying Ad-hoc Mobile Router Network (AMRoNet) using simple robotic routers
is an approach that facilitates communication between the agents without
restricting their movements. We address the following question in our paper:
How to create an AMRoNet with local information and with minimum number of
routers? We propose two new localized and distributed algorithms 1)
agent-assisted router deployment and 2) a self-spreading for creating AMRoNet.
The algorithms use a greedy deployment strategy for deploying routers
effectively into the area maximizing coverage and a triangular deployment
strategy to connect different connected component of routers from different
base stations. Empirical analysis shows that the proposed algorithms are the
two best localized approaches to create AMRoNets.
