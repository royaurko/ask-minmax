In todays world, Cloud computing has attracted research communities as it
provides services in reduced cost due to virtualizing all the necessary
resources. Even modern business architecture depends upon Cloud computing .As
it is a internet based utility, which provides various services over a network,
it is prone to network based attacks. Hence security in clouds is the most
important in case of cloud computing. Cloud Security concerns the customer to
fully rely on storing data on clouds. That is why Cloud security has attracted
attention of the research community. This paper will discuss securing the data
in clouds by implementing key agreement, encryption and signature
verification/generation with hyperelliptic curve cryptography.
