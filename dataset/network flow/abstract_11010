A procedure to characterize chaotic dynamical systems with concepts of
complex networks is pursued, in which a dynamical system is mapped onto a
network. The nodes represent the regions of space visited by the system, while
edges represent the transitions between these regions. Parameters used to
quantify the properties of complex networks, including those related to higher
order neighborhoods, are used in the analysis. The methodology is tested for
the logistic map, focusing the onset of chaos and chaotic regimes. It is found
that the corresponding networks show distinct features, which are associated to
the particular type of dynamics that have generated them.
