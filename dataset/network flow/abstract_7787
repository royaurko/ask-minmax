We investigate the stability of the steady convective flow in a plane tilted
layer with ideal thermal conductivity of solid boundaries in the presence of
uniform longitudinal temperature gradient. Analytically found the stability
boundary with respect to the long-wave perturbations, find the critical Grashof
number for the most dangerous among them of even spiral perturbation.
