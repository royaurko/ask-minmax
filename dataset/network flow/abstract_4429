In a previous paper we introduced a method called augmented sparse
reconstruction (ASR) that identifies links among nodes of ordinary differential
equation networks, given a small set of observed trajectories with various
initial conditions. The main purpose of that technique was to reconstruct
intracellular protein signaling networks. In this paper we show that a
recursive augmented sparse reconstruction generates artificial networks that
are homologous to a large, reference network, in the sense that kinase
inhibition of several reactions in the network alters the trajectories of a
sizable number of proteins in comparable ways for reference and reconstructed
networks. We show this result using a large in-silico model of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGF-R) driven signaling cascade to generate the data
used in the reconstruction algorithm. The most significant consequence of this
observed homology is that a nearly optimal combinatorial dosage of kinase
inhibitors can be inferred, for many nodes, from the reconstructed network, a
result potentially useful for a variety of applications in personalized
medicine.
