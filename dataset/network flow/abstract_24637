The contributors of (Cho et al., 2014a) have shown that the recently introduced
neural network translation systems suffer from a significant drop in
translation quality when translating long sentences, unlike existing
phrase-based translation systems. In this paper, we propose a way to address
this issue by automatically segmenting an input sentence into phrases that can
be easily translated by the neural network translation model. Once each segment
has been independently translated by the neural machine translation model, the
translated clauses are concatenated to form a final translation. Empirical
results show a significant improvement in translation quality for long
sentences.
