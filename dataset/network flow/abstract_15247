Deployment of sensor network in hostile environment makes it mainly
vulnerable to battery drainage attacks because it is impossible to recharge or
replace the battery power of sensor nodes. Among different types of security
threats, low power sensor nodes are immensely affected by the attacks which
cause random drainage of the energy level of sensors, leading to death of the
nodes. The most dangerous type of attack in this category is sleep deprivation,
where target of the intruder is to maximize the power consumption of sensor
nodes, so that their lifetime is minimized. Most of the existing works on sleep
deprivation attack detection involve a lot of overhead, leading to poor
throughput. The need of the day is to design a model for detecting intrusions
accurately in an energy efficient manner. This paper proposes a hierarchical
framework based on distributed collaborative mechanism for detecting sleep
deprivation torture in wireless sensor network efficiently. Proposed model uses
anomaly detection technique in two steps to reduce the probability of false
intrusion.
