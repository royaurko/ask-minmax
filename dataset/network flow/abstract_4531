It is now well established that the cell is a highly crowded environment.
Yet, the effects of crowding on the dynamics of signaling pathways, gene
regulation networks and metabolic networks are still largely unknown. Crowding
can alter both molecular diffusion and the equilibria of biomolecular
reactions. In this review, we first discuss how diffusion can affect
biochemical networks. Diffusion of transcription factors can increase noise in
gene expression, while diffusion of proteins between intracellular compartments
or between cells can reduce concentration fluctuations. In push-pull networks
diffusion can impede information transmission, while in multi-site protein
modification networks diffusion can qualitatively change the macroscopic
response of the system, such as the loss or emergence of bistability. Moreover,
diffusion can directly change the metabolic flux. We describe how crowding
affects diffusion, and thus how all these phenomena are influenced by crowding.
Yet, a potentially more important effect of crowding on biochemical networks is
mediated via the shift in the equilibria of bimolecular reactions, and we
provide computational evidence that supports this idea. Finally, we discuss how
the effects of crowding can be incorporated in models of biochemical networks.
