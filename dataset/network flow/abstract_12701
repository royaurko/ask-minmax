This paper considers the likely maximum range of space vessels providing the
basis of a mature interstellar transportation network. Using the principle of
sufficiency, it is argued that this range will be less than three parsecs for
the average interstellar vessel. This maximum range provides access from the
Solar System to a large majority of nearby stellar systems, with total travel
distances within the network not excessively greater than actual physical
distance.
