The transverse mass spectra of Omega hyperons and phi mesons measured
recently by STAR Collaboration in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 130 GeV are
described within a hydrodynamic model of the quark gluon plasma expansion and
hadronization. The flow parameters at the plasma hadronization extracted by
fitting these data are used to predict the transverse mass spectra of J/psi and
psi' mesons.
