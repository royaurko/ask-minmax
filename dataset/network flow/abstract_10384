The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is thought to be a powerful source of
turbulence and momentum transport in astrophysical accretion discs, but
obtaining observational evidence of its operation is challenging. Recently,
laboratory experiments of Taylor--Couette flow with externally imposed axial
and azimuthal magnetic fields have revealed the kinematic and dynamic
properties of the MRI close to the instability onset. While good agreement was
found with linear stability analyses, little is known about the transition to
turbulence and transport properties of the MRI. We here report on a numerical
investigation of the MRI with an imposed azimuthal magnetic field. We show that
the laminar Couette flow becomes unstable to a wave rotating in the azimuthal
direction and standing in the axial direction via a supercritical Hopf
bifurcation. Subsequently, the flow features a catastrophic transition to
spatio-temporal defects which is mediated by a subcritical subharmonic Hopf
bifurcation. Our results are in agreement with the PROMISE experiment and
dramatically extend their realisable parameter range. We find that as the
Reynolds number increases defects accumulate and grow into turbulence, yet the
momentum transport scales weakly.
