As cellular operators are suffering from a data explosion problem, and users
are consequently experiencing poor data services, the introduction of
femtocells offers a cost-effective way to mitigate this problem. Femtocells
enable larger network capacity by increasing spatial reuse of the spectrum and
shortening the distance to the users. Existing work has shown that open access
femtocells, which allow unregistered macro users to connect, are efficient in
reducing inter-cell interference and offloading traffic. However, a major
obstacle constraining the potential capability of femtocells and open access is
the lack of incentives for privately-owned femtocells to serve unregistered
users. Hence in this paper, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction
based incentive framework for accessing such selfish femtocells. We consider
two scenarios: One scenario involves a single macro user and another scenario
has multiple macro users. We design auction schemes for both scenarios and show
analytically that our schemes are truthful and have low computational
complexity. Extensive simulations validate these properties and show huge
performance improvement to the macro users.
