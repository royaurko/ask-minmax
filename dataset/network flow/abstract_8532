In this paper, we research the potential of information communication
technologies (ICTs) for changing our society from a commute-centric to a
network-centric environment. We propose to formalize the key attributes of
ICT-based telecommuting experiences from both economic and human interactivity
perspective. We introduce the notion of network-eligible transactions and
disclose the link between degree of network centricity and worker settlement
radius, postulating that media-rich network services have a strong potential to
increase the physical distance between work and home locations. We also
highlight notable technology challenges and opportunities of migration from
location-based to mobile living, signifying the needs for new services and
standards development.
