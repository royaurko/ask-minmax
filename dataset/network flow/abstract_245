Motivated by the recent observation that the ridge decreases with trigger
particle angle ($\phi_s$) relative to the event plane, it is theorized that the
ridge is formed by interplay between jet propagation and medium flow. Such
interplay may produce asymmetry in the ridge azimuthal correlation at a fixed
$\phi_s$. We present an analysis of this asymmetry from STAR data. We found an
asymmetric ridge with maximum asymmetry at $\phi_s\approx45^{\circ}$ concurrent
with a symmetric jet at all $\phi_s$.
