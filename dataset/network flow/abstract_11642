One of the major challenges in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) is to
prolong the lifetime of network. Traditional research work focuses on
minimizing transmit power; however, in the case of short range communication
the consumption power in decoding is significantly larger than transmit power.
This paper investigates the minimization of total power consumption by reducing
the decoding power consumption. For achieving a desired Bit Error Rate (BER),
we introduce some fundamental results on the basis of iterative message-passing
algorithms for Low Density Parity Check Code (LDPC). To reduce energy
dissipation in decoder, LDPC based coded communications between sensors are
considered. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of LDPC at different code
rates and introduce Adaptive Iterative Decoding (AID) by exploiting threshold
on the number of iterations for a certain BER (0.0004). In iterative LDPC
decoding, the total energy consumption of network is reduced by 20 to 25%.
