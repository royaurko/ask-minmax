We report simulations of a continuum model for (apolar, flow aligning) active
fluids in two dimensions. Both free and anchored boundary conditions are
considered, at parallel confining walls that are either static or moving at
fixed relative velocity. We focus on extensile materials and find that steady
shear bands, previously shown to arise ubiquitously in 1D for the active
nematic phase at small (or indeed zero) shear rate, are generally replaced in
2D by more complex flow patterns that can be stationary, oscillatory, or
apparently chaotic. The consequences of these flow patterns for time-averaged
steady-state rheology are examined.
