In this paper, we solve the remaining cases of the boundary Yamabe problem
introduced by Escobar in 1992. Indeed, using the bubbles of Brendle-Chen, which
are an adaptation to manifolds with boundary of the original ones introduced by
Brendle for the study of the Yamabe flow on closed Riemannian manifolds of
dimension greater or equal to 6, and the algebraic topological argument of
Bahri-Coron, we solve the cases left open after the work of Brendle-Chen. Thus
combining our work with the ones of Brendle-Chen and Escobar, we have that the
boundary Yamabe problem is a done deal.
