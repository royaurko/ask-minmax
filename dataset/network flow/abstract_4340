As the number and size of the Network increases, the deficiencies persist,
including network security problems. But there is no shortage of technologies
offered as universal remedy - EIGRP,BGP, OSPF, VoIP, IPv6, IPTV, MPLS, WiFi, to
name a few. There are multiple factors for the current situation. Now a day
during emergent and blossoming stages of network development is no longer
sufficient when the networks are mature and have become everyday tool for
social and business interactions. A new model of network is necessary to find
solutions for today's pressing problems, especially those related to network
security. In this paper out factors leading to current stagnation discusses
critical assumptions behind current networks, how many of them are no longer
valid and have become barriers for implementing real solutions. The paper
concludes by offering new directions for future needs and solving current
challenges.
