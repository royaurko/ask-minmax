Moving Sink (MS) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has appeared as a
blessing because it collects data directly from the nodes where the concept of
relay nodes is becomes obsolete. There are, however, a few challenges to be
taken care of, like data delay tolerance and trajectory of MS which is NP-hard.
In our proposed scheme, we divide the square field in small squares. Middle
point of the partitioned area is the sojourn location of the sink, and nodes
around MS are in its transmission range, which send directly the sensed data in
a delay-tolerant fashion. Two sinks are moving simultaneously; one inside and
having four sojourn locations and other in outer trajectory having twelve
sojourn locations. Introduction of the joint mobility enhances network life and
ultimately throughput. As the MS comes under the NP-hard problem, we convert it
into a geometric problem and define it as, Geometric Sink Movement (GSM). A set
of linear programming equations has also been given in support of GSM which
prolongs network life time.
