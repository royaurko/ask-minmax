In this paper, a novel fine timing algorithm has been tested and developed to
synchronize Ultra-Wideband (UWB) signals with pulse position modulation (PPM).
By applying this algorithm, we evaluate timing algorithms in both data-aided
(DA) and non-data-aided (NDA) modes. Based on correlation operations, our
algorithm remains operational in practical UWB settings. The proposed timing
scheme consists of two complementary floors or steps. The first floor consists
on a coarse synchronization which is founded on the recently proposed
acquisition scheme based on dirty templates (TDT). In the second floor, we
investigate a new fine synchronization algorithm which gives an improved
estimate of timing offset. Simulations confirm performance improvement of our
timing synchronization compared to the original TDT algorithm in terms of mean
square error.
