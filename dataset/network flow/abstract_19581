Dense granular media have a compaction between the random loose and random
close packings. For these dense media the concept of a granular pressure
depending on compaction is not unanimously accepted because they are often in a
"frozen" state which prevents them to explore all their possible microstates, a
necessary condition for defining a pressure and a compressibility
unambiguously. While periodic tapping or cyclic fluidization have already being
used for that exploration, we here suggest that a succession of flowing states
with velocities slowly decreasing down to zero can also be used for that
purpose. And we propose to deduce the pressure in \emph{dense and flowing}
granular media from experiments measuring the thickness of the granular layer
that remains on a rough incline just after the flow has stopped.
