In this paper we apply a heuristic method based on artificial neural networks
in order to trace out the efficient frontier associated to the portfolio
selection problem. We consider a generalization of the standard Markowitz
mean-variance model which includes cardinality and bounding constraints. These
constraints ensure the investment in a given number of different assets and
limit the amount of capital to be invested in each asset. We present some
experimental results obtained with the neural network heuristic and we compare
them to those obtained with three previous heuristic methods.
