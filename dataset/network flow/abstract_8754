Lie symmetry group method is applied to study Newtonian incompressible
fluid's equations flow in turbulent boundary layers. The symmetry group and its
optimal system are given, and group invariant solutions associated to the
symmetries are obtained. Finally the structure of the Lie algebra symmetries is
determined.
