Various biological sensory systems exhibit a response to a relative change of
the stimulus, often referred to as fold-change detection. In the last few years
fold-change detecting mechanisms, based on transcriptional networks, have been
proposed. Here we present fold-change detecting mechanism, based on
protein-protein interactions, consisting of two interacting proteins. This
mechanism, in contrast to previously proposed mechanisms, does not consume
chemical energy and is not subject to transcriptional and translational noise.
We show by analytical and numerical calculations, that the mechanism can have a
fast, precise and efficient response for parameters that are relevant to
eukaryotic cells.
