We study renormalization group flows between six-dimensional superconformal
field theories (SCFTs) using their geometric realizations as singular limits of
F-theory compactified on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds. There are
two general types of flows: One corresponds to giving expectation values to
scalars in the tensor multiplets (tensor branch flow) realized as resolving the
base of the geometry. The other corresponds to giving expectation values to
hypermultiplets (Higgs branch flow) realized as complex structure deformations
of the geometry. To corroborate this physical picture we calculate the change
in the anomaly polynomial for these theories, finding strong evidence for a
flow from a UV fixed point to an IR fixed point. Moreover, we find evidence
against non-trivial dualities for 6D SCFTs. In addition we find non-trivial RG
flows for theories realizing small E8 instantons on ALE spaces.
