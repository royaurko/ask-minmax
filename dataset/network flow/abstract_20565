We characterize the observational properties of the convectively driven
vortex flows recently discovered on the quiet Sun, using magnetograms,
Dopplergrams and images obtained with the 1-m balloon-borne Sunrise telescope.
By visual inspection of time series, we find some 3.1e-3 vortices/(Mm^2 min),
which is a factor of 1.7 larger than previous estimates. The mean duration of
the individual events turns out to be 7.9 min, with a standard deviation of 3.2
min. In addition, we find several events appearing at the same locations along
the duration of the time series (31.6 min). Such recurrent vortices show up in
the proper motion flow field map averaged over the time series. The typical
vertical vorticities are <= 6e-3 1/sec, which corresponds to a period of
rotation of some 35 min. The vortices show a preferred counterclockwise sense
of rotation, which we conjecture may have to do with the preferred vorticity
impinged by the solar differential rotation.
