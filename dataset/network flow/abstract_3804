We draw attention to a clear dichotomy between small-world networks
exhibiting exponential neighborhood growth, and fractal-like networks where
neighborhoods grow according to a power law. This distinction is observed in a
number of real-world networks, and is related to the degree correlations and
geographical constraints. We conclude by pointing out that the status of human
social networks in this dichotomy is far from clear.
