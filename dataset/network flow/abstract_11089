We propose a mechanism that incorporates network coding into TCP with only
minor changes to the protocol stack, thereby allowing incremental deployment.
In our scheme, the source transmits random linear combinations of packets
currently in the congestion window. At the heart of our scheme is a new
interpretation of ACKs - the sink acknowledges every degree of freedom (i.e., a
linear combination that reveals one unit of new information) even if it does
not reveal an original packet immediately. Such ACKs enable a TCP-like
sliding-window approach to network coding. Our scheme has the nice property
that packet losses are essentially masked from the congestion control
algorithm. Our algorithm therefore reacts to packet drops in a smooth manner,
resulting in a novel and effective approach for congestion control over
networks involving lossy links such as wireless links. Our experiments show
that our algorithm achieves higher throughput compared to TCP in the presence
of lossy wireless links. We also establish the soundness and fairness
properties of our algorithm.
