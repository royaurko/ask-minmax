A social network consists of a set of actors and a set of relationships
between them which describe certain patterns of communication. Most current
networks are huge and difficult to analyze and visualize. One of the methods
frequently used is to extract the most important features, namely to create a
certain abstraction, that is the transformation of a large network to a much
smaller one, so the latter is a useful summary of the original one, still
keeping the most important characteristics. In the case of a social network it
can be achieved in two ways. One is to find groups of actors and present only
them and relationships between them. The other is to find actors who play
similar roles and to construct a smaller network in which the connection
between the actors would be replaced with connections between the roles.
Classifying actors by the roles they are playing in the network can help to
understand 'who is who' in a social network. This classification can be very
useful, because it gives us a comprehensive view of the network and helps to
understand how the network is organized, and to predict how it could behave in
the case of certain events (internal or external).
