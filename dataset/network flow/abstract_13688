We discuss collective effects in $pp$--collisions at the LHC energies and
derive an upper bound for the anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$. A
possibility of its verification via comparison with the measurements of $v_2$
is considered. We use an assumption on the relation of the two--particle
correlations with the rotation of the transient state of matter.
