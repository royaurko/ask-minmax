Across the sciences, the statistical analysis of networks is central to the
production of knowledge on relational phenomena. Because of their ability to
model the structural generation of networks, exponential random graph models
are a ubiquitous means of analysis. However, they are limited by an inability
to model networks with valued edges. We solve this problem by introducing a
class of generalized exponential random graph models capable of modeling
networks whose edges are valued, thus greatly expanding the scope of networks
applied researchers can subject to statistical analysis.
