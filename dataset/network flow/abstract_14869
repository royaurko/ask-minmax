Over the past few years much progress has been made in Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) in its ability to accurately simulate the hydrodynamics
associated with a deep-V monohull planing craft. This work has focused on not
only predicting the hydrodynamic forces and moments, but also the complex
multiphase free-surface flow field generated by a deep-V monohull planing boat
at high Froude numbers. One of these state of the art CFD codes is Numerical
Flow Analysis (NFA). NFA provides turnkey capabilities to model breaking waves
around a ship, including both plunging and spilling breaking waves, the
formation of spray, and the entrainment of air. NFA uses a Cartesian-grid
formulation with immersed body and volume-of-fluid methods.
