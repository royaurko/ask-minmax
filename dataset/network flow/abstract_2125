This paper considers Gaussian flows multiplexed in a queueing network. A
single node being a useful but often incomplete setting, we examine more
advanced models. We focus on a (two-node) tandem queue, fed by a large number
of Gaussian inputs. With service rates and buffer sizes at both nodes scaled
appropriately, Schilder's sample-path large-deviations theorem can be applied
to calculate the asymptotics of the overflow probability of the second queue.
More specifically, we derive a lower bound on the exponential decay rate of
this overflow probability and present an explicit condition for the lower bound
to match the exact decay rate. Examples show that this condition holds for a
broad range of frequently used Gaussian inputs. The last part of the paper
concentrates on a model for a single node, equipped with a priority scheduling
policy. We show that the analysis of the tandem queue directly carries over to
this priority queueing system.
