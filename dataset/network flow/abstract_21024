The interaction between three localized vibrational modes is shown to be as
relevant for the lifetimes of localized modes as the interaction involving two
localized and one extended, and one localized and two extended modes. This
contrasts with previous views. I support my arguments by a numerical study of a
strongly disordered linear atomic chain.
