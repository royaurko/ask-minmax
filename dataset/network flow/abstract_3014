In this paper, we study the Ricci flow of solvmanifolds whose Lie algebra has
an abelian ideal of codimension one, by using the bracket flow. We prove that
solutions to the Ricci flow are immortal, the omega-limit of bracket flow
solutions is a single point, and that for any sequence of times there exists a
subsequence in which the Ricci flow converges, in the pointed topology, to a
manifold which is locally isometric to a flat manifold. We give a functional
which is non-increasing along a normalized bracket flow that will allow us to
prove that given a sequence of times, one can extract a subsequence converging
to an algebraic soliton, and to determine which of these limits are flat.
Finally, we use these results to prove that if a Lie group in this class admits
a Riemannian metric of negative sectional curvature, then the curvature of any
Ricci flow solution will become negative in finite time.
