We will justify why the Poisson-commutant of a finite family of pairwise
Poisson-commuting Hamiltonians should be quantized as the commutant of a finite
family of pairwise commuting selfadjoint operators. This will lead to the
notion of decomposable Weyl Calculus. Explicit cases are considered. Comparing
our quantization with the canonical Weyl Calculus leads to the notion of
commutation of quantization and reduction in an operator framework. Examples
involving angular momenta are given.
