On directed} Barabasi-Albert and Small-World networks the
  Ising model with spin S=1, 3/2 and 2 is now studied through Monte Carlo
simulations.
  In this model, the order-disorder phase transition of the order parameter is
well defined on Small-World networks for Ising model with spin S=1. We
calculate the value of the critical temperature T_c for several values of
rewiring probability p of the directed Small-World network. This model on
directed Small-World networks we obtained a second-order phase transition for
p=0.2 and first-order phase transition for p=0.8. The critical exponentes
beta/nu, gamma/nu and
  1/\nu were calculated for p=0.2. On directed Barabasi-Albert we show that no
there is phase transition for Ising model with spin S=1, 3/2 and 2.
