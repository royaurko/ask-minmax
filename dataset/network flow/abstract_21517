Fluid-mediated interactions between particles in a vibrating fluid lead to
both long range attraction and short range repulsion. The resulting patterns
include hexagonally ordered micro-crystallites, time-periodic structures, and
chaotic fluctuating patterns with complex dynamics. A model based on streaming
flow gives a good quantitative account of the attractive part of the
interaction.
