We investigate a model of stratified economic interactions between agents
when the notion of spatial location is introduced. The agents are placed on a
network with near-neighbor connections. Interactions between neighbors can
occur only if the difference in their wealth is less than a threshold value
that defines the width of the economic classes. By employing concepts from
spatiotemporal dynamical systems, three types of patterns can be identified in
the system as parameters are varied: laminar, intermittent and turbulent
states. The transition from the laminar state to the turbulent state is
characterized by the activity of the system, a quantity that measures the
average exchange of wealth over long times. The degree of inequality in the
wealth distribution for different parameter values is characterized by the Gini
Coefficient. High levels of activity are associated to low values of the Gini
coefficient. It is found that the topological properties of the network have
little effect on the activity of the system, but the Gini coefficient increases
when the clustering coefficient of the network is increased.
