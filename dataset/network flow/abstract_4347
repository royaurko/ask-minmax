The Call admission control (CAC) is one of the Radio Resource Management
(RRM) techniques that plays influential role in ensuring the desired Quality of
Service (QoS) to the users and applications in next generation networks. This
paper proposes a fuzzy neural approach for making the call admission control
decision in multi class traffic based Next Generation Wireless Networks (NGWN).
The proposed Fuzzy Neural call admission control (FNCAC) scheme is an
integrated CAC module that combines the linguistic control capabilities of the
fuzzy logic controller and the learning capabilities of the neural networks.
The model is based on recurrent radial basis function networks which have
better learning and adaptability that can be used to develop intelligent system
to handle the incoming traffic in an heterogeneous network environment. The
simulation results are optimistic and indicates that the proposed FNCAC
algorithm performs better than the other two methods and the call blocking
probability is minimal when compared to other two methods.
