Video content delivery over wireless networks is expected to grow drastically
in the coming years. In this paper, we investigate the challenging problem of
video over cognitive radio (CR) networks. Although having high potential, this
problem brings about a new level of technical challenges. After reviewing
related work, we first address the problem of video over infrastructure-based
CR networks, and then extend the problem to video over non-infrastructure-based
ad hoc CR networks. We present formulations of cross-layer optimization
problems as well as effective algorithms to solving the problems. The proposed
algorithms are analyzed with respect to their optimality and validate with
simulations.
