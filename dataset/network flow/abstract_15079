Temporal correlations in the brain are thought to have very dichotomic roles.
On one hand they are ubiquitously present in the healthy brain and are thought
to underlie feature binding during information processing. On the other hand
large scale synchronization is an underlying mechanism of epileptic seizures.
In this paper we show a possible mechanism of transition to pathological
coherence underlying seizure generation. We show that properties of phase
synchronization in the 2-D lattice of non-identical coupled Hindmarsh-Rose
neurons change radically depending on the connectivity structure. We modify the
connectivity using the small world network paradigm and measure properties of
phase synchronization using previously developed measure based on assessment of
the distributions of relative interspike intervals. We show that the phase
synchronization undergoes a dramatic change as a function of locality of
network connections from local coherence strongly dependent on the distance
between two neurons to global coherence exhibiting stronger phase locking and
spanning the whole network.
