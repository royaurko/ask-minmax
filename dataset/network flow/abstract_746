Many complex networks are described by directed links; in such networks, a
link represents, for example, the control of one node over the other node or
unidirectional information flows. Some centrality measures are used to
determine the relative importance of nodes specifically in directed networks.
We analyze such a centrality measure called the influence. The influence
represents the importance of nodes in various dynamics such as synchronization,
evolutionary dynamics, random walk, and social dynamics. We analytically
calculate the influence in various networks, including directed multipartite
networks and a directed version of the Watts-Strogatz small-world network. The
global properties of networks such as hierarchy and position of shortcuts,
rather than local properties of the nodes, such as the degree, are shown to be
the chief determinants of the influence of nodes in many cases. The developed
method is also applicable to the calculation of the PageRank. We also
numerically show that in a coupled oscillator system, the threshold for
entrainment by a pacemaker is low when the pacemaker is placed on influential
nodes. For a type of random network, the analytically derived threshold is
approximately equal to the inverse of the influence. We numerically show that
this relationship also holds true in a random scale-free network and a neural
network.
