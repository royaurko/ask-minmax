This paper presents a wireless message dissemination method designed with no
need to trust other users. This method utilizes modern wireless adaptors
ability to broadcast device name and identification information. Using the
scanning features built into Bluetooth and Wifi, messages can be exchanged via
their device names. This paper outlines a method of interchanging multiple
messages to discoverable and nondiscoverable devices using a user defined
scanning interval method along with a response based system. By selectively
relaying messages each user is in control of their involvement in the ad-hoc
network.
