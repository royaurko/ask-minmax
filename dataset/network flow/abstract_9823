We study the rheology and distribution of interparticle contact lifetimes for
gravity-driven, dense granular flows of non-cohesive particles down an inclined
plane using large-scale, three dimensional, granular dynamics simulations.
Rather than observing a large number of long-lived contacts as might be
expected for dense flows, brief binary collisions predominate. In the hard
particle limit, the rheology conforms to Bagnold scaling, where the shear
stress is quadratic in the strain rate. As the particles are made softer,
however, we find significant deviations from Bagnold rheology; the material
flows more like a viscous fluid. We attribute this change in the collective
rheology of the material to subtle changes in the contact lifetime distribution
involving the increasing lifetime and number of the long-lived contacts in the
softer particle systems.
