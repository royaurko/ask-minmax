In recent years, many researchers have focused on wireless sensor networks
and their applications. To obtain scalability potential in these networks most
of the nodes are categorized as distinct groups named cluster and the node
which is selected as cluster head or Aggregation Node offers the operation of
data collection from other cluster nodes and aggregation and sending it to the
rest of the network. Clustering and data aggregation increase network
scalability and cause that limited resources of the network are used well.
However, these mechanisms also make several breaches in the network, for
example in clustered networks cluster head nodes are considered Desirable and
attractive targets for attackers since reaching their information whether by
physical attack and node capturing or by other attacks, the attacker can obtain
the whole information of corresponding cluster. In this study secure clustering
of the nodes are considered with the approach of reducing energy consumption of
nodes and a protocol is presented that in addition to satisfying Advanced
security needs of wireless sensor networks reduces the amount of energy
consumption by the nodes. Due to network clustering there is scalability
potential in such a network and According to frequent change of cluster head
nodes load distribution is performed in the cluster and eventually increase the
network lifetime.
