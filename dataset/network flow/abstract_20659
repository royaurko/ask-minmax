The recent proliferation of Data Grids and the increasingly common practice
of using resources as distributed data stores provide a convenient environment
for communities of researchers to share, replicate, and manage access to copies
of large datasets. This has led to the question of which replica can be
accessed most efficiently. In such environments, fetching data from one of the
several replica locations requires accurate predictions of end-to-end transfer
times. The answer to this question can depend on many factors, including
physical characteristics of the resources and the load behavior on the CPUs,
networks, and storage devices that are part of the end-to-end data path linking
possible sources and sinks. Our approach combines end-to-end application
throughput observations with network and disk load variations and captures
whole-system performance and variations in load patterns. Our predictions
characterize the effect of load variations of several shared devices (network
and disk) on file transfer times. We develop a suite of univariate and
multivariate predictors that can use multiple data sources to improve the
accuracy of the predictions as well as address Data Grid variations
(availability of data and sporadic nature of transfers). We ran a large set of
data transfer experiments using GridFTP and observed performance predictions
within 15% error for our testbed sites, which is quite promising for a
pragmatic system.
