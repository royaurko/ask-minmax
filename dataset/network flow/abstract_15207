We study an extension of Axelrod's model for social influence, in which
cultural drift is represented as random perturbations, while mass media are
introduced by means of an external field. In this scenario, we investigate how
the modular structure of social networks affects the propagation of mass media
messages across the society. The community structure of social networks is
represented by coupled random networks, in which two random graphs are
connected by intercommunity links. Considering inhomogeneous mass media fields,
we study the conditions for successful message spreading and find a novel phase
diagram in the multidimensional parameter space. These findings show that
social modularity effects are of paramount importance in order to design
successful, cost-effective advertising campaigns.
