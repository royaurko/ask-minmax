The latent position cluster model is a popular model for the statistical
analysis of network data. This approach assumes that there is an underlying
latent space in which the actors follow a finite mixture distribution.
Moreover, actors which are close in this latent space tend to be tied by an
edge. This is an appealing approach since it allows the model to cluster actors
which consequently provides the practitioner with useful qualitative
information. However, exploring the uncertainty in the number of underlying
latent components in the mixture distribution is a very complex task. The
current state-of-the-art is to use an approximate form of BIC for this purpose,
where an approximation of the log-likelihood is used instead of the true
log-likelihood which is unavailable. The main contribution of this paper is to
show that through the use of conjugate prior distributions it is possible to
analytically integrate out almost all of the model parameters, leaving a
posterior distribution which depends on the allocation vector of the mixture
model. A consequence of this is that it is possible to carry out posterior
inference over the number of components in the latent mixture distribution
without using trans-dimensional MCMC algorithms such as reversible jump MCMC.
Moreover, our algorithm allows for more reasonable computation times for larger
networks than the standard methods using the latentnet package (Krivitsky and
Handcock 2008; Krivitsky and Handcock 2013).
