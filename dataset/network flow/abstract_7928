A numerical study of the problem of laminar infinite flow of viscous
incompressible fluid around a rotating circular cylinder at Reynolds number $
50 \le {\rm Re} \le 500 $ and dimensionless rotation rate $ 0 \le \alpha \le 7
$ has been carried out. The parametric map of flow regimes has been
constructed, where two zones of steady and two zones of periodic solutions are
signed out. The dependencies of the drag and lift coefficients on the rotation
rate for $ {\rm Re} = 200 $ are studied in detail. Convergence of the numerical
solution to the known asymptotic solution at large $ \alpha $ is confirmed.
