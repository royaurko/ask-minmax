In this short review, I present some of the recent progresses on the pending
questions of solar physics. These questions let us revisit the solar wind, the
solar dynamo problem, the dynamics of the photosphere and finally have a
glimpse at other solar type stars. Discussing the use of direct numerical
simulations in solar physics, I show that the full numerical calculation of the
flow in a single supergranule would require more electric power than the
luminosity of the sun itself with present computer technology.
