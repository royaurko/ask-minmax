The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model has successfully mimicked the
propagation of such airborne diseases as influenza A (H1N1). Although the SIR
model has recently been studied in a multilayer networks configuration, in
almost all the research the isolation of infected individuals is disregarded.
Hence we focus our study in an epidemic model in a two-layer network, and we
use an isolation parameter to measure the effect of isolating infected
individuals from both layers during an isolation period. We call this process
the Susceptible-Infected-Isolated-Recovered ($SI_IR$) model. The isolation
reduces the transmission of the disease because the time in which infection can
spread is reduced. In this scenario we find that the epidemic threshold
increases with the isolation period and the isolation parameter. When the
isolation period is maximum there is a threshold for the isolation parameter
above which the disease never becomes an epidemic. We also find that epidemic
models, like $SIR$ overestimate the theoretical risk of infection. Finally, our
model may provide a foundation for future research to study the temporal
evolution of the disease calibrating our model with real data.
