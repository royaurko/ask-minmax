The phenomena of liquid bridge formation due to an applied electric field is
investigated. A new solution for the charged catenary is presented which allows
to determine the static and dynamical stability conditions where charged liquid
bridges are possible. The creeping height, the bridge radius and length as well
as the shape of the bridge is calculated showing an asymmetric profile in
agreement with observations. The flow profile is calculated from the Navier
Stokes equation leading to a mean velocity which combines charge transport with
neutral mass flow and which describes recent experiments on water bridges.
