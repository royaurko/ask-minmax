We develop a systematic procedure to approximate generalized free energy in
out of equilibrium stochastic systems. The procedure only requires knowledge of
the averages of macroscopic observables and uses quasi-equilibrium distribution
to this task. As an application we consider model systems in the regime of
diverging relaxation times. We find that geometry of the approximate
generalized free energy changes at the onset of this phenomena.
