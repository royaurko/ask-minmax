We study the gravitational influence of very large scale structures, as
traced by clusters of galaxies, on the Local Group [LG] motion and the large
scale flows. We derive from the distribution of Abell clusters within
$300~$Mpc/h the overdensity field on a 3--D grid of spacing $5~$Mpc/h, then we
solve the Poisson equation for the peculiar potential and finally obtain the
peculiar velocity field. Quite interestingly, from this global solution we: i)
recover within $\sim 10^o$ the direction of the LG motion in the Cosmic
Microwave Background [CMB] frame, ii find that the Great Attractor itself moves
wrt to the CMB frame, iii) derive $\beta_c^{-1} \equiv b_c \Omega_0^{-0.6} =
5.3 \pm 0.20$ from a preliminary comparison with the Mark~II catalog of
peculiar velocities, iv) derive estimates for the bulk flow in spheres which
fairly agree with the level derived from POTENT and the Spiral samples, v) find
that the Lauer \& Postman [L\&P] bulk flow has too a large amplitude to be in
agreement with our results.
