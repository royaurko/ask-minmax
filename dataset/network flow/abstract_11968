Collective sensing by many interacting cells is observed in a variety of
biological systems, and yet a quantitative understanding of how sensory
information is encoded by many cells is still lacking. In this study, we
characterize the calcium dynamics of cocultured monolayers of fibroblast cells
and breast cancer cells in response to external ATP stimuli. We find that gap
junctional communication is suppressed by the presence of cancer cells, similar
in effect to reducing cell density. The ATP-induced calcium dynamics of nearest
neighbor cells are correlated, and the cross-correlation functions depend on
both ATP concentration and the architecture of the multicellular network.
Combining experiments and stochastic modeling, we find that networks with
sparse or defective connectivity have a reduced propensity for calcium
oscillations and exhibit a broader distribution of oscillation frequencies. We
find that cell-to-cell variability makes the conventional model of frequency
encoding ineffective for a large population of communicating cells. Instead,
our results suggest that multicellular networks are organized near a dynamical
critical point which allows cell-to-cell communications to significantly
modulate the collective cellular dynamics.
