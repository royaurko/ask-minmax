Intrusion Detection and/or Prevention Systems (IDPS) represent an important
line of defence against a variety of attacks that can compromise the security
and proper functioning of an enterprise information system. Along with the
widespread evolution of new emerging services, the quantity and impact of
attacks have continuously increased, attackers continuously find
vulnerabilities at various levels, from the network itself to operating system
and applications, exploit them to crack system and services. Network defence
and network monitoring has become an essential component of computer security
to predict and prevent attacks. Unlike traditional Intrusion Detection System
(IDS), Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) have additional
features to secure computer networks. In this paper, we present a detailed
study of how deployment of an IDPS plays a key role in its performance and the
ability to detect and prevent known as well as unknown attacks. We categorize
IDPS based on deployment as Network-based, host-based, and Perimeter-based and
Hybrid. A detailed comparison is shown in this paper and finally we justify our
proposed solution, which deploys agents at host-level to give better
performance in terms of reduced rate of false positives and accurate detection
and prevention.
