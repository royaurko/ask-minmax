Robustness is as important as efficiency in air transportation. All
components in the air traffic system are connected to form an interactive
network. So, a disturbance that occurs in one component, for example, a severe
delay at an airport, can influence the entire network. Delays are easily
propagated between flights through gates, but the propagation can be reduced if
gate assignments are robust against stochastic delays. In this paper, we
analyze gate delays and suggest an approach that involves assigning gates while
making them robust against stochastic delays. We extract an example flight
schedule from data source and generate schedules with increased traffic to
analyze how the compact flight schedules impact the robustness of gate
assignment. Simulation results show that our approach improves the robustness
of gate assignment. Particularly, the robust gate assignment reduces average
duration of gate conflicts by 96.3% and the number of gate conflicts by 96.7%
compared to the baseline assignment. However, the robust gate assignment
results in longer transit time for passengers, and a trade-off between the
robustness of gate assignment and passenger transit time is presented.
