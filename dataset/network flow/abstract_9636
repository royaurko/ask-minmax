This paper presents Merlin, a new framework for managing resources in
software-defined networks. With Merlin, administrators express high-level
policies using programs in a declarative language. The language includes
logical predicates to identify sets of packets, regular expressions to encode
forwarding paths, and arithmetic formulas to specify bandwidth constraints. The
Merlin compiler uses a combination of advanced techniques to translate these
policies into code that can be executed on network elements including a
constraint solver that allocates bandwidth using parameterizable heuristics. To
facilitate dynamic adaptation, Merlin provides mechanisms for delegating
control of sub-policies and for verifying that modifications made to
sub-policies do not violate global constraints. Experiments demonstrate the
expressiveness and scalability of Merlin on real-world topologies and
applications. Overall, Merlin simplifies network administration by providing
high-level abstractions for specifying network policies and scalable
infrastructure for enforcing them.
