We construct and analyze a climate network which represents the
interdependent structure of the climate in different geographical zones and
find that the network responds in a unique way to El-Ni\~{n}o events. Analyzing
the dynamics of the climate network shows that when El-Ni\~{n}o events begin,
the El-Ni\~{n}o basin partially loses its influence on its surroundings. After
typically three months, this influence is restored while the basin loses almost
all dependence on its surroundings and becomes \textit{autonomous}. The
formation of an autonomous basin is the missing link to understand the
seemingly contradicting phenomena of the afore--noticed weakening of the
interdependencies in the climate network during El-Ni\~{n}o and the known
impact of the anomalies inside the El-Ni\~{n}o basin on the global climate
system.
