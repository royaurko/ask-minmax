We consider the effect of caching in wireless networks where fading is the
dominant channel effect. First, we propose a one-hop transmission strategy for
cache-enabled wireless networks, which is based on exploiting multi-user
diversity gain. Then, we derive a closed-form result for throughput scaling of
the proposed scheme in large networks, which reveals the inherent trade-off
between cache memory size and network throughput. Our results show that
substantial throughput improvements are achievable in networks with sources
equipped with large cache size. We also verify our analytical result through
simulations.
