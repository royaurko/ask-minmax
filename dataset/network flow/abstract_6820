We report the results of a study of multiphase flow in porous media. A
Darcy's law for steady multiphase flow was investigated for both binary and
ternary amphiphilic flow. Linear flux-forcing relationships satisfying Onsager
reciprocity were shown to be a good approximation of the simulation data. The
dependence of the relative permeability coefficients on water saturation was
investigated and showed good qualitative agreement with experimental data.
Non-steady state invasion flows were investigated, with particular interest in
the asymptotic residual oil saturation. The addition of surfactant to the
invasive fluid was shown to significantly reduce the residual oil saturation.
