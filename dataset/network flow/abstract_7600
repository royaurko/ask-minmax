We present first results on event-by-event elliptic flow fluctuations in
Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV obtained with the PHOBOS detector. Over the
measured range in centrality, large relative fluctuations of 40--50% are found.
The elliptic flow fluctuations are well described as being proportional to
fluctuations in the shape of the initial collision region, as estimated
event-by-event with the participant eccentricity using Glauber Monte Carlo.
