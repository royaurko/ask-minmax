A classic result due to G.I.Taylor is that a drop placed in a uniform
electric field becomes a prolate or oblate spheroid, which is axisymmetrically
aligned with the applied field. We report an instability and symmetry-breaking
transition to obliquely oriented, steady and unsteady shapes in strong fields.
Our experiments reveal novel droplet behaviors such as tumbling, shape
oscillations, and chaotic dynamics even under creeping flow conditions. A
theoretical model, which includes anisotropy in the polarization relaxation due
to drop asphericity and charge convection due to drop fluidity, elucidates the
interplay of interfacial flow and charging as the source of the rich nonlinear
dynamics.
