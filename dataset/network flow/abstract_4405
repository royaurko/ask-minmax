We develop an approximate analytical technique for evaluating the performance
of multi-hop networks based on beacon-less CSMA/CA as standardised in IEEE
802.15.4, a popular standard for wireless sensor networks. The network
comprises sensor nodes, which generate measurement packets, and relay nodes
which only forward packets. We consider a detailed stochastic process at each
node, and analyse this process taking into account the interaction with
neighbouring nodes via certain unknown variables (e.g., channel sensing rates,
collision probabilities, etc.). By coupling these analyses of the various
nodes, we obtain fixed point equations that can be solved numerically to obtain
the unknown variables, thereby yielding approximations of time average
performance measures, such as packet discard probabilities and average queueing
delays. Different analyses arise for networks with no hidden nodes and networks
with hidden nodes. We apply this approach to the performance analysis of tree
networks rooted at a data sink. Finally, we provide a validation of our
analysis technique against simulations.
