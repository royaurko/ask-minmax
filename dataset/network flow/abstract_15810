Recently the problem of indexing and locating content in peer-to-peer
networks has received much attention. Previous work suggests caching index
entries at intermediate nodes that lie on the paths taken by search queries,
but until now there has been little focus on how to maintain these intermediate
caches. This paper proposes CUP, a new comprehensive architecture for
Controlled Update Propagation in peer-to-peer networks. CUP asynchronously
builds caches of index entries while answering search queries. It then
propagates updates of index entries to maintain these caches. Under unfavorable
conditions, when compared with standard caching based on expiration times, CUP
reduces the average miss latency by as much as a factor of three. Under
favorable conditions, CUP can reduce the average miss latency by more than a
factor of ten.
  CUP refreshes intermediate caches, reduces query latency, and reduces network
load by coalescing bursts of queries for the same item. CUP controls and
confines propagation to updates whose cost is likely to be recovered by
subsequent queries. CUP gives peer-to-peer nodes the flexibility to use their
own incentive-based policies to determine when to receive and when to propagate
updates. Finally, the small propagation overhead incurred by CUP is more than
compensated for by its savings in cache misses.
