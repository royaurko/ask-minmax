The contact structure between hosts has a critical influence on disease
spread. However, most networkbased models used in epidemiology tend to ignore
heterogeneity in the weighting of contacts. This assumption is known to be at
odds with the data for many contact networks (e.g. sexual contact networks) and
to have a strong effect on the predictions of epidemiological models. One of
the reasons why models usually ignore heterogeneity in transmission is that we
currently lack tools to analyze weighted networks, such that most studies rely
on numerical simulations. Here, we present a novel framework to estimate key
epidemiological variables, such as the rate of early epidemic expansion and the
basic reproductive ratio, from joint probability distributions of number of
partners (contacts) and number of interaction events through which contacts are
weighted. This framework also allows for a derivation of the full time course
of epidemic prevalence and contact behaviour which is validated using numerical
simulations. Our framework allows for the incorporation of more realistic
contact networks into epidemiological models, thus improving predictions on the
spread of emerging infectious diseases.
