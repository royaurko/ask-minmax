We address the physical meaning of hydrodynamic approach related with the
coarse graining scale in the frame work of variational formulation. We point
out that the local thermal equilibrium does not necessarily play a critical
role in the description of the collective flow patterns. We further show that
the effect of viscosity is also formulated in the form of the variational
method including fluctuations.
