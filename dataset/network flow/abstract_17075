The paper presents a quality of service aware routing protocol which provides
low latency for high priority packets. Packets are differentiated based on
their priority by applying queuing theory. Low priority packets are transferred
through less energy paths. The sensor nodes interact with the pivot nodes which
in turn communicate with the sink node. This protocol can be applied in
monitoring context aware physical environments for critical applications.
