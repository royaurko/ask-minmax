The parallel dynamics of the asymmetric extremely diluted Ashkin-Teller
neural network is studied using signal-to-noise analysis techniques. Evolution
equations for the order parameters are derived, both at zero and finite
temperature. The retrieval properties of the network are discussed in terms of
the four-spin coupling strength and the temperature. It is shown that the
presence of a four-spin coupling enhances the retrieval quality.
