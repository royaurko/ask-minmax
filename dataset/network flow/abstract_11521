In this paper, we adopt the concept of pheromone to generate a set of static
paths that can reach the performance of global dynamic routing strategy [Phys.
Rev. E 81, 016113(2010)]. In the test stage, pheromone is dropped to the nodes
by packets forwarded by the global dynamic routing strategy. After that, static
paths are generated according to the density of pheromone. The output paths can
greatly improve traffic systems' overall capacity on different network
structures, including scale-free networks, small-world networks and random
graphs. Because the paths are static, the system needs much less computational
resource than the global dynamic routing strategy.
