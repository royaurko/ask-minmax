Traditional network generation models attempt to replicate global structural
properties (degree distribution, average distance, clustering coefficient,
communities, etc.) through synthetic link formation mechanisms such as triadic
closure or preferential attachment. In this work, we study the evolution of a
very big communication network coming from mobile telephony and we analyse the
link formation process. A first study conducted on the standard mechanisms
allows observing that several mechanisms are responsible for the properties
observed in this network. In a second study, we characterize more precisely the
link formation process by searching for correlations between the probability of
creating a new link and some individual properties such as the degree, the
clustering coefficient and the age of the nodes.
