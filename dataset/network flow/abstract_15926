In the wake of the ongoing global financial crisis, interdependencies among
banks have come into focus in trying to assess systemic risk. To date, such
analysis has largely been based on numerical data. By contrast, this study
attempts to gain further insight into bank interconnections by tapping into
financial discussion. Co-mentions of bank names are turned into a network,
which can be visualized and analyzed quantitatively, in order to illustrate
characteristics of individual banks and the network as a whole. The approach
allows for the study of temporal dynamics of the network, to highlight changing
patterns of discussion that reflect real-world events, the current financial
crisis in particular. For instance, it depicts how connections from distressed
banks to other banks and supervisory contributorities have emerged and faded over
time, as well as how global shifts in network structure coincide with severe
crisis episodes. The usage of textual data holds an additional advantage in the
possibility of gaining a more qualitative understanding of an observed
interrelation, through its context. We illustrate our approach using a case
study on Finnish banks and financial institutions. The data set comprises 3.9M
posts from online, financial and business-related discussion, during the years
2004 to 2012. Future research includes analyzing European news articles with a
broader perspective, and a focus on improving semantic description of
relations.
