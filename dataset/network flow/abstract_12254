The recently introduced multifractal network generator (MFNG), has been shown
to provide a simple and flexible tool for creating random graphs with very
diverse features. The MFNG is based on multifractal measures embedded in 2d,
leading also to isolated nodes, whose number is relatively low for realistic
cases, but may become dominant in the limiting case of infinitely large network
sizes. Here we discuss the relation between this effect and the information
dimension for the 1d projection of the link probability measure (LPM), and
argue that the node isolation can be avoided by a simple transformation of the
LPM based on rotation.
