With the advance of the Internet, ordinary users have created multiple
personal accounts on online social networks, and interactions among these
social network users have recently been tagged with location information. In
this work, we observe user interactions across two popular online social
networks, Facebook and Twitter, and analyze which factors lead to retweet/like
interactions for tweets/posts. In addition to the named entities, lexical
errors and expressed sentiments in these data items, we also consider the
impact of shared user locations on user interactions. In particular, we show
that geolocations of users can greatly affect which social network post/tweet
will be liked/ retweeted. We believe that the results of our analysis can help
researchers to understand which social network content will have better
visibility.
