We present the architecture and application of the distributed control in
public cluster, a parallel machine which is open for public access. Following
the nature of public cluster, the integrated distributed control system is
fully accessible through network using a user-friendly web interface. The
system is intended mainly to control the power of each node in a block of
parallel computers provided to certain users. This is especially important to
extend the life-time of related hardwares, and to reduce the whole running and
maintainance costs. The system consists of two parts : the master- and
node-controllers, and both are connected each other through RS-485 interface.
Each node-controller is assigned with a unique address to distinguish each of
them. We also discuss briefly the implementation of the system at the LIPI
Public Cluster.
