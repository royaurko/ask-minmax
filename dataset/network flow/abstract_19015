This paper describes an interference mitigation technique using range
information in a swarm network. This technique utilizes range information to
create interference free communication through a shared common channel. The
performance of this scheme is compared with non-aided methods to quantify the
benefits of using the range information in the communication. We argue that the
proposed techniques yield significant benefits as the number of nodes
increases. We provide simulation results in support of the claim. Proposed
methods indicate that the throughput can be increased on average by 3-8 times
for typical swarm configurations. The performance gain of the proposed methods
increases as the dimension of the network increases.
