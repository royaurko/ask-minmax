This paper studies the network throughput and transport delay of a multihop
wireless random access network based on a Markov renewal model of packet
transportation. We show that the distribution of the source-to-destination (SD)
distance plays a critical role in characterizing network performance. We
establish necessary and sufficient condition on the SD distance for scalable
network throughput, and address the optimal rate allocation issue with fairness
and the QoS requirements taken into consideration. In respect to the end-to-end
performance, the transport delay is explored in this paper along with network
throughput. We characterize the transport delay by relating it to nodal
queueing behavior and the SD-distance distribution; the former is a local
property while the latter is a global property. In addition, we apply the large
deviation theory to derive the tail distribution of transport delay. To put our
theory into practical network operation, several traffic scaling laws are
provided to demonstrate how network scalability can be achieved by localizing
the traffic pattern, and a leaky bucket scheme at the network access is
proposed for traffic shaping and flow control.
