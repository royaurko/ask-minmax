In cognitive radio networks, channel aggregation (CA) and channel
fragmentation (CF) techniques have been proposed to enhance the spectrum
utilization. While most of the literature studies CA and CF independently, in
this paper we combine CA and CF innovatively and present a new spectrum sharing
strategy named CAF (Channel Aggregation and Fragmentation). We elaborate on the
proposed CAF strategy and derive the balance equation by a continuous time
Markov chain (CTMC) model. Then various system performance metrics including
blocking probability, dropping probability, spectrum utilization and throughput
of the secondary network are evaluated. Both analytical and simulation results
show that our strategy lowers the blocking and dropping probabilities and
enhances the spectrum utilization and throughput effectively. Moreover, by
tuning the bandwidth requirement of each secondary user, different system
performance can be achieved.
