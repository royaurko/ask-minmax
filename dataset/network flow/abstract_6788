It is well known that the rotating inviscid accretion flows with adequate
injection parameters around black holes could form shock waves close to the
black holes, after the flow passes through the outer sonic point and can be
virtually stopped by the centrifugal force.
  We examine numerically such shock waves in 1D and 2D accretion flows, taking
account of cooling and heating of the gas and radiation transport.
  The numerical results show that the shock location shifts outward compared
with that in the adiabatic solutions and that the more rarefied ambient density
leads to the more outward shock location.
  In the 2D-flow, we find an intermediate frequency QPO behavior of the shock
location as is observed in the black hole candidate
  GRS 1915+105.
