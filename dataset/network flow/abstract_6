The present work studies a kind of Maximum Concurrent Flow Problem, called as
Extended Maximum Concurrent Flow Problem with Saturated Capacity. Our major
contributions are as follows: (A) Propose the definition of Extensive Maximum
Concurrent Flow Problem with Saturated Capacity and prove its solutions exist.
(B) Design a approximation algorithm to solve the problem. (C) Propose and
prove the complexity and the approximation measures of the algorithm we design.
