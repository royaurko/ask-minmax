We present high angular resolution (12"-24") and high sensitivity 12CO and
13CO J=2-1 and J=1-0 observations of the HH 1-2 outflow. The observations show
the molecular counterpart, moving with a velocity of approx. 30 km/s, of the
optical bipolar system driven by the VLA 1 embedded source. Along the optical
jet there are certain regions where the molecular gas reaches deprojected
velocities of 100-200 km/s, and that we interpret as the molecular jet. The
bipolar CO outflow has a length of approx. 260" with a curved morphology
towards the North where it extends beyond the HH 1 object (approx. 120") .
  Two new molecular outflows have been detected, one arising from IRAS
05339-0647 which excites the HH 147 optical flow and another powered by VLA 2
which drives the HH 144 optical outflow. The molecular outflow driven by the
VLA 3 source is also clearly detected and spatially resolved from the VLA 1
main outflow.
