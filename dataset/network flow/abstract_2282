We extend the concept of expansive measure \cite{am} defined for
homeomorphism to flows. We obtain some properties for such measures including
abscense of singularities in the support, aperiodicity, expansivity with
respect to time-$T$ maps, invariance under flow-equivalence, negligibleness of
orbits, characterization of expansive measures for expansive flows and
naturallity under suspensions. As an application we obtain a new proof of the
well known fact that there are no continuous expansive flows on surfaces (e.g.
\cite{hs}).
