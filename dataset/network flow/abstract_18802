I present a study of high-resolution time series of Ca II H images and Fe I
630.15 nm spectra taken with the Solar Optical Telescope on the Hinode
spacecraft. There is excellent correspondence between the Ca II H and Fe I line
core intensity, except tenuous emission around the network field concentrations
in the former that is absent in the latter. Analysis of on-disk observations
and a comparison with limb observations suggests that this "network haze"
corresponds to spicules, and likely to type-II spicules in particular. They are
known to appear in emission in on-disk broadband Ca II H diagnostics and the
network haze is strongest in those areas where features similar to type-II
spicules are produced in simulations.
