Coordination games describe social or economic interactions in which the
adoption of a common strategy has a higher payoff. They are classically used to
model the spread of conventions, behaviors, and technologies in societies. Here
we consider a two-strategies coordination game played asynchronously between
the nodes of a network. Agents behave according to a noisy best-response
dynamics.
  It is known that noise removes the degeneracy among equilibria: In the long
run, the ``risk-dominant'' behavior spreads throughout the network. Here we
consider the problem of computing the typical time scale for the spread of this
behavior. In particular, we study its dependence on the network structure and
derive a dichotomy between highly-connected, non-local graphs that show slow
convergence, and poorly connected, low dimensional graphs that show fast
convergence.
