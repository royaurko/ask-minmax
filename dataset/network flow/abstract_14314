If a quark-gluon plasma is formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, there
may or may not be a mixed phase of quarks, gluons and hadronic clusters when
the critical temperature is reached in the expansion of the fireball. If there
is a temperature gradient in the fireball, the hadronic clusters, embedded in
the heat bath of quarks and gluons, are subjected to a thermophoretic force. It
is shown that even for small temperature gradients and short lifetimes of the
mixed phase, thermophoresis would lead to a flow essentially stronger than the
observed one. The absence of this strong flow provides support for a rapid or
sudden hadronization mechanism without a mixed phase.
