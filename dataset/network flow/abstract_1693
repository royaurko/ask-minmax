A constant-rate encoder--decoder pair is presented for a fairly large family
of two-dimensional (2-D) constraints. Encoding and decoding is done in a
row-by-row manner, and is sliding-block decodable.
  Essentially, the 2-D constraint is turned into a set of independent and
relatively simple one-dimensional (1-D) constraints; this is done by dividing
the array into fixed-width vertical strips. Each row in the strip is seen as a
symbol, and a graph presentation of the respective 1-D constraint is
constructed. The maxentropic stationary Markov chain on this graph is next
considered: a perturbed version of the corresponding probability distribution
on the edges of the graph is used in order to build an encoder which operates
in parallel on the strips. This perturbation is found by means of a network
flow, with upper and lower bounds on the flow through the edges.
  A key part of the encoder is an enumerative coder for constant-weight binary
words. A fast realization of this coder is shown, using floating-point
arithmetic.
