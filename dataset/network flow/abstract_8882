This demo paper introduces young students to writing code in a touch enabled
interactive maze game. Problem-based learning is given a gamified approach to
learning, while simultaneously introducing the TouchDevelop platform to build
basic first control flow algorithms and to learn about ordering and loops in
conditional statements.
