In this work we introduce hierarchy in wireless networks that can be modeled
by a decentralized multiple access channel and for which energy-efficiency is
the main performance index. In these networks users are free to choose their
power control strategy to selfishly maximize their energy-efficiency.
Specifically, we introduce hierarchy in two different ways: 1. Assuming
single-user decoding at the receiver, we investigate a Stackelberg formulation
of the game where one user is the leader whereas the other users are assumed to
be able to react to the leader's decisions; 2. Assuming neither leader nor
followers among the users, we introduce hierarchy by assuming successive
interference cancellation at the receiver. It is shown that introducing a
certain degree of hierarchy in non-cooperative power control games not only
improves the individual energy efficiency of all the users but can also be a
way of insuring the existence of a non-saturated equilibrium and reaching a
desired trade-off between the global network performance at the equilibrium and
the requested amount of signaling. In this respect, the way of measuring the
global performance of an energy-efficient network is shown to be a critical
issue.
