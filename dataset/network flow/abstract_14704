Ring-like ripples on the surface of icicles are an example of morphological
instability of the ice-water interface during ice growth under supercooled
water film flow. The surface of icicles is typically covered with ripples of
about 1 cm in wavelength, and the wavelength appears to be almost independent
of external temperature, icicle radius, and volumetric water flow rate. One
side of the water layer consists of the water-air surface and growing ice is
the other. This is one of the more complicated moving phase boundary problems
with two interfaces. A recent theoretical work [K. Ueno, Phys. Rev. E 68,
(2003) 021603] to address the underlying instability that produces ripples is
based on the assumption of the absence of airflow around icicles. In this
paper, we extend the previous theoretical framework to include a natural
convection airflow ahead of the water-air surface and consider whether the
effect of natural convection airflow on the wavelength of ripples produced on
an ice surface is essential or not.
