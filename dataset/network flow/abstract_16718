In recent work, Jon Kleinberg considered a small-world network model
consisting of a d-dimensional lattice augmented with shortcuts. The probability
of a shortcut being present between two points decays as a power of the
distance between them. Kleinberg studied the efficiency of greedy routing
depending on the value of the power. The results were extended to a continuum
model by Franceschetti and Meester. In our work, we extend the result to more
realistic models constructed from a Poisson point process, wherein each point
is connected to all its neighbours within some fixed radius, as well as
possessing random shortcuts to more distant nodes as described above.
