Advanced vehicle content distribution system (ACDS)is complemented by
improved network connectivity with Mobile Network 3G, 4G network. Advanced
content distribution system uses Access Points deployed along roadside. APs
co-ordinate and collaborate to distribute content to vehicles in mobility. The
infrastructure of deployed APs solves real time issues like predicting errors
in movement, limited information shared to vehicles on movement due to limited
resources. The advances vehicle content distribution system structures APs in
to form a map which is considering the vehicle contact pattern which is
analyzed by APs. The system is more effective by optimizing the network
consumption by sharing prefectched data between APs. The process depends on APs
storage, bandwidth and load on the origin APs which is connected to internet.
With the features Advanced System to distribute the content the system takes
care of improving road safety, delivery accuracy and important content
distribution.
