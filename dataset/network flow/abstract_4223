Boolean threshold networks have recently been proposed as useful tools to
model the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks, and have been successfully
applied to describe the cell cycles of \textit{S. cerevisiae} and \textit{S.
pombe}. Threshold networks assume that gene regulation processes are additive.
This, however, contrasts with the mechanism proposed by S. Kauffman in which
each of the logic functions must be carefully constructed to accurately take
into account the combinatorial nature of gene regulation. While Kauffman
Boolean networks have been extensively studied and proved to have the necessary
properties required for modeling the fundamental characteristics of genetic
regulatory networks, not much is known about the essential properties of
threshold networks. Here we study the dynamical properties of these networks
with different connectivities, activator-repressor proportions,
activator-repressor strengths and different thresholds. Special attention is
paid to the way in which the threshold value affects the dynamical regime in
which the network operates and the structure of the attractor landscape. We
find that only for a very restricted set of parameters, these networks show
dynamical properties consistent with what is observed in biological systems.
The virtues of these properties and the possible problems related with the
restrictions are discussed and related to earlier work that uses these kind of
models.
