We review and discuss the equations governing the distribution of work done
on a system which is driven out of equilibrium by external manipulation, as
well as those governing the entropy flow to a reservoir in a nonequilibrium
system. We take advantage of these equations to investigate the path phase
transition in a manipulated mean-field Ising model and the large-deviation
function for the heat flow in the asymmetric exclusion process with
periodically varying transition probabilities.
