Using a micro particle imaging velocity technique, we resolve for the first
time the three dimensionnal structure of wormlike shear banding flows in
straight microchannels. The study revealed two effects, which should be generic
for shear banding flows: the first is a strong amplification of the confinement
induced by the edge of the channel, the second is an instability of the
interface between the shear bands. A detailed quantitative comparison of our
experimental measurements with a theoretical study of the diffusive Johnson
Segalman model leads to excellent agreement. Our study clarifies the nature of
shear banding flow instabilities, and shows that, despite the challenging
complexity of the situation and the uncertainty regarding their molecular
structure, shear banding flows in confined geometries are amenable to
quantitative modelling, a feature that opens pathways to their practical
utilization.
