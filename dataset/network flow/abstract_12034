We study the friction of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) rubber network
sliding, at low velocity, on a substrate on which PDMS chains are end-tethered.
We thus clearly evidence the contribution to friction of the pull-out mechanism
of chain-ends that penetrate into the network. This interfacial dissipative
process is systematically investigated by probing the velocity dependence of
the friction stress and its variations with the grafting density and molecular
weight of the tethered chains. This allows us to confirm semi-quantitatively
the picture of arm retraction relaxation of the grafted chains proposed in
models of slippage at a network/brush interface.
