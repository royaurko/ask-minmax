Nowadays efficient usage of high-tech security tools and appliances is
considered as an important criterion for security improvement of computer
networks. Based on this assumption, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
(IDPS) have key role for applying the defense in depth strategy. In this
situation, by increasing network bandwidth in addition to increasing number of
threats, Network-based IDPSes have been faced with performance challenge for
processing of huge traffic in the networks. A general solution for this
bottleneck is exploitation of efficient hardware architectures for performance
improvement of IDPS. In this paper a framework for analysis and performance
evaluation of application specific instruction set processors is presented for
usage in application of attack detection in Networkbased Intrusion Detection
Systems(NIDS). By running this framework as a security application on V850,
OR1K, MIPS32, ARM7TDMI and PowerPC32 microprocessors, their performance has
been evaluated and analyzed. For performance improvement, the compiler
optimization levels are employed and at the end; base on O2 optimization level
a new combination of optimization flags is presented. The experiments show that
the framework results 18.10% performance improvements for pattern matching on
ARM7TDMI microprocessors.
