In this contribution we present the first formulation of a heterogeneous
multiscale method for an incompressible immiscible two-phase flow system with
degenerate permeabilities. The method is in a general formulation which
includes oversampling. We do not specify the discretization of the derived
macroscopic equation, but we give two examples of possible realizations,
suggesting a finite element solver for the fine scale and a vertex centered
finite volume method for the effective coarse scale equations. Assuming
periodicity, we show that the method is equivalent to a discretization of the
homogenized equation. We provide an a-posteriori estimate for the error between
the homogenized solutions of the pressure and saturation equations and the
corresponding HMM approximations. The error estimate is based on the results
recently achieved in [C. Canc{\`e}s, I. S. Pop, and M. Vohral\'{\i}k. An a
posteriori error estimate for vertex-centered finite volume discretizations of
immiscible incompressible two-phase flow. Math. Comp., 2014].
