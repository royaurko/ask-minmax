Measurements of anisotropic flow in heavy-ion collisions provide insight into
the early stage of the system's evolution. This proceedings presents directed
and elliptic flow for Au+Au collisions at 39, 11.5 and 7.7 GeV, and for Cu+Cu
at 22.4 GeV, measured in the STAR Experiment at RHIC. Differential measurements
of directed and elliptic flow of charged particles as a function of centrality,
transverse momentum and pseudorapidity are discussed.
