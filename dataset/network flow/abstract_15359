Force-directed layout algorithms produce graph drawings by resolving a system
of emulated physical forces. We present techniques for using social gravity as
an additional force in force-directed layouts, together with a scaling
technique, to produce drawings of trees and forests, as well as more complex
social networks. Social gravity assigns mass to vertices in proportion to their
network centrality, which allows vertices that are more graph-theoretically
central to be visualized in physically central locations. Scaling varies the
gravitational force throughout the simulation, and reduces crossings relative
to unscaled gravity. In addition to providing this algorithmic framework, we
apply our algorithms to social networks produced by Mark Lombardi, and we show
how social gravity can be incorporated into force-directed Lombardi-style
drawings.
