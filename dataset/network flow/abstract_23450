We study the behavior of fracture in disordered systems close to the
breakdown point. We simulate numerically both scalar (resistor network) and
vectorial (spring network) models with threshold disorder, driven at constant
current and stress rate respectively. We analyze the scaling of the
susceptibility and the cluster size close to the breakdown. We observe
avalanche behavior and clustering of the cracks. We find that the scaling
exponents are consistent with those found close to a mean-field spinodal and
present analogies between the coalescence of microfractures and the coalescence
of droplets in a metastable magnetic system. Finally, we discuss different
experimental conditions and some possible theoretical interpretations of the
results.
