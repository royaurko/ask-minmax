Motivated by recent studies in geophysical and planetary sciences, we
investigate the PDE-analytical aspects of time-averages for barotropic,
inviscid flows on a fast rotating sphere $S^2$. Of particular interests are the
incompressible Euler equations. We prove that the finite-time-average of the
solution stays close to a subspace of \emph{longitude-independent zonal flows}.
The intial data can be arbitrarily far away from this subspace. Meridional
variation of the Coriolis parameter underlies this phenomenon. Our proofs use
Riemannian geometric tools, in particular the Hodge Theory.
