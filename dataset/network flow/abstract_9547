Recent advances in communications, mobile computing, and artificial
intelligence have greatly expanded the application space of intelligent
distributed sensor networks. This in turn motivates the development of
generalized Bayesian decentralized data fusion (DDF) algorithms for robust and
efficient information sharing among autonomous agents using probabilistic
belief models. However, DDF is significantly challenging to implement for
general real-world applications requiring the use of dynamic/ad hoc network
topologies and complex belief models, such as Gaussian mixtures or hybrid
Bayesian networks. To tackle these issues, we first discuss some new key
mathematical insights about exact DDF and conservative approximations to DDF.
These insights are then used to develop novel generalized DDF algorithms for
complex beliefs based on mixture pdfs and conditional factors. Numerical
examples motivated by multi-robot target search demonstrate that our methods
lead to significantly better fusion results, and thus have great potential to
enhance distributed intelligent reasoning in sensor networks.
