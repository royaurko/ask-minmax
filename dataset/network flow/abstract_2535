Among the different models of networks usually considered, the hexagonal
network model is the most popular. However, it requires extensive numerical
computations. The Poisson network model, for which the base stations (BS)
locations form a spatial Poisson process, allows to consider a non constant
distance between base stations. Therefore, it may characterize more
realistically operational networks. The Fluid network model, for which the
interfering BS are replaced by a continuum of infinitesimal interferers, allows
to establish closed-form formula for the SINR (Signal on Interference plus
Noise Ratio). This model was validated by comparison with an hexagonal network.
The two models establish very close results. As a consequence, the Fluid
network model can be used to analyze hexagonal networks. In this paper, we show
that the Fluid network model can also be used to analyze Poisson networks.
Therefore, the analysis of performance and quality of service becomes very
easy, whatever the type of network model, by using the analytical expression of
the SINR established by considering the Fluid network model.
