By establishing a characterization for Sobolev differentiability of random
fields, we prove the weak differentiability of solutions to stochastic
differential equations with local Sobolev and super-linear growth coefficients
with respect to the starting point. Moreover, we also study the strong Feller
property and the irreducibility of the associated diffusion semigroup.
