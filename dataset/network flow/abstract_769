The objective of this paper is to implement the Active Network based Active
Queue Management Technique for providing Quality of Service (QoS) using Network
Processor(NP) based router to enhance multimedia applications. The performance
is evaluated using Intel IXP2400 NP Simulator. The results demonstrate that,
Active Network based Active Queue Management has better performance than RED
algorithm in case of congestion and is well suited to achieve high speed packet
classification to support multimedia applications with minimum delay and Queue
loss. Using simulation, we show that the proposed system can provide assurance
for prioritized flows with improved network utilization where bandwidth is
shared among the flows according to the levels of priority. We first analyze
the feasibility and optimality of the load distribution schemes and then
present separate solutions for non-delay sensitive streams and delay-sensitive
streams. Rigorous simulations and experiments have been carried out to evaluate
the performance.
