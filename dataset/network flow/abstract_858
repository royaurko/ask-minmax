We investigate a simple multisegment cellular automaton model of traffic
flow. With the introduction of segment-dependent deceleration probability,
metastable congested states in the intermediate density region emerge, and the
initial state dependence of the flow is observed. The essential feature of
three-phased structure empirically found in real-world traffic flow is
reproduced without elaborate assumptions.
