A supply chain is a system which moves products from a supplier to customers.
The supply chains are ubiquitous. They play a key role in all economic
activities. Inspired by biological principles of nutrients' distribution in
protoplasmic networks of slime mould Physarum polycephalum we propose a novel
algorithm for a supply chain design. The algorithm handles the supply networks
where capacity investments and product flows are variables. The networks are
constrained by a need to satisfy product demands. Two features of the slime
mould are adopted in our algorithm. The first is the continuity of a flux
during the iterative process, which is used in real-time update of the costs
associated with the supply links. The second feature is adaptivity. The supply
chain can converge to an equilibrium state when costs are changed. Practicality
and flexibility of our algorithm is illustrated on numerical examples.
