The Gibbs entropy of a microcanonical network ensemble is the logarithm of
the number of network configurations compatible with a set of hard constraints.
This quantity characterizes the level of order and randomness encoded in
features of a given real network. Here we show how to relate this entropy to
large deviations of conjugated canonical ensembles. We derive exact expression
for this correspondence using the cavity methods for some hard constraints.
