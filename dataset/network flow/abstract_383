We have developed a steady state theory of complex transport networks used to
model the flow of commodity, information, viruses, opinions, or traffic. Our
approach is based on the use of the Markov chains defined on the graph
representations of transport networks allowing for the effective network
design, network performance evaluation, embedding, partitioning, and network
fault tolerance analysis. Random walks embed graphs into Euclidean space in
which distances and angles acquire a clear statistical interpretation. Being
defined on the dual graph representations of transport networks random walks
describe the equilibrium configurations of not random commodity flows on
primary graphs. This theory unifies many network concepts into one framework
and can also be elegantly extended to describe networks represented by directed
graphs and multiple interacting networks.
