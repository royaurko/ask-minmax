In this paper, we consider femtocell CR networks, where femto base stations
(FBS) are deployed to greatly improve network coverage and capacity. We
investigate the problem of generic data multicast in femtocell networks. We
reformulate the resulting MINLP problem into a simpler form, and derive upper
and lower performance bounds. Then we consider three typical connection
scenarios in the femtocell network, and develop optimal and near-optimal
algorithms for the three scenarios. Second, we tackle the problem of streaming
scalable videos in femtocell CR networks. A framework is developed to captures
the key design issues and trade-offs with a stochastic programming problem
formulation. In the case of a single FBS, we develop an optimum-achieving
distributed algorithm, which is shown also optimal for the case of multiple
non-interfering FBS's. In the case of interfering FBS's, we develop a greedy
algorithm that can compute near-opitmal solutions, and prove a closed-form
lower bound on its performance.
