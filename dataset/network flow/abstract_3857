Bonacich centrality measures the number of attenuated paths between nodes in
a network. We use this metric to study network structure, specifically, to rank
nodes and find community structure of the network. To this end we extend the
modularity-maximization method for community detection to use this centrality
metric as a measure of node connectivity. Bonacich centrality contains a
tunable parameter that sets the length scale of interactions. By studying how
rankings and discovered communities change when this parameter is varied allows
us to identify globally important nodes and structures. We apply the proposed
method to several benchmark networks and show that it leads to better insight
into network structure than earlier methods.
