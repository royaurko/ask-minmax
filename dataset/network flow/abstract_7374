We present results from a BeppoSAX observation of the cooling flow cluster
Abell 2029. The broad band spectrum (2-35 keV) of the cluster, when fitted with
a model including a cooling flow component and a one temperature thermal
component, yields a temperature of 8.3+/-0.2 keV and a metal abundance of
0.46+/-0.03 in solar units, for the latter. No evidence of a hard X-ray excess
is found in the PDS spectrum. By performing a spatially resolved spectral
analysis we find that the projected temperature and abundance drop with
increasing radius, going from about 8 keV and 0.5 (solar units) at the cluster
core to about 5 keV and 0.2 (solar units) at about 1.2 Mpc.
