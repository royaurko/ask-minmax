We study the cluster dynamics of multichannel (multivariate) time series by
representing their correlations as time-dependent networks and investigating
the evolution of network communities. We employ a node-centric approach that
allows us to track the effects of the community evolution on the functional
roles of individual nodes without having to track entire communities. As an
example, we consider a foreign exchange market network in which each node
represents an exchange rate and each edge represents a time-dependent
correlation between the rates. We study the period 2005-2008, which includes
the recent credit and liquidity crisis. Using dynamical community detection, we
find that exchange rates that are strongly attached to their community are
persistently grouped with the same set of rates, whereas exchange rates that
are important for the transfer of information tend to be positioned on the
edges of communities. Our analysis successfully uncovers major trading changes
that occurred in the market during the credit crisis.
