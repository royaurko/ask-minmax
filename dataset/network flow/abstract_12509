A network has a non-overlapping community structure if the nodes of the
network can be partitioned into disjoint sets of nodes such that each set of
nodes is densely connected to the nodes inside the set and sparsely connected
to the nodes outside it. To uncover the community structure in a network, many
methods have been proposed till now. Even though there have been a multitude of
comparative studies of these methods, there has not been any comparative study
of community detection methodologies that rely only on structural data with
methodologies that rely entirely on behavioral data. For this purpose, we
execute some behavioral property based community detection methods along with
some structural property based methods on two real-world networks: Filmtipset
and Twitter. The results are then objectively evaluated using two well-defined
quality functions: modularity and like-mindedness. We also present two new
behavioral property based community finding algorithms called Modified Louvain
Method and Like-Mindedness Maximization. The first algorithm attempts to
achieve a community structure with approximately the highest modularity and
reasonably good like-mindedness. The second algorithm attempts to maximize the
like-mindedness of the identified community structure.
