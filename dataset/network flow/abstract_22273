Vibrational energy transfer of the amide I mode of N-methylacetamide (NMA) is
studied theoretically using the vibrational configuration interaction method. A
quartic force field of NMA is constructed at the B3LYP/6-31G+(d) level of
theory and its accuarcy is checked by comparing the resulting anharmonic
frequencies with available theoretical and experimental values. Quantum
dynamics calculations for the amide I mode excitation clarify the dominant
energy transfer pathways, which sensitively depend on the anharmonic couplings
among vibrational modes. A ratio of the anharmonic coupling to the frequency
mismatch is employed to predict and interpret the dominant energy flow
pathways.
