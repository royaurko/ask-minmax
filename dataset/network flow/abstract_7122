The motion and deformation of a droplet suspended in an unbounded fluid with
an arbitrary, but Stokesian, imposed flow is investigated when there is a slip
at the interface between the two liquids. The boundary condition at the
interface is accounted by means of a simple Navier slip condition. Expressions
are derived considering the effect of slip on the velocity and the shape
deformation of the droplet for any arbitrary imposed flow field, and results
are presented for the specific cases of shear flow and Poiseuille flow with the
results of Hetsroni and Haber (J. Fluid Mech., 1970, vol. 41(04), pp. 689-705);
and Ramachandran and Leal (J. Rheol., 2012, vol. 56(6), pp. 1555-1587) as the
limiting cases of our general expressions. The modification to Fax\'en's law is
also presented in the above perspective.
