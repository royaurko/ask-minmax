We present integral field spectroscopy of the nebular line emission in a
sample of 9 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). The sample was chosen to probe
both cooling flow and non-cooling flow clusters, as well as a range of cluster
X-ray luminosities. The line emission morphology and velocity gradients suggest
a great diversity in the properties of the line emitting gas. While some BGCs
show evidence for filamentary or patchy emission (Abell 1060, Abell 1668 and
MKW3s), others have extended emission (Abell 1204, Abell 2199), while still
others have centrally concentrated emission (Abell 2052). We examine diagnostic
line ratios to determine the dominant ionization mechanisms in each galaxy.
Most of the galaxies show regions with AGN-like spectra, however for two BCGs,
Abell 1060 and Abell 1204, the emission line diagnostics suggest regions which
can be described by the emission from young stellar populations. The diversity
of emission line properties in our sample of BCGs suggests that the emission
mechanism is not universal, with different ionization processes dominating
different systems. Given this diversity, there is no evidence for a clear
distinction of the emission line properties between cooling flow and
non-cooling flow BCGs. It is not always cooling flow BCGs which show emission
(or young stellar populations), and non-cooling flow BCGs which do not.
