We prove a functional central limit theorem for partial sums of symmetric
stationary long range dependent heavy tailed infinitely divisible processes
with a certain type of negative dependence. Previously only positive dependence
could be treated. The negative dependence involves cancellations of the
Gaussian second order. This leads to new types of limiting processes involving
stable random measures, due to heavy tails, Mittag-Leffler processes, due to
long memory, and Brownian motions, due to the Gaussian second order
cancellations.
