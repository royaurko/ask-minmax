We present an effective immunization strategy for computer networks and
populations with broad and, in particular, scale-free degree distributions. The
proposed strategy, acquaintance immunization, calls for the immunization of
random acquaintances of random nodes (individuals). The strategy requires no
knowledge of the node degrees or any other global knowledge, as do targeted
immunization strategies. We study analytically the critical threshold for
complete immunization. We also study the strategy with respect to the
susceptible-infected-removed epidemiological model. We show that the
immunization threshold is dramatically reduced with the suggested strategy, for
all studied cases.
