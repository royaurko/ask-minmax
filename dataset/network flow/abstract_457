In this thesis, Riemann problems and Godunov methods are developed for higher
order traffic flow models. A rigorous analysis of the first order traffic flow
model of inhomogeneous road is presented. A two-level simulation framework of
network vehicular traffic is proposed as a Godunov-type finite difference
system with the supply-demand method as an alternative of Riemann solver.
