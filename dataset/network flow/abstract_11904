Public Protection and Distaster Relief (PPDR) services can benefit greatly
from the availability of mobile broadband communications in disaster and
emergency scenarios. While undoubtedly offering full control and reliability,
dedicated networks for PPDR have resulted in high operating costs and a lack of
innovation in comparison to the commercial domain. Driven by the many benefits
of broadband communications, PPDR operators are increasingly interested in
adopting mainstream commercial technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE)
in favour of expensive, dedicated narrow-band networks.
  In addition, the emergence of virtualization for wireless networks offers a
new model for sharing infrastructure between several operators in a flexible
and customizable manner. In this context, we propose a virtual Public Safety
(PS) operator that relies on shared infrastructure of commercial LTE networks
to deliver services to its users. We compare several methods of allocating
spectrum resources between virtual operators at peak times and examine how this
influences differing traffic services. We show that it is possible to provide
services to the PS users reliably during both normal and emergency operation,
and examine the impact on the commercial operators.
