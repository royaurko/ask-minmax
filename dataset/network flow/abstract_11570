Concepts such as energy dependence, random deployment, dynamic topological
update, self-organization, varying large number of nodes are among many factors
that make WSNs a type of complex system. However, when analyzing WSNs
properties using complex network tools, classical topological measures must be
considered with care as they might not be applicable in their original form. In
this work, we focus on the topological measures frequently used in the related
field of Internet topological analysis. We illustrate their applicability to
the WSNs domain through simulation experiments. In the cases when the classic
metrics turn out to be incompatible, we propose some alternative measures and
discuss them based on the WSNs characteristics.
