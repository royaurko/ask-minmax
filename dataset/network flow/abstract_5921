This paper uses a recently presented abstract, tuneable Boolean regulatory
network model extended to consider aspects of mobile DNA, such as transposons.
The significant role of mobile DNA in the evolution of natural systems is
becoming increasingly clear. This paper shows how dynamically controlling
network node connectivity and function via transposon-inspired mechanisms can
be selected for in computational intelligence tasks to give improved
performance. The designs of dynamical networks intended for implementation
within the slime mould Physarum polycephalum and for the distributed control of
a smart surface are considered.
