Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are self-configuring infrastructure-less
networks comprised of mobile nodes that communicate over wireless links without
any central control on a peer-to-peer basis. These individual nodes act as
routers to forward both their own data and also their neighbours' data by
sending and receiving packets to and from other nodes in the network. The
relatively easy configuration and the quick deployment make ad hoc networks
suitable the emergency situations (such as human or natural disasters) and for
military units in enemy territory. Securing data dissemination between these
nodes in such networks, however, is a very challenging task. Exposing such
information to anyone else other than the intended nodes could cause a privacy
and confidentiality breach, particularly in military scenarios. In this paper
we present a novel framework to enhance the privacy and data confidentiality in
mobile ad hoc networks by attaching the originator policies to the messages as
they are sent between nodes. We evaluate our framework using the Network
Simulator (NS-2) to check whether the privacy and confidentiality of the
originator are met. For this we implemented the Policy Enforcement Points
(PEPs), as NS-2 agents that manage and enforce the policies attached to packets
at every node in the MANET.
