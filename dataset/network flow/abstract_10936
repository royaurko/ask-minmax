Recent biological experimental findings have shown that synaptic plasticity
depends on the relative timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes and this is
called spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Many contributors have claimed that
a precise balance between long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression
(LTD) of STDP is crucial in the storage of spatio-temporal patterns. Some
contributors have numerically investigated the impact of an imbalance between LTP
and LTD on the network properties. However, the mathematical mechanism remains
unknown. We analytically show that an associative memory network has the robust
retrieval properties of spatio-temporal patterns, and these properties make the
network less vulnerable to any deviation from a precise balance between LTP and
LTD when the network contains a finite number of neurons.
