We investigate the global in time stability of regular solutions with large
velocity vectors to the evolutionary Navier-Stokes equation in ${\bf R}^3$. The
class of stable flows contains all two dimensional weak solutions. The only
assumption which is required is smallness of the $L_2$-norm of initial
perturbation or its derivative with respect to the `$z$'-coordinate in the same
norm. The magnitude of the rest of the norm of initial datum is not restricted.
