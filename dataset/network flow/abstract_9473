Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) suffers from the hot spot problem where the
sensor nodes closest to the base station are need to relay more packet than the
nodes farther away from the base station. Thus, lifetime of sensory network
depends on these closest nodes. Clustering methods are used to extend the
lifetime of a wireless sensor network. However, current clustering algorithms
usually utilize two techniques; selecting cluster heads with more residual
energy, and rotating cluster heads periodically to distribute the energy
consumption among nodes in each cluster and lengthen the network lifetime. Most
of the algorithms use random selection for selecting the cluster heads. Here,
we propose a novel trajectory clustering technique for selecting the cluster
heads in WSNs. Our algorithm selects the cluster heads based on traffic and
rotates periodically. It provides the first trajectory based clustering
technique for selecting the cluster heads and to extenuate the hot spot problem
by prolonging the network lifetime.
