We have analysed the many facets of Consciousness into two distinct
categories. First: the organisational state of the neural networks at any one
time, which determines whether a person is conscious - awake, or unconscious -
asleep. Second: the processes that underlie the traffic of electrical signals
across these networks that accounts for all the experiences of conscious
awareness. This paper addresses the former; namely, how the state of the
billions of neural networks and the trillions of additional axons, dendrites
and synapses varies over the daily cycle - what physically changes when we go
to sleep - what happens when we wake up. We submit that the widths of synaptic
clefts are not fixed, but are variable, and that this variable tension across
the synapses is the neural correlate of consciousness.
