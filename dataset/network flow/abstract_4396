Solving fastest distributed consensus averaging problem (i.e., finding
weights on the edges to minimize the second-largest eigenvalue modulus of the
weight matrix) over networks with different topologies is one of the primary
areas of research in the field of sensor networks and one of the well known
networks in this issue is tree network. Here in this work we present analytical
solution for the problem of fastest distributed consensus averaging algorithm
by means of stratification and semidefinite programming, for two particular
types of tree networks, namely perfect and complete n-ary tree networks. Our
method in this paper is based on convexity of fastest distributed consensus
averaging problem, and inductive comparing of the characteristic polynomials
initiated by slackness conditions in order to find the optimal weights. Also
the optimal weights for the edges of certain types of branches such as perfect
and complete n-ary tree branches are determined independently of rest of the
network.
