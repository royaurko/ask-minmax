Various disordered dense systems such as foams, gels, emulsions and colloidal
suspensions, exhibit a jamming transition from a liquid state (they flow) to a
solid state below a yield stress. Their structure, thoroughly studied with
powerful means of 3D characterization, exhibits some analogy with that of
glasses which led to call them soft glassy materials. However, despite its
importance for geophysical and industrial applications, their rheological
behavior, and its microscopic origin, is still poorly known, in particular
because of its nonlinear nature. Here we show from two original experiments
that a simple 3D continuum description of the behaviour of soft glassy
materials can be built. We first show that when a flow is imposed in some
direction there is no yield resistance to a secondary flow: these systems are
always unjammed simultaneously in all directions of space. The 3D jamming
criterion appears to be the plasticity criterion encountered in most solids. We
also find that they behave as simple liquids in the direction orthogonal to
that of the main flow; their viscosity is inversely proportional to the main
flow shear rate, as a signature of shear-induced structural relaxation, in
close similarity with the structural relaxations driven by temperature and
density in other glassy systems.
