Mathematical model for hit phenomena in entertainments in the society is
presented as stochastic process of interactions of human dynamics. The model
use only the time distribution of advertisement budget as input and the words
of mouth (WOM) as posting in the social network system is used as the data to
compare with the calculated results. The unit of time is daily. The WOM
distribution in time is found to be very close to the residue distribution in
time. The calculations for Japanese motion picture market due to the
mathematical model agree very well with the actual residue distribution in
time.
