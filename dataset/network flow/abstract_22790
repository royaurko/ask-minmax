Based on Broise-Alamichel and Paulin's work on the Gauss map corresponding to
the principal convergents, we continue the study of the Gauss map via Farey
maps to contain all the intermediate convergents. We define the geometric Farey
map, which is given by time-1 map of the geodesic flow. We also define
algebraic Farey maps, better suited for arithmetic properties, which produce
all the intermediate convergents. Then we obtain the ergodic invariant measures
for the Farey maps and the convergent speed.
