There is growing evidence that electronic and molecular networks present some
common universal properties, among which the existence of a self-organized
intermediate phase. In glasses, the latter is revealed by the reversibility
window obtained from complex calorimetric measurements at the glass transition.
Here we focus on amorphous networks and we show how this intermediate phase can
be understood from a rigidity percolation analysis on size increasing clusters.
This provides benchmarks and guidance for an electromechanical analogy with
high temperature super conductors
