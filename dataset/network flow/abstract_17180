We propose a distributed algorithm for controlling traffic signals, allowing
constraints such as periodic switching sequences of phases and minimum and
maximum green time to be incorporated. Our algorithm is adapted from
backpressure routing, which has been mainly applied to communication and power
networks. We formally prove that our algorithm ensures global optimality as it
leads to maximum network throughput even though the controller is constructed
and implemented in a completely distributed manner.
