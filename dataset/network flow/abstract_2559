We study enhancement of diffusive mixing by fast incompressible time-periodic
flows. The class of relaxation-enhancing flows that are especially efficient in
speeding up mixing has been introduced in [2]. The relaxation-enhancing
property of a flow has been shown to be intimately related to the properties of
the dynamical system it generates. In particular, time-independent flows $u$
such that the operator $u \cdot \nabla$ has sufficiently smooth eigenfunctions
are not relaxation-enhancing. Here we extend results of [2] to time-periodic
flows $u(x,t)$ and in particular show that there exist flows such that for each
fixed time the flow is Hamiltonian, but the resulting time-dependent flow is
relaxation-enhancing. Thus we confirm the physical intuition that time
dependence of a flow may aid mixing. We also provide an extension of our
results to the case of a nonlinear diffusion model. The proofs are based on a
general criterion for the decay of a semigroup generated by an operator of the
form $\Gamma+iAL(t)$ with a negative unbounded self-adjoint operator $\Gamma$,
a time-periodic self-adjoint operator-valued function $L(t)$, and a parameter
$A>>1$.
