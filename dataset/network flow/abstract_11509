The emergence of explosive collective phenomena has recently attracted much
attention due to the discovery of an explosive percolation transition in
complex networks. In this Letter, we demonstrate how an explosive transition
shows up in the synchronization of complex heterogeneous networks by
incorporating a microscopic correlation between the structural and the
dynamical properties of the system. The characteristics of this explosive
transition are analytically studied in a star graph reproducing the results
obtained in synthetic scale-free networks. Our findings represent the first
abrupt synchronization transition in complex networks thus providing a deeper
understanding of the microscopic roots of explosive critical phenomena.
