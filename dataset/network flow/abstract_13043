This paper studies rapidly forming singularities in the Yang-Mills flow. It
is shown that a sequence of blow-ups near the singular point converges, modulo
the gauge group, to a homothetically shrinking soliton with non-zero curvature.
The proof uses Hamilton's monotonicity formula. Examples of homothetically
shrinking solitons are given in the case of trivial bundles over R^n for
dimensions 5 through 9.
