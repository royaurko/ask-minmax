Complexity science affords a number of novel tools for examining terrorism,
particularly network analysis and NK-Boolean fitness landscapes. The following
paper explores various aspects of terrorist networks which can be illuminated
through applications of non-linear dynamical systems modeling to terrorist
network structures. Of particular interest are some of the emergent properties
of terrorist networks as typified by the 9-11 hijackers network, properties of
centrality, hierarchy and distance, as well as ways in which attempts to
disrupt the transmission of information through terrorist networks may be
expected to produce greater or lesser levels of fitness in those organizations.
