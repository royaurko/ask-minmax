We look at the properties of high frequency eigenmodes for the damped wave
equation on a compact manifold with an Anosov geodesic flow. We study
eigenmodes with spectral parameters which are asymptotically close enough to
the real axis. We prove that such modes cannot be completely localized on
subsets satisfying a condition of negative topological pressure. As an
application, one can deduce the existence of a "strip" of logarithmic size
without eigenvalues below the real axis under this dynamical assumption on the
set of undamped trajectories.
