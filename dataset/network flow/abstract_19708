Identified particle elliptic flow results are presented for the Au+Au
reaction at sqrt[s_{NN}] = 200$ GeV as a function of transverse momentum and
pseudorapidity. Data at pseudorapidities eta approximately equal to 0, 1, and
3.4 were obtained using the two BRAHMS spectrometers. Differential v2(eta, pt)
values for a given particle type are found to be essentially constant over the
covered pseudorapidity range, in contrast to the integral v2 values which have
previously been observed to decrease at forward rapidities. A softening of the
particle spectra at forward angles is found to account for at least part of the
integral v2 falloff. The data are found to be consistent with existing
constituent quark scaling systematics.
