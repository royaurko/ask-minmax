We study the spatial distribution of gyrotactic microorganisms transported by
a three-dimensional turbulent flow generated by direct numerical simulations.
We find that gyrotaxis combines with turbulent fluctuations to produce small
scales (multi-)fractal clustering. We explain this result by showing that
gyrotactic swimming cells behave like tracers in a compressible flow. The
effective compressibility is derived in the limits of fluid acceleration much
larger and smaller than the gravity.
