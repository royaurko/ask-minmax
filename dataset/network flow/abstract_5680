To understand the contact patterns of a population -- who is in contact with
whom, and when the contacts happen -- is crucial for modeling outbreaks of
infectious disease. Traditional theoretical epidemiology assumes that any
individual can meet any with equal probability. A more modern approach, network
epidemiology, assumes people are connected into a static network over which the
disease spreads. Newer yet, temporal network epidemiology, includes the time in
the contact representations. In this paper, we investigate the effect of these
successive inclusions of more information. Using empirical proximity data, we
study both outbreak sizes from unknown sources, and from known states of
ongoing outbreaks. In the first case, there are large differences going from a
fully mixed simulation to a network, and from a network to a temporal network.
In the second case, differences are smaller. We interpret these observations in
terms of the temporal network structure of the data sets. For example, a fast
overturn of nodes and links seem to make the temporal information more
important.
