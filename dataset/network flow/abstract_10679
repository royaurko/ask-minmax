Lauer \& Postman (LP) observe that all Abell clusters with redshifts less
than 15,000\kms\ appear to be participating in a bulk flow of 689 km s$^{-1}$
with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background. We find this result difficult
to reconcile with all popular models for large-scale structure formation that
assume Gaussian initial conditions. This conclusion is based on Monte-Carlo
realizations of the LP data, drawn from large Particle-Mesh $N$-body
simulations.
  We have taken special care to treat properly the longest-wavelength
components of the power spectra. Bulk flows with amplitude as large as that
reported by LP are not uncommon in the Monte-Carlo datasets. However, the
$\chi^2$ of the observed bulk flow, taking into account the anisotropy of the
error ellipsoid, is much more difficult to match in the simulations. The models
examined are ruled out at confidence levels between 94\% and 98\%. Any model
that has {\it intrinsic} flows of less than 480\kms\ on the scales probed by LP
scales can be ruled out at a similar level.
