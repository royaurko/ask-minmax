We present broadband imaging polarimetry of DR21 at 2.2$\mu$m. Background
stars shining through the lobes of the bipolar outflow show polarization
aligned with the long axis of the outflow, indicating a magnetic field geometry
oriented along the flow axis. There is no indication of a spiral or turbulent
magnetic field geometry in the lobes. The polarization of stars in the central
cluster has a different position angle than the lobes and is in good agreement
with millimeter polarimetry. The nebulosity in the Eastern lobe has moderate to
high polarization consistent with scattering of continuum light from the
central cluster. We were unable to detect polarization of the nebulosity in the
Western lobe at the 4.2% (3sigma) level.
