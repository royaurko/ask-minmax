A variety of idealized models of communication systems exist, and all may
have something in common. Starting with Shannons communication model and ending
with the OSI model, this paper presents progressively more advanced forms of
modeling of communication systems by tying communication models together based
on the notion of flow. The basic communication process is divided into
different spheres (sources, channels, and destinations), each with its own five
interior stages, receiving, processing, creating, releasing, and transferring
of information. The flow of information is ontologically distinguished from the
flow of physical signals, accordingly, Shannons model, network based OSI
models, and TCP IP are redesigned.
