In this paper we study an energy of maps between almost Hermitian manifolds
for which pseudo-holomorphic maps are global minimizers. We derive its
Euler-Lagrange equation, the $\bar{\partial}$-harmonic map equation, and show
that it coincides with the harmonic map equation up to first order terms. We
prove results analogous to the those that hold for harmonic maps, including
obstructions to the long time existence of the associated parabolic flow, an
Eells-Sampson type result under appropriate conditions on the target manifold,
and a bubbling result for finite time singularities on surfaces. We also
consider examples of the flow where the target is a non-Kahler surface.
