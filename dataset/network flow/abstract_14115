We present the results of an exhaustive numerical study of fully relativistic
non-axisymmetric Bondi-Hoyle accretion onto a moving Schwarzschild black hole.
We have solved the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics with a
high-resolution shock-capturing numerical scheme based on a linearized Riemann
solver. The numerical code was previously used to study axisymmetric flow
configurations past a Schwarzschild hole. We have analyzed and discussed the
flow morphology for a sample of asymptotically high Mach number models. The
results of this work reveal that initially asymptotic uniform flows always
accrete onto the hole in a stationary way which closely resembles the previous
axisymmetric patterns. This is in contrast with some Newtonian numerical
studies where violent flip-flop instabilities were found. As discussed in the
text, the reason can be found in the initial conditions used in the
relativistic regime, as they can not exactly duplicate the previous Newtonian
setups where the instability appeared. The dependence of the final solution
with the inner boundary condition as well as with the grid resolution has also
been studied. Finally, we have computed the accretion rates of mass and linear
and angular momentum.
