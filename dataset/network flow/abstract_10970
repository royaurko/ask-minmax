We study scale free simple graphs with an exponent of the degree distribution
$\gamma$ less than two. Generically one expects such extremely skewed networks
-- which occur very frequently in systems of virtually or logically connected
units -- to have different properties than those of scale free networks with
$\gamma>2$: The number of links grows faster than the number of nodes and they
naturally posses the small world property, because the diameter increases by
the logarithm of the size of the network and the clustering coefficient is
finite. We discuss a simple prototype model of such networks, inspired by real
world phenomena, which exhibits these properties and allows for a detailed
analytical investigation.
