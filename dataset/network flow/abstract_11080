A metabolic model can be represented as bipartite graph comprising linked
reaction and metabolite nodes. Here it is shown how a network of conserved
fluxes can be assigned to the edges of such a graph by combining the reaction
fluxes with a conserved metabolite property such as molecular weight. A similar
flux network can be constructed by combining the primal and dual solutions to
the linear programming problem that typically arises in constraint-based
modelling. Such constructions may help with the visualisation of flux
distributions in complex metabolic networks. The analysis also explains the
strong correlation observed between metabolite shadow prices (the dual linear
programming variables) and conserved metabolite properties. The methods were
applied to recent metabolic models for Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, and Methanosarcina barkeri. Detailed results are reported for E.
coli; similar results were found for the other organisms.
