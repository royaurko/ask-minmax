The aim of this paper is to develop a multiscale hierarchical hybrid model
based on finite element analysis and neural network computation to link
mesoscopic scale (trabecular network level) and macroscopic (whole bone level)
to simulate bone remodelling process. Because whole bone simulation considering
the 3D trabecular level is time consuming, the finite element calculation is
performed at macroscopic level and a trained neural network are employed as
numerical devices for substituting the finite element code needed for the
mesoscale prediction. The bone mechanical properties are updated at macroscopic
scale depending on the morphological organization at the mesoscopic computed by
the trained neural network. The digital image-based modeling technique using
m-CT and voxel finite element mesh is used to capture 2 mm3 Representative
Volume Elements at mesoscale level in a femur head. The input data for the
artificial neural network are a set of bone material parameters, boundary
conditions and the applied stress. The output data is the updated bone
properties and some trabecular bone factors. The presented approach, to our
knowledge, is the first model incorporating both FE analysis and neural network
computation to simulate the multilevel bone adaptation in rapid way.
