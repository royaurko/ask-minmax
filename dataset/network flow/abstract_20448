We present a flexible illustrative line style model for the visualization of
streamline data. Our model partitions view-oriented line strips into parallel
bands whose basic visual properties can be controlled independently. We thus
extend previous line stylization techniques specifically for visualization
purposes by allowing the parametrization of these bands based on the local line
data attributes. Moreover, our approach supports emphasis and abstraction by
introducing line style transfer functions that map local line attribute values
to complete line styles. With a flexible GPU implementation of this line style
model we enable the interactive exploration of visual representations of
streamlines. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by applying it to 3D
flow field datasets.
