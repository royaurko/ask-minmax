Transport through generalized trees is considered. Trees contain the simple
nodes and supernodes, either well-structured regular subgraphs or those with
many triangles. We observe a superdiffusion for the highly connected nodes
while it is Brownian for the rest of the nodes. Transport within a supernode is
affected by the finite size effects vanishing as $N\to\infty.$ For the even
dimensions of space, $d=2,4,6,...$, the finite size effects break down the
perturbation theory at small scales and can be regularized by using the
heat-kernel expansion.
