We consider solutions to the full (non-isentropic) two-dimensional Euler
equations that are constant in time and along rays emanating from the origin.
We prove that for a polytropic equation of state, entropy admissible solutions
in $L^\infty$ with non-vanishing velocity, density, and internal energy must be
$BV$. Moreover, we obtain some results concerning the structure of such
solutions.
