Critical states are usually identified experimentally through power-law
statistics or universal scaling functions. We show here that such features
naturally emerge from networks in self-sustained irregular regimes away from
criticality. Power-law statistics are also seen when the units are replaced by
independent stochastic surrogates, and thus are not sufficient to establish
criticality. We rather suggest that these are universal features of large-scale
networks when considered macroscopically. These results put caution on the
interpretation of scaling laws found in nature.
