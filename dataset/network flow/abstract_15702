In this paper we apply techniques of complex network analysis to data sources
representing public funding programs and discuss the importance of the
considered indicators for program evaluation. Starting from the Open Data
repository of the 2007-2013 Italian Program Programma Operativo Nazionale
'Ricerca e Competitivit\`a' (PON R&C), we build a set of data models and
perform network analysis over them. We discuss the obtained experimental
results outlining interesting new perspectives that emerge from the application
of the proposed methods to the socio-economical evaluation of funded programs.
