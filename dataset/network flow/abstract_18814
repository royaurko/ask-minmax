Living systems have time-evolving interactions that, until recently, could
not be identified accurately from recorded time series in the presence of
noise. Stankovski et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 024101, 2012) introduced a
method based on dynamical Bayesian inference that facilitates the simultaneous
detection of time-varying synchronization, directionality of influence, and
coupling functions. It can distinguish unsynchronized dynamics from
noise-induced phase slips. The method is based on phase dynamics, with Bayesian
inference of the time- evolving parameters being achieved by shaping the prior
densities to incorporate knowledge of previous samples. We now present the
method in detail using numerically-generated data, data from an analog
electronic circuit, and cardio-respiratory data. We also generalize the method
to encompass networks of interacting oscillators and thus demonstrate its
applicability to small-scale networks.
