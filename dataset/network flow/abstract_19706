We introduce an analysis method to measure elliptic flow (v_2) fluctuations
using the PHOBOS detector for Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV. In this
method, v_2 is determined event-by-event by a maximum likelihood fit. The
non-statistical fluctuations are determined by unfolding the contribution of
statistical fluctuations and detector effects using Monte Carlo
simulations(MC). Application of this method to measure dynamical fluctuations
embedded in special MC are presented. It is shown that the input fluctuations
are reconstructed successfully for <v_2> >= 0.03.
