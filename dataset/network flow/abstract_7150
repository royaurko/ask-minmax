We apply percolation theory to a recently proposed measure of fragmentation
$F$ for social networks. The measure $F$ is defined as the ratio between the
number of pairs of nodes that are not connected in the fragmented network after
removing a fraction $q$ of nodes and the total number of pairs in the original
fully connected network. We compare $F$ with the traditional measure used in
percolation theory, $P_{\infty}$, the fraction of nodes in the largest cluster
relative to the total number of nodes. Using both analytical and numerical
methods from percolation, we study Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) and scale-free (SF)
networks under various types of node removal strategies. The removal strategies
are: random removal, high degree removal and high betweenness centrality
removal. We find that for a network obtained after removal (all strategies) of
a fraction $q$ of nodes above percolation threshold, $P_{\infty}\approx
(1-F)^{1/2}$. For fixed $P_{\infty}$ and close to percolation threshold
($q=q_c$), we show that $1-F$ better reflects the actual fragmentation. Close
to $q_c$, for a given $P_{\infty}$, $1-F$ has a broad distribution and it is
thus possible to improve the fragmentation of the network. We also study and
compare the fragmentation measure $F$ and the percolation measure $P_{\infty}$
for a real social network of workplaces linked by the households of the
employees and find similar results.
