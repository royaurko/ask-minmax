Asynchronous rotation in binary stars produces non-radial oscillations that
are known to cause observable variability on orbital timescales. The horizontal
perturbations of the surface velocity fields are referred to as "tidal flows".
In this paper we illustrate the manner in which tidal flows perturb the surface
velocity field from that of uniform rotation, using a one-layer stellar model
for the calculations. We justify the validity of this simplified model by the
striking similarity between the photospheric absorption line-profiles it
predicts and observational data of the binary system alpha Virginis. The
velocity perturbations are used to compute the mechanical energy dissipation
rates, dot-E, due to the shearing flows for the case of a massive (50+28 Mo)
binary system having a moderately eccentric (e=0.3) orbit. The largest value of
dot-E around periastron phases is found on the hemisphere facing the companion.
However, at other orbital phases the maximum dot-E may migrate towards the
poles. Assuming that dot-E plays a role in the mass-loss characteristics of
massive binary systems, this suggests that peculiar binaries such as HD 5980
and eta Carinae may have a highly non-spherically symmetric mass-loss
distribution which, in addition, is time-variable.
