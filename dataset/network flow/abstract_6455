In this paper, we present a new framework that links the two worlds of wired
and cellular users sharing systems. The approach is to propose an easy gateway
that enables the use of cellular networks based services by wireline users and
applications. The idea is to use a mobile terminal or wireless equipment for
sharing cellular services, available thanks to its cellular network, to other
users that use the wireline Internet. The software application acts as a
gateway between the cellular and the wired network; it is responsible for
supporting the services provided by the wireless network and make them
accessible and usable, in a standard and easy way, by anyone on the wireline
network. The gateway software can be integrated easily on any complex
architecture since it can interact with any cellular modem. The paper describes
an implementation prototype where some examples of services, such as the
ability of using messaging services and calls streaming, are experimented. The
proposed platform combines different standards to guarantee the use of our
gateway in heterogeneous environments.
