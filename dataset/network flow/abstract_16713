This paper presents control and coordination algorithms for groups of
vehicles. The focus is on autonomous vehicle networks performing distributed
sensing tasks where each vehicle plays the role of a mobile tunable sensor. The
paper proposes gradient descent algorithms for a class of utility functions
which encode optimal coverage and sensing policies. The resulting closed-loop
behavior is adaptive, distributed, asynchronous, and verifiably correct.
