Through research conducted in this study, a network approach to the
correlation patterns of void spaces in rough fractures (crack type II) was
developed. We characterized friction networks with several networks
characteristics. The correlation among network properties with the fracture
permeability is the result of friction networks. The revealed hubs in the
complex aperture networks confirmed the importance of highly correlated groups
to conduct the highlighted features of the dynamical aperture field. We found
that there is a universal power law between the nodes' degree and motifs
frequency (for triangles it reads T(k)\proptok{\beta} ({\beta}
\approx2\pm0.3)). The investigation of localization effects on eigenvectors
shows a remarkable difference in parallel and perpendicular aperture patches.
Furthermore, we estimate the rate of stored energy in asperities so that we
found that the rate of radiated energy is higher in parallel friction networks
than it is in transverse directions. The final part of our research highlights
4 point sub-graph distribution and its correlation with fluid flow. For shear
rupture, we observed a similar trend in sub-graph distribution, resulting from
parallel and transversal aperture profiles (a superfamily phenomenon).
