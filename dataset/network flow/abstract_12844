We discuss accretion flows on massive black holes in which different elements
of the flow (clumps) have velocities that may differ substantially. We estimate
the consequence of collisions between these clumps as they come close to the
central object and calculate the resulting radiation. We show that this
radiation is similar to that observed in the optical to X-ray spectral domain
in Seyfert galaxies and quasars. We also show that the large scale accretion is
likely to be clumpy when arriving in the active region and that the clumps keep
their identity between collisions.
