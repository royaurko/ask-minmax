Designing a wireless node that supports quality of service (QoS) in a mobile
ad hoc network is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an architecture
of a wireless node that may be used to form a mobile ad hoc network that
supports QoS. We discuss the core functionalities required for such a node and
how those functionalities can be incorporated. A feature of our architecture is
that the node has the ability to utilize multiple paths, if available, for the
provision of QoS. However, in the absence of multiple paths it can utilize the
resources provided by a single path between the source and the destination. We
follow a modular approach where each module is expanded iteratively. We compare
the features of our architecture with the existing architectures proposed in
the literature. Our architecture has provisions of energy and mobility
management and it can be customized to design a system-on-chip (SoC).
