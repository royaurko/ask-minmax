We define the Ricci curvature, as a measure, for certain singular
torsion-free connections on the tangent bundle of a manifold. The definition
uses an integral formula and vector-valued half-densities. We give relevant
examples in which the Ricci measure can be computed. In the time dependent
setting, we give a weak notion of a Ricci flow solution on a manifold.
