Ground states of 3d EA Ising spin glasses are calculated for sizes up to 14^3
using a combination of a genetic algorithm and Cluster-Exact Approximation.
Evidence for an ultrametric structure is found by studying triplets of
independent ground states where one or two values of the three overlaps are
fixed.
