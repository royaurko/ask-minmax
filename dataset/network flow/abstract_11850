Most of the sensor network applications need real time communication and the
need for deadline aware real time communication is becoming eminent in these
applications. These applications have different dead line requirements also.
The real time applications of wireless sensor networks are bandwidth sensitive
and need higher share of bandwidth for higher priority data to meet the dead
line requirements. In this paper we focus on the MAC layer modifications to
meet the real time requirements of different priority data. Bandwidth
partitioning among different priority transmissions is implemented through MAC
layer modifications. The MAC layer implements a queuing model that supports
lower transfer rate for lower priority packets and higher transfer rate for
real time packets with higher priority, minimizing the end to end delay. The
performance of the algorithm is evaluated with varying node distribution.
