In this paper we design an incentive mechanism for heterogeneous Delay
Tolerant Networks (DTNs). The proposed mechanism tackles a core problem of such
systems: how to induce coordination of DTN relays in order to achieve a target
performance figure, e.g., delivery probability or end-to-end delay, under a
given constraint in term of network resources, e.g., number of active nodes or
energy consumption. Also, we account for the realistic case when the cost for
taking part in the forwarding process varies with the devices' technology or
the users' habits. Finally, the scheme is truly applicable to DTNs since it
works with no need for end-to-end connectivity.
  In this context, we first introduce the basic coordination mechanism
leveraging the notion of a Minority Game. In this game, relays compete to be in
the population minority and their utility is defined in combination with a
rewarding mechanism. The rewards in turn configure as a control by which the
network operator controls the desired operating point for the DTN. To this aim,
we provide a full characterization of the equilibria of the game in the case of
heterogeneous DTNs. Finally, a learning algorithm based on stochastic
approximations provably drives the system to the equilibrium solution without
requiring perfect state information at relay nodes or at the source node and
without using end-to-end communications to implement the rewarding scheme. We
provide extensive numerical results to validate the proposed scheme.
