While funding agencies have provided substantial support for the developers
and vendors of services that facilitate the unfettered flow of information
through the Internet, little consolidated knowledge exists on the basic
communications network infrastructure of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In the
absence open access and public data, rumors and fear have reigned supreme.
During provisional research on the country's censorship regime, we found
initial indicators that telecommunications entities in Iran allowed private
addresses to route domestically, whether intentionally or unintentionally,
creating a hidden network only reachable within the country. Moreover, records
such as DNS entries lend evidence of a 'dual stack' approach, wherein servers
are assigned a domestic IP addresses, in addition to a global one. Despite the
clear political implications of the claim we put forward, particularly in light
of rampant speculation regarding the mandate of Article 46 of the 'Fifth Five
Year Development Plan' to establish a "national information network," we
refrain from hypothesizing the purpose of this structure. In order to solicit
critical feedback for future research, we outline our initial findings and
attempt to demonstrate that the matter under contention is a nation-wide
phenomenom that warrants broader attention.
