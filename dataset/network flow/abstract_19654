As a streak of dye is advected by a chaotic flow, it stretches and folds and
becomes indistinguishable from a one-dimensional idealized material line. The
variation along a material line of the total stretching experienced by fluid
elements is examined, and it is found that it can be decomposed into an overall
time-dependent factor, constant along the line, and a smooth time-independent
deviation. The stretching is related by a power law to the curvature of the
line near sharp bends. This is confirmed numerically and motivated by a simple
model. A conservation law for Lyapunov exponents explains deviations from a
power-law.
