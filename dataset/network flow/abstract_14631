We obtain self-similar solutions that describe the dynamics of a
self-gravitating, rotating, viscous system. We use simplifying assumptions; but
explicitly include viscosity and the cooling due to the dissipation of energy.
By assuming that the turbulent dissipation of energy is as power law of the
density and the speed v_{rms} and for a power-law dependence of viscosity on
the density, pressure, and rotational velocity, we investigate turbulent
cooling flows. It has been shown that for the cylindrically and the spherically
cooling flows the similarity indices are the same, and they depend only on the
exponents of the dissipation rate and the viscosity model. Depending on the
values of the exponents, which the mechanisms of the dissipation and viscosity
determine them, we may have solutions with different general physical
properties. The conservation of the total mass and the angular momentum of the
system strongly depends on the mechanisms of energy dissipation and the
viscosity model.
