In this paper, we study the connectivity in one-dimensional ad hoc wireless
networks with an fixed access point. In recent years, various closed
expressions for the probability of connectivity on one-dimensional networks
(interval graphs) have been derived by many researchers. We will provide some
numerical validation for them by means of extensive simulations.
