We consider the induction of magnetic field in flows of electrically
conducting fluid at low magnetic Prandtl number and large kinetic Reynolds
number. Using the separation between the magnetic and kinetic diffusive
lengthscales, we propose a new numerical approach. The coupled magnetic and
fluid equations are solved using a mixed scheme, where the magnetic field
fluctuations are fully resolved and the velocity fluctuations at small scale
are modelled using a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) scheme. We study the response
of a forced Taylor-Green flow to an externally applied field: tology of the
mean induction and time fluctuations at fixed locations. The results are in
remarkable agreement with existing experimental data; a global $1/f$ behavior
at long times is also evidenced.
