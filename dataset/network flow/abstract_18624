The concept of continuous-time random walks (CTRW) is a generalization of
ordinary random walk models, and it is a powerful tool for investigating a
broad spectrum of phenomena in natural, engineering, social and economic
sciences. Recently, several theoretical approaches have been developed that
allowed to analyze explicitly dynamics of CTRW at all times, which is
critically important for understanding mechanisms of underlying phenomena.
However, theoretical analysis has been done mostly for systems with a simple
geometry. Here we extend the original method based on generalized master
equations to analyze all-time dynamics of CTRW models on complex networks.
Specific calculations are performed for models on lattices with branches and
for models on coupled parallel-chain lattices. Exact expressions for velocities
and dispersions are obtained. Generalized fluctuations theorems for CTRW models
on complex networks are discussed.
