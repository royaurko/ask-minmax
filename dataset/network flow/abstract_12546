We consider a number of `honest' mobile agents which are initially scattered
in an asynchronous network. In the network there is also a hostile mobile agent
that is able to block the agents' movements. The honest agents need to meet
(rendezvous) at a node. We study this problem under a weakest scenario in which
the agents do not have any information about the size of the network or their
number, they do not have distinct identities, they cannot see or communicate
with each-other unless they are at the same node, and they only have constant
memory. We give a universal distributed deterministic algorithm that solves the
problem for any number of more than two honest agents in oriented rings, and
for any odd number of agents in unoriented rings, despite the existence of a
malicious agent. We prove that the problem is unsolvable in any other
configuration in a ring network. Then, we study the problem in an oriented mesh
network and we prove that the problem can be solved if and only if the honest
agents initially form a connected configuration without holes and they can see
at a distance two. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to
study such a weak setting with a malicious agent in which the aim of the honest
agents is to achieve a task in the `trusted' subnetwork, i.e., in the part of
the network where the malicious agent has no access.
