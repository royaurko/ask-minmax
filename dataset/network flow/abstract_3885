A single neuron is known to generate almost identical spike trains when the
same fluctuating input is repeatedly applied. Here, we study the reliability of
spike firing in a pulse-coupled network of oscillator neurons receiving
fluctuating inputs. We can study the precise responses of the network as
synchronization between uncoupled copies of the network by a common noisy
input. To study the noise-induced synchronization between networks, we derive a
self-consistent equation for the distribution of spike-time differences between
the networks. Solving this equation, we elucidate how the spike precision
changes as a function of the coupling strength.
