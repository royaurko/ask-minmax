This note is devoted to optimal spectral estimates for Schr\"odinger
operators on compact connected Riemannian manifolds without boundary. These
estimates are based on the use of appropriate interpolation inequalities and on
some recent rigidity results for nonlinear elliptic equations on those
manifolds.
