We investigate transport effects in in situ studies of defined model
catalysts using a multi-scale modeling approach integrating first-principles
kinetic Monte Carlo simulations into a fluid dynamical treatment. We
specifically address two isothermal flow setups: i) a channel flow with the
gas-stream approaching the single crystal from the side, as is representative
for reactor scanning tunneling microscopy experiments; and ii) a stagnation
flow with perpendicular impingement. Using the CO oxidation at RuO2 (110) as
showcase we obtain substantial variations in the gas-phase pressures between
the inlet and the catalyst surface. In the channel geometry the mass transfer
limitations lead furthermore to pronounced lateral changes in surface
composition across the catalyst surface. This prevents the aspired direct
relation between activity and catalyst structure. For the stagnation flow the
lateral variations are restricted to the edges of the catalyst. This allows to
access the desired structure-activity relation using a simple model.
