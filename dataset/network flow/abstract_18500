Both IEEE 802.15.4 and 802.15.4a standards allow for dynamic channel
allocation and use of multiple channels available at their physical layers but
its MAC protocols are designed only for single channel. Also, sensor's
transceivers such as CC2420 provide multiple channels and as shown in [1], [2]
and [3] channel switch latency of CC2420 transceiver is just about 200$\mu$s.
In order to enhance both energy efficiency and to shorten end to end delay, we
propose, in this report, a spectrum-efficient frequency allocation schemes that
are able to statically assign control channels and dynamically reuse data
channels for Personal Area Networks (PANs) inside a Large-Scale WSN based on
UWB technology.
