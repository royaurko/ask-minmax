The conformal geometry of the Schwarzian Davey-Stewartson II hierarchy and
its discrete analogue is investigated. Connections with discrete and continuous
isothermic surfaces and generalised Clifford configurations are recorded. An
interpretation of the Schwarzian Davey-Stewartson II flows as integrable
deformations of conformally immersed surfaces is given.
