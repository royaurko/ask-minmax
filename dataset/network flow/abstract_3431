A variety of scale-free networks have been created since the pioneer work by
A.-L. Barab\'{a}si and R. Albert. All this networks are homogeneous since they
are composed of the same kind of nodes. In the realistic world, however, one
element (node or vertex) in the network may play different roles and hence has
different functions. In this Letter, we develop a new kind of network to
account for this property. In our model, each type of nodes may exhibit a
scaling law in the degree distribution and the scaling exponents are
adjustable. As a consequence, the whole network lacks of such scaling
characteristics, which indicates that many previous statistical results based
on empirical data that claimed to be scale-free networks may need to be
reexamined. This model poses an alternative way of the network division other
than the module method. Besides, one can expect that this new network will
exhibit some interesting properties concerning the dynamical processes on it.
