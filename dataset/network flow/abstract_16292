We consider the application of the two-loop functional renormalization-group
(fRG) approach to study the low-dimensional Hubbard model. This approach
accounts for both, the universal and non-universal contributions to the RG
flow. While the universal contributions were studied previously within the
field-theoretical RG for the one-dimensional Hubbard model with linearized
electronic dispersion and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with flat Fermi
surface, the non-universal contributions appear to be important for the flow of
the vertices and susceptibilities at large momenta scales. The two-loop fRG
approach is also applied to the two-dimensional Hubbard model with a curved
Fermi surface and the van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. The vertices
and susceptibilities in the end of the flow of the two-loop approch are
suppressed in comparison with both the one-loop approach with vertex projection
and the modified one-loop approach with corrected vertex projection errors. The
results of the two-loop approach are closer to the results of one-loop approach
with the projected vertices, the difference of the results of one- and two-loop
fRG approaches decreases when going away from the van Hove band filling. The
quasiparticle weight remains finite in two dimensions at not too low
temperatures above the paramagnetic ground state.
