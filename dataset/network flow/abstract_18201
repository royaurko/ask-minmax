Based on cluster de-synchronization properties of phase oscillators, we
introduce an efficient method for the detection and identification of modules
in complex networks. The performance of the algorithm is tested on computer
generated and real-world networks whose modular structure is already known or
has been studied by means of other methods. The algorithm attains a high level
of precision, especially when the modular units are very mixed and hardly
detectable by the other methods, with a computational effort ${\cal O}(KN)$ on
a generic graph with $N$ nodes and $K$ links.
