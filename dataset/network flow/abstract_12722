This paper shows that structured transmission schemes are a good choice for
secret communication over interference networks with an eavesdropper.
Structured transmission is shown to exploit channel asymmetries and thus
perform better than randomly generated codebooks for such channels. For a class
of interference channels, we show that an equivocation sumrate that is within
two bits of the maximum possible legitimate communication sum-rate is
achievable using lattice codes.
