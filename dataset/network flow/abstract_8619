Google's PageRank method was developed to evaluate the importance of
web-pages via their link structure. The mathematics of PageRank, however, are
entirely general and apply to any graph or network in any domain. Thus,
PageRank is now regularly used in bibliometrics, social and information network
analysis, and for link prediction and recommendation. It's even used for
systems analysis of road networks, as well as biology, chemistry, neuroscience,
and physics. We'll see the mathematics and ideas that unite these diverse
applications.
