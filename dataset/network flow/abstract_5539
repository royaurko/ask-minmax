Computer experiments are performed to investigate why protein contact
networks (networks induced by spatial contacts between amino acid residues of a
protein) do not have shorter average shortest path lengths in spite of their
importance to protein folding. We find that shorter average inter-nodal
distances is no guarantee of finding a global optimum more easily. Results from
the experiments also led to observations which parallel an existing view that
neither short-range nor long-range interactions dominate the protein folding
process. Nonetheless, runs where there was a slight delay in the use of
long-range interactions yielded the best search performance. We incorporate
this finding into the optimization function by giving more weight to
short-range links. This produced results showing that randomizing long-range
links does not yield better search performance than protein contact networks au
natural even though randomizing long-range links significantly reduces average
path lengths and retains much of the clustering and positive degree-degree
correlation inherent in protein contact networks. Hence there can be
explanations, other than the excluded volume argument, beneath the topological
limits of protein contact networks.
