Four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with unitary gauge groups
and matter in the adjoint and fundamental representations give rise to a series
of non-trivial fixed points with an ADE classification. Many of these models
exhibit generalizations of Seiberg duality. Upon compactification on a
two-torus with suitable background fields for global U(1) symmetries, they flow
at long distances to two dimensional theories with (0,2) supersymmetry. We
study these theories, focusing on the two dimensional analogs of the four
dimensional dualities.
