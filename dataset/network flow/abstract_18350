We propose to demonstrate a mobile server assisted P2P system for on-demand
video streaming. Our proposed solution uses a combination of 3G and ad-hoc
Wi-Fi connections, to enable mobile devices to download content from a
centralised server in a way that minimises the 3G bandwidth use and cost. On
the customised GUI, we show the corresponding reduction in 3G bandwidth
achieved by increasing the number of participating mobile devices in the
combined P2P and ad-hoc Wi- Fi network, while demonstrating the good video
playout quality on each of the mobiles. We also demonstrate the implemented
trust mechanism which enables mobiles to only use trusted adhoc connections.
The system has been implemented on Android based smartphones.
