Network management systems based on mobile agents are efficiently a better
alternative than typical client/server based architectures. Centralized
management models like SNMP or CMIP based management models suffer from
scalability and flexibility issues which are addressed to great extent by flat
bed or static mid-level manager models based on mobile agents, yet the use of
mobile agents to distribute and delegate management tasks for above stated
agent-based management frameworks like initial flat bed models and static
mid-level managers cannot efficiently meet the demands of current networks
which are growing in size and complexity. In view of the above mentioned
limitations, we proposed a domain partitioned network management model based-on
mobile agent & Element Management Systems in order to minimize management data
flow to a centralized server. Intelligent agent allocated to specific EMS
performs local network management and reports the results to the superior
manager and finally the global manager performs global network management using
those submitted management results. Experimental results of various scenarios
of the proposed model have been presented to support the arguments given in
favor of the prototype system based on mobile agents.
