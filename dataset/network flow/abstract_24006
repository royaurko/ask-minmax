A double percolation transition is identified in a binary network composed of
nanoparticles of magnesium diborade superconductor and chromium oxide
half-metallic ferromagnet. Anomalously high-resistance or insulating state, as
compared to the conducting or superconducting states in single-component
systems of either constituent, is observed between two distinct percolation
thresholds. This double percolation effect, which is especially pronounced at
liquid helium temperatures, is controlled by composite volume fraction and
originates from the suppressed interface conduction and tunneling between
nanoparticles of different species. We investigate the scaling behavior near
both percolation thresholds, and determine the distinct critical exponents
associated with two different types of transitions.
