MOTIVATION: A central goal of postgenomic biology is the elucidation of the
regulatory relationships among all cellular constituents that together comprise
the 'genetic network' of a cell or microorganism. Experimental manipulation of
gene activity coupled with the assessment of perturbed transcriptome (i. e.,
global mRNA expression) patterns represents one approach toward this goal, and
may provide a backbone into which other measurements can be later integrated.
  RESULT: We use microarray data on 287 single gene deletion Saccharomyces
cerevisiae mutant strains to elucidate generic relationships among perturbed
transcriptomes. Their comparison with a method that preferentially recognizes
distinct expression subpatterns allows us to pair those transcriptomes that
share localized similarities. Analyses of the resulting transcriptome
similarity network identify a continuum hierarchy among the deleted genes, and
in the frequency of local similarities that establishes the links among their
reorganized transcriptomes. We also find a combinatorial utilization of shared
expression subpatterns within individual links, with increasing quantitative
similarity among those that connect transcriptome states induced by the
deletion of functionally related gene products. This suggests a distinct
hierarchical and combinatorial organization of the S. cerevisiae
transcriptional activity, and may represent a pattern that is generic to the
transcriptional organization of all eukaryotic organisms.
