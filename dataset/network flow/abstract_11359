Models of dynamic networks --- networks that evolve over time --- have
manifold applications. We develop a discrete-time generative model for social
network evolution that inherits the richness and flexibility of the class of
exponential-family random graph models. The model --- a Separable Temporal ERGM
(STERGM) --- facilitates separable modeling of the tie duration distributions
and the structural dynamics of tie formation. We develop likelihood-based
inference for the model, and provide computational algorithms for maximum
likelihood estimation. We illustrate the interpretability of the model in
analyzing a longitudinal network of friendship ties within a school.
