In everyday life, we often observe unusually frequent interactions among
people before or during important events, e.g., we receive/send more greetings
from/to our friends on Christmas Day, than usual. We also observe that some
videos suddenly go viral through people's sharing in online social networks
(OSNs). Do these seemingly different phenomena share a common structure?
  All these phenomena are associated with sudden surges of user activities in
networks, which we call "bursts" in this work. We find that the emergence of a
burst is accompanied with the formation of triangles in networks. This finding
motivates us to propose a new method to detect bursts in OSNs. We first
introduce a new measure, "triadic cardinality distribution", corresponding to
the fractions of nodes with different numbers of triangles, i.e., triadic
cardinalities, within a network. We demonstrate that this distribution changes
when a burst occurs, and is naturally immunized against spamming social-bot
attacks. Hence, by tracking triadic cardinality distributions, we can reliably
detect bursts in OSNs. To avoid handling massive activity data generated by OSN
users, we design an efficient sample-estimate solution to estimate the triadic
cardinality distribution from sampled data. Extensive experiments conducted on
real data demonstrate the usefulness of this triadic cardinality distribution
and the effectiveness of our sample-estimate solution.
