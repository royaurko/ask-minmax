This paper reviews some of the principal uses, over almost seven decades, of
correlations, in both Eulerian and Lagrangian frames of reference, of
properties of turbulent flows at variable spatial locations and variable time
instants. Commonly called space--time correlations, they have been fundamental
to theories and models of turbulence as well as for the analyses of
experimental and direct numerical simulation turbulence data.
