A new cellular automaton (CA) traffic model is presented. The focus is on
mechanical restrictions of vehicles realized by limited acceleration and
deceleration capabilities. These features are incorporated into the model in
order to construct the condition of collision-free movement. The strict
collision-free criterion imposed by the mechanical restrictions is softened in
certain traffic situations, reflecting human overreaction. It is shown that the
present model reliably reproduces most empirical findings including
synchronized flow, the so-called {\it pinch effect}, and the time-headway
distribution of free flow. The findings suggest that many free flow phenomena
can be attributed to the platoon formation of vehicles ({\it platoon effect})
