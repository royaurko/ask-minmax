A Sensor network generally has a large number of sensor nodes that are
deployed at some audited site. In most sensor networks the nodes are static.
Nevertheless, node connectivity is subject to changes because of disruptions in
wireless communication, transmission power changes, or loss of synchronization
between neighbouring nodes, so there is a need to maintain synchronization
between the neighbouring nodes in order to have efficient communication. Hence
even after a sensor is aware of its immediate neighbours, it must continuously
maintain its view a process we call continuous neighbour discovery. In this
proposed work we are maintaining synchronization between neighbouring nodes so
that the sensor network will be always active.
