A random sequential box-covering algorithm recently introduced to measure the
fractal dimension in scale-free networks is investigated. The algorithm
contains Monte Carlo sequential steps of choosing the position of the center of
each box, and thereby, vertices in preassigned boxes can divide subsequent
boxes into more than one pieces, but divided boxes are counted once. We find
that such box-split allowance in the algorithm is a crucial ingredient
necessary to obtain the fractal scaling for fractal networks; however, it is
inessential for regular lattice and conventional fractal objects embedded in
the Euclidean space. Next the algorithm is viewed from the cluster-growing
perspective that boxes are allowed to overlap and thereby, vertices can belong
to more than one box. Then, the number of distinct boxes a vertex belongs to is
distributed in a heterogeneous manner for SF fractal networks, while it is of
Poisson-type for the conventional fractal objects.
