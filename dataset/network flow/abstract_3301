This paper investigates the nature of the development of two-dimensional
laminar flow of an incompressible fluid at the reversed stagnation-point. ". In
this study, we revisit the problem of reversed stagnation-point flow over a
flat plate. Proudman and Johnson (1962) first studied the flow and obtained an
asymptotic solution by neglecting the viscous terms. This is no true in
neglecting the viscous terms within the total flow field. In particular it is
pointed out that for a plate impulsively accelerated from rest to a constant
velocity V0 that a similarity solution to the self-similar ODE is obtained
which is noteworthy completely analytical.
