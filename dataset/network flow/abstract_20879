Wireless Body Area Sensor Network (WBASN) is a technology employed mainly for
patient health monitoring. New research is being done to take the technology to
the next level i.e. player's fatigue monitoring in sports. Muscle fatigue is
the main cause of player's performance degradation. This type of fatigue can be
measured by sensing the accumulation of lactic acid in muscles. Excess of
lactic acid makes muscles feel lethargic. Keeping this in mind we propose a
protocol \underline{TH}reshold based \underline{E}nergy-efficient
\underline{FA}tigue \underline{ME}asurement (THE-FAME) for soccer players using
WBASN. In THE-FAME protocol, a composite parameter has been used that consists
of a threshold parameter for lactic acid accumulation and a parameter for
measuring distance covered by a particular player. When any parameters's value
in this composite parameter shows an increase beyond threshold, the players is
declared to be in a fatigue state. The size of battery and sensor should be
very small for the sake of players' best performance. These sensor nodes,
implanted inside player's body, are made energy efficient by using multiple
sinks instead of a single sink. Matlab simulation results show the
effectiveness of THE-FAME.
