We study the dynamics of gene activities in relatively small size biological
networks (up to a few tens of nodes), e.g. the activities of cell-cycle
proteins during the mitotic cell-cycle progression. Using the framework of
deterministic discrete dynamical models, we characterize the dynamical
modifications in response to structural perturbations in the network
connectivities. In particular, we focus on how perturbations affect the set of
fixed points and sizes of the basins of attraction. Our approach uses two
analytical measures: the basin entropy $H$ and the perturbation size $\Delta$,
a quantity that reflects the distance between the set of fixed points of the
perturbed network to that of the unperturbed network. Applying our approach to
the yeast-cell cycle network introduced by Li \textit{et al.} provides a low
dimensional and informative fingerprint of network behavior under large classes
of perturbations. We identify interactions that are crucial for proper network
function, and also pinpoints functionally redundant network connections.
Selected perturbations exemplify the breadth of dynamical responses in this
cell-cycle model.
