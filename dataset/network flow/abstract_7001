We discuss the holographic counterpart of a recent conjecture regarding
R-symmetric RG-flows in four-dimensional supersymmetric field theories. In such
theories, a quantity \tau_U can be defined at the fixed points which was
conjectured in arXiv:1109.3279 to be larger in the UV than in the IR,
\tau_U^{UV} > \tau_U^{IR}. We analyze this conjecture from a dual supergravity
perspective: using some general properties of domain wall solutions dual to
R-symmetric RG flows, we define a bulk quantity which interpolates between the
correct \tau_U at the UV and IR fixed points, and study its monotonicity
properties in a class of examples. We find a monotonic behavior for theories
flowing to an interacting IR fixed point. For gapped theories, the monotonicity
is still valid up to a finite value of the radial coordinate where the function
vanishes, reflecting the gap scale of the field theory.
