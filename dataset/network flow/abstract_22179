We formulate a linear response theory of the spin Seebeck effect, i.e., a
spin voltage generation from heat current flowing in a ferromagnet. Our
approach focuses on the collective magnetic excitation of spins, i.e., magnons.
We show that the linear-response formulation provides us with a qualitative as
well as quantitative understanding of the spin Seebeck effect observed in a
prototypical magnet, yttrium iron garnet.
