A study of ripple formation on sapphire surfaces by 300-2000 eV Ar+ ion
bombardment is presented. Surface characterization by in-situ synchrotron
grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering and ex-situ atomic force
microscopy is performed in order to study the wavelength of ripples formed on
sapphire (0001) surfaces. We find that the wavelength can be varied over a
remarkably wide range-nearly two orders of magnitude-by changing the ion
incidence angle. Within the linear theory regime, the ion induced viscous flow
smoothing mechanism explains the general trends of the ripple wavelength at low
temperature and incidence angles larger than 30. In this model, relaxation is
confined to a few-nm thick damaged surface layer. The behavior at high
temperature suggests relaxation by surface diffusion. However, strong smoothing
is inferred from the observed ripple wavelength near normal incidence, which is
not consistent with either surface diffusion or viscous flow relaxation.
