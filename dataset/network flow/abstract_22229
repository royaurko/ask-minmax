We report on recent progress of the implementation of the similarity
renormalization group (SRG) for three-body interactions in a one-dimensional,
bosonic model system using the plane wave basis. We discuss our implementation
of the flow equations and show results that confirm that results in the
three-body sector remain unchanged by the transformation of the Hamiltonian. We
also show how the SRG transformation decouples low- from high-momentum nodes in
the three-body sector and therefore simplifies the numerical calculation of
observables.
