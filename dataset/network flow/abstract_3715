Red blood cells (RBCs) are the major component of blood and the flow of blood
is dictated by that of RBCs. We employ vesicles, which consist of closed
bilayer membranes enclosing a fluid, as a model system to study the behavior of
RBCs under a confined Poiseuille flow. We extensively explore two main
parameters: i) the degree of confinement of vesicles within the channel, and
ii) the flow strength. Rich and complex dynamics for vesicles are revealed
ranging from steady-state shapes (in the form of parachute and slipper) to
chaotic dynamics of shape. Chaos occurs through a cascade of multiple periodic
oscillations of the vesicle shape. We summarize our results in a phase diagram
in the parameter plane (degree of confinement, flow strength). This finding
highlights the level of complexity of a flowing vesicle in the small Reynolds
number where the flow is laminar in the absence of vesicles and can be rendered
turbulent due to elasticity of vesicles.
