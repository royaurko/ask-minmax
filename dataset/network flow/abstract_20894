This paper studies online shortest-path routing over dynamic multi-hop
networks. Link costs or delays are time-varying and modeled by independent and
identically distributed random processes, whose parameters are initially
unknown. The parameters, and hence the optimal path, can only be estimated by
routing packets through the network and observing the realized delays. Our aim
is to find a routing policy that minimizes the regret (the cumulative delay
difference) between the path chosen by the policy and the unknown optimal path.
We formulate the problem as a combinatorial bandit optimization problem and
consider several scenarios that differ in where routing decisions are made and
in the information available when making the decision. For each scenario, we
derive the tight asymptotic lower bound on the regret that has to be satisfied
by any online routing policy. These bounds help us to understand the
performance improvements we can expect when (i) taking routing decisions at
each hop rather than at the source only, and (ii) observing per-link costs
rather than aggregate path costs. In particular, we show that (i) is of no use
while (ii) can have a spectacular impact. Three algorithms, with a trade-off
between computational complexity and performance, are proposed. The regret
upper bounds of these algorithm improve over those of the existing algorithms,
and they significantly outperform the-state-of-art algorithm in numerical
experiments.
