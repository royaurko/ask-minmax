We analyze the steady radial accretion of matter into a nonrotating black
hole. Neglecting the self-gravity of the accreting matter, we consider a rather
general class of static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat
background spacetimes with a regular horizon. In addition to the Schwarzschild
metric, this class contains certain deformation of it which could arise in
alternative gravity theories or from solutions of the classical Einstein
equations in the presence of external matter fields. Modeling the ambient
matter surrounding the black hole by a relativistic perfect fluid, we
reformulate the accretion problem as a dynamical system, and under rather
general assumptions on the fluid equation of state, we determine the local and
global qualitative behavior of its phase flow. Based on our analysis and
generalizing previous work by Michel, we prove that for any given positive
particle density number at infinity, there exists a unique radial, steady-state
accretion flow which is regular at the horizon. We determine the physical
parameters of the flow, including its accretion and compression rates, and
discuss their dependency on the background metric.
