Although there is a rich literature on the rate of occupational mobility,
there are important gaps in understanding patterns of movement among
occupations. We employ a network based approach to explore occupational
mobility of the Romanian university graduates in the first years after
graduation (2003 - 2008). We use survey data on their career mobility to build
an empirical occupational mobility network (OMN) that covers all their job
movements in the considered period. We construct the network as directed and
weighted. The nodes are represented by the occupations (post coded at 3 digits
according to ISCO-88) and the links are weighted with the number of persons
switching from one occupation to another. This representation of data permits
us to use the novel statistical techniques developed in the framework of
weighted directed networks in order to extract a set of stylized facts that
highlight patterns of occupational mobility: centrality, network motifs.
