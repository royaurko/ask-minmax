We are studying some fundamental properties of the interface between control
and data planes in Information-Centric Networks. We try to evaluate the traffic
between these two planes based on allowing a minimum level of acceptable
distortion in the network state representation in the control plane. We apply
our framework to content distribution, and see how we can compute the overhead
of maintaining the location of content in the control plane. This is of
importance to evaluate content-oriented network architectures: we identify
scenarios where the cost of updating the control plane for content routing
overwhelms the benefit of fetching a nearby copy. We also show how to minimize
the cost of this overhead when associating costs to peering traffic and to
internal traffic for operator-driven CDNs.
