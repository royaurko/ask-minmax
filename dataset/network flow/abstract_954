In our previous work, we have shown that many of the properties of the
Florida power grid are reproduced by deterministic network growth models based
on the minimization of energy dissipation $E_\mathrm{diss}$. As there is no $a~
priori$ best $E_\mathrm{diss}$ minimizing growth model, we here present a tool,
called the "centrality fingerprint," for probing the behavior of different
growth models. The centrality fingerprints are comparisons of the current flow
into/out of the network with the values of various centrality measures
calculated at every step of the growth process. Finally, we discuss
applications to the Maryland power grid.
