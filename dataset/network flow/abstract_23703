Competitive exclusion, a key principle of ecology, can be generalized to
understand many other complex systems. Individuals under surviving pressure
tend to be different from others, and correlations among them change
correspondingly to the updating of their states. We show with numerical
simulation that these aptitudes can contribute to group formation or speciation
in social fields. Moreover, they can lead to power-law topological correlations
of complex networks. By coupling updating states of nodes with variation of
connections in a network, structural properties with power-laws and functions
like multifractality, spontaneous ranking and evolutionary branching of node
states can emerge out simultaneously from the present self-organized model of
coevolutionary process.
