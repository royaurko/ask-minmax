We consider instanton solutions of Euclidean Horava-Lifshitz gravity in four
dimensions satisfying the detailed balance condition. They are described by
geometric flows in three dimensions driven by certain combinations of the
Cotton and Ricci tensors as well as the cosmological-constant term. The
deformation curvature terms can have competing behavior leading to a variety of
fixed points. The instantons interpolate between any two fixed points, which
are vacua of topologically massive gravity with Lambda > 0, and their action is
finite. Special emphasis is placed on configurations with SU(2) isometry
associated with homogeneous but generally non-isotropic Bianchi IX model
geometries. In this case, the combined Ricci-Cotton flow reduces to an
autonomous system of ordinary differential equations whose properties are
studied in detail for different couplings. The occurrence and stability of
isotropic and anisotropic fixed points are investigated analytically and some
exact solutions are obtained. The corresponding instantons are classified and
they are all globally R x S^3 and complete spaces. Generalizations to
higher-dimensional gravities are also briefly discussed.
