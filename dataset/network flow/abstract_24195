The objective of the paper is to identify laws and mechanisms that allow the
creation of more order from disorder using natural means i.e., without the help
of conscious beings. While this is not possible for the collection of all
dynamical systems as it violates the second law of thermodynamics, I show that
this is possible within a special subset called stable parallel looped (SPL)
dynamical systems. I identify a new infinite family of physical and chemical
dynamical SPL systems, which are (a) easy to create naturally and (b) easy to
merge, link and combine to create dynamical systems of any specified
complexity. Within SPL systems, I propose a special collection of designs
called active material-energy looped systems using which it is possible to
generate large-scale ordered chemical networks, like the metabolic networks, in
a reliable, repeatable, iterative and natural manner. The resulting SPL systems
provide a new theoretical framework for the problem of origin of life.
