Based on the structure of Casimir elements associated with general Hopf
algebras there are constructed Liouville-Arnold integrable flows related with
naturally induced Poisson structures on arbitrary co-algebra and their
deformations. Some interesting special cases including the oscillatory
Heisenberg-Weil algebra related co-algebra structures and adjoint with them
integrable Hamiltonian systems are considered.
