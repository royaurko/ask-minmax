Although the machine to machine (M2M) communication has been emerging in
recent years, many vendors' specific proprietary solutions are not suitable for
vital M2M applications. While the main focus of those solutions is management
and provisioning of machines, real-time monitoring and communication control
are also required to handle a variety of access technologies, like WiFi and
LTE, and unleash machine deployment. In this paper, we present a new
architecture addressing these issues by leveraging the IP Multimedia Subsystem
(IMS) deployed in operator's networks for RCS and VoLTE.
