We examine microscopic mechanisms for coupling stochastic oscillators so that
they display similar and correlated temporal variations. Unlike oscillatory
motion in deterministic dynamical systems, complete synchronization of
stochastic oscillators does not occur, but appropriately defined oscillator
phase variables coincide. This is illustrated in model chemical systems and
genetic networks that produce oscillations in the dynamical variables, and we
show that suitable coupling of different networks can result in their phase
synchronization.
