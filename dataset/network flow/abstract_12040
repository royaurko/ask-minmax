We show that the collapsed globular phase of a polymer accommodates a
scale-free incompatibility graph of its contacts. The degree distribution of
this network is found to decay with the exponent $\gamma = 1/(2-c)$ up to a
cut-off degree $d_c \propto L^{2-c}$, where $c$ is the loop exponent for dense
polymers ($c=11/8$ in two dimensions) and $L$ is the length of the polymer. Our
results exemplify how a scale-free network (SFN) can emerge from standard
criticality.
