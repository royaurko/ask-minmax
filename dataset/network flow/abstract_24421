We explore the effect of all-optical feedback on the steady state dynamics of
optomechanical arrays arising from various topologies. First we consider an
array comprised of a pair of independent optomechanical cavities coupled
reversibly via their optical modes. Next we consider an optomechanical network
formed from coupling two optical modes with interactions mediated via a common
mechanical mode. Finally we extend the analysis to a large network of N-coupled
optomechanical systems. Our results show implementing an-all optical feedback
loop in each arrangement can enhance the degree of steady state entanglement
between inter cavity optical and mechanical modes.
