Warped astrophysical discs are usually treated as laminar viscous flows,
which have anomalous properties when the disc is nearly Keplerian and the
viscosity is small: fast horizontal shearing motions and large torques are
generated, which cause the warp to evolve rapidly, in some cases at a rate that
is inversely proportional to the viscosity. However, these flows are often
subject to a linear hydrodynamic instability, which may produce small-scale
turbulence and modify the large-scale dynamics of the disc. We use a warped
shearing sheet to compute the oscillatory laminar flows in a warped disc and to
analyse their linear stability by the Floquet method. We find widespread
hydrodynamic instability deriving from the parametric resonance of inertial
waves. Even very small, unobservable warps in nearly Keplerian discs of low
viscosity can be expected to generate hydrodynamic turbulence, or at least wave
activity, by this mechanism.
