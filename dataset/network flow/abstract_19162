Conventional TCP performance is significantly impaired under long latency
and/or constrained bandwidth. While small Pacific Island states on satellite
links experience this in the extreme, small populations and remoteness often
rule out submarine fibre connections and their communities struggle to reap the
benefits of the Internet. Network-coded TCP (TCP/NC) can increase goodput under
high latency and packet loss, but has not been used to tunnel conventional TCP
and UDP across satellite links before. We report on a feasibility study aimed
at determining expected goodput gain across such TCP/NC tunnels into island
targets on geostationary and medium earth orbit satellite links.
