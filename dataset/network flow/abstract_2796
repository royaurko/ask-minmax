The real monetary economy is grounded upon monetary flow equilibration or the
activity of actualizing monetary flow continuity at each economic agent except
for the central bank. Every update of monetary flow continuity at each agent
constantly causes monetary flow equilibration at the neighborhood agents. Every
monetary flow equilibration as the activity of shooting the mark identified as
monetary flow continuity turns out to be off the mark, and constantly generate
the similar activities in sequence. Monetary flow equilibration ceaselessly
reverberating in the economy performs two functions. One is to seek an
organization on its own, and the other is to perturb the ongoing organization.
Monetary flow equilibration as the agency of seeking and perturbing its
organization also serves as a means of predicting its behavior. The likely
organizational behavior could be the one that remains most robust against
monetary flow equilibration as an agency of applying perturbations.
