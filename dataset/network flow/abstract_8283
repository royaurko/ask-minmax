Correlation between nodes is found to be a common and important property in
many complex networks. Here we investigate degree correlations of the
Barabasi-Albert (BA) Scale-Free model with both analytical results and
simulations, and find two neighboring regions, a disassortative one for low
degrees and a neutral one for high degrees. The average degree of the neighbors
of a randomly picked node is expected to diverge in the limit of infinite
network size. As an generalization of the concept of correlation, we also study
the correlations of other scalar properties, including age and clustering
coefficient. Finally we propose a correlation measurement in bipartite
networks.
