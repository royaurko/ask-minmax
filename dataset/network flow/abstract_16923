The aim of this chapter is twofold. In the first part we will provide a brief
overview of the mathematical and statistical foundations of graphical models,
along with their fundamental properties, estimation and basic inference
procedures. In particular we will develop Markov networks (also known as Markov
random fields) and Bayesian networks, which comprise most past and current
literature on graphical models. In the second part we will review some
applications of graphical models in systems biology.
