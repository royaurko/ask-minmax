We study a mesoscopic model for the flow of amorphous solids. The model is
based on the key features identified at the microscopic level, namely peri- ods
of elastic deformation interspersed with localised rearrangements of parti-
cles that induce long-range elastic deformation. These long-range deformations
are derived following a continuum mechanics approach, in the presence of solid
boundaries, and are included in full in the model. Indeed, they mediate spatial
cooperativity in the flow, whereby a localised rearrangement may lead a distant
region to yield. In particular, we simulate a channel flow and find
manifestations of spatial cooperativity that are consistent with published
experimental obser- vations for concentrated emulsions in microchannels. Two
categories of effects are distinguished. On the one hand, the coupling of
regions subject to different shear rates, for instance,leads to finite shear
rate fluctuations in the seemingly un- sheared "plug" in the centre of the
channel. On the other hand, there is convinc- ing experimental evidence of a
specific rheology near rough walls. We discuss diverse possible physical
origins for this effect, and we suggest that it may be associated with the
bumps of particles into surface asperities as they slide along the wall.
