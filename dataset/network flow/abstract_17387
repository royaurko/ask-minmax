Using the scattering transform for $n^{th}$ order linear scalar operators,
the Poisson bracket found by Gel'fand and Dikii, which generalizes the Gardner
Poisson bracket for the KdV hierarchy, is computed on the scattering side.
Action-angle variables are then constructed. Using this, complete integrability
is demonstrated in the strong sense. Real action-angle variables are
constructed in the self-adjoint case.
