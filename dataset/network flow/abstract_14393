Let S be a nonexceptional oriented surface of finite type. We construct an
uncountable family of probability measures on the space of area on holomorphic
quadratic differentials over the moduli space for S containing the usual
Lebesgue measure. These measures are invariant under the Teichmueller geodesic
flow, and they are mixing, absolutely continuous with respect to the stable and
unstable foliation adn exponentially recurrent to a compact set. Finally we
show that the critical exponent of the mapping class group equals the dimension
of the Teichmueller space for S. Moreover, this critical exponent coincides
with the the logarithmic asymptotic of the number of closed Teichmueller
geodesics in moduli space which meet a sufficiently large compact set.
