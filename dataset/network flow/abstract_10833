The plasma brake is a thin negatively biased tether which has been proposed
as an efficient concept for deorbiting satellites and debris objects from low
Earth orbit. We simulate the interaction with the ionospheric plasma ram flow
with the plasma brake tether by a high performance electrostatic particle in
cell code to evaluate the thrust. The tether is assumed to be perpendicular to
the flow. We perform runs for different tether voltage, magnetic field
orientation and plasma ion mass. We show that a simple analytical thrust
formula reproduces most of the simulation results well. The interaction with
the tether and the plasma flow is laminar (i.e., smooth and not turbulent) when
the magnetic field is perpendicular to the tether and the flow. If the magnetic
field is parallel to the tether, the behaviour is unstable and thrust is
reduced by a modest factor. The case when the magnetic field is aligned with
the flow can also be unstable, but does not result in notable thrust reduction.
We also fix an error in an earlier reference. According to the simulations, the
predicted thrust of the plasma brake is large enough to make the method
promising for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite deorbiting. As a numerical
example we estimate that a 5 km long plasma brake tether weighing 0.055 kg
could produce 0.43 mN breaking force which is enough to reduce the orbital
altitude of a 260 kg object mass by 100 km during one year.
