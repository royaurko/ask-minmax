As Moore's Law continues to fuel the ability to build ever increasingly
complex system-on-chips (SoCs), achieving performance goals is rising as a
critical challenge to completing designs. In particular, the system
interconnect must efficiently service a diverse set of data flows with widely
ranging quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. However, the known solutions for
off-chip interconnects such as large-scale networks are not necessarily
applicable to the on-chip environment. Latency and memory constraints for
on-chip interconnects are quite different from larger-scale interconnects. This
paper introduces a novel on-chip interconnect arbitration scheme. We show how
this scheme can be distributed across a chip for high-speed implementation. We
compare the performance of the arbitration scheme with other known interconnect
arbitration schemes. Existing schemes typically focus heavily on either low
latency of service for some initiators, or alternatively on guaranteed
bandwidth delivery for other initiators. Our scheme allows service latency on
some initiators to be traded off smoothly against jitter bounds on other
initiators, while still delivering bandwidth guarantees. This scheme is a
subset of the QoS controls that are available in the SonicsMX? (SMX) product.
