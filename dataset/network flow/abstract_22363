The existing Levy-Zhang approach to constructing the contribution to the
resistivity of a magnetic domain wall is explored. The model equations are
integrated analytically, giving a closed form expression for the resistivity
when the current flows in the wall. The Boltzmann equation is solved
analytically and the ratio of the spin up and spin down resistivities is
calculated and its dependence on the strength of the Coulomb and exchange
scattering potentials is elucidated.
