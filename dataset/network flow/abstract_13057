We investigate the formation of singularities in a self-similar form of
regular solutions of the Localized Induction Approximation (also referred as to
the binormal flow). This equation appears as an approximation model for the
self-induced motion of a vortex filament in an inviscid incompressible fluid.
The solutions behave as 3d-logarithmic spirals at infinity.
  The proofs of the results are strongly based on the existing connection
between the binormal flow and certain Schr\"odinger equations.
