With the rapid advancement of wireless network technology, usage of WSN in
real time applications like military, forest monitoring etc. found increasing.
Generally WSN operate in an unattended environment and handles critical data.
Authenticating the user trying to access the sensor memory is one of the
critical requirements. Many researchers have proposed remote user
authentication schemes focusing on various parameters. In 2013, Li et al.
proposed a temporal-credential-based mutual authentication and key agreement
scheme for WSNs. Li et al. claimed that their scheme is secure against all
major cryptographic attacks and requires less computation cost due to usage of
hash function instead encryption operations. Unfortunately, in this paper we
will show that their scheme is vulnerable to offline password guessing attack,
stolen smart card attack, leakage of password etc. and failure to provide data
privacy.
