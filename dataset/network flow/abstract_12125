We use the lac operon in Escherichia coli as a prototype system to illustrate
the current state, applicability, and limitations of modeling the dynamics of
cellular networks. We integrate three different levels of description
-molecular, cellular, and that of cell population- into a single model, which
seems to capture many experimental aspects of the system.
