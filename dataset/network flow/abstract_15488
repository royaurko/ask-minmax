In this paper, we present a novel method for a base station (BS) to estimate
the total downlink interference power received by any given mobile receiver,
without information feedback from the user or information exchange between
neighbouring BSs. The prediction method is deterministic and can be computed
rapidly. This is achieved by first abstracting the cellular network into a
mathematical model, and then inferring the interference power received at any
location based on the power spectrum measurements taken at the observing BS.
The analysis expands the methodology to a $\mathsf{K}$-tier heterogeneous
network and demonstrates the accuracy of the technique for a variety of
sampling densities. The paper demonstrates the methodology by applying it to an
opportunistic transmission technique that avoids transmissions to channels
which are overwhelmed by interference. The simulation results show that the
proposed technique performs closely or better than existing interference
avoidance techniques that require information exchange, and yields a 30%
throughput improvement over baseline configurations.
