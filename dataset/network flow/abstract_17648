We provide a gravity counterpart of the theorem by Hofman and Strominger that
in (1+1) dimension, chiral scale invariance indicates chiral conformal
invariance. We show that the strict null energy condition gives a sufficient
condition to guarantee the symmetry enhancement. We also investigate a
possibility to construct holographic c-function that decreases along the
holographic renormalization group flow.
