Online Social Networks (OSN) are a permanent presence in today's personal and
professional lives of a huge segment of the population, with direct
consequences to offline activities. Built on a foundation of trust-users
connect to other users with common interests or overlapping personal
trajectories-online social networks and the associated applications extract an
unprecedented volume of personal information. Unsurprisingly, serious privacy
and security risks emerged, positioning themselves along two main types of
attacks: attacks that exploit the implicit trust embedded in declared social
relationships; and attacks that harvest user's personal information for
ill-intended use. This article provides an overview of the privacy and security
issues that emerged so far in OSNs. We introduce a taxonomy of privacy and
security attacks in OSNs, we overview existing solutions to mitigate those
attacks, and outline challenges still to overcome.
