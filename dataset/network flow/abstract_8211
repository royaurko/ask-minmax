The leading paradigm for chaotic flows dominated by dissipation predicts an
exponential growth of the mean distance between pairs of fluid elements, in the
long run. This is reflected in the analysis of experimental results on tracer
particles and the discussions which follow, as reported in recent experimental
and numerical publications. To quantitatively validate this prediction, we have
conducted a microfluidic experiment generating elastic turbulence, a flow
characterised in the literature as smooth in space and random in time. To our
great surprise, we discovered that the pair separation follows a much slower
power-law --- also known as ballistic --- a notion overlooked so far for flows
of this type. We provide conclusive experimental evidence that this scaling is
well-desribed by the same coefficients derived from the short-time dynamics.
Our finding reinforces the role of the ballistic regime over a significant
range in time and space, providing a quantitative estimation for the spreading
of particles in mixing microfluidic flows based on the initial velocity
snapshot. Finally we note that the conditions for the asymptotic exponential
pair separation are quite stringent when it comes to tracer particles and are
unlikely to be realised in wall-bounded flows. Therefore this work raises
questions regarding the relevance and applicability of the currently leading
paradigm.
