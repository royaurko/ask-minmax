Recent work in inter-jet energy flow has identified a class of leading
logarithms previously not considered in the literature. These so-called
non-global logarithms have been shown to have significant numerical impact on
gaps-between-jets calculations at the energies of current particle colliders.
Here we calculate, at fixed order and to all orders, the effect of applying
clustering to the gluonic final state responsible for these logarithms for a
trivial colour flow 2 jet system. Such a clustering algorithm has already been
used for experimental measurements at HERA. We find that the impact of the
non-global logarithms is reduced, but not removed, when clustering is demanded,
a result which is of considerable interest for energy flow observable
calculations.
