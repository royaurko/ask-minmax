We introduce a new model for rill erosion. We start with a network similar to
that in the Discrete Web and instantiate a dynamics which makes the process
highly non-Markovian. The behavior of nodes in the streams is similar to the
behavior of Polya urns with time-dependent input. In this paper we use a
combination of rigorous arguments and simulation results to show that the model
exhibits many properties of rill erosion; in particular, nodes which are deeper
in the network tend to switch less quickly.
