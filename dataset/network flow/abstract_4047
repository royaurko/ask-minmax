We review the production and flow of identified hadrons at RHIC with a main
emphasis on the intermediate transverse momentum region ($2< p_{T} <5$
GeV/$c$). The goal is to unravel the dynamics of baryon production and resolve
the anomalously large baryon yields and elliptic flow observed in the
experiments.
