We investigate the optimal carrier sensing threshold in random CSMA/CA
networks considering the effect of binary exponential backoff. We propose an
iterative algorithm for optimizing the carrier sensing threshold and hence
maximizing the area spectral efficiency. We verify that simulations are
consistent with our analytical results.
