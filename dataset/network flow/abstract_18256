The behavior of some stochastic chemical reaction networks is largely
unaffected by slight inaccuracies in reaction rates. We formalize the
robustness of state probabilities to reaction rate deviations, and describe a
formal connection between robustness and efficiency of simulation. Without
robustness guarantees, stochastic simulation seems to require computational
time proportional to the total number of reaction events. Even if the
concentration (molecular count per volume) stays bounded, the number of
reaction events can be linear in the duration of simulated time and total
molecular count. We show that the behavior of robust systems can be predicted
such that the computational work scales linearly with the duration of simulated
time and concentration, and only polylogarithmically in the total molecular
count. Thus our asymptotic analysis captures the dramatic speedup when
molecular counts are large, and shows that for bounded concentrations the
computation time is essentially invariant with molecular count. Finally, by
noticing that even robust stochastic chemical reaction networks are capable of
embedding complex computational problems, we argue that the linear dependence
on simulated time and concentration is likely optimal.
