Service composition enables customizable services to be provided to the
service consumers. Since the capabilities and the performances of mobile
devices (e.g., smart phone, PDA, handheld media player) have improved, a mobile
device can be utilized to interact with external mobile service providers
towards providing composite Web service to remote clients. Existing approaches
on mobile-hosted service composition are usually platform dependent, and rely
on centralized infrastructure. Such approaches are not feasible in an open,
mobile infrastructure-less environment, in which networked services are
implemented using different technologies, devices are capable of dynamically
joining or leaving the network, and a centralized management entity is
nonexistent. This paper proposes a solution to enable mobile Web service
composition in an open, infrastructure-less environment based on loosely
coupled SOA techniques.
