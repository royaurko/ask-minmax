The effects of a large-scale shear on the energy spectrum of a passively
advected scalar field are investigated. The shear is superimposed on a
turbulent isotropic flow, yielding an Obukhov-Corrsin $k^{-5/3}$ scalar
spectrum at small scales. Shear effects appear at large scales, where a
different, anisotropic behavior is observed. The scalar spectrum is shown to
behave as $k^{-4/3}$ for a shear fixed in intensity and direction. For other
types of shear characteristics, the slope is generally intermediate between the
-5/3 Obukhov-Corrsin's and the -1 Batchelor's values. The physical mechanisms
at the origin of this behaviour are illustrated in terms of the motion of
Lagrangian particles. They provide an explanation to the scalar spectra shallow
and dependent on the experimental conditions observed in shear flows at
moderate Reynolds numbers.
