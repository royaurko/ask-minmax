A new formalism for electromagnetic and mechanical momenta in a metamaterial
is developed by means of the technique of wave-packet integrals. The medium has
huge mass density and can therefore be regarded as almost stationary upon
incident electromagnetic waves. A clear identification of momentum density and
momentum flow, including their electromagnetic and mechanical parts, is
obtained by employing this formalism in a lossless dispersive metamaterial
(including the cases of impedance matching and mismatching with vacuum). It is
found that the ratio of the electromagnetic momentum density to the mechanical
momentum density depends on the impedance and group velocity of the
electromagnetic wave inside the metamaterial. One of the definite results is
that both the electromagnetic momentum and the mechanical momentum in the
metamaterial are in the same direction as the energy flow, instead of in the
direction of the wave vector. The conservation of total momentum is verified.
In addition, the law of energy conservation in the process of normal incidence
is also verified by using the wave-packet integral of both the electromagnetic
energy density and the electromagnetic power density, of which the latter is
caused by the interaction between the induced (polarized) currents and the
electromagnetic wave.
