Observations of the H66a recombination line from the ionized gas in the
cluster of newly formed massive stars, G10.6-0.4, show that most of the
continuum emission derives from the dense gas in an ionized accretion flow that
forms an ionized disk or torus around a group of stars in the center of the
cluster. The inward motion observed in the accretion flow suggests that despite
the equivalent luminosity and ionizing radiation of several O stars, neither
radiation pressure nor thermal pressure has reversed the accretion flow. The
observations indicate why the radiation pressure of the stars and the thermal
pressure of the HII region are not effective in reversing the accretion flow.
The observed rate of the accretion flow, 0.001 solar masses/yr, is sufficient
to form massive stars within the time scale imposed by their short main
sequence lifetimes. A simple model of disk accretion relates quenched HII
regions, trapped hypercompact HII regions, and photo-evaporating disks in an
evolutionary sequence.
