We present an overview of measurements related to open heavy-flavour
production with the ALICE experiment at the LHC. Studies are performed using
single leptons (electrons at mid-rapidity and muons at forward-rapidity) and D
mesons, which are reconstructed via their hadronic decay channels. The measured
differential production cross sections in proton-proton collisions at
$\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 and 7 TeV are in agreement with perturbative QCD
calculations. Results from Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV on
the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ are shown, along with the elliptic
flow $\nu_2$.
