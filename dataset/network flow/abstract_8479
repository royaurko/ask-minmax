The model of community isolation was extended to the case when individuals
are randomly placed at nodes of hierarchical modular networks. It was shown
that the average number of blocked nodes (individuals) increases in time as a
power function, with the exponent depending on network parameters. The
distribution of time when the first isolated cluster appears is unimodal,
non-gaussian. The developed analytical approach is in a good agreement with the
simulation data.
