The study of the optimal constant in an Hessian-type Sobolev inequality leads
to a fully nonlinear boundary value problem, overdetermined with non standard
boundary conditions. We show that all the solutions have ellipsoidal symmetry.
In the proof we use the maximum principle applied to a suitable auxiliary
function in conjunction with an entropy estimate from affine curvature flow.
