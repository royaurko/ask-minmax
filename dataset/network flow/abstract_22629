We develop a fully Bayesian, computationally efficient framework for
incorporating model uncertainty into Type II Tobit models and apply this to the
investigation of the determinants of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). While
direct evaluation of modelprobabilities is intractable in this setting, we show
that by using conditional Bayes Factors, which nest model moves inside a Gibbs
sampler, we are able to incorporate model uncertainty in a straight-forward
fashion. We conclude with a study of global FDI flows between 1988-2000.
