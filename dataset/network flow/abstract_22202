In the spectral theory of positive elliptic operators, an important role is
played by certain smoothing kernels, related to the Fourier transform of the
trace of a wave operator, which may be heuristically interpreted as smoothed
spectral projectors asymptotically drifting to the right of the spectrum. In
the setting of Toeplitz quantization, we consider analogues of these, where the
wave operator is replaced by the Hardy space compression of a linearized
Hamiltonian flow, possibly composed with a family of zeroth order Toeplitz
operators. We study the local asymptotics of these smoothing kernels, and
specifically how they concentrate on the fixed loci of the linearized dynamics.
