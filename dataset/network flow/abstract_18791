Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) is a provisional solution for Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) security loopholes present in already widely deployed
legacy 802.11 wireless devices. In this work, we model and analyse the
computational complexity of TKIP security mechanism and propose an optimised
implementation, called LOTKIP, to decrease processing overhead for better
energy efficient security performance. The LOTKIP improvements are based on
minimising key mixing redundancy and a novel frame encapsulation with low
overhead. We simulate and compare LOTKIP with baseline TKIP in terms of
complexity and energy consumption for ad hoc wireless network security. From
simulation results, we demonstrate that LOTKIP executes with lower
computational complexity, hence, with faster encryption time and more
energy-efficient.
