Given any embedded Lagrangian on a four dimensional compact Calabi-Yau, we
find another Lagrangian in the same Hamiltonian isotopy class which develops a
finite time singularity under mean curvature flow. This contradicts a weaker
version of the Thomas-Yau conjecture regarding long time existence and
convergence of Lagrangian mean curvature flow.
