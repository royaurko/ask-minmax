In this letter we propose a scheme for the preparation of steady
entanglements in bosonic dissipative networks. We describe its implementation
in a system of coupled cavities interacting with an engineered reservoir built
up of three-level atoms. Emblematic bipartite ($Bell$ and $NOON$) and
multipartite $W$-class states can be produced with high fidelity and purity.
