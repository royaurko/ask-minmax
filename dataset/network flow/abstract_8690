We describe a relation between Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary condition and a
global elliptic boundary condition which naturally appears in formulating a
splitting formula for a spectral flow, when we decompose the manifold into two
components. Then we give a variant of the splitting formula with the Hoermander
index as a correction term.
