Wireless Mesh Network is presented as an appealing solution for bridging the
digital divide between developed and under-developed regions. But the planning
and deployment of these networks are not just a technical matter, since the
success depends on many other factors tied to the related region. Although we
observe some deployments, to ensure usefulness and sustainability, there is
still a need of concrete design process model and proper network planning
approach for rural regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper
presents a design methodology to provide network connectivity from a landline
node in a rural region at very low cost. We propose a methodology composed of
ten steps, starting by a deep analysis of the region in order to identify
relevant constraints and useful applications to sustain local activities and
communication. Approach for planning the physical architecture of the network
is based on an indoor-outdoor deployment for reducing the overall cost of the
network.
