In the first part of this paper, we generalize the results of the contributor
\cite{Liu,Liu2} from the random flow case to the random semiflow case, i.e. we
obtain Conley decomposition theorem for infinite dimensional random dynamical
systems. In the second part, by introducing the backward orbit for random
semiflow, we are able to decompose invariant random compact set (e.g. global
random attractor) into random Morse sets and connecting orbits between them,
which generalizes the Morse decomposition of invariant sets originated from
Conley \cite{Con} to the random semiflow setting and gives the positive answer
to an open problem put forward by Caraballo and Langa \cite{CL}.
