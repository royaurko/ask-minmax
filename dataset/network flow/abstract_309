Classifying network traffic according to their application-layer protocols is
an important task in modern networks for traffic management and network
security. Existing payload-based or statistical methods of application
identification cannot meet the demand of both high performance and accurate
identification at the same time. We propose an application identification
framework that classifies traffic at aggregate-flow level leveraging
aggregate-flow cache. A detailed traffic classifier designed based on this
framework is illustrated to improve the throughput of payload-based
identification methods. We further optimize the classifier by proposing an
efficient design of aggregate-flow cache. The cache design employs a
frequency-based, recency-aware replacement algorithm based on the analysis of
temporal locality of aggregate-flow cache. Experiments on real-world traces
show that our traffic classifier with aggregate-flow cache can reduce up to 95%
workload of backend identification engine. The proposed cache replacement
algorithm outperforms well-known replacement algorithms, and achieves 90% of
the optimal performance using only 15% of memory. The throughput of a
payload-based identification system, L7-filter [1], is increased by up to 5.1
times by using our traffic classifier design.
