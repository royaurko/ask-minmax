We present a real-world testbed for research and development in vehicular
networking that has been deployed successfully in the sea port of Leix\~oes in
Portugal. The testbed allows for cloud-based code deployment, remote network
control and distributed data collection from moving container trucks, cranes,
tow boats, patrol vessels and roadside units, thereby enabling a wide range of
experiments and performance analyses. After describing the testbed architecture
and its various modes of operation, we give concrete examples of its use and
offer insights on how to build effective testbeds for wireless networking with
moving vehicles.
