We propose an uncoordinated all-to-all broadcast protocol for periodic
messages in vehicular networks based on coded slotted ALOHA (CSA). Unlike
classical CSA, each user acts as both transmitter and receiver in a half-duplex
mode. As in CSA, each user transmits its packet several times. The half-duplex
mode gives rise to an interesting design trade-off: the more the user repeats
its packet, the higher the probability that this packet is decoded by other
users, but the lower the probability for this user to decode packets from
others. We compare the proposed protocol with carrier sense multiple access
with collision avoidance, currently adopted as a multiple access protocol for
vehicular networks. The results show that the proposed protocol greatly
increases the number of users in the network that reliably communicate with
each other. We also provide analytical tools to predict the performance of the
proposed protocol.
