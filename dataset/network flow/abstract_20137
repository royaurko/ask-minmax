We employ a relativistic transport theory to describe the fireball expansion
of the matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (uRHICs).
Developing an approach to fix locally the shear viscosity to entropy density
$\eta/s$, we study the impact of a temperature dependent $\eta/s(T)$ on the
build-up of the elliptic flow, $v_2$, a measure of the angular anisotropy in
the particle production. Beam Energy Scan from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= \rm 62.4 GeV$ at
RHIC up to 2.76 TeV at LHC has shown that the $v_2(p_T)$ as a function of the
transverse momentum $p_T$ appears to be nearly invariant with energy. We show
that such a surprising behavior is determined by a rise and fall of $\eta/s(T)$
with a minimum at $T\sim T_c$, as one would expect if the matter undergoes a
phase transition or a cross-over. This provides an evidence for phase
transition occurring in the uRHIC's and a first constraint on the temperature
dependence of $\eta/s$. In particular, a constant $\eta/s$ at all temperatures
or a too strong T-dependence would cause a breaking of the scaling of
$v_2(p_T)$ with the energy.
