We discuss gauge symmetry and Ward-Takahashi identities for Wilsonian flows
in pure Yang-Mills theories. The background field formalism is used for the
construction of a gauge invariant effective action. The symmetries of the
effective action under gauge transformations for both the gauge field and the
auxiliary background field are separately evaluated. We examine how the
symmetry properties of the full theory are restored in the limit where the
cut-off is removed.
