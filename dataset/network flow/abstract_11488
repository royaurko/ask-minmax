Small-world networks describe many important practical systems among which
neural networks consisting of excitable nodes are the most typical ones. In
this paper we study self-sustained oscillations of target waves in excitable
small-world networks. A novel dominant phase-advanced driving (DPAD) method,
which is generally applicable for analyzing all oscillatory complex networks
consisting of nonoscillatory nodes, is proposed to reveal the self-organized
structures supporting this type of oscillations. The DPAD method explicitly
explores the oscillation sources and wave propagation paths of the systems,
which are otherwise deeply hidden in the complicated patterns of randomly
distributed target groups. Based on the understanding of the self-organized
structure, the oscillatory patterns can be controlled with extremely high
efficiency.
