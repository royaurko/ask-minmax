Most networks found in social and biochemical systems have modular
structures. An important question prompted by the modularity of these networks
is whether nodes can be said to belong to a single group. If they cannot, we
would need to consider the role of "overlapping communities." Despite some
efforts in this direction, the problem of detecting overlapping groups remains
unsolved because there is neither a formal definition of overlapping community,
nor an ensemble of networks with which to test the performance of group
detection algorithms when nodes can belong to more than one group. Here, we
introduce an ensemble of networks with overlapping groups. We then apply three
group identification methods--modularity maximization, k-clique percolation,
and modularity-landscape surveying--to these networks. We find that the
modularity-landscape surveying method is the only one able to detect
heterogeneities in node memberships, and that those heterogeneities are only
detectable when the overlap is small. Surprisingly, we find that the k-clique
percolation method is unable to detect node membership for the overlapping
case.
