We consider all Test matches played between 1877 and 2010 and One Day
International (ODI) matches played between 1971 and 2010. We form directed and
weighted networks of teams and also of their captains. The success of a team
(or captain) is determined by the 'quality' of wins and not on the number of
wins alone. We apply the diffusion based PageRank algorithm on the networks to
access the importance of wins and rank the teams and captains respectively. Our
analysis identifies {\it Australia} as the best team in both forms of cricket
$-$ Test and ODI. {\it Steve Waugh} is identified as the best captain in Test
cricket and {\it Ricky Ponting} is the best captain in the ODI format. We also
compare our ranking scheme with the existing ranking schemes which include the
Reliance ICC Ranking. Our method does not depend on `external' criteria in
ranking of teams (captains). The purpose of this paper is to introduce a
revised ranking of cricket teams and to quantify the success of the captains.
