The proton elliptic flow in collisions of Ca on Ca at energies from 30 to 100
MeV/nucleon is studied in an isospin-dependent transport model. With increasing
incident energy, the elliptic flow shows a transition from positive to negative
flow. Its magnitude depends on both the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and the
nucleon-nucleon scattering cross section. Different elliptic flows are obtained
for a stiff EOS with free nucleon-nucleon cross sections and a soft EOS with
reduced nucleon-nucleon cross sections, although both lead to vanishing
in-plane transverse flow at the same balance energy. The study of both in-plane
and elliptic flows at intermediate energies thus provides a means to extract
simultaneously the information on the nuclear equation of state and the
nucleon-nucleon scattering cross section in medium.
