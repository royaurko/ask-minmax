We introduce a new optimization framework to maximize the expected spread of
cascades in networks. Our model allows a rich set of actions that directly
manipulate cascade dynamics by adding nodes or edges to the network. Our
motivating application is one in spatial conservation planning, where a cascade
models the dispersal of wild animals through a fragmented landscape. We propose
a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation that combines elements from
network design and stochastic optimization. Our approach results in solutions
with stochastic optimality guarantees and points to conservation strategies
that are fundamentally different from naive approaches.
