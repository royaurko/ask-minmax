The different types of instabilities of free cylinders (diameter $D$, length
$L$) have been studied in a viscous flow (velocity $U$) between parallel
vertical walls of horizontal width $W$ at a distance $H$: the influence of the
confinement parameters $D/H$ and $L/W$ has been investigated. As $D/H$
increases, there is a transition from stable flow to oscillations transverse to
the walls and then to a fluttering motion with oscillations of the angle of the
axis with respect to the horizontal. The two types of oscillations may be
superimposed in the transition domain. The frequency $f$ of the transverse
oscillations is independent of the lateral confinement $L/W$ in the range:
0.055 \le L/W \le 0.94$ for a given cylinder velocity $V_{cx}$ and increases
only weakly with $V_{cx}$. These results are accounted for by assuming a 2D
local flow over the cylinder with a characteristic velocity independent of
$L/W$ for a given $V_{cx}$ value. The experimental values of $f$ are also
independent of the transverse confinement $D/H$. The frequency $f_f$ of the
fluttering motion is significantly lower than $f$: $f_f$ is also nearly
independent of the cylinder diameter and of the flow velocity but decreases
significantly as $L/W$ increases. The fluttering instability is then rather a
3D phenomenon involving the full length of the cylinder and the clearance
between its ends and the side walls.
