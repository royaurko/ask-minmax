The event-plane method, which is widely used to analyze anisotropic flow in
nucleus-nucleus collisions, is known to be biased by nonflow effects,especially
at high $p_t$. Various methods (cumulants, Lee-Yang zeroes) have been proposed
to eliminate nonflow effects, but their implementation is tedious, which has
limited their application so far. In this paper, we show that the
Lee-Yang-zeroes method can be recast in a form similar to the standard
event-plane analysis. Nonflow correlations are strongly suppressed by using the
information from the length of the flow vector, in addition to the event-plane
angle. This opens the way to improved analyses of elliptic flow and
azimuthally-sensitive observables at RHIC and LHC.
