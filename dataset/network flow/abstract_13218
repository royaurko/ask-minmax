A study of 50 supergranular cells obtained from SOHO Dopplergrams was
undertaken in order to investigate the relationship between the lifetime ($T$)
and the horizontal flow velocity ($v_h$) of the cells. For this sample we find
that the two parameters are correlated with a relation $v_h\propto T^{0.5}$ and
$T$ is identified with the eddy turn-over time. This is in agreement with the
turbulent convective model of the solar atmosphere where the velocity spectrum
of supergranular field given by '$v_h \propto L^{1/3}$' can be identified with
the Kolmogorov spectrum for the eddy size $L$.
