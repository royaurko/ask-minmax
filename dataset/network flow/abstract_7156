A network belongs to the monotone separable class if its state variables are
homogeneous and monotone functions of the epochs of the arrival process.
  This framework, which was first introduced to derive the stability region for
stochastic networks with stationary and ergodic driving sequences, is
revisited. It contains several classical queueing network models, including
generalized Jackson networks, max-plus networks, polling systems, multiserver
queues, and various classes of stochastic Petri nets. Our purpose is the
analysis of the tails of the stationary state variables in the particular case
of i.i.d. driving sequences. For this, we establish general comparison
relationships between networks of this class and the GI/GI/1/\infty queue.
  We first use this to show that two classical results of the asymptotic theory
for GI/GI/1/\infty queues can be directly extended to this framework.
  The first one concerns the existence of moments for the stationary state
variables. We establish that for all \alpha\geq 1, the (\alpha+1)-moment
condition for service times is necessary and sufficient for the existence of
the \alpha-moment for the stationary maximal dater (typically the time to empty
the network when stopping further arrivals) in any network of this class. The
second one is a direct extension of Veraverbeke's tail asymptotic for the
stationary waiting times in the GI/GI/1/\infty queue.
