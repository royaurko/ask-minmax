Using a functional renormalization group we compute the flow of the
renormalized impurity potential for a single impurity in a Luttinger liquid
over the entire energy range - from the microscopic scale of a lattice-fermion
model down to the low-energy limit. The non-perturbative method provides a
complete real-space picture of the effective impurity potential. We confirm the
universality of the open chain fixed point, but it turns out that very large
systems (10^4-10^5 sites) are required to reach the fixed point for realistic
choices of the impurity and interaction parameters.
