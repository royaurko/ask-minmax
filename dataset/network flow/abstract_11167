In this work we present a protocol for self-synchronized duty-cycling in
wireless sensor networks with energy harvesting capabilities. The protocol is
implemented in Wiselib, a library of generic algorithms for sensor networks.
Simulations are conducted with the sensor network simulator Shawn. They are
based on the specifications of real hardware known as iSense sensor nodes. The
experimental results show that the proposed mechanism is able to adapt to
changing energy availabilities. Moreover, it is shown that the system is very
robust against packet loss.
