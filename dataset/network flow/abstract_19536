We generalize the earlier theory by Fredrickson [J. Rheol. v.38, 1045 (1994)]
to study the orientational behaviour of the hexagonal phase of diblock
copolymer melt subjected to steady shear flow. We use symmetry arguments to
show that the orientational ordering in the hexagonal phase is a much weaker
effect than in the lamellae. We predict the parallel orientation to be stable
at low and the perpendicular orientation at high shear rates. Our analysis
reproduces the experimental results by Tepe et al. [Macromolecules v.28, 3008
(1995)] and explains the difficulties in experimental observation of the
different orientations in the hexagonal phase.
