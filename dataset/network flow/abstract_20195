In this paper we explore the fast rotation, nonhydrostatic limit of the
rotating and stratified Boussinesq equations. We derive new reduced equations
for the slow dynamics that describe Taylor-Proudman flows. One new aspect of
the dynamics is a decoupling of the horizontal kinetic energy, described by 2D
Navier-Stokes, from new dynamics that describe the coupling of vertical kinetic
energy and buoyancy. We support the theory with high resolution numerical
simulations of the full Boussinesq equations that, in this limit, reveal the
spontaneous formation of Taylor-Proudman columns and their dynamics.
