We present a numerically efficient method to reconstruct a disordered network
of thin biopolymers, such as collagen gels, from three-dimensional (3D) image
stacks recorded with a confocal microscope. Our method is based on a template
matching algorithm that simultaneously performs a binarization and
skeletonization of the network. The size and intensity pattern of the template
is automatically adapted to the input data so that the method is scale
invariant and generic. Furthermore, the template matching threshold is
iteratively optimized to ensure that the final skeletonized network obeys a
universal property of voxelized random line networks, namely, solid-phase
voxels have most likely three solid-phase neighbors in a $3\times3$
neighborhood. This optimization criterion makes our method free of user-defined
parameters and the output exceptionally robust against imaging noise.
