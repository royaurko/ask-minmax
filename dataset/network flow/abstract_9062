The study of complex networks has drawn much attention over the last years,
mainly by virtue of its potential to characterize the most diverse systems
through unified mathematical and computational tools. Not long ago the emphasis
on this field mostly focused on the effects of the structural properties on the
global behavior of a dynamical process taking place in the system. Recently,
some studies started to unveil the richness of interactions that occur between
groups of nodes when we look at the small scale of interactions occurring in
the network. Such findings call for a new systematic methodology to quantify,
at node level, how a dynamics is being influenced (or differentiated) by the
structure of the underlying system. Here we present a first step towards this
direction, in which we define a new measurement that, based on dynamical
characteristics obtained for a large set of initial conditions, compares the
dynamical behavior of the nodes present in the system. Through this measurement
we find the high capacity of networks, generated by the geographic and
Barab\'asi-Albert models, to exhibit groups of nodes with distinct dynamics
compared to the rest of the network. We also present a practical application of
the methodology by using the neuronal network of the nematode
\emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}, where we show that the interneurons of the
ventral cord presents a very large dynamical differentiation when compared to
the rest of the network.
