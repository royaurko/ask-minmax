Reduction in the operating voltage of electrooptic modulators is needed in
order to remove the bottleneck in the flow of data between electronics and
optical interconnects. We report experimental demonstration of a 10 fold
reduction in an electrooptic modulator's half-wave voltage up to 50 GHz. This
was achieved by employing optical sideband-only amplification.
