The current functionality supported by OpenFlowbased software defined
networking (SDN) includes switching, routing, tunneling, and some basic fire
walling while operating on traffic flows. However, the semantics of SDN do not
allow for other operations on the traffic, nor does it allow operations at a
higher granularity. In this work, we describe a method to expand the SDN
framework to add other network primitives. In particular, we present a method
to integrate different network elements (like cache, proxy etc). Here, we focus
on storage and caching, but our method could be expanded to other functionality
seamlessly. We also present a method to identify content so as to perform
per-content policy, as opposed to per flow policy. We have implemented the
proposed mechanisms to demonstrate its feasibility.
