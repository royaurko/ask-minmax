We study the impact of a localized defect in a cellular automaton model for
traffic flow which exhibits metastable states and phase separation. The defect
is implemented by locally limiting the maximal possible flow through an
increase of the deceleration probability. Depending on the magnitude of the
defect three phases can be identified in the system. One of these phases shows
the characteristics of stop-and-go traffic which can not be found in the model
without lattice defect. Thus our results provide evidence that even in a model
with strong phase separation stop-and-go traffic can occur if local defects
exist. From a physical point of view the model describes the competition
between two mechanisms of phase separation.
