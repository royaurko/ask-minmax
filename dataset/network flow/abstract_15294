Online discussion boards are an important medium for collaboration. The goal
of our work is to understand how messages and individual discussants contribute
to Q&A discussions. We present a novel network model for capturing in-formation
roles of messages and discussants, and show how we identify useful answers to
the initial question. We first classify information seeking or information
providing roles of messages, such as question, answer or acknowledgement. We
also identify user intent in the discussion as an information seeker or a
provider. We capture such role information within a reply-to discussion
network, and identify messages that answer seeker questions and how answeres
are acknowledged. Message influences are analyzed using B-centrality measures.
User influences across different threads are combined with message influences.
We use the combined score in identifying the most useful answer in the thread.
The resulting ranks correlate with human provided ranks with an MRR score of
0.67.
