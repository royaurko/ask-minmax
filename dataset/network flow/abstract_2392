Theoretical advances in the study of non-equilibrium phenomena are briefly
reviewed with emphasis on steady state properties of one-dimensional driven
lattice gases. The presentation is focused on the totally asymmetric
simple-exclusion process (TASEP) with open boundary conditions: particles are
injected at the left end with rate alpha and removed at the right end with rate
beta. Depending on the values of these parameters, the model exhibits three
stationary phases, separated by lines of first- and second-order
non-equilibrium phase transitions. New simulation results on the power spectrum
of the fluctuating total number of particles in the different phases of the
system are presented. Our theoretical contribution concerns the approximate
evaluation of the power spectrum in the domain-wall picture of the coexisting
low- and high-density phases. Finally, we review some of our recent results on
the TASEP defined on an open network containing a double-chain section in the
middle. With the aid of a simple theory, which neglects correlations at the
junctions of the chain segments, the possible phase structures of the model are
found. Density profiles and nearest-neighbor correlations in the steady states
of the model at representative points of the phase diagram are obtained by
means of computer simulations. On the coexistence line cross-correlations are
found to exist between equivalent sites in the branches of the middle section.
