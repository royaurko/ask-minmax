We consider a multi-class queueing network as a model of packet transfer in a
communication network. We define a second stochastic model as a model document
transfer in a communication network where the documents transferred have a
general distribution. We prove the weak convergence of the multi-class queueing
process to the document transfer process. Our convergence result allows the
comparison of general document size distributions, and consequently, we prove
general insensitivity results for the limit queueing process.
