A class of discrete event synthesis problems can be reduced to solving
language equations f . X &sube; S, where F is the fixed component and S the
specification. Sequential synthesis deals with FSMs when the automata for F and
S are prefix closed, and are naturally represented by multi-level networks with
latches. For this special case, we present an efficient computation, using
partitioned representations, of the most general prefix-closed solution of the
above class of language equations. The transition and the output relations of
the FSMs for F and S in their partitioned form are represented by the sets of
output and next state functions of the corresponding networks. Experimentally,
we show that using partitioned representations is much faster than using
monolithic representations, as well as applicable to larger problem instances.
