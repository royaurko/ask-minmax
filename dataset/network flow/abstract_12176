We propose a simple real-valued generalization of the well known
integer-valued Erdos number as a topological, non-metric measure of the
`closeness' felt between two nodes in an undirected, weighted graph. These
real-valued Erdos numbers are asymmetric and are able to distinguish between
network topologies that standard distance metrics view as identical. We use
this measure to study some simple analytically tractable networks, and show the
utility of our measure to devise a ratings scheme based on the generalized
Erdos number that we deploy on the data from the NetFlix prize, and find a
significant improvement in our ratings prediction over a baseline.
