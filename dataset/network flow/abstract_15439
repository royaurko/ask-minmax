We use a simple dynamical model and explore coherent dynamics of wavepackets
in complex networks of optical fibers. We start from a symmetric lattice and
through the application of a Monte-Carlo criterion we introduce structural
disorder and deform the lattice into a small-world network regime. We
investigate in the latter both structural (correlation length) as well as
dynamical (diffusion exponent) properties and find that both exhibit a rapid
crossover from the ordered to the fully random regime. For a critical value of
the structural disorder parameter $\rho \approx 0.25$ transport changes from
ballistic to sub-diffusive due to the creation strongly connected local
clusters and channels of preferential transport in the small world regime.
