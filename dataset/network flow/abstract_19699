The study of the multi-strange production in the final state of
ultra-relativistic Au+Au collisions at top RHIC energy gives information on the
freeze-out conditions and probably on earlier stages of the collision. The
chemical freeze-out temperature as well as the strangeness phase space
occupancy factor gamma_s extracted from statistical models are studied as a
function of the collision centrality. Within the framework of a
hydrodynamically-inspired model the transverse collectivity of the collision is
investigated. In this view, multi-strange particles seem to develop significant
radial transverse flow. Furthermore, they present an elliptic flow as stronger
as previously measured baryons supporting the idea that a fraction of the final
collective motion has been developed at an early partonic stage of the
collision.
