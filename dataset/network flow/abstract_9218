Many real networks in nature and society share two generic properties: they
are scale-free and they display a high degree of clustering. We show that these
two features are the consequence of a hierarchical organization, implying that
small groups of nodes organize in a hierarchical manner into increasingly large
groups, while maintaining a scale-free topology. In hierarchical networks the
degree of clustering characterizing the different groups follows a strict
scaling law, which can be used to identify the presence of a hierarchical
organization in real networks. We find that several real networks, such as the
World Wide Web, actor network, the Internet at the domain level and the
semantic web obey this scaling law, indicating that hierarchy is a fundamental
characteristic of many complex systems.
