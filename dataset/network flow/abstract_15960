Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables flexible network resource
allocations for traffic engineering, but at the same time the scalability
problem becomes more serious since traffic is more difficult to be aggregated.
Those crucial issues in SDN have been studied for unicast but have not been
explored for multicast traffic, and addressing those issues for multicast is
more challenging since the identities and the number of members in a multicast
group can be arbitrary. In this paper, therefore, we propose a new multicast
tree for SDN, named Branch-aware Steiner Tree (BST). The BST problem is
difficult since it needs to jointly minimize the numbers of the edges and the
branch nodes in a tree, and we prove that it is NP-Hard and inapproximable
within $k$, which denotes the number of group members. We further design an
approximation algorithm, called Branch Aware Edge Reduction Algorithm (BAERA),
to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the trees obtained by
BAERA are more bandwidth-efficient and scalable than the shortest-path trees
and traditional Steiner trees. Most importantly, BAERA is computation-efficient
to be deployed in SDN since it can generate a tree on massive networks in small
time.
