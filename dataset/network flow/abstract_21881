I analyse the identified single-particle p_t spectra and two-pion
Bose-Einstein correlations from RHIC. They indicate a massive transverse
expansion and rather short lifetime of the system. The quantitative analysis in
framework of the blast-wave model yields, however, unphysical results and
suggests that the model may not be applicable in description of two-particle
correlations. I then discuss generalisations of the blast-wave model to
non-central collisions and the question how spatial asymmetry can be
disentangled from flow asymmetry in measurements of v_2 and azimuthally
sensitive HBT radii.
