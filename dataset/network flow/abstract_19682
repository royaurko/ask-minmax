We use a Grassmannian framework to define multi-component tau functions as
expectation values of certain multi-component Fermi operators satisfying simple
bilinear commutation relations on Clifford algebra. The tau functions contain
both positive and negative flows and are shown to satisfy the $2n$-component KP
hierarchy. The hierarchy equations can be formulated in terms of
pseudo-differential equations for $n \times n$ matrix wave functions derived in
terms of tau functions. These equations are cast in form of Sato-Wilson
relations. A reduction process leads to the AKNS, two-component Camassa-Holm
and Cecotti-Vafa models and the formalism provides simple formulas for their
solutions
