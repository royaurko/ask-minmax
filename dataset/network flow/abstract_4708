An approximate method to compute mean velocity profiles in turbulent flows is
developed. This approach is based on the equation connecting the Reynolds
stress and mean velocity. By using the measured values of pressure drop and
average (bulk) flow velocity, such characteristics of a turbulent flow as the
mean velocity and Reynolds stress distributions were calculated and compared
with the experimental measurements in different pipes and channels for various
fluids and gases. These show good agreement for a wide range of Reynolds
numbers.
