In this note, we relate the two well-known difficulties of Godunov schemes:
the carbuncle phenomena in simulating high Mach number flow, and the inaccurate
pressure profile in simulating low Mach number flow. We introduced two simple
low-Mach-number modifications for the classical Roe flux to decrease the
difference between the acoustic and advection contributions of the numerical
dissipation. While the first modification increases the local numerical
dissipation, the second decreases it. The numerical tests on the double-Mach
reflection problem show that both modifications eliminate the kinked Mach stem
suffered by the original flux. These results suggest that, other than
insufficient numerical dissipation near the shock front, the carbuncle
phenomena is strongly relevant to the non-comparable acoustic and advection
contributions of the numerical dissipation produced by Godunov schemes due to
the low Mach number effect.
