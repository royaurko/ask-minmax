We study the sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of a class of multi-layer
relay-aided MIMO broadcast networks with delayed channel state information at
transmitters (CSIT). In the assumed network a K-antenna source intends to
communicate to K single-antenna destinations, with the help of N-2 layers of K
full-duplex single-antenna relays. We consider two practical delayed CSIT
feedback scenarios. If the source can obtain the CSI feedback signals from all
layers, we prove the optimal sum DoF of the network to be K/(1+1/2+...+1/K). If
the CSI feedback is only within each hop, we show that when K=2 the optimal sum
DoF is 4/3, and when K >= 3 the sum DoF 3/2 is achievable. Our results reveal
that the sum DoF performance in the considered class of N-layer MIMO broadcast
networks with delayed CSIT may depend not on N, the number of layers in the
network, but only on K, the number of antennas/terminals in each layer.
