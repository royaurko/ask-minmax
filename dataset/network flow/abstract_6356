We present a method to generate realistic, three-dimensional networks of
crosslinked semiflexible polymers. The free energy of these networks is
obtained from the force-extension characteristics of the individual polymers
and their persistent directionality through the crosslinks. A Monte Carlo
scheme is employed to obtain isotropic, homogeneous networks that minimize the
free energy, and for which all of the relevant parameters can be varied: the
persistence length, the contour length as well as the crosslinking length may
be chosen at will. We also provide an initial survey of the mechanical
properties of our networks subjected to shear strains, showing them to display
the expected non-linear stiffening behavior. Also, a key role for non-affinity
and its relation to order in the network is uncovered.
