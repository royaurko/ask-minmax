In this paper, we study the two dimensional lattice Boltzmann BGK model (LBGK)
by analytically solving a simple flow in a 2~-D channel. The flow is driven by
the movement of upper boundary with vertical injection fluid at the porous
boundaries. The velocity profile is shown to satisfy a second-order
finite-difference form of the simplified incompressible Navier-Stokes equation.
With the analysis, different boundary conditions can be studied theoretically.
A momentum exchange principle is also revealed at the boundaries. A general
boundary condition for any given velocity boundary is proposed based on the
analysis.
