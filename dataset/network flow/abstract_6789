We present VLA data at 330 MHz and 1.5 GHz of the radio emission observed in
the cooling flow cluster A2626. By producing images at different resolutions we
found that the radio source consists of different components: an unresolved
core plus a jet-like feature, two elongated parallel features, and an extended
diffuse emission (radio mini-halo). Low resolution images allow us to derive
morphological and spectral information of the diffuse emission: the radio
mini-halo is extended on a scale comparable to that of the cooling flow region
and is characterized by amorphous morphology, lack of polarized flux and very
steep spectrum which steepens with distance from the center. We then applied to
this new mini-halo source a model for particle re-acceleration in cooling flows
(Gitti, Brunetti & Setti 2002). In particular, we found that its main radio
properties (brightness profile, integrated radio spectrum and radial spectral
steepening) can be accounted for by the synchrotron radiation from relic
relativistic electrons in the cluster, which are efficiently re-accelerated by
MHD turbulence amplified by the compression of the cluster magnetic field in
the cooling flow region.
