In cylindrical domain, we consider the nonstationary flow with prescribed
inflow and outflow, modelled with Navier-Stokes equations under the slip
boundary conditions. Using smallness of some derivatives of inflow function,
external force and initial velocity of the flow, but with no smallness
restrictions on the inflow, initial velocity neither force, we prove existence
of solutions in $W^{2,1}_2.$
