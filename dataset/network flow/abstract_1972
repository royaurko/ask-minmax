In this paper, we consider a cognitive setting under the context of
cooperative communications, where the cognitive radio (CR) user is assumed to
be a self-organized relay for the network. The CR user and the PU are assumed
to be energy harvesters. The CR user cooperatively relays some of the
undelivered packets of the primary user (PU). Specifically, the CR user stores
a fraction of the undelivered primary packets in a relaying queue (buffer). It
manages the flow of the undelivered primary packets to its relaying queue using
the appropriate actions over time slots. Moreover, it has the decision of
choosing the used queue for channel accessing at idle time slots (slots where
the PU's queue is empty). It is assumed that one data packet transmission
dissipates one energy packet. The optimal policy changes according to the
primary and CR users arrival rates to the data and energy queues as well as the
channels connectivity. The CR user saves energy for the PU by taking the
responsibility of relaying the undelivered primary packets. It optimally
organizes its own energy packets to maximize its payoff as time progresses.
