Anisotropic flow of protons and negative pions in 4.2A GeV/c C+Ta collisions
is studied using the Fourier analysis of azimuthal distributions. The protons
exhibit pronounced directed flow. Directed flow of pions is positive in the
entire rapidity interval and indicates that the pions are preferentially
emitted in the reaction plane from the target to the projectile. The elliptic
flow of protons and negative pions is close to zero. Comparison with the
quark-gluon-string model (QGSM) and relativistic transport model (ART 1.0) show
that they both yield a flow signature similar to the experimental data.
