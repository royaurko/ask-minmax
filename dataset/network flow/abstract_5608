Gene regulatory networks are commonly used for modeling biological processes
and revealing underlying molecular mechanisms. The reconstruction of gene
regulatory networks from observational data is a challenging task, especially
considering the large number of players (e.g. genes) involved and the small
number of biological replicates available for analysis. Herein, we propose a
new statistical method for estimating the number of erroneous edges in
reconstructed networks that strongly enhances commonly used inference
approaches. This method is based on a special relationship between correlation
and causality, and allows for the identification and to removal of
approximately half of all erroneous edges. Using the mathematical model of
Bayesian networks and positive correlation inequalities we establish a
mathematical foundation for our method. Analyzing existing biological datasets,
we find a strong correlation between the results of our method and the commonly
used false discovery rate (FDR) technique. Furthermore, simulation analysis
demonstrates that with large networks our new method provides a more accurate
estimate of network error than FDR.
