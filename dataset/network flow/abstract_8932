In this paper we describe the stable and unstable leaves for the geodesic
flow on the space of non-wandering spacelike geodesics of a Margulis Space Time
and prove contraction properties of the leaves under the flow. We also show
that monodromy of Margulis Space Times are "Anosov representations in non
semi-simple Lie groups".
