A general methodology is presented to perform direct numerical simulations of
particle dispersions in a shear flow with Lees-Edwards periodic boundary
conditions. The Navier-Stokes equation is solved in oblique coordinates to
resolve the incompatibility of the fluid motions with the sheared geometry, and
the force coupling between colloidal particles and the host fluid is imposed by
using a smoothed profile method. The validity of the method is carefully
examined by comparing the present numerical results with experimental viscosity
data for particle dispersions in a wide range of volume fractions and shear
rates including nonlinear shear-thinning regimes.
