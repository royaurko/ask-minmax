Results of 3D gas dynamical simulation of mass transfer in binaries are
presented for systems with various values of viscosity. Analysis of obtained
solutions shows that in the systems with low value of viscosity the flow
structure is qualitatively similar to one for systems with high viscosity.
Presented calculations confirm that there is no shock interaction between the
stream from L1 and the forming accretion disk (`hot spot') at any value of
viscosity.
