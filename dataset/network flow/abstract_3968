IEEE 802.15.4 standard is used for low rate, short distance wireless
communication. However due to its low power it is greatly affected by
interference provided by other wireless technology working on same
ISM(industrial, scientific & medical) band, such as IEEE 802.11b/g & Bluetooth.
In ubiquitous network environment we have two different heterogeneous
communication systems coexists in single place. In this paper we use an
analytic model and an experimental set up for the coexistence among Zigbee,
&WLAN. The model focuses on two aspects, namely Power & Timing. These two
jointly impacts on the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 wireless network. Zigbee is
main component of wireless sensor network, so therefore to study about
performance of network should be need in interference environment.
