We show that the existence of one simple closed Reeb orbit of a particular
type (a symplectically degenerate maximum) forces the Reeb flow to have
infinitely many periodic orbits. We use this result to give a different proof
of a recent theorem of Cristofaro-Gardiner and Hutchings asserting that every
Reeb flow on the standard contact three-sphere has at least two periodic
orbits. Our methods are based on adapting the machinery originally developed
for proving the Hamiltonian Conley conjecture to the contact setting.
