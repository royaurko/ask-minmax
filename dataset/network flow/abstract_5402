We analyze a model of interacting agents (e.g. prebiotic chemical species)
which are represended by nodes of a network, whereas their interactions are
mapped onto directed links between these nodes. On a fast time scale, each
agent follows an eigendynamics based on catalytic support from other nodes,
whereas on a much slower time scale the network evolves through selection and
mutation of its nodes-agent. In the first part of the paper, we explain the
dynamics of the model by means of characteristic snapshots of the network
evolution and confirm earlier findings on crashes an recoveries in the network
structure. In the second part, we focus on the aggregate behavior of the
network dynamics. We show that the disruptions in the network structure are
smoothed out, so that the average evolution can be described by a growth regime
followed by a saturation regime, without an initial random regime. For the
saturation regime, we obtain a logarithmic scaling between the average
connectivity per node $\mean{l}_{s}$ and a parameter $m$, describing the
average incoming connectivity, which is independent of the system size $N$.
