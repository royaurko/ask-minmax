We show how to simulate the equatorial section of the Schwarzschild metric
through a flowing liquid crystal in its nematic phase. Inside a liquid crystal
in the nematic phase, a traveling light ray feels an effective metric, whose
properties are linked to perpendicular and parallel refractive indexes, $n_o$ e
$n_e$ respectively, of the rod-like molecule of the liquid crystal. As these
indexes depend on the scalar order parameter of the liquid crystal, the
Beris-Edwards hydrodynamic theory is used to connect the order parameter with
the velocity of a liquid crystal flow at each point. This way we calculate a
radial velocity profile that simulates the equatorial section of the
Schwarzschild metric, in the region outside of Schwarzschild's radius, in the
nematic phase of the liquid crystal. In our model, the higher flow velocity can
be of the order of some meters per second.
