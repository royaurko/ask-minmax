We review microstructural fracture growth models suitable for the study of
hydraulic fracture processes in disordered porous materials and present some
basic results. It is shown that microstructural models exhibit certain
similarities to corresponding theories of continua. These similarities are most
easily demonstrated for simple crack geometries, i.e., straight cracks (finite
size scalings). However, there exist even scaling relations which are
completely independent of the particular employed crack structure. Furthermore
it is demonstrated that disorder in cohesional/flow properties can influence
the crack growth and the resulting fracture geometry in an essential way.
