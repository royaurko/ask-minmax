Equip the edges of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with i.i.d. random capacities.
We prove a law of large numbers for the maximal flow crossing a rectangle in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ when the side lengths of the rectangle go to infinity. The value
of the limit depends on the asymptotic behaviour of the ratio of the height of
the cylinder over the length of its basis. This law of large numbers extends
the law of large numbers obtained by Grimmett and Kesten (1984) for rectangles
of particular orientation.
