A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network consisting of spatially
distributed autonomous devices using sensors to cooperatively monitor physical
or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure,
motion or pollutants, at different locations. During RF transmission energy
consumed by critically energy-constrained sensor nodes in a WSN is related to
the life time system, but the life time of the system is inversely proportional
to the energy consumed by sensor nodes. In that regard, modulated
backscattering (MB) is a promising design choice, in which sensor nodes send
their data just by switching their antenna impedance and reflecting the
incident signal coming from an RF source. Hence wireless passive sensor
networks (WPSN) designed to operate using MB do not have the lifetime
constraints. In this we are going to investigate the system analytically. To
obtain interference-free communication connectivity with the WPSN nodes number
of RF sources is determined and analyzed in terms of output power and the
transmission frequency of RF sources, network size, RF source and WPSN node
characteristics. The results of this paper reveal that communication coverage
and RF Source Power can be practically maintained in WPSN through careful
selection of design parameters
