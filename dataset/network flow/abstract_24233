It is important to implement safe smart grid environment to enhance people's
lives and livelihoods. This paper provides information on smart grid IS
functional requirement by illustrating some discussion points to the sixteen
identified requirements. This paper introduces the smart grid potential hazards
that can be referred as a triggering factor to improve the system and security
of the entire grid. The background of smart information infrastructure and the
needs for smart grid IS is described with the adoption of hermeneutic circle as
methodology. Grid information technology and security-s session discusses that
grid provides the chance of a simple and transparent access to different
information sources. In addition, the transformation between traditional versus
smart grid networking trend and the IS importance on the communication field
reflects the criticality of grid IS functional requirement identification is
introduces. The smart grid IS functional requirements described in this paper
are general and can be adopted or modified to suit any smart grid system. This
paper has tutorial contents where some related backgrounds were provided,
especially for networking community, covering the cyber security requirement of
smart grid information infrastructure.
