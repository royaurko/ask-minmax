Studies of fluid flows sheared by moving planes, restricted to
reflection-symmetric fluid states, have shown that unstable equilibrium and
periodic orbit solutions shape turbulent motions. We show here that for flows
with continuous translational symmetries, such as pipe flow in a streamwise
periodic minimal flow unit, turbulent fluid motions are well captured by
unstable relative equilibria (traveling waves) and relative periodic orbits. A
methodological advance that facilitates the search for relative periodic orbits
is symmetry reduction by the method of slices. By use of a well-constructed
`template', the method enables us to go far beyond our previous work---symmetry
reduction is achieved for high dimensional turbulence, enabling the discovery
of many relative periodic orbits. Whereas traditional projections provide
little insight, visualizations of the symmetry-reduced state space show that
our numerically-exact invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations are
distributed across the ergodic region of state space and form the invariant
backbone of the turbulent attractor. The method is general and can be applied
to any system with continuous symmetries.
