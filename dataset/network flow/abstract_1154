In today's world Wireless Ad-hoc sensor network, consists of small sensor
nodes having limited resources, has a great potential to solve problems in
various domain including disaster management. In this paper "QCS-protocol" is
modified which was introduced in our previous paper [1] and named as "Modified
QCS-protocol". This is the backbone of our Intelligent Energy Efficient Ad-hoc
Sensor Network. Two other protocols "Irregular Information Transfer" & "Final
Broadcast-Petrol Flow" protocol are also modified to enhance performance of the
new version of QCS protocol to run the system properly and to make the network
more energy efficient and perfect. The challenges in WASN are- limited node
power, Ad-hoc organization of network and reliability. Most of the existing
approaches addressed the problems separately, but not in a totality. This paper
shows how the network can have unlimited life and all time readiness with
overall stability to send information to the base station with minimum power
dissipation with the help of multimode "same type" sensor nodes and type
categorization of generated information. Moreover an effort is made to give
some light to the implementation issues and analyzed overall performance of the
network by MATLAB simulation.
