We study the robustness and stability of the yeast cell regulatory network by
using a general inhomogeneous discrete model. We find that inhomogeneity, on
average, enhances the stability of the biggest attractor of the dynamics and
that the large size of the basin of attraction is robust against changes in the
parameters of inhomogeneity. We find that the most frequent orbit, which
represents the cell-cycle pathway, has a better biological meaning than the one
exhibited by the homogeneous model.
