The problems of sensor configuration and activation for the detection of
correlated random fields using large sensor arrays are considered. Using
results that characterize the large-array performance of sensor networks in
this application, the detection capabilities of different sensor configurations
are analyzed and compared. The dependence of the optimal choice of
configuration on parameters such as sensor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), field
correlation, etc., is examined, yielding insights into the most effective
choices for sensor selection and activation in various operating regimes.
