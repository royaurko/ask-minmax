Most large cities are spanned by more than one transportation system. These
different modes of transport have usually been studied separately: it is
however important to understand the impact on urban systems of the coupling
between them and we report in this paper an empirical analysis of the coupling
between the street network and the subway for the two large metropolitan areas
of London and New York. We observe a similar behaviour for network quantities
related to quickest paths suggesting the existence of generic mechanisms
operating beyond the local peculiarities of the specific cities studied. An
analysis of the betweenness centrality distribution shows that the introduction
of underground networks operate as a decentralising force creating congestions
in places located at the end of underground lines. Also, we find that
increasing the speed of subways is not always beneficial and may lead to
unwanted uneven spatial distributions of accessibility. In fact, for London --
but not for New York -- there is an optimal subway speed in terms of global
congestion. These results show that it is crucial to consider the full,
multimodal, multi-layer network aspects of transportation systems in order to
understand the behaviour of cities and to avoid possible negative side-effects
of urban planning decisions.
