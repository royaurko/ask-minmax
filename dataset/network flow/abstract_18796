Data collected nowadays by social-networking applications create fascinating
opportunities for building novel services, as well as expanding our
understanding about social structures and their dynamics. Unfortunately,
publishing social-network graphs is considered an ill-advised practice due to
privacy concerns. To alleviate this problem, several anonymization methods have
been proposed, aiming at reducing the risk of a privacy breach on the published
data, while still allowing to analyze them and draw relevant conclusions. In
this paper we introduce a new anonymization approach that is based on injecting
uncertainty in social graphs and publishing the resulting uncertain graphs.
While existing approaches obfuscate graph data by adding or removing edges
entirely, we propose using a ?finer-grained perturbation that adds or removes
edges partially: this way we can achieve the same desired level of obfuscation
with smaller changes in the data, thus maintaining higher utility. Our
experiments on real-world networks con?firm that at the same level of identity
obfuscation our method provides higher usefulness than existing randomized
methods that publish standard graphs.
