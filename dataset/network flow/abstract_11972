In this paper we consider the question whether a distributed network of
sensors and data processors can form "perceptions" based on the sensory data.
Because sensory data can have exponentially many explanations, the use of a
central data processor to analyze the outputs from a large ensemble of sensors
will in general introduce unacceptable latencies for responding to dangerous
situations. A better idea is to use a distributed "Helmholtz machine"
architecture in which the collective state of the network as a whole provides
an explanation for the sensory data.
