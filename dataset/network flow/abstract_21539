A model of a superconducting tunnel junction coupled to a mechanical
oscillator is studied at zero temperature in the case of linear coupling
between the oscillator and tunneling electrons. It is found that the Josephson
current flowing between two superconductors is modulated by the motion of the
oscillator. Coupling to harmonic oscillator produces additional Shapiro steps
in $I-V$ characteristic of Josephson junction whose position is tuned by the
frequency of the vibration mode. We also find a new velocity dependent term
originating from the backaction of the ac Josephson current. This term is
periodic in time and vanishes at zero bias voltage.
