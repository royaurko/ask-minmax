Highly responsive, or 'smart' materials are abundant in Nature; individual
cells, for instance, can adapt their mechanical properties to the local
surroundings through small changes in their internal structure. An effective
method to enhance the responsiveness of synthetic materials is to operate near
a critical point, where small variations lead to large changes in material
properties. Recent theories have suggested that fibre/polymer networks can show
critical behaviour near and below the point of marginal connectivity that
separates rigid and floppy states [1-4]. To date, however, experimental
evidence for criticality in such networks has been lacking. Here, we
demonstrate critical behaviour in the stress response of synthetic hydrogels at
low concentrations of order 0.1% volume fraction. We show, using computer
simulations, that the observed response to stress can be understood by
considering the influence of a zero-temperature critical point, i.e. the
Maxwell isostatic point [5], together with the intrinsically nonlinear stretch
response of semi-flexible polymer strands in the gel.
