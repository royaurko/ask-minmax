One of the challenges in the wireless sensor applications which are gaining
much attention is the real-time transmission of continuous data packets across
the network. Though advances in communication in sensor networks are providing
guaranteed quality data packet delivery they still have some drawbacks. One
such drawback is transmission of incessant data packets over high speed
networks. Here in this paper we have designed a concentric sensor network
having buffer just not at the sink but also in selected intermediate nodes to
minimize the packet loss caused due to congestion. This approach results in
haggle congestion and less packet loss in the designed network.
