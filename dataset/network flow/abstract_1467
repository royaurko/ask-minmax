We study the transition towards effective payoffs in the prisoner's dilemma
game on scale-free networks by introducing a normalization parameter guiding
the system from accumulated payoffs to payoffs normalized with the connectivity
of each agent. We show that during this transition the heterogeneity-based
ability of scale-free networks to facilitate cooperative behavior deteriorates
continuously, eventually collapsing with the results obtained on regular
graphs. The strategy donations and adaptation probabilities of agents with
different connectivities are studied. Results reveal that strategies generally
spread from agents with larger towards agents with smaller degree. However,
this strategy adoption flow reverses sharply in the fully normalized payoff
limit. Surprisingly, cooperators occupy the hubs even if the averaged
cooperation level due to partly normalized payoffs is moderate.
