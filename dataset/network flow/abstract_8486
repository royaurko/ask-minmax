We present a method to construct a network null-model based on the maximum
entropy principle and where the restrictions that the rich-club and the degree
sequence impose are conserved. We show that the probability that two nodes
share a link can be described with a simple probability function. The
null-model closely approximates the assortative properties of the network.
