We construct a classical vortex string solution in a Seiberg-dual theory of
N=1 supersymmetric SO(N_c) QCD which flows to a confining phase. We claim that
this vortex string is a QCD string, as previouly argued by M.Strassler. In
SO(N_c) QCD, it is known that stable QCD strings exist even in the presence of
dynamical quarks. We show that our vortex strings are stable in the
Seiberg-dual theory.
