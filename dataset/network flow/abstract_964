We study the effect of local wettability reversal on remobilizing immobile
fluid clusters in steady-state two-phase flow in porous media. We consider a
two dimensional network model for porous medium and introduce a wettability
alteration mechanism. A qualitative change in the steady state flow patterns,
destabilizing the percolating and trapped clusters, is observed as the system
wettability is varied. When capillary forces are strong a finite wettability
alteration is necessary to move the system from single-phase to two-phase flow
regime. For the case of both phases being mobile we find a linear relationship
between fractional flow and wettability alteration.
