We present a set of three-dimensional (3D) direct numerical simulations of
incompressible decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in which we investigate
the influence of an external uniform magnetic field B_0. A parametric study in
terms of B_0 intensity is made where, in particular, we distinguish the shear-
from the pseudo-Alfven waves dynamics. The initial kinetic and magnetic
energies are equal with a negligible cross-correlation. Both the temporal and
spectral effects of B_0 are discussed. A sub-critical balance is found between
the Alfven and nonlinear times with both a global and a spectral definition.
The nonlinear dynamics of strongly magnetized flows is characterized by a
different k_perp-spectrum (where B_0 defines the parallel direction) if it is
plotted at a fixed k_// (2D spectrum) or if it is integrated (averaged) over
all k_// (1D spectrum). In the former case a much wider inertial range is found
with a steep power law, closer to the wave turbulence prediction than the
Kolmogorov one like in the latter case. It is believed that the averaging
effect may be a source of difficulty to detect the transition towards wave
turbulence in natural plasmas. For the first time, the formation of filaments
is reported within current and vorticity sheets in strongly magnetized flows
which modifies our classical picture of dissipative sheets in conductive flows.
