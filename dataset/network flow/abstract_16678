Research on integrated neural-symbolic systems has made significant progress
in the recent past. In particular the understanding of ways to deal with
symbolic knowledge within connectionist systems (also called artificial neural
networks) has reached a critical mass which enables the community to strive for
applicable implementations and use cases. Recent work has covered a great
variety of logics used in artificial intelligence and provides a multitude of
techniques for dealing with them within the context of artificial neural
networks. We present a comprehensive survey of the field of neural-symbolic
integration, including a new classification of system according to their
architectures and abilities.
