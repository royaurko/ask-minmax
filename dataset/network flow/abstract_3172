Web services growth makes the composition process a hard task to solve. This
numerous interacting elements can be adequately represented by a network.
Discovery and composition can benefit from the knowledge of the network
structure. In this paper, we investigate the topological properties of two
models of syntactic and semantic Web services composition networks: dependency
and interaction. Results show that they share a similar organization
characterized by the small-world property, a heavy-tailed degree distribution
and a low transitivity value. Furthermore, the networks are disassortative.
