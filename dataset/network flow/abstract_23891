We present a method to search for transient GWs using a network of detectors
with different spectral and directional sensitivities: the interferometer Virgo
and the bar detector AURIGA. The data analysis method is based on the
measurements of the correlated energy in the network by means of a weighted
cross-correlation. To limit the computational load, this coherent analysis step
is performed around time-frequency coincident triggers selected by an excess
power event trigger generator tuned at low thresholds. The final selection of
GW candidates is performed by a combined cut on the correlated energy and on
the significance as measured by the event trigger generator. The method has
been tested on one day of data of AURIGA and Virgo during September 2005. The
outcomes are compared to the results of a stand-alone time-frequency
coincidence search. We discuss the advantages and the limits of this approach,
in view of a possible future joint search between AURIGA and one
interferometric detector.
