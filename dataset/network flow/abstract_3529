In this paper, we explore complex network properties of word collocation
networks (Ferret, 2002) from four different genres. Each document of a
particular genre was converted into a network of words with word collocations
as edges. We analyzed graphically and statistically how the global properties
of these networks varied across different genres, and among different network
types within the same genre. Our results indicate that the distributions of
network properties are visually similar but statistically apart across
different genres, and interesting variations emerge when we consider different
network types within a single genre. We further investigate how the global
properties change as we add more and more collocation edges to the graph of one
particular genre, and observe that except for the number of vertices and the
size of the largest connected component, network properties change in phases,
via jumps and drops.
