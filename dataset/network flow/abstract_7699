We experimentally study the susceptibility to symmetry breaking of a closed
turbulent von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n swirling flow from $Re = 150$ to $Re \simeq
10^{6}$. We report a divergence of this susceptibility at an intermediate
Reynolds number $Re = Re_\chi \simeq 90\,000$ which gives experimental evidence
that such a highly space and time fluctuating system can undergo a "phase
transition". This transition is furthermore associated with a peak in the
amplitude of fluctuations of the instantaneous flow symmetry corresponding to
intermittencies between spontaneously symmetry breaking metastable states.
