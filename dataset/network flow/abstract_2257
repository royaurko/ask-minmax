We present a general and flexible procedure which allows for the reduction
(or expansion) of any dynamical network while preserving the spectrum of the
network's adjacency matrix. Computationally, this process is simple and easily
implemented for the analysis of any network. Moreover, it is possible to
isospectrally reduce a network with respect to any network characteristic
including centrality, betweenness, etc. This procedure also establishes new
equivalence relations which partition all dynamical networks into spectrally
equivalent classes. Here, we present general facts regarding isospectral
network transformations which we then demonstrate in simple examples. Overall,
our procedure introduces new possibilities for the analysis of networks in ways
that are easily visualized.
