We propose a time discretization scheme for a class of ordinary differential
equations arising in simulations of fluid/particle flows. The scheme is
intended to work robustly in the lubrication regime when the distance between
two particles immersed in the fluid or between a particle and the wall tends to
zero. The idea consists in introducing a small threshold for the particle-wall
distance below which the real trajectory of the particle is replaced by an
approximated one where the distance is kept equal to the threshold value. The
error of this approximation is estimated both theoretically and by numerical
experiments. Our time marching scheme can be easily incorporated into a full
simulation method where the velocity of the fluid is obtained by a numerical
solution to Stokes or Navier-Stokes equations. We also provide a derivation of
the asymptotic expansion for the lubrication force (used in our numerical
experiments) acting on a disk immersed in a Newtonian fluid and approaching the
wall. The method of this derivation is new and can be easily adapted to other
cases.
