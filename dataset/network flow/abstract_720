We introduce a new model of random layered media, extending the Matheron-de
Marsily model: Here we allow for the flows to change in time. For such layered
structures, we solve exactly the equations of motion for single particles, and
also for polymers modelled as Rouse chains. The results show a rich variety of
dynamical patterns.
