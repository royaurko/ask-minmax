We introduce a graphical calculus for computing morphism spaces between the
categorified spin networks of Cooper and Krushkal. The calculus, phrased in
terms of planar compositions of categorified Jones-Wenzl projectors and their
duals, is then used to study the module structure of spin networks over the
colored unknots.
