Comparing two geometric graphs embedded in space is important in the field of
transportation network analysis. Given street maps of the same city collected
from different sources, researchers often need to know how and where they
differ. However, the majority of current graph comparison algorithms are based
on structural properties of graphs, such as their degree distribution or their
local connectivity properties, and do not consider their spatial embedding.
This ignores a key property of road networks since similarity of travel over
two road networks is intimately tied to the specific spatial embedding.
Likewise, many current street map comparison algorithms focus on the spatial
embeddings only and do not take structural properties into account, which makes
these algorithms insensitive to local connectivity properties and shortest path
similarities. We propose a new path-based distance measure to compare two
planar geometric graphs embedded in the plane. Our distance measure takes
structural as well as spatial properties into account by imposing a distance
measure between two road networks based on the Hausdorff distance between the
two sets of travel paths they represent. We show that this distance can be
approximated in polynomial time and that it preserves structural and spatial
properties of the graphs.
