A new initialization method for hidden parameters in a neural network is
proposed. Derived from the integral representation of the neural network, a
nonparametric probability distribution of hidden parameters is introduced. In
this proposal, hidden parameters are initialized by samples drawn from this
distribution, and output parameters are fitted by ordinary linear regression.
Numerical experiments show that backpropagation with proposed initialization
converges faster than uniformly random initialization. Also it is shown that
the proposed method achieves enough accuracy by itself without backpropagation
in some cases.
