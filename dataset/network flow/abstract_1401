A reliable and fast numerical scheme is crucial for the 1D simulation of
blood flow in compliant vessels. In this paper, a 1D blood flow model is
incorporated with a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic arterial wall. This leads to a
nonlinear hyperbolic-parabolic system, which is then solved with four numerical
schemes, namely: MacCormack, Taylor-Galerkin, MUSCL (monotonic upwind scheme
for conservation law) and local discontinuous Galerkin. The numerical schemes
are tested on a single vessel, a simple bifurcation and a network with 55
arteries. The numerical solutions are checked favorably against analytical,
semi-analytical solutions or clinical observations. Among the numerical
schemes, comparisons are made in four important aspects: accuracy, ability to
capture shock-like phenomena, computational speed and implementation
complexity. The suitable conditions for the application of each scheme are
discussed.
