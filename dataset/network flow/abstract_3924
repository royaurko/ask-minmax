Collaboration networks provide a method for examining the structure of
collaborative communities. The model I present in this paper connects an
individual's skill set to her position in the collaboration network, and
changes in the distribution of skills to the structure of the collaboration
network as a whole. I show that individuals with a useful combination of skills
will have a disproportionate number of links in the network, resulting in a
skewed degree distribution. The degree distribution becomes more skewed as
problems become more difficult, leading to a community dominated by a few
high-degree superstars.
