We perform detailed magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the gas cloud G2
interacting with the accretion flow around the Galactic Center black hole Sgr
A*. We take as our initial conditions a steady-state, converged solution of the
accretion flow obtained earlier using the general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic code HARM. Using the observed parameters for the cloud's
orbit, we compute the interaction of the cloud with the ambient gas and
identify the shock structure that forms ahead of the cloud. We show that for
many configurations, the cloud front crosses orbit pericenter 7 to 9 months
earlier than the center-of-mass.
