We show how effectively the diffusive capture processes (DCP) on complex
networks can be applied to information search in the networks. Numerical
simulations show that our method generates only 2% of traffic compared with the
most popular flooding-based query-packet-forwarding (FB) algorithm. We find
that the average searching time, $<T>$, of the our model is more scalable than
another well known $n$-random walker model and comparable to the FB algorithm
both on real Gnutella network and scale-free networks with $\gamma =2.4$. We
also discuss the possible relationship between $<T>$ and $<k^2>$, the second
moment of the degree distribution of the networks.
