We study the formation of disks via the cooling flow of gas within galactic
haloes using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. These simulations
resolve mass scales of a few thousand solar masses in the gas component for the
first time. Thermal instabilities result in the formation of numerous warm
clouds that are pressure confined by the hot ambient halo gas. The clouds fall
slowly onto the disk through non-spherical accretion from material flowing
preferentially down the angular momentum axis. The rotational velocity of the
infalling cold gas decreases as a function of height above the disk, closely
resembling that of the extra-planar gas recently observed around the spiral
galaxy NGC 891.
