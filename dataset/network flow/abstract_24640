Broadband communications for high speed train is becoming a main trend in
high mobility communications. The main bottleneck of this communication network
is handover, since the handover occurs so frequently and the delays are so long
that broadband real-time communication cannot apply. Various handover models
have been developed and studied recently. However, no comprehensive evaluation
method for these models is employed. To this end, we borrow Data Envelopment
Analysis (DEA) method to evaluate six typical handover system models. Handover
models that to be evaluated are introduced. A brief presentation of DEA and its
characters is provided. A specific procedure of the evaluation is proposed.
Then the results of the evaluation are obtained by running the DEA. Finally, we
give our comments and conclusions to all the handover models. We hope our work
will supply a gap in the system evaluation area.
