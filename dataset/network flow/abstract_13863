The most important function of proteins may well be to bind to other
biomolecules. It has long been felt that kinetic rates of bond formation and
dissociation between soluble receptors and ligands might account for most
features of the binding process. Only theoretical considerations allowed to
predict the behaviour of surface-attached receptors from the properties of
soluble forms. During the last decade, experimental progress essentially based
on flow chambers, atomic force microscopes or biomembrane force probes allowed
direct analysis of biomolecule interaction at the single bond level and gave
new insight into previously ignored features such as bond mechanical properties
or energy landscapes. The aim of this review is (i) to describe the main
advances brought by laminar flow chambers, including information on bond
response to forces, multiplicity of binding states, kinetics of bond formation
between attached structures, effect of molecular environment on receptor
efficiency and behaviour of multivalent attachment, (ii) to compare results
obtain by this and other techniques on a few well defined molecular systems,
and (iii) to discuss the limitations of the flow chamber method. It is
concluded that a new framework may be needed to account for the effective
behaviour of biomolecule association.
