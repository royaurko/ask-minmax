In the framework of the variational principle the canonical variables
describing ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows of general type (i.e., with
spatially varying entropy and nonzero values of all topological invariants) are
introduced. The corresponding complete velocity representation enables us not
only to describe the general type flows in terms of single-valued functions,
but also to solve the intriguing problem of the ``missing'' MHD integrals of
motion. The set of hitherto known MHD local invariants and integrals of motion
appears to be incomplete: for the vanishing magnetic field it does not reduce
to the set of the conventional hydrodynamic invariants. And if the MHD analogs
of the vorticity and helicity were discussed earlier for the particular cases,
the analog of Ertel invariant has been so far unknown. It is found that on the
basis of the new invariants introduced a wide set of high-order invariants can
be constructed. The new invariants are relevant both for the deeper insight
into the problem of the topological structure of the MHD flows as a whole and
for the examination of the stability problems. The additional advantage of the
proposed approach is that it enables one to deal with discontinuous flows,
including all types of possible breaks.
