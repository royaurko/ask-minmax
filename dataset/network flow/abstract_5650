Clustering is an important concept to reduce the energy consumption and
prolonging the life of a wireless sensor network. In heterogeneous wireless
sensor network some of the nodes are equipped with more energy than the other
nodes.
  Many routing algorithms are proposed for heterogeneous wireless sensor
network. Stable Election Protocol (SEP) is one of the important protocol in
this category. In this research paper a novel energy efficient distance based
cluster protocol (DBCP) is proposed for single hop heterogeneous wireless
sensor network to increase the life and energy efficiency of a sensor network.
DBCP use the average distance of the sensor from the base station as the major
issue for the selection of a cluster head in the sensor network.
