In this work we present a system for the automatic classification of the
light curves of eclipsing binaries. This system is based on a classification
scheme that aims to separate eclipsing binary sistems according to their
geometrical configuration in a modified version of the traditional
classification scheme. The classification is performed by a Bayesian ensemble
of neural networks trained with {\em Hipparcos} data of seven different
categories including eccentric binary systems and two types of pulsating light
curve morphologies.
