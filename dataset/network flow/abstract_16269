We discuss two temperature accretion disk flows around rotating black holes.
As we know that to explain observed hard X-rays the choice of Keplerian angular
momentum profile is not unique, we consider the sub-Keplerian regime of the
disk. Without any strict knowledge of the magnetic field structure, we assume
the cooling mechanism is dominated by bremsstrahlung process. We show that in a
range of Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter $0.2\gsim\alpha\gsim0.0005$, flow
behavior varies widely, particularly by means of the size of disk, efficiency
of cooling and corresponding temperatures of ions and electrons. We also show
that the disk around a rotating black hole is hotter compared to that around a
Schwarzschild black hole, rendering a larger difference between ion and
electron temperatures in the former case. With all the theoretical solutions in
hand, finally we reproduce the observed luminosities ($L$) of two extreme cases
-- the under-fed AGNs and quasars (e.g. Sgr $A^*$) with $L\gsim 10^{33}$
erg/sec to ultra-luminous X-ray sources with $L\sim 10^{41}$ erg/sec, at
different combinations of mass accretion rate, ratio of specific heats,
Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter and Kerr parameter, and conclude that Sgr
$A^*$ may be an intermediate spinning black hole.
