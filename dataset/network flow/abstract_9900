The large and saturating differential elliptic flow v2(pT) observed in Au+Au
reactions at RHIC so far could only be explained assuming an order of magnitude
denser initial parton system than estimated from perturbative QCD.
Hadronization via parton coalescence can resolve this ``opacity puzzle''
because it enhances hadron elliptic flow at large pT relative to that of
partons at the same transverse momentum. An experimentally testable consequence
of the coalescence scenario is that v2(pT) saturates at about 50% higher values
for baryons than for mesons. In addition, if strange quarks have weaker flow
than light quarks, hadron v2 at high pT decreases with relative strangeness
content.
