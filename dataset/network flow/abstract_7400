We present a self-consistent mean field model of the extraction of atoms from
a Bose-Einstein condensate to form a CW atom laser. The model is based upon the
Hartree-Fock Bogoliubov equations within the Popov approximation, modified by
the inclusion of spatially dependent source and sink terms, which lead to
current flow within the condensate. The effects of this current flow are
investigated for traps containing Rubidium (repulsive effective interaction)
and Lithium (attractive interaction) atoms. The extra kinetic energy associated
with this flow is shown to be able to stabilise the condensate in the
attractive case against mechanical instability.
