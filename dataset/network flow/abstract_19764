Heat exchange during laminar flow is studied at the fracture scale on the
basis of the Stokes equation. We used a synthetic aperture model (a self-affine
model) that has been shown to be a realistic geometrical description of the
fracture morphology. We developed a numerical modelling using a finite
difference scheme of the hydrodynamic flow and its coupling with an
advection/conduction description of the fluid heat. As a first step,
temperature within the surrounding rock is supposed to be constant. Influence
of the fracture roughness on the heat flux through the wall, is estimated and a
thermalization length is shown to emerge. Implications for the
Soultz-sous-For\^{e}ts geothermal project are discussed.
