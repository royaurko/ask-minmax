A mechanism of formation of small-scale inhomogeneities in spatial
distributions of aerosols and droplets associated with clustering instability
in the atmospheric turbulent flow is discussed. The particle clustering is a
consequence of a spontaneous breakdown of their homogeneous space distribution
due to the clustering instability, and is caused by a combined effect of the
particle inertia and a finite correlation time of the turbulent velocity field.
In this paper a theoretical approach proposed in Phys. Rev. E 66, 036302 (2002)
is further developed and applied to investigate the mechanisms of formation of
small-scale aerosol inhomogeneities in the atmospheric turbulent flow. The
theory of the particle clustering instability is extended to the case when the
particle Stokes time is larger than the Kolmogorov time scale, but is much
smaller than the correlation time at the integral scale of turbulence. We
determined the criterion of the clustering instability for the Stokes number
larger than 1. We discussed applications of the analyzed effects to the
dynamics of aerosols and droplets in the atmospheric turbulent flow.
