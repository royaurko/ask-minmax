We present a key-exchange protocol that comprises two parties with chaotic
dynamics that are mutually coupled and undergo a synchronization process, at
the end of which they can use their identical dynamical state as an encryption
key. The transferred coupling-signals are based non-linearly on time-delayed
states of the parties, and therefore they conceal the parties' current state
and can be transferred over a public channel. Synchronization time is linear in
the number of synchronized digits alpha, while the probability for an attacker
to synchronize with the parties drops exponentially with alpha. To achieve
security with finite alpha we use a network.
