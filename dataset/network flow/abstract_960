In this paper, we focus on the different traffic flow models that exist in
literature. Due to our frequently encountered confusion among traffic engineers
and policy makers, this paper goes into more detail about transportation
planning models on the one hand, and traffic flow models on the other hand. The
former deal with households that make certain decisions which lead to
transportation and the use of infrastructure, as opposed to the latter which
explicitly describe the physical propagation of traffic flows in a road
network. Our goal is not to give a full account (as that would be a
dissertation of its own, given the broadness of the field), but rather to
impose upon the reader a thorough feeling for the differences between
transportation planning and traffic flow models. Because of the high course of
progress over the last decade (or even during the last five years), this paper
tries to chronicle both past models, as well as some of the latest developments
in this area.
