We have experimentally investigated 2-dimensional dense bubble flows
underneath inclined planes. Velocity profiles and velocity fluctuations have
been measured. A broad second-order phase transition between two dynamical
regimes is observed as a function of the tilt angle $\theta$. For low $\theta$
values, a block motion is observed. For high $\theta$ values, the velocity
profile becomes curved and a shear velocity gradient appears in the flow.
