Considering backhaul consumption in practical systems, it may not be the best
choice to engage all the time in full cooperative MIMO for interference
mitigation. In this paper, we propose a novel downlink partial cooperative MIMO
(Pco-MIMO) physical layer (PHY) scheme, which allows flexible tradeoff between
the partial data cooperation level and the backhaul consumption. Based on this
Pco-MIMO scheme, we consider dynamic transmit power and rate allocation
according to the imperfect channel state information at transmitters (CSIT) and
the queue state information (QSI) to minimize the average delay cost subject to
average backhaul consumption constraints and average power constraints. The
delay-optimal control problem is formulated as an infinite horizon average cost
constrained partially observed Markov decision process (CPOMDP). By exploiting
the special structure in our problem, we derive an equivalent Bellman Equation
to solve the CPOMDP. To reduce computational complexity and facilitate
distributed implementation, we propose a distributed online learning algorithm
to estimate the per-flow potential functions and Lagrange multipliers (LMs) and
a distributed online stochastic partial gradient algorithm to obtain the power
and rate control policy. The proposed low-complexity distributed solution is
based on local observations of the system states at the BSs and is very robust
against model variations. We also prove the convergence and the asymptotic
optimality of the proposed solution.
