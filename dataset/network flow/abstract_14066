Existing numerical models of the swash zone are relatively inflexible in
dealing with sediment transport due to a high dependence of the deployed
numerical schemes on empirical sediment transport relations. Moreover, these
models are usually not well-balanced, meaning they are unable to correctly
simulate quiescent flow. Here a well-balanced and flexible morphological model
for the swash zone is presented. The nonlinear shallow water equations and the
Exner equation are discretized by the shock-capturing finite volume method, in
which the numerical flux and the bed slope source term are estimated by a
well-balanced version of the SLIC (Slope LImited Centered) scheme that does not
depend on empirical sediment transport relations. The satisfaction of the
well-balanced property is demonstrated through simulating quiescent coastal
flow. The quantitative accuracy of the model in reproducing key parameters
(i.e., the notional shoreline position, the swash depth, the flow velocity, the
overtopping flow volume, the beach change depth and the sediment transport
rate) is shown to be satisfactory through comparisons against analytical
solutions, experimental data as well as previous numerical solutions. This work
facilitates an improved modeling framework for the swash hydrodynamics and
sediment transport.
