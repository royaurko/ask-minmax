The creation of small and cheap sensors promoted the emergence of large scale
sensor networks. Sensor networks allow monitoring a variety of physical
phenomena, like weather conditions (temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure
...), traffic levels on highways or rooms occupancy in public buildings. Some
of the sensors produce large volume of data such as weather temperature. These
data should be stored somewhere for user queries. In this paper two known
sensor data storage methods that store data semantically has been compared and
it has been shown that storing data in ontology form consumes more energy so
the lifetime of sensor network would decreases. The reason we choose them is
that they are useful and popular.
