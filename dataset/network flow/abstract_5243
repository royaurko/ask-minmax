We study the turbulent flow of the density-stratified fluid around a small
translating (either passively or self-propelled) particle. It was found
recently [A. M. Ardekani and R. Stocker, Phys. Rev. Lett. vol. 105, 084502
(2010)] that without turbulence, the familiar Stokes flow is dramatically
altered by the stratification. Stratification-induced inhomogeneity "turns on"
the buoyancy introducing a new "cutoff" or "screening" length scale for the
flow, yielding closed streamlines and a faster (exponential-like) decay of
velocity. This result, however, did not account for the potential role of the
background turbulence, intrinsically present in many aquatic environments.
Turbulence mixes the density opposing the effect. Here we derive and solve the
advection-diffusion equation that describes the interplay of turbulent mixing,
diffusion of the stratifying agent and buoyancy. We derive an exact expression
for fluctuations due to weak background turbulence and show that stronger
turbulence can completely change the flow around the particle, canceling the
effect of stratification and restoring the unstratified Stokes flow.
