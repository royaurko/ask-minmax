The critical state of the vortex lattice in a thin strip is considered for
the case when first a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, then a
longitudinal field, and then again the perpendicular field is increased. This
longitudinal field can strongly enhance the critical currents in the strip
since the vortices are inclined and the currents flow in the strip plane.
