In this paper we explore the mathematical structure of hierarchical
organization in smooth dynamical systems. We start by making precise what we
mean by a level in a hierarchy, and how the higher le vels need to respect the
dynamics on the lower levels. We derive a mathematical construction for
identifying distinct levels in a hierarchical dynamics. The construction is
expressed through a quotient manifold of the phase space and a Lie group that
fulfills certain requirement with respect to the flow. We show that projections
up to higher levels can be related to symmetries of the dynamical system. We
also discuss how the quotient manifold projections relate to invariant
manifolds, invariants of the motion, and Noether's theorem.
