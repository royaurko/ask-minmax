This paper experimentally evaluates the effects of applying autonomic
management to the scheduling of maintenance operations in a deployed Chord
network, for various membership churn and workload patterns. Two versions of an
autonomic management policy were compared with a static configuration. The
autonomic policies varied with respect to the aggressiveness with which they
responded to peer access error rates and to wasted maintenance operations. In
most experiments, significant improvements due to autonomic management were
observed in the performance of routing operations and the quantity of data
transmitted between network members. Of the autonomic policies, the more
aggressive version gave slightly better results.
