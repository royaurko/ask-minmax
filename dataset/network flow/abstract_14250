We measure time-averaged velocity, density, and temperature fields for steady
granular flow past a wedge and calculate a speed of granular pressure
disturbances (sound speed) equal to 10% of the flow speed. The flow is
supersonic, forming shocks nearly identical to those in a supersonic gas.
Molecular dynamics simulations of Newton's laws and Monte Carlo simulations of
the Boltzmann equation yield fields in quantitative agreement with experiment.
A numerical solution of Navier-Stokes-like equations agrees with a molecular
dynamics simulation for experimental conditions excluding wall friction.
