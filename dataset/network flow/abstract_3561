The recent significant progress in realizing full-duplex~(FD) systems has
opened up a promising avenue for improving quality of service (QoS) and quality
of experience (QoE) in future wireless networks. There is an urgent need to
address the diverse set of challenges regarding different aspects of FD network
design, theory, and development. In addition to the self-interference
cancelation signal processing algorithms, network protocols such as resource
management are also essential in the practical design and implementation of FD
wireless networks. This article aims to present the latest development and
future directions of resource allocation in different full duplex systems by
exploring the network resources in different domains, including power, space,
frequency, and device dimensions. Four representative application scenarios are
considered: FD MIMO networks, FD cooperative networks, FD OFDMA cellular
networks, and FD heterogeneous networks. Resource management problems and novel
algorithms in these systems are presented, and key open research directions are
discussed.
