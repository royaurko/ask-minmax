We study effects of delay in diffusively coupled logistic maps on the Cayley
tree networks. We find that smaller coupling values exhibits sensitiveness for
value of delay, and leads to different cluster patterns of self-organized and
driven types. Whereas larger coupling strengths are very robust against change
in delay values, and leads to stable driven clusters comprising only nodes from
last generation of the Calaye tree. Furthermore, introduction of delay exhibits
suppression as well as enhancement of synchronization depending upon coupling
strength values, hence demonstrating richness of the model. To the end we
relate the results with social conflicts and cooperation observed in families.
