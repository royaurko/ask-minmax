We describe how to calculate the sizes of all giant connected components of a
directed graph, including the {\em strongly} connected one. Just to the class
of directed networks, in particular, belongs the World Wide Web. The results
are obtained for graphs with statistically uncorrelated vertices and an
arbitrary joint in,out-degree distribution $P(k_i,k_o)$. We show that if
$P(k_i,k_o)$ does not factorize, the relative size of the giant strongly
connected component deviates from the product of the relative sizes of the
giant in- and out-components. The calculations of the relative sizes of all the
giant components are demonstrated using the simplest examples. We explain that
the giant strongly connected component may be less resilient to random damage
than the giant weakly connected one.
