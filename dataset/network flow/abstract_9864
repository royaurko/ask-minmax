An approach based on a lattice version of the Boltzmann kinetic equation for
describing multi-phase flows in nano- and micro-corrugated devices is proposed.
We specialize it to describe the wetting/dewetting transition of fluids in
presence of nanoscopic grooves etched on the boundaries. This approach permits
to retain the essential supra-molecular details of fluid-solid interactions
without surrendering -actually boosting- the computational efficiency of
continuum methods. The mesoscopic method is first validated quantitatively
against Molecular Dynamics (MD) results of Cottin-Bizonne et al. [Nature Mater.
2, 237 (2003)] and then applied to more complex situations which are hardly
accessible to MD simulations. The resulting analysis confirms that surface
roughness and capillary effects may conspire to promote a counter-intuitive but
significant reduction of the flow drag with substantial enhancement in the mass
flow rates and slip-lengths in the micrometric range for highly hydrophobic
surfaces.
