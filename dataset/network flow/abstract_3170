Studying the capacity of wireless multi-hop networks is an important problem
and extensive research has been done in the area. In this letter, we sift
through various capacity-impacting parameters and show that the capacity of
both static and mobile networks is fundamentally determined by the average
number of simultaneous transmissions, the link capacity and the average number
of transmissions required to deliver a packet to its destination. We then use
this result to explain and help to better understand existing results on the
capacities of static networks, mobile networks and hybrid networks and the
multicast capacity.
