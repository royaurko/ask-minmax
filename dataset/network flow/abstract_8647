It the literature have been identified three social mechanisms explaining the
similarity between people connected in the network of social relations
homophily, confounding and social contagion. The article proposes a simple
model for simulating mechanisms responsible for similarity of attitudes in
networks of social relations; along with a measure that is able to indicate
which of the three mechanisms has taken major role in the process.
