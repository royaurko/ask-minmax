We revisit the classical problem of the behavior of an isolated linear
polymer chain in confined spaces, introducing the distinction between two
different confinement regimes (the {\it weak} and the {\it strong} confinement
regimes, respectively). We then discuss some recent experimental findings
concerning the partitioning of individual polymers into protein pores. We also
generalize our study to the case of branched polymers, and study the
flow-injection properties of such objects into nanoscopic pores, for which the
strong confinement regime plays an important role.
