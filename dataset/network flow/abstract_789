We report and analyze the results of numerical studies of dense granular
flows in two and three dimensions, using both linear damped springs and
Hertzian force laws between particles. Chute flow generically produces a
constant density profile that satisfies scaling relations suggestive of a
Bagnold grain inertia regime. The type of force law has little impact on the
behavior of the system. Bulk and surface flows differ in their failure criteria
and flow rheology, as evidenced by the change in principal stress directions
near the surface. Surface-only flows are not observed in this geometry.
