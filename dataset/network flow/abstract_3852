Analytical results are derived for the bond percolation threshold and the
size of the giant connected component in a class of random networks with
non-zero clustering. The network's degree distribution and clustering spectrum
may be prescribed, and theoretical results match well to numerical simulations
on both synthetic and real-world networks.
