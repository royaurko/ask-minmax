Naturally-occurring granular materials often consist of angular particles
whose shape and frictional characteristics may have important implications on
macroscopic flow rheology. In this paper, we provide a theoretical account for
the peculiar phenomenon of auto-acoustic compaction -- non-monotonic variation
of shear band volume with shear rate in angular particles -- recently observed
in experiments. Our approach is based on the notion that the volume of a
granular material is determined by an effective-disorder temperature known as
the compactivity. Noise sources in a driven granular material couple its
various degrees of freedom and the environment, causing the flow of entropy
between them. The grain-scale dynamics is described by the
shear-transformation-zone (STZ) theory of granular flow, which accounts for
irreversible plastic deformation in terms of localized flow defects whose
density is governed by the state of configurational disorder. To model the
effects of grain shape and frictional characteristics, we propose an Ising-like
internal variable to account for nearest-neighbor grain interlocking and
geometric frustration, and interpret the effect of friction as an acoustic
noise strength. We show quantitative agreement between experimental
measurements and theoretical predictions, and propose additional experiments
that provide stringent tests on the new theoretical elements.
