Recent empirical studies have confirmed the key roles of complex contagion
mechanisms such as memory, social reinforcement, and decay effects in
information diffusion and behaviour spreading. Inspired by this fact, we here
propose a new agent--based model to capture the whole picture of the joint
action of the three mechanisms in information spreading, by quantifying the
complex contagion mechanisms as stickiness and persistence, and carry out
extensive simulations of the model on various networks. By numerical
simulations as well as theoretical analysis, we find that the stickiness of the
message determines the critical dynamics of message diffusion on tree-like
networks, whereas the persistence plays a decisive role on dense regular
lattices. In either network, the greater persistence can effectively make the
message more invasive. Of particular interest is that our research results
renew our previous knowledge that messages can spread broader in networks with
large clustering, which turns out to be only true when they can inform a
non-zero fraction of the population in the limit of large system size.
