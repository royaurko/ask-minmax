Many weighted scale-free networks are known to have a power-law correlation
between strength and degree of nodes, which, however, has not been well
explicated. We investigate the dynamic behaviors of resource/traffic flow on
scale-free networks. The dynamical system will evolve to a kinetic equilibrium
state, where the strength, defined by the amount of resource or traffic load,
is correlated with the degree in a power-law form with tunable exponent. The
analytical results agree with simulations well.
