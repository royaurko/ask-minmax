We consider the problem of extinction processes on random networks with a
given structure. For sufficiently large well-mixed populations, the process of
extinction of one or more state variable components occurs in the tail of the
quasi-stationary probability distribution, thereby making it a rare event. Here
we show how to extend the theory of large deviations to random networks to
predict extinction times. In particular, we use the theory to find the most
probable path leading to extinction. We apply the methodology to epidemic
models and discover how mean extinction times scale with epidemiological and
network parameters in Erdos-Renyi networks. The results are shown to compare
quite well with Monte Carlo simulations of the network in predicting both the
most probable paths to extinction and mean extinction times.
