In this paper, we consider a planar annulus, i.e., a bounded, two-connected,
Jordan domain, endowed with a sequence of triangulations exhausting it. We then
construct a corresponding sequence of maps which converge uniformly on compact
subsets of the domain, to a conformal homeomorphism onto the interior of a
Euclidean annulus bounded by two concentric circles. As an application, we will
affirm a conjecture raised by Ken Stephenson in the 90's which predicts that
the Riemann mapping can be approximated by a sequence of electrical networks.
