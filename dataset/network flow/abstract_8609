Interference shapes the interplay between capacity and coverage in cellular
networks. However, interference is non-deterministic and depends on various
system and channel parameters including user scheduling, frequency reuse, and
fading variations. We present an analytical approach for modeling the
distribution of intercell interference in the downlink of cellular networks as
a function of generic fading channel models and various scheduling schemes. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the derived expressions in calculating
location-based and average-based data rates in addition to capturing practical
tradeoffs between cell capacity and coverage in downlink cellular networks.
