Let $Y$ be a compact, oriented 3-manifold with a contact form $a$ and a
metric $ds^2$. Suppose that $F\to Y$ is a principal bundle with structure group
$U(2) = SU(2)\times_{\pm1}S^1$ such that $F/S^1$ is the principal SO(3) bundle
of orthonormal frames for $TY$. A unitary connection $A_0$ on the Hermitian
line bundle $F\times_{\det U(2)}\mathbb{C}$ determines a self-adjoint Dirac
operator $D_0$ on the $\mathbb{C}^2$-bundle $F\times_{U(2)}\mathbb{C}^2$.
  The contact form $a$ can be used to perturb the connection $A_0$ by
$A_0-ira$. This associates a one parameter family of Dirac operators $D_r$ for
$r\geq0$. When $r>>1$, we establish a sharp sup-norm estimate on the
eigensections of $D_r$ with small eigenvalues. The sup-norm estimate can be
applied to study the asymptotic behavior of the spectral flow from $D_0$ to
$D_r$. In particular, it implies that the subleading order term of the spectral
flow is strictly smaller than the order of $r^{\frac{3}{2}}$. We also relate
the $\eta$-invariant of $D_r$ to certain spectral asymmetry function involving
only the small eigenvalues of $D_r$.
