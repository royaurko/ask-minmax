This is the first in a series of papers that introduces a new paradigm for
understanding the jet in M87: a collimated relativistic flow in which strong
magnetic fields play a dominant dynamical role. Here wefocus on the flow
downstream of HST-1 - an essentially stationary flaring feature that ejects
trails of superluminal components. We propose that these components are quad
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic shock fronts (forward/reverse fast and slow
modes) in a narrow jet with a helically twisted magnetic structure. And we
demonstrate the properties of such shocks with simple one-dimensional numerical
simulations. Quasi-periodic ejections of similar component trails may be
responsible for the M87 jet substructures observed further downstream on 100 -
1,000 pc scales. This new paradigm requires the assimilation of some new
concepts into the astrophysical jet community, particularly the behavior of
slow/fast-mode waves/shocks and of current-driven helical kink instabilities.
However, the prospects of these ideas applying to a large number of other jet
systems may make this worth the effort.
