In this Letter, we examine the phantom energy accretion onto a
Kehagias-Sfetsos black hole in Ho$\check{r}$ava Lifshitz gravity. To discuss
the accretion process onto the black hole, the equations of phantom flow near
the black hole have been derived. It is found that mass of the black hole
decreases because of phantom accretion. We discuss the conditions for critical
accretion. Graphically, it has been found that the critical accretion phenomena
is possible for different values of parameters. The results for the
Schwarzschild black hole can be recovered in the limiting case.
