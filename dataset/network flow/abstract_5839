A network's transmission capacity is the maximal rate of traffic inflow that
the network can handle without causing congestion. Here we study how to enhance
this quantity by redistributing the capability of individual nodes while
preserving the total sum of node capability. We propose a practical and
effective node-capability allocation scheme which allocates a node's capability
based on the local knowledge of the node's connectivity. We show the scheme
enhances the transmission capacity by two orders of magnitude for networks with
heterogenous structures.
