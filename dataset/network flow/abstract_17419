We study the problem of prescribing the Paneitz curvature on higher
dimensional spheres. Particular attention is paid to the blow-up points, i.e.
the critical points at infinity of the corresponding variational problem. Using
topological tools and a careful analysis of the gradient flow lines in the
neighborhood of such critical points at infinity, we prove some existence
results.
