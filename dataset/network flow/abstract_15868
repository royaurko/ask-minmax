PageRank (PR) is an algorithm originally developed by Google to evaluate the
importance of web pages. Considering how deeply rooted Google's PR algorithm is
to gathering relevant information or to the success of modern businesses, the
question of rank-stability and choice of the damping factor (a parameter in the
algorithm) is clearly important. We investigate PR as a function of the damping
factor d on a network obtained from a domain of the World Wide Web, finding
that rank-reversal happens frequently over a broad range of PR (and of d). We
use three different correlation measures, Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall, to
study rank-reversal as d changes, and show that the correlation of PR vectors
drops rapidly as d changes from its frequently cited value, $d_0=0.85$.
Rank-reversal is also observed by measuring the Spearman and Kendall rank
correlation, which evaluate relative ranks rather than absolute PR.
Rank-reversal happens not only in directed networks containing rank-sinks but
also in a single strongly connected component, which by definition does not
contain any sinks. We relate rank-reversals to rank-pockets and bottlenecks in
the directed network structure. For the network studied, the relative rank is
more stable by our measures around $d=0.65$ than at $d=d_0$.
