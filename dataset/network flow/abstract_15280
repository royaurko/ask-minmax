In this work, we consider a multi-antenna cognitive ad hoc network (CAHNet)
with heterogeneous delay requirements. To fulfill the interference and delay
constraints simultaneously, we propose to perform adaptive zero-forcing
beamforming (ZFBF) at cognitive transmitters according to interference channel
state information (CSI). To assist the CAHNet to obtain the interference CSI,
we use a win-win inter-network cooperation strategy, namely quantized
interference CSI feedback from the primary network to CAHNet through a feedback
link, under the condition that the CAHNet pays a proper price for it.
Considering the scarcity of feedback and power resources, we focus on the
minimization of the overall resource cost subject to both interference and
delay constraints. To solve the problem, we derive a joint feedback and power
control algorithm amongst multiple links of CAHNet. Finally, simulation results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
