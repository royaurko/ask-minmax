We prove the differentiability of $\beta $ of Mather function on all homology
classes corresponding to rotation vectors of measures whose supports are
contained in a Lipschitz Lagrangian absorbing graph, invariant by Tonelli
Hamiltonians. We also show the relationship between local differentiability of
$\beta $ and local integrability of the Hamiltonian flow.
