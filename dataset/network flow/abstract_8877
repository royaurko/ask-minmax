We present the predictions of a hydrodynamic model for the flow observables
recently measured in the highest-multiplicity p+Pb collisions at the LHC. We
focus o the ridge phenomenon, which provides an important probe of the
long-range dynamics and may be used to support the collective interpretation of
the p+A data.
