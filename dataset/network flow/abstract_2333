In this paper, we study the long-term behavior of the conical K\"ahler-Ricci
flow on Fano manifold $M$. First, based on our work of locally uniform
regularity for the twisted K\"ahler-Ricci flows, we obtain a long-time solution
to the conical K\"ahler-Ricci flow by limiting a sequence of these twisted
flows. Second, we study the uniform Perelman's estimates of the twisted
K\"ahler-Ricci flows. After that, we prove that the conical K\"ahler-Ricci flow
must converge to a conical K\"ahler-Einstein metric if there exists one.
