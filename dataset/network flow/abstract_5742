We characterize the distributions of short cycles in a large metabolic
network previously shown to have small world characteristics and a power law
degree distribution. Compared with three classes of random networks, including
Erdoes-Renyi random graphs and synthetic small world networks of the same
connectivity, the metabolic network has a particularly large number of
triangles and a deficit in large cycles. Short cycles reduce the length of
detours when a connection is clipped, so we propose that long cycles in
metabolism may have been selected against in order to shorten transition times
and reduce the likelihood of oscillations in response to external
perturbations.
