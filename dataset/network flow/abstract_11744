Cellular signaling involves the transmission of environmental information
through cascades of stochastic biochemical reactions, inevitably introducing
noise that compromises signal fidelity. Each stage of the cascade often takes
the form of a kinase-phosphatase push-pull network, a basic unit of signaling
pathways whose malfunction is linked with a host of cancers. We show this
ubiquitous enzymatic network motif effectively behaves as a Wiener-Kolmogorov
(WK) optimal noise filter. Using concepts from umbral calculus, we generalize
the linear WK theory, originally introduced in the context of communication and
control engineering, to take nonlinear signal transduction and discrete
molecule populations into account. This allows us to derive rigorous
constraints for efficient noise reduction in this biochemical system. Our
mathematical formalism yields bounds on filter performance in cases important
to cellular function---like ultrasensitive response to stimuli. We highlight
features of the system relevant for optimizing filter efficiency, encoded in a
single, measurable, dimensionless parameter. Our theory, which describes noise
control in a large class of signal transduction networks, is also useful both
for the design of synthetic biochemical signaling pathways, and the
manipulation of pathways through experimental probes like oscillatory input.
