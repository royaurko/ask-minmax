Network functions virtualization (NFV) is an appealing vision that promises
to dramatically reduce capital and operating expenses for cellular providers.
However, existing efforts in this space leave open broad issues about how NFV
deployments should be instantiated or how they should be provisioned. In this
paper, we present an initial attempt at a framework that will help network
operators systematically evaluate the potential benefits that different points
in the NFV design space can offer.
