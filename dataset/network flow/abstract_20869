We are motivated by the problem of designing a simple distributed algorithm
for Peer-to-Peer streaming applications that can achieve high throughput and
low delay, while allowing the neighbor set maintained by each peer to be small.
While previous works have mostly used tree structures, our algorithm constructs
multiple random directed Hamiltonian cycles and disseminates content over the
superposed graph of the cycles. We show that it is possible to achieve the
maximum streaming capacity even when each peer only transmits to and receives
from Theta(1) neighbors. Further, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves
the streaming delay of Theta(log N) when the streaming rate is less than
(1-1/K) of the maximum capacity for any fixed integer K>1, where N denotes the
number of peers in the network. The key theoretical contribution is to
characterize the distance between peers in a graph formed by the superposition
of directed random Hamiltonian cycles, in which edges from one of the cycles
may be dropped at random. We use Doob martingales and graph expansion ideas to
characterize this distance as a function of N, with high probability.
