Interactions between units in phyical, biological, technological, and social
systems usually give rise to intrincate networks with non-trivial structure,
which critically affects the dynamics and properties of the system. The focus
of most current research on complex networks is on global network properties. A
caveat of this approach is that the relevance of global properties hinges on
the premise that networks are homogeneous, whereas most real-world networks
have a markedly modular structure. Here, we report that networks with different
functions, including the Internet, metabolic, air transportation, and protein
interaction networks, have distinct patterns of connections among nodes with
different roles, and that, as a consequence, complex networks can be classified
into two distinct functional classes based on their link type frequency.
Importantly, we demonstrate that the above structural features cannot be
captured by means of often studied global properties.
