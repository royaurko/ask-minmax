We consider a stochastic flow driven by a finite dimensional Brownian motion.
We show that almost every realization of such a flow exhibits strong
statistical properties such as the exponential convergence of an initial
measure to the equilibrium state and the central limit theorem. The proof uses
new estimates of the mixing rates of the multipoint motion.
