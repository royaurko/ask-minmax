A recurring motif in gene regulatory networks is transcription factors (TFs)
that regulate each other, and then bind to overlapping sites on DNA, where they
interact and synergistically control transcription of a target gene. Here, we
suggest that this motif maximizes information flow in a noisy network. Gene
expression is an inherently noisy process due to thermal fluctuations and the
small number of molecules involved. A consequence of multiple TFs interacting
at overlapping binding-sites is that their binding noise becomes correlated.
Using concepts from information theory, we show that in general a signaling
pathway transmits more information if 1) noise of one input is correlated with
that of the other, 2) input signals are not chosen independently. In the case
of TFs, the latter criterion hints at up-stream cross-regulation. We
demonstrate these ideas for competing TFs and feed-forward gene regulatory
modules, and discuss generalizations to other signaling pathways. Our results
challenge the conventional approach of treating biological noise as
uncorrelated fluctuations, and present a systematic method for understanding TF
cross-regulation networks either from direct measurements of binding noise, or
bioinformatic analysis of overlapping binding-sites.
