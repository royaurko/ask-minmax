The proliferation of media sharing and social networking websites has brought
with it vast collections of site-specific user generated content. The result is
a Social Networking Divide in which the concepts and structure common across
different sites are hidden. The knowledge and structures from one social site
are not adequately exploited to provide new information and resources to the
same or different users in comparable social sites. For music bloggers, this
latent structure, forces bloggers to select sub-optimal blogrolls. However, by
integrating the social activities of music bloggers and listeners, we are able
to overcome this limitation: improving the quality of the blogroll
neighborhoods, in terms of similarity, by 85 percent when using tracks and by
120 percent when integrating tags from another site.
