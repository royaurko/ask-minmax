We present fully general relativistic equations governing viscous transonic
flows in vertical equilibrium in Kerr geometry. We find the complete set of
global solutions (both for Optically thick and optically thin flows) in the
weak viscosity limit. We show that for a large region of parameter space,
centrifugal pressure supported standing shocks can form in accretion and winds
very close to the black hole horizon, both for co-rotating and contra-rotating
flows. We compute the nature of the shear tensor for complete transonic
solutions and discuss the consequences of its reversal properties.
