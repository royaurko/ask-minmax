Models of biochemical networks are frequently high-dimensional and complex.
Reduction methods that preserve important dynamical properties are therefore
essential in their study. Interactions between the nodes in such networks are
frequently modeled using a Hill function, $x^n/(J^n+x^n)$. Reduced ODEs and
Boolean networks have been studied extensively when the exponent $n$ is large.
However, the case of small constant $J$ appears in practice, but is not well
understood. In this paper we provide a mathematical analysis of this limit, and
show that a reduction to a set of piecewise linear ODEs and Boolean networks
can be mathematically justified. The piecewise linear systems have closed form
solutions that closely track those of the fully nonlinear model. On the other
hand, the simpler, Boolean network can be used to study the qualitative
behavior of the original system. We justify the reduction using geometric
singular perturbation theory and compact convergence, and illustrate the
results in networks modeling a genetic switch and a genetic oscillator.
