We apply lattice Boltzmann methods to study the relaxation of the velocity
profile in binary fluids under shear during spinodal decomposition. In simple
fluids, when a shear flow is applied on the boundaries of the system, the time
required to obtain a triangular profile is inversely proportional to the
viscosity and proportional to the square of the size of the system. We find
that the same behaviour also occurs for binary mixtures, for any component
ratio in the mixture and independently from the time when shear flow is
switched on during phase separation.
