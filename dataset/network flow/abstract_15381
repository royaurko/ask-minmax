The spread of rumors, which are known as unverified statements of uncertain
origin, may cause tremendous number of social problems. If it would be possible
to identify factors affecting spreading a rumor (such as agents' desires, trust
network, etc.), then this could be used to slowdown or stop its spreading. A
computational model that includes rumor features and the way a rumor is spread
among society's members, based on their desires, is therefore needed. Our
research is centering on the relation between the homogeneity of the society
and rumor convergence in it and result shows that the homogeneity of the
society is a necessary condition for convergence of the spreading rumor.
