This paper explores the potential of volunteered geographical information
from social media for informing geographical models of behavior, based on a
case study of museums in Yorkshire, UK. A spatial interaction model of visitors
to 15 museums from 179 administrative zones is constructed to test this
potential. The main input dataset comprises geo-tagged messages harvested using
the Twitter Streaming Application Programming Interface (API), filtered,
analyzed and aggregated to allow direct comparison with the model's output.
Comparison between model output and tweet information allowed the calibration
of model parameters to optimize the fit between flows to museums inferred from
tweets and flow matrices generated by the spatial interaction model. We
conclude that volunteered geographic information from social media sites have
great potential for informing geographical models of behavior, especially if
the volume of geo-tagged social media messages continues to increase. However,
we caution that volunteered geographical information from social media has some
major limitations so should be used only as a supplement to more consistent
data sources or when official datasets are unavailable.
