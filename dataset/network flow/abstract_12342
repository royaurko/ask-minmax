We propose an algorithm for detecting communities of links in networks which
uses local information, is based on a new evaluation function, and allows for
pervasive overlaps of communities. The complexity of the clustering task
requires the application of a memetic algorithm that combines probabilistic
evolutionary strategies with deterministic local searches. In Part 2 we will
present results of experiments with a large citation network of astrophysical
papers.
