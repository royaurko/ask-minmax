This study presents novel methods for computing fixed points of positive
concave mappings and for characterizing the existence of fixed points. These
methods are important in many planning and optimization tasks in wireless
networks. For example, previous studies have shown that the feasibility of a
network design can be quickly evaluated by computing the fixed point of a
concave mapping that is constructed based on many environmental and network
control parameters such as the position of base stations, channel conditions,
and antenna tilts. To address this and more general problems, we show two
alternative but equivalent ways to construct a matrix that is guaranteed to
have spectral radius strictly smaller than one if the corresponding mapping has
a fixed point. This matrix is then used to build a new mapping that preserves
the fixed point of the original positive concave mapping. We show that the
standard fixed point iterations using the new mapping converges faster than the
standard iterations applied to the original concave mapping. As exemplary
applications of the proposed methods, we consider the problems of power and
load planning in networks based on the orthogonal frequency division multiple
access (OFDMA) technology.
