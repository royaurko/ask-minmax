This study is devoted to the problem of parametric synthesis of multi-service
telecommunication sys-tems. The main characteristics of telecommunication
systems, which are brought to account in an article, are multilayer structure
formed by the overlayed networks and presence flows with self-similarity
effect. For accounting these features of modern telecommunications systems is
proposed to use a multi-layered graph for describing the system structure, and
self-similar processes model for modeling flows in a network. Solution of
parametric synthesis problem is reduced to a nonlinear programming problem
which is solved by using gradient descent method.
