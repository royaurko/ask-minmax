We consider the properties of vibrational dynamics on random networks, with
random masses and spring constants. The localization properties of the
eigenstates contrast greatly with the Laplacian case on these networks. We
introduce several real-space renormalization techniques which can be used to
describe this dynamics on general networks, drawing on strong disorder
techniques developed for regular lattices. The renormalization group is capable
of elucidating the localization properties, and provides, even for specific
network instances, a fast approximation technique for determining the spectra
which compares well with exact results.
