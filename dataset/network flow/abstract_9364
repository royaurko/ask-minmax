Wireless Networks rendering varied services has not only become the order of
the day but the demand of a large pool of customers as well. Thus, security of
wireless networks has become a very essential design criterion. This paper
describes our research work focused towards creating secure cognitive wireless
local area networks using soft computing approaches. The present dense Wireless
Local Area Networks (WLAN) pose a huge threat to network integrity and are
vulnerable to attacks. In this paper we propose a secure Cognitive Framework
Architecture (CFA). The Cognitive Security Manager (CSM) is the heart of CFA.
The CSM incorporates access control using Physical Architecture Description
Layer (PADL) and analyzes the operational matrices of the terminals using multi
layer neural networks, acting accordingly to identify contributorized access and
uncontributorized usage patterns.
