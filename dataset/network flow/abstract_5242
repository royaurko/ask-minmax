In micro-swimmer suspensions locomotion necessarily generates fluid motion,
and it is known that such flows can lead to collective behavior from unbiased
swimming. We examine the complementary problem of how chemotaxis is affected by
self-generated flows. A kinetic theory coupling run-and-tumble chemotaxis to
the flows of collective swimming shows separate branches of chemotactic and
hydrodynamic instabilities for isotropic suspensions, the first driving
aggregation, the second producing increased orientational order in suspensions
of "pushers" and maximal disorder in suspensions of "pullers". Nonlinear
simulations show that hydrodynamic interactions can limit and modify
chemotactically-driven aggregation dynamics. In puller suspensions the dynamics
form aggregates that are mutually-repelling due to the non-trivial flows. In
pusher suspensions chemotactic aggregation can lead to destabilizing flows that
fragment the regions of aggregation.
