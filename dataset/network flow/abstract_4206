The following \textit{network computing} problem is considered. Source nodes
in a directed acyclic network generate independent messages and a single
receiver node computes a target function $f$ of the messages. The objective is
to maximize the average number of times $f$ can be computed per network usage,
i.e., the ``computing capacity''. The \textit{network coding} problem for a
single-receiver network is a special case of the network computing problem in
which all of the source messages must be reproduced at the receiver. For
network coding with a single receiver, routing is known to achieve the capacity
by achieving the network \textit{min-cut} upper bound. We extend the definition
of min-cut to the network computing problem and show that the min-cut is still
an upper bound on the maximum achievable rate and is tight for computing (using
coding) any target function in multi-edge tree networks and for computing
linear target functions in any network. We also study the bound's tightness for
different classes of target functions. In particular, we give a lower bound on
the computing capacity in terms of the Steiner tree packing number and a
different bound for symmetric functions. We also show that for certain networks
and target functions, the computing capacity can be less than an arbitrarily
small fraction of the min-cut bound.
