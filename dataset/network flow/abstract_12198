We derive exact equations that determine the spectra of undirected and
directed sparsely connected regular graphs containing loops of arbitrary
length. The implications of our results to the structural and dynamical
properties of networks are discussed by showing how loops influence the size of
the spectral gap and the propensity for synchronization. Analytical formulas
for the spectrum are obtained for specific length of the loops.
