Flow electrification of polymer melts is an important side effect of polymer
processing. The studies dealing with this phenomenon are seldom and most of the
scientific work has been focused on flow electrification of aqueous and
insulating Newtonian liquids. From that prior art it is well established that
the flow electrification in Newtonian liquids is a consequence of the formation
of an ionic double layer. Convection of this layer induces the electrification
of the liquid at the outlet of the pipe. In those models, the key parameters
governing the flow electrification are thus the intrinsic electrical properties
of the polymer and the flow characteristics. In this work, we reconsider the
assumptions made previously and we propose a new approach to modelise the flow
electrification in the particular case of non-Newtonian polymer materials in
laminar flow conditions. We establish that, a key parameter for the
electrification quantification in the polymer melt is the shape of the velocity
profile. Additionally, in some cases, we show that a slip velocity at the
polymer/die wall interface must be considered to describe accurately the
electrification. As a consequence, we deduce that the slip velocity at the
interface can be calculated by measuring the electrification: this work gives
an alternative manner to measure the slip velocity during polymer flow.
