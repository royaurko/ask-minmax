Energy efficient routing protocols are consistently cited as efficient
solutions for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) routing. The area of WSNs is one
of the emerging and fast growing fields which brought low cost, low power and
multi-functional sensor nodes. In this paper, we examine some protocols related
to homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. To evaluate the efficiency of
different clustering schemes, we compare five clustering routing protocols; Low
Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), Threshold Sensitive Energy
Efficient Sensor Network (TEEN), Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC)
and two variants of TEEN which are Clustering and Multi-Hop Protocol in
Threshold Sensitive Energy Efficient Sensor Network (CAMPTEEN) and Hierarchical
Threshold Sensitive Energy Efficient Sensor Network (H-TEEN). The contribution
of this paper is to introduce sink mobility to increase the network life time
of hierarchal routing protocols. Two scenarios are discussed to compare the
performances of routing protocols; in first scenario static sink is implanted
and in later one mobile sink is used. We perform analytical simulations in
MATLAB by using different performance metrics such as, number of alive nodes,
number of dead nodes and throughput.
