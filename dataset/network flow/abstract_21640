To verify the conjecture that Yang-Mills theory in the infrared limit is
equivalent to a spin system whose excitations are knot solitons, a numerical
algorithm based on the inverse Monte Carlo method is proposed. To investigate
the stability of the effective spin field action, numerical studies of the
renormalization group flow for the coupling constants are suggested. A
universality of the effective spin field action is also discussed.
