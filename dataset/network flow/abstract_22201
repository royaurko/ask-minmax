A novel $\pi$-Camassa--Holm system is studied as a geodesic flow on a
semidirect product obtained from the diffeomorphism group of the circle. We
present the corresponding details of the geometric formalism for metric Euler
equations on infinite-dimensional Lie groups and compare our results to what
has already been obtained for the usual two-component Camassa--Holm equation.
Our approach results in well-posedness theorems and explicit computations of
the sectional curvature.
