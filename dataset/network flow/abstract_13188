We demonstrate that in Optimal Velocity Model (OVM) delay times of vehicles
coming from the dynamical equation of motion of OVM almost explain the order of
delay times observed in actual traffic flows without introducing explicit delay
times. Delay times in various cases are estimated: the case of a leader vehicle
and its follower, a queue of vehicles controlled by traffic lights and
many-vehicle case of highway traffic flow. The remarkable result is that in
most of the situation for which we can make a reasonable definition of a delay
time, the obtained delay time is of order 1 second.
