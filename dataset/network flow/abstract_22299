The Log-Poisson phenomenological description of the turbulent energy cascade
is evoked to discuss high-order statistics of velocity derivatives and the
mapping between their probability distribution functions at different Reynolds
numbers. The striking confirmation of theoretical predictions suggests that
numerical solutions of the flow, obtained at low/moderate Reynolds numbers can
play an important quantitative role in the analysis of experimental high
Reynolds number phenomena, where small scales fluctuations are in general
inaccessible from direct numerical simulations.
