We present sufficient conditions for multicasting a set of correlated sources
over cooperative networks. We propose joint source-Wyner-Ziv
encoding/sliding-window decoding scheme, in which each receiver considers an
ordered partition of other nodes. Subject to this scheme, we obtain a set of
feasibility constraints for each ordered partition. We consolidate the results
of different ordered partitions by utilizing a result of geometrical approach
to obtain the sufficient conditions. We observe that these sufficient
conditions are indeed necessary conditions for Aref networks. As a consequence
of the main result, we obtain an achievable rate region for networks with
multicast demands. Also, we deduce an achievability result for two-way relay
networks, in which two nodes want to communicate over a relay network.
