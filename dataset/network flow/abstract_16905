We present a novel geographical routing scheme for spontaneous wireless mesh
networks. Greedy geographical routing has many advantages, but suffers from
packet losses occurring at the border of voids. In this paper, we propose a
flexible greedy routing scheme that can be adapted to any variant of
geographical routing and works for any connectivity graph, not necessarily Unit
Disk Graphs. The idea is to reactively detect voids, backtrack packets, and
propagate information on blocked sectors to reduce packet loss. We also propose
an extrapolating algorithm to reduce the latency of void discovery and to limit
route stretch. Performance evaluation via simulation shows that our modified
greedy routing avoids most of packet losses.
