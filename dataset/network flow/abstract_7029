Flow fields are often represented by a set of static arrows to illustrate
scientific vulgarization, documentary film, meteorology, etc. This simple
schematic representation lets an observer intuitively interpret the main
properties of a flow: its orientation and velocity magnitude. We propose to
generate dynamic versions of such representations for 2D unsteady flow fields.
Our algorithm smoothly animates arrows along the flow while controlling their
density in the domain over time. Several strategies have been combined to lower
the unavoidable popping artifacts arising when arrows appear and disappear and
to achieve visually pleasing animations. Disturbing arrow rotations in low
velocity regions are also handled by continuously morphing arrow glyphs to
semi-transparent discs. To substantiate our method, we provide results for
synthetic and real velocity field datasets.
