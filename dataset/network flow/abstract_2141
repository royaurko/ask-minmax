When using appropriate surfactants, oil and aqueous foam can be intimately
mixed without the foam being destroyed. In this Letter, we show that a foam,
initially free of oil, can draw an oil drop under the action of capillary
forces and stretch it through the aqueous network. We focus on the suction of
oil by a single horizontal foam channel, known as a Plateau border. In such
confined channels, imbibition dynamics are governed by a balance between
capillarity and viscosity. Yet, the scaling law for our system differs from
that of classical imbibition in porous media such as aqueous foam. This is due
to the particular geometry of the liquid channels: Plateau borders filled with
foaming solution are always concave whereas they can be convex or flat when
filled with oil. Finally, the oil slug, confined in the Plateau border,
fragments into droplets following a film breakup.
