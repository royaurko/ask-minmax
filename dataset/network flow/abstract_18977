Social network analysis (SNA), which is a research field describing and
modeling the social connection of a certain group of people, is popular among
network services. Our topic words analysis project is a SNA method to visualize
the topic words among emails from Obama.com to accounts registered in Columbus,
Ohio. Based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, a popular topic model
of SNA, our project characterizes the preference of senders for target group of
receptors. Gibbs sampling is used to estimate topic and word distribution. Our
training and testing data are emails from the carbon-free server
Datagreening.com. We use parallel computing tool BashReduce for word processing
and generate related words under each latent topic to discovers typical
information of political news sending specially to local Columbus receptors.
Running on two instances using paralleling tool BashReduce, our project
contributes almost 30% speedup processing the raw contents, comparing with
processing contents on one instance locally. Also, the experimental result
shows that the LDA model applied in our project provides precision rate 53.96%
higher than TF-IDF model finding target words, on the condition that
appropriate size of topic words list is selected.
