Malware writers have employed various obfuscation and polymorphism techniques
to thwart static analysis approaches and bypassing antivirus tools. Dynamic
analysis techniques, however, have essentially overcome these deceits by
observing the actual behaviour of the code execution. In this regard, various
methods, techniques and tools have been proposed. However, because of the
diverse concepts and strategies used in the implementation of these methods and
tools, security researchers and malware analysts find it difficult to select
the required optimum tool to investigate the behaviour of a malware and to
contain the associated risk for their study. Focusing on two dynamic analysis
techniques: Function Call monitoring and Information Flow Tracking, this paper
presents a comparison framework for dynamic malware analysis tools. The
framework will assist the researchers and analysts to recognize the tools
implementation strategy, analysis approach, system wide analysis support and
its overall handling of binaries, helping them to select a suitable and
effective one for their study and analysis.
