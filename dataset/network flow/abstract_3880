This review explains in a self-contained way the properties of random Boolean
networks and their attractors, with a special focus on critical networks. Using
small example networks, analytical calculations, phenomenological arguments,
and problems to solve, the basic concepts are introduced and important results
concerning phase diagrams, numbers of relevant nodes and attractor properties
are derived.
