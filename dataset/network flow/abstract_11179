We report on our experience on multidimensional aspects of our faculty's
network design and management, including some unique aspects such as
campus-wide VLANs and ghosting, security and monitoring, switching and routing,
and others. We outline a historical perspective on certain research, design,
and development decisions and discuss the network topology, its scalability,
and management in detail; the services our network provides, and its evolution.
We overview the security aspects of the management as well as data management
and automation and the use of the data by other members of the IT group in the
faculty.
