Network & internet security is the burning question of today's world and they
are deeply related to each other for secure successful data transmission.
Network security approach is totally based on the concept of network security
services. In this paper, a new system of network security service is
implemented which is more secure than conventional network security services.
This technique is mainly deals with two essential network security services,
one is user authentication and other is data confidentiality. For user
authentication this paper introduces Graphical Username & Voice Password
approaches which provides better security than conventional username & password
authentication process. In data confidentiality section this paper introduces
two layer private key for both message encryption & decryption which is mainly
applicable on 8 bit plain text data. This paper also provides the hints of
introducing other two network security services (integrity and non-repudiation)
as a future work.
