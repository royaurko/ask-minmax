We update our calculations of thermal-photon production in nuclear collisions
at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). Specifically, we address the
recent experimental observation of an elliptic flow of direct photons
comparable in magnitude to that of pions, which is at variance with
expectations based on quark-gluon plasma (QGP) dominated photon radiation. Our
thermal emission rate is based on previous work, i.e., resummed leading-order
QGP emission and in-medium hadronic rates in the confined phase. These rates
are nearly degenerate at temperatures close to the expected QCD-phase change.
The rates are convoluted over an improved elliptic-fireball expansion with
transverse- and elliptic-flow fields quantitatively constrained by empirical
light- and strange-hadron spectra. The resulting direct-photon spectra in
central Au-Au collisions are characterized by hadron-dominated emission up to
transverse momenta of ~2-3 GeV. The associated large elliptic flow in the
hadronic phase mitigates the discrepancy with the measured photon-v2 compared
to scenarios with QGP-dominated emission.
