We study the Glauber dynamics of Ising spin models with random bonds, on
finitely connected random graphs. We generalize a recent dynamical replica
theory with which to predict the evolution of the joint spin-field
distribution, to include random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. The
theory is applied to Ising ferromagnets on randomly diluted Bethe lattices,
where we study the evolution of the magnetization and the internal energy. It
predicts a prominent slowing down of the flow in the Griffiths phase, it
suggests a further dynamical transition at lower temperatures within the
Griffiths phase, and it is verified quantitatively by the results of Monte
Carlo simulations.
