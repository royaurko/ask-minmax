Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is currently widely used for the study of
HIV/AIDS-related high risk populations. However, recent studies have shown that
traditional RDS methods are likely to generate large variances and may be
severely biased since the assumptions behind RDS are seldom fully met in real
life. To improve estimation in RDS studies, we propose a new method to generate
estimates with ego network data, which is collected by asking RDS respondents
about the composition of their personal networks, such as "what proportion of
your friends are married?". By simulations on an extracted real-world social
network of gay men as well as on artificial networks with varying structural
properties, we show that the new estimator, RDSI^{ego} shows superior
performance over traditional RDS estimators. Importantly, RDSI^{ego} exhibits
strong robustness to the preference of peer recruitment and variations in
network structural properties, such as homophily, activity ratio, and community
structure. While the biases of traditional RDS estimators can sometimes be as
large as 10%~20%, biases of all RDSI^{ego} estimates are well restrained to be
less than 2%. The positive results henceforth encourage researchers to collect
ego network data for variables of interests by RDS, for both hard-to-access
populations and general populations when random sampling is not applicable. The
limitation of RDSI^{ego} is evaluated by simulating RDS assuming different
level of reporting error.
