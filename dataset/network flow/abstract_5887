Coded recurrent neural networks with three levels of sparsity are introduced.
The first level is related to the size of messages, much smaller than the
number of available neurons. The second one is provided by a particular coding
rule, acting as a local constraint in the neural activity. The third one is a
characteristic of the low final connection density of the network after the
learning phase. Though the proposed network is very simple since it is based on
binary neurons and binary connections, it is able to learn a large number of
messages and recall them, even in presence of strong erasures. The performance
of the network is assessed as a classifier and as an associative memory.
