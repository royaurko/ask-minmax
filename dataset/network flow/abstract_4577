Multi-radio multi-channel (MR-MC) networks contribute significant enhancement
in the network throughput by exploiting multiple radio interfaces and
non-overlapping channels. While throughput optimization is one of the main
targets in allocating resource in MR-MC networks, recently, the network energy
efficiency is becoming a more and more important concern. Although turning on
more radios and exploiting more channels for communication is always beneficial
to network capacity, they may not be necessarily desirable from an energy
efficiency perspective. The relationship between these two often conflicting
objectives has not been well-studied in many existing works. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of optimizing energy efficiency under full capacity
operation in MR-MC networks and analyze the optimal choices of numbers of
radios and channels. We provide detailed problem formulation and solution
procedures. In particular, for homogeneous commodity networks, we derive a
theoretical upper bound of the optimal energy efficiency and analyze the
conditions under which such optimality can be achieved. Numerical results
demonstrate that the achieved optimal energy efficiency is close to the
theoretical upper bound.
