We investigate the influence of medium corrections to the pion dispersion
relation on the pion dynamics in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions. To
do so a pion potential is extracted from the in-medium dispersion relation and
used in QMD calculations and thus we take care of both, real and imaginary part
of the pion optical potential. The potentials are determined from different
sources, i.e. from the $\Delta$--hole model and from phenomenological
approaches. Depending on the strength of the potential a reduction of the
anti-correlation of pion and nucleon flow in non-central collisions is observed
as well as an enhancement of the high energetic yield in transverse pion
spectra. A comparison to experiments, in particular to $p_t$-spectra for the
reaction Ca+Ca at 1 GeV/nucleon and the pion in-plane flow in Ne+Pb collisions
at 800 MeV/nucleon, generally favours a weak potential.
