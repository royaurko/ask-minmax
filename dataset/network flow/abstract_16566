Inner porous regions play a critical role in the load bearing capability of
large bones.We show that an extension of disordered elastic networks [Chung et.
al., Phys. Rev. B, {\bf 54}, 15094 (1996)] exhibits analogs of several known
mechanical features of bone. The "stress-backbones" and histograms of stress
distributions for healthy and weak networks are shown to be qualitatively
different. A hereto untested relationship between bone density and bone
strength is presented.
