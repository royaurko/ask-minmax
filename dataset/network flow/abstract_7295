We show that certain non-linear dynamical systems with non-linearities in the
form of Hill functions, can be approximated by piecewise linear dynamical
systems. The resulting piecewise systems have closed form solutions that can be
used to understand the behavior of the fully nonlinear system. We justify the
reduction using geometric singular perturbation theory, and illustrate the
results in networks modeling a genetic switch and a genetic oscillator.
