A simple contactless method suitable to discern between the intergrain
(circular) current, which flows in the thin superconducting ring, and the
intragrain current, which does not cross the weakest link, has been proposed.
At first, we show that the intergrain current may directly be estimated from
the magnetic flux density $B(\pm z_0)$ measured by the Hall sensor positioned
in the special points $\pm z_0$ above/below the ring center. The experimental
and the numerical techniques to determine the value $z_0$ are discussed. Being
very promising for characterization of a current flowing across the joints in
welded YBaCuO rings (its dependencies on the temperature and the external
magnetic field as well as the time dissipation), the approach has been applied
to study corresponding properties of the intra- and intergrain currents flowing
across the $a$-twisted grain boundaries which are frequent in bulk
melt-textured YBaCuO samples. We present experimental data related to the flux
penetration inside a bore of MT YBaCuO rings both in the non-magnetized, virgin
state and during the field reversal. The shielding properties and their
dependence on external magnetic fields are also studied. Besides, we consider
the flux creep effects and their influence on the current re-distribution
during a dwell.
