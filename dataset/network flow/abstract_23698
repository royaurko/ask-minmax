Urban streets patterns form planar networks whose empirical properties cannot
be accounted for by simple models such as regular grids or Voronoi
tesselations. Striking statistical regularities across different cities have
been recently empirically found, suggesting that a general and
details-independent mechanism may be in action. We propose a simple model based
on a local optimization process combined with ideas previously proposed in
studies of leaf pattern formation. The statistical properties of this model are
in good agreement with the observed empirical patterns. Our results thus
suggests that in the absence of a global design strategy, the evolution of many
different transportation networks indeed follow a simple universal mechanism.
