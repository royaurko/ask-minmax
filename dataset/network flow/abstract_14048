Non-spherical explosions develop non-radial flows as the pattern of shock
emergence progresses across the stellar surface. In supernovae these flows can
limit ejecta speeds, stifle shock breakout emission, and cause collisions
outside the star. Similar phenomena occur in stellar and planetary collisions,
tidal disruption events, accretion-induced collapses, and propagating
detonations. We present two-dimensional, nested-grid Athena simulations of
non-radial shock emergence in a frame comoving with the breakout pattern,
focusing on the adiabatic, non-relativistic limit in a plane stratified
envelope. We set boundary conditions using a known self-similar solution and
explore the role of box size and resolution on the result. The shock front
curves toward the stellar surface, and exhibits a kink from which weak
discontinuities originate. Flow around the point of shock emergence is neither
perfectly steady nor self-similar. Waves and vortices, which are not
predominantly due to grid effects, emanate from this region. The post-shock
flow is deflected along the stellar surface, and its pressure disturbs the
stellar atmosphere upstream of the emerging shock. We use the numerical results
and their analytical limits to predict the effects of radiation transfer and
gravity, which are not included in our simulations.
