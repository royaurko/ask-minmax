We apply non-extensive methods to the statistical analysis of fully developed
turbulent flows. Probability density functions of velocity differences at
distance r obtained by extremizing the Tsallis entropies coincide well with
what is measured in turbulence experiments. We derive a set of relations
between the hyperflatness factors F_m and the non-extensitivity parameter q,
which can be used to directly extract the function q(r) from experimentally
measured structure functions. We comment on various non-extensive methods to
calculate the moment scaling exponents zeta_m.
