The q-composite key predistribution scheme [1] is used prevalently for secure
communications in large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Prior work
[2]-[4] explores topological properties of WSNs employing the q-composite
scheme for q = 1 with unreliable communication links modeled as independent
on/off channels. In this paper, we investigate topological properties related
to the node degree in WSNs operating under the q-composite scheme and the
on/off channel model. Our results apply to general q and are stronger than
those reported for the node degree in prior work even for the case of q being
1. Specifically, we show that the number of nodes with certain degree
asymptotically converges in distribution to a Poisson random variable, present
the asymptotic probability distribution for the minimum degree of the network,
and establish the asymptotically exact probability for the property that the
minimum degree is at least an arbitrary value. Numerical experiments confirm
the validity of our analytical findings.
