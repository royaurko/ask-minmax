In random access protocols, the service rate depends on the number of
stations with a packet buffered for transmission. We demonstrate via numerical
analysis that this state-dependent rate along with the consideration of Poisson
traffic and infinite (or large enough to be considered infinite) buffer size
may cause a high-throughput and extremely long (in the order of hours)
transitory phase when traffic arrivals are right above the stability limit. We
also perform an experimental evaluation to provide further insight into the
characterisation of this transitory phase of the network by analysing
statistical properties of its duration. The identification of the presence as
well as the characterisation of this behaviour is crucial to avoid
misprediction, which has a significant potential impact on network performance
and optimisation. Furthermore, we discuss practical implications of this
finding and propose a distributed and low-complexity mechanism to keep the
network operating in the high-throughput phase.
