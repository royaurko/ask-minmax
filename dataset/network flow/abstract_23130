The incorporation of particle inertia into the usual mean field theory for
particle aggregation and fragmentation in fluid flows is still an unsolved
problem. We therefore suggest an alternative approach that is based on the
dynamics of individual inertial particles and apply this to study steady state
particle size distributions in a 3-d synthetic turbulent flow. We show how a
fractal-like structure, typical of aggregates in natural systems, can be
incorporated in an approximate way into the aggregation and fragmentation model
by introducing effective densities and radii. We apply this model to the
special case of marine aggregates in coastal areas and investigate numerically
the impact of three different modes of fragmentation: large-scale splitting,
where fragments have similar sizes, erosion, where one of the fragments is much
smaller than the other and uniform fragmentation, where all sizes of fragments
occur with the same probability. We find that the steady state particle size
distribution depends strongly on the mode of fragmentation. The resulting size
distribution for large-scale fragmentation is exponential. As some aggregate
distributions found in published measurements share this latter characteristic,
this may indicate that large-scale fragmentation is the primary mode of
fragmentation in these cases.
