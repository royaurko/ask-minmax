We estimate the thermal conductivity of a weakly collisional magnetized
plasma with chaotic magnetic field fluctuations. When the fluctuation spectrum
extends over two or more decades in wave-vector, we find that thermal
conduction is very efficient; the conduction coefficient is only a factor ~5
below the classical Spitzer estimate. We suggest that conduction could play a
significant role in cooling flows in clusters of galaxies.
