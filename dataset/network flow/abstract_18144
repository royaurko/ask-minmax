Most MANET (Mobile Ad hoc NETwork) research assumes idealized propagation
models. Experimental results have shown significant divergence from simulation
results due to the effect of signal fading in realistic wireless communication
channels. In this paper, we characterize the impact of fading on protocol
performance. We first study the effect of fading on MAC performance and show
that its effect can be dominating. One of our important conclusions is that
eliminating RTS/CTS packets results in more effective operation under fading.
We also identify an unfairness problem that arises due to backoffs in the
presence of fading. Moreover, fading results in several subtle interactions
between the MAC and routing layers. We identify several of these problems and
make observations about effective approaches for addressing them. For example,
the criteria for determining the best path should not only consider the link
status but also the link order. In addition, because routing protocols rely on
MAC level transmission failure (when the retry limit is exceeded), route
failure errors are often generated unnecessarily. Finally, because MAC level
broadcasts are unreliable, they are especially vulnerable to fading. We analyze
these effects and outline preliminary solutions to them.
