The dynamics of a sphere fluidized in a nearly-levitating upflow of air were
previously found to be identical to those of a Brownian particle in a
two-dimensional harmonic trap, consistent with a Langevin equation [Ojha {\it
et al.}, Nature {\bf 427}, 521 (2004)]. The random forcing, the drag, and the
trapping potential represent different aspects of the interaction of the sphere
with the air flow. In this paper we vary the experimental conditions for a
single sphere, and report on how the force terms in the Langevin equation scale
with air flow speed, sphere radius, sphere density, and system size. We also
report on the effective interaction potential between two spheres in an upflow
of air.
