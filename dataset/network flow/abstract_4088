In this paper, we study how to get the Ricci expanders from W+-functional
through the heat kernel estimate of the conjugate heat equation to the type III
singularity of Ricci flow. The Gaussian upper and lower bounds are established
for the related heat kernel in accordance to the interesting work of Cao-Zhang
for the type I Rici flow.
