Elliptic flow holds much promise for studying the early-time thermalization
attained in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. Flow measurements also
provide a means of distinguishing between hydrodynamic models and calculations
which approach the low density (dilute gas) limit. Among the effects that can
complicate the interpretation of elliptic flow measurements are azimuthal
correlations that are unrelated to the reaction plane (non-flow correlations).
Using data for Au + Au collisions at sqrt{s_{NN}} = 130 GeV from the STAR TPC,
it is found that four-particle correlation analyses can reliably separate flow
and non-flow correlation signals. The latter account for on average about 15%
of the observed second-harmonic azimuthal correlation, with the largest
relative contribution for the most peripheral and the most central collisions.
The results are also corrected for the effect of flow variations within
centrality bins. This effect is negligible for all but the most central bin,
where the correction to the elliptic flow is about a factor of two. A simple
new method for two-particle flow analysis based on scalar products is
described. An analysis based on the distribution of the magnitude of the flow
vector is also described.
