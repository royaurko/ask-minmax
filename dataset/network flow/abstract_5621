Wireless broadband technology is now in motion to provide higher data rate,
wider coverage and improved mobility. Towards this the 4G - network is an
integration of various wireless technologies and expected to provide seamless
mobility. Moreover 4G-networks will be entirely packet switched systems based
on IP protocol. One of the research challenges for 4G-Network is the design of
intelligent mobility management techniques that take advantage of IP-based
technologies to achieve global roaming among various access technologies. Hence
Mobile IPv6 is considered to be one of the key technologies for integration of
heterogeneous networks. However the original Mobile IPv6 does not support fast
handover, which is essential function for mobile networks. Number of research
groups working towards this to develop a common protocol to enable seamless
mobility. In this paper we identify and explore the different issues and
challenges related to mobility management in 4G - networks.
