We propose a novel deterministic protocol, based on continuous light flows,
that enables us to control the concentration of light in generic plasmonic
nanostructures. Based on an exact inversion of the response tensor of the
nanosystem, the so-called Deterministic Optical Inversion (DOPTI) protocol
provides a physical solution for the incident field leading to a desired near
field pattern, expressed in the form of a coherent superposition of high order
beams. We demonstrate the high degree of control achieved on complex plasmonic
architectures and quantify its efficiency and accuracy.
