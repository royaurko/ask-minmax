This paper studies the stability of synchronized states in networks where
couplings between nodes are characterized by some distributed time delay, and
develops a generalized master stability function approach. Using a generic
example of Stuart-Landau oscillators, it is shown how the stability of
synchronized solutions in networks with distributed delay coupling can be
determined through a semi-analytic computation of Floquet exponents. The
analysis of stability of fully synchronized and of cluster or splay states is
illustrated for several practically important choices of delay distributions
and network topologies.
