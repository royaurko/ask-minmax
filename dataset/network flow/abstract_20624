We present previously unpublished photometry of three Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) microlensing events and show that the new photometry confirms the
microlensing interpretation of these events. These events were discovered by
the MACHO Project alert system and were also recovered by the analysis of the
5.7 year MACHO data set. This new photometry provides a substantial increase in
the signal-to-noise ratio over the previously published photometry and in all
three cases, the gravitational microlensing interpretation of these events is
strengthened. The new data consist of MACHO-Global Microlensing Alert Network
(GMAN) follow-up images from the CTIO 0.9 telescope plus difference imaging
photometry of the original MACHO data from the 1.3m "Great Melbourne" telescope
at Mt. Stromlo. We also combine microlensing light curve fitting with
photometry from high resolution HST images of the source stars to provide
further confirmation of these events and to show that the microlensing
interpretation of event MACHO-LMC-23 is questionable. Finally, we compare our
results with the analysis of Belokurov, Evans & Le Du who have attempted to
classify candidate microlensing events with a neural network method, and we
find that their results are contradicted by the new data and more powerful
light curve fitting analysis for each of the four events considered in this
paper. The failure of the Belokurov, Evans & Le Du method is likely to be due
to their use of a set of insensitive statistics to feed their neural networks.
