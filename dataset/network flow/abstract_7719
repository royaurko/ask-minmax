The well-posedness of a phase-field approximation to the Willmore flow with
area and volume constraints is established when the functional approximating
the area has no critical point satisfying the two constraints. The existence
proof relies on the underlying gradient flow structure of the problem: the time
discrete approximation is solved by a variational minimization principle. The
main difficulty stems from the nonlinearity of the area constraint.
