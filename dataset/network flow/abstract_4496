Technological advances in sensor manufacture, communication, and computing
are stimulating the development of new applications that are transforming
traditional vision systems into pervasive intelligent camera networks. The
analysis of visual cues in multi-camera networks enables a wide range of
applications, from smart home and office automation to large area surveillance
and traffic surveillance. While dense camera networks - in which most cameras
have large overlapping fields of view - are well studied, we are mainly
concerned with sparse camera networks. A sparse camera network undertakes large
area surveillance using as few cameras as possible, and most cameras have
non-overlapping fields of view with one another. The task is challenging due to
the lack of knowledge about the topological structure of the network,
variations in the appearance and motion of specific tracking targets in
different views, and the difficulties of understanding composite events in the
network. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive survey of recent
research results to address the problems of intra-camera tracking, topological
structure learning, target appearance modeling, and global activity
understanding in sparse camera networks. A number of current open research
issues are discussed.
