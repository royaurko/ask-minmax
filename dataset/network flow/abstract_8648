In order to utilize network resources and provide a more reliable delivery of
information, multipath routing algorithms are used with a higher priority than
single path routing. But providing the quality of service (QoS) requirements
while load balancing is done among multiple paths is still a challenge. In this
paper a new load balancing algorithm is proposed by using an explicit endpoint
admission control (EEAC) to achieve a dynamic load balancing algorithm, with
the ability to guarantee the end-to-end QoS for a variety of service classes.
The simulation results for non deterministic network conditions show that the
proposed algorithm increases the utilization of network resources and also
decreases the end-to-end delay.
