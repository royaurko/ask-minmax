A major current challenge poses the systematic construction of coarse-grained
models that are dynamically consistent, and, moreover, might be used for
systems driven out of thermal equilibrium. Here we present a novel prescription
that extends the Markov state modelling approach to driven systems. The first
step is to construct a complex network of microstates from detailed atomistic
simulations with transition rates that break detailed balance. The
coarse-graining is then carried out in the cycle space of this network. To this
end we introduce the concept of representatives, which stand for many cycles
with similar properties. We show how to find these cycle communities using
well-developed standard algorithms. Removing all cycles except for the
representatives defines the coarse-grained model, which is mapped back onto a
network with far fewer states and renormalized transition rates that, however,
preserve the entropy production of the original network. Our approach is
illustrated and validated for a single driven particle.
