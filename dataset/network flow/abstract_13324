We investigate the algebra generated by the topological Wilson loop operators
in WZW models. Wilson loops describe the nontrivial fixed points of the
boundary renormalization group flows triggered by Kondo perturbations. Their
enveloping algebra therefore encodes all the fixed points which can be reached
by sequences of Kondo flows. This algebra is easily described in the case of
SU(2), but displays a very rich structure for higher rank groups. In the latter
case, its action on known D-branes creates a profusion of new and generically
non-rational D-branes. We describe their symmetries and the geometry of their
worldvolumes. We briefly explain how to extend these results to coset models.
