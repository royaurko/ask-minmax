The efficient use of energy source in a sensor node is most desirable
criteria for prolong the life time of wireless sensor network. In this paper,
we propose a two layer hierarchical routing protocol called Cluster Based
Hierarchical Routing Protocol (CBHRP). We introduce a new concept called
head-set, consists of one active cluster head and some other associate cluster
heads within a cluster. The head-set members are responsible for control and
management of the network. Results show that this protocol reduces energy
consumption quite significantly and prolongs the life time of sensor network as
compared to LEACH.
