We present a dynamical analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 970 based on a
new set of radial velocities measured at ESO, Pic du Midi and Haute-Provence
observatories. Our analysis indicates that this cluster has a substructure and
is out of dynamical equilibrium. This conclusion is also supported by
differences in the positions of the peaks of the surface density distribution
and X-ray emission, as well as by the evidence of a large scale velocity
gradient in the cluster. We also found a discrepancy between the masses
inferred with the virial theorem and with the X-ray emission, what is expected
if the galaxies and the gas inside the cluster are not in hydrostatic
equilibrium. Abell 970 has a modest cooling flow, as is expected if it is out
of equilibrium as suggested by Allen (1998). We propose that cooling flows may
have an intermittent behavior, with phases of massive cooling flows being
followed by phases without significant cooling flows after the acretion of a
galaxy group massive enough to disrupt the dynamical equilibrium in the center
of the clusters. A massive cooling flow will be established again, after a new
equilibrium is achieved.
