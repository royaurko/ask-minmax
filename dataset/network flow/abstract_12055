We study synchronization phenomena in scale-free networks of asymetrically
coupled dynamical systems featuring degree-degree correlation in the connection
wiring. We show that when the interaction is dominant from the high-degree to
the low-degree or from the low-degree to the high-degree nodes, synchronization
is enhanced for assortative or disassortative degree-degree correlations
