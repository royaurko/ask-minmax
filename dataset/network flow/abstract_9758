The identification of communities in large-scale networks is a challenging
task to existing searching schemes when the communities overlap significantly
among their members, as often the case in large-scale social networks. The
strong overlaps render many algorithms invalid. We propose a detection scheme
based on properly merging the partial communities revealed by the ego networks
of each vertex. The general principle, merger criteria, and post-processing
procedures are discussed. This partial community merger algorithm (PCMA) is
tested on two modern benchmark models. It shows a linear time complexity and it
performs accurately and efficiently when compared with two widely used
algorithms. PCMA is then applied to a huge social network and millions of
communities are identified. A detected community can be visualized with all its
members as well as the number of different communities that each member belongs
to. The multiple memberships of a vertex, in turn, illustrates the significant
overlaps between communities that calls for the need of a novel and efficient
algorithm such as PCMA.
