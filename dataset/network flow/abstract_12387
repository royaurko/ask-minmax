It is known at a qualitative level that directional antennas can be used to
boost the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks. Lacking is a measure to
quantify this advantage and to compare directional antennas of different
footprint patterns. This paper introduces the concept of the effective beam
width (and the effective null width as its dual counterpart) as a measure which
quantitatively captures the capacity-boosting capability of directional
antennas. Beam width is commonly defined to be the directional angle spread
within which the main-lobe beam power is above a certain threshold. In
contrast, our effective beam width definition lumps the effects of the (i)
antenna pattern, (ii) active-node distribution, and (iii) channel
characteristics, on network capacity into a single quantitative measure. We
investigate the mathematical properties of the effective beam width and show
how the convenience afforded by these properties can be used to analyze the
effectiveness of complex directional antenna patterns in boosting network
capacity, with fading and multi-user interference taken into account. In
particular, we derive the extent to which network capacity can be scaled with
the use of phased array antennas. We show that a phased array antenna with N
elements can boost transport capacity of an Aloha-like network by a factor of
order N^1.620.
