We study the influence of the forcing on the steady turbulent states of a von
K\'arm\'an swirling flow, at constant impeller speed, or at constant torque. We
find that the different forcing conditions change the nature of the stability
of the steady states and reveal dynamical regimes that bear similarities with
low-dimensional systems. We suggest that this forcing dependence may be an out-
of-equilibrium analogue of the ensemble inequivalence, valid for long-range
interacting statistical systems, and that it may be applicable to other
turbulent systems.
