We present the results of mesoscopic dissipative particle dynamics (DPD)
simulations of coupled electrohydrodynamic phenomena on the micro- and
nanoscale. The effects of electroosmotic flow and slippage combined with
polyelectrolyte electrophoresis are investigated in detail, taking full account
of hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions. Our numerical results are in
excellent agreement with analytical calculations.
