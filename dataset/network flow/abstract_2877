Network theory provides a rich toolbox consisting of methods, measures, and
models for studying the structure and dynamics of complex systems found in
nature, society, or technology. Recently, it has been pointed out that many
real-world complex systems are more adequately mapped by networks of
interacting or interdependent networks, e.g., a power grid showing
interdependency with a communication network. Additionally, in many real-world
situations it is reasonable to include node weights into complex network
statistics to reflect the varying size or importance of subsystems that are
represented by nodes in the network of interest. E.g., nodes can represent
vastly different surface area in climate networks, volume in brain networks or
economic capacity in trade networks. In this letter, combining both ideas, we
derive a novel class of statistical measures for analysing the structure of
networks of interacting networks with heterogeneous node weights. Using a
prototypical spatial network model, we show that the newly introduced
node-weighted interacting network measures indeed provide an improved
representation of the underlying system's properties as compared to their
unweighted analogues. We apply our method to study the complex network
structure of cross-boundary trade between European Union (EU) and non-EU
countries finding that it provides important information on trade balance and
economic robustness.
