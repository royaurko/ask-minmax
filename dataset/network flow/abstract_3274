In this article, the extensional flow and viscosity and the
converging-diverging geometry were examined as the basis of the peculiar
viscoelastic behavior in porous media. The modified Bautista-Manero model,
which successfully describes shearthinning, elasticity and thixotropic
time-dependency, was used for modeling the flow of viscoelastic materials which
also show thixotropic attributes. An algorithm, originally proposed by Philippe
Tardy, that employs this model to simulate steadystate time-dependent flow was
implemented in a non-Newtonian flow simulation code using pore-scale modeling
and the initial results were analyzed. The findings are encouraging for further
future development.
