Securing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a hard problem. In particular,
network access control is notoriously difficult to achieve due to the inherent
broadcast characteristics of wireless communications: an attacker can easily
target any node in its transmission range and affect large parts of a sensor
network simultaneously. In this paper, we therefore propose a distributed
guardian system to protect a WSN based on physically regulating channel access
by means of selective interference. The guardians are deployed alongside a
sensor network, inspecting all local traffic, classifying packets based on
their content, and destroying any malicious packet while still on the air. In
that sense, the system tries to gain "air dominance" over attackers. A key
challenge in implementing the guardian system is the resulting real-time
requirement in order to classify and destroy packets during transmission. We
present a USRP2 software radio based guardian implementation for IEEE 802.15.4
that meets this challenge; using an FPGA-based design we can even check for the
content of the very last payload byte of a packet and still prevent its
reception by a potential victim mote. Our evaluation shows that the guardians
effectively block 99.9% of uncontributorized traffic in 802.15.4 networks in our
experiments, without disturbing the legitimate operations of the WSN.
