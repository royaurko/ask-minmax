In this paper we introduce a non-fuzzy measure which has been designed to
rank the partitions of a network's nodes into overlapping communities. Such a
measure can be useful for both quantifying clusters detected by various methods
and during finding the overlapping community-structure by optimization methods.
The theoretical problem referring to the separation of overlapping modules is
discussed, and an example for possible applications is given as well.
