A new order parameter approximation to Random Boolean Networks (RBN) is
introduced, based on the concept of Boolean derivative. A statistical argument
involving an annealed approximation is used, allowing to measure the order
parameter in terms of the statistical properties of a random matrix. Using the
same formalism, a Lyapunov exponent is calculated, allowing to provide the
onset of damage spreading through the network and how sensitive it is to
minimal perturbations. Finally, the Lyapunov exponents are obtained by means of
different approximations: through distance method and a discrete variant of the
Wolf's method for continuous systems.
