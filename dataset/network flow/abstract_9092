We are interested in fixed points in Boolean networks, {\em i.e.} functions
$f$ from $\{0,1\}^n$ to itself. We define the subnetworks of $f$ as the
restrictions of $f$ to the subcubes of $\{0,1\}^n$, and we characterizes a
class $\mathcal{F}$ of Boolean networks satisfying the following property:
Every subnetwork of $f$ has a unique fixed point if and only if $f$ has no
subnetwork in $\mathcal{F}$. This characterization generalizes the fixed point
theorem of Shih and Dong, which asserts that if for every $x$ in $\{0,1\}^n$
there is no directed cycle in the directed graph whose the adjacency matrix is
the discrete Jacobian matrix of $f$ evaluated at point $x$, then $f$ has a
unique fixed point. Then, denoting by $\mathcal{C}^+$ (resp. $\mathcal{C}^-$)
the networks whose the interaction graph is a positive (resp. negative) cycle,
we show that the non-expansive networks of $\mathcal{F}$ are exactly the
networks of $\mathcal{C}^+\cup \mathcal{C}^-$; and for the class of
non-expansive networks we get a "dichotomization" of the previous forbidden
subnetwork theorem: Every subnetwork of $f$ has at most (resp. at least) one
fixed point if and only if $f$ has no subnetworks in $\mathcal{C}^+$ (resp.
$\mathcal{C}^-$) subnetwork. Finally, we prove that if $f$ is a conjunctive
network then every subnetwork of $f$ has at most one fixed point if and only if
$f$ has no subnetwork in $\mathcal{C}^+$.
