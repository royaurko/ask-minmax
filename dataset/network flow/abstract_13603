We adjust Arnoux's coding, in terms of regular continued fractions, of the
geodesic flow on the modular surface to give a cross section on which the
return map is a double cover of the natural extension for the \alpha-continued
fractions, for each $\alpha$ in (0,1]. The argument is sufficiently robust to
apply to the Rosen continued fractions and their recently introduced
\alpha-variants.
