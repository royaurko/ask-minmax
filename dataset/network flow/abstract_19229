In Wireless Sensor Networks, the sensor nodes are battery powered small
devices designed for long battery life. These devices also lack in terms of
processing capability and memory. In order to provide high confidentiality to
these resource constrained network nodes, a suitable security algorithm is
needed to be deployed that can establish a balance between security level and
processing overhead. The objective of this research work is to perform a
security analysis and performance evaluation of recently proposed Secure Force
algorithm. This paper shows the comparison of Secure Force 64, 128, and 192 bit
architecture on the basis of avalanche effect (key sensitivity), entropy change
analysis, image histogram, and computational time. Moreover, based on the
evaluation results, the paper also suggests the possible solutions for the
weaknesses of the SF algorithm.
