The aim of this paper is to propose diffusion strategies for distributed
estimation over adaptive networks, assuming the presence of spatially
correlated measurements distributed according to a Gaussian Markov random field
(GMRF) model. The proposed methods incorporate prior information about the
statistical dependency among observations, while at the same time processing
data in real-time and in a fully decentralized manner. A detailed mean-square
analysis is carried out in order to prove stability and evaluate the
steady-state performance of the proposed strategies. Finally, we also
illustrate how the proposed techniques can be easily extended in order to
incorporate thresholding operators for sparsity recovery applications.
Numerical results show the potential advantages of using such techniques for
distributed learning in adaptive networks deployed over GMRF.
