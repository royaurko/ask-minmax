Non-radiating, advection-dominated, accretion flows are convectively
unstable. We calculate the two-dimensional (r-theta) structure of such flows
assuming that (1) convection transports angular momentum inwards, opposite to
normal viscosity and (2) viscous transport by other mechanisms (e.g., magnetic
fields) is weak (alpha << 1). Under such conditions convection dominates the
dynamics of the accretion flow and leads to a steady state structure that is
marginally stable to convection. We show that the marginally stable flow has a
constant temperature and rotational velocity on spherical shells, a net flux of
energy from small to large radii, zero net accretion rate, and a radial density
profile proportional to r^{-1/2}, flatter than the r^{-3/2} profile
characteristic of spherical accretion flows. This solution accurately describes
the full two-dimensional structure of recent axisymmetric numerical simulations
of advection-dominated accretion flows.
