A numerical simulation of fluid flows in a Laval nozzle is performed to
observe formations of acoustic black holes and the classical counterpart to
Hawking radiation under a realistic setting of the laboratory experiment. We
determined the Hawking temperature of the acoustic black hole from obtained
numerical data. Some noteworthy points in analyzing the experimental data are
clarified through our numerical simulation.
