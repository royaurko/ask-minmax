An increasing amount of geo-referenced mobile phone data enables the
identification of behavioral patterns, habits and movements of people. With
this data, we can extract the knowledge potentially useful for many
applications including the one tackled in this study - understanding spatial
variation of epidemics. We explored the datasets collected by a cell phone
service provider and linked them to spatial HIV prevalence rates estimated from
publicly available surveys. For that purpose, 224 features were extracted from
mobility and connectivity traces and related to the level of HIV epidemic in 50
Ivory Coast departments. By means of regression models, we evaluated predictive
ability of extracted features. Several models predicted HIV prevalence that are
highly correlated (>0.7) with actual values. Through contribution analysis we
identified key elements that impact the rate of infections. Our findings
indicate that night connectivity and activity, spatial area covered by users
and overall migrations are strongly linked to HIV. By visualizing the
communication and mobility flows, we strived to explain the spatial structure
of epidemics. We discovered that strong ties and hubs in communication and
mobility align with HIV hot spots.
