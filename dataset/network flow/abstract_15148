Interference in wireless networks is one of the key capacity-limiting
factors. Recently developed interference-embracing techniques show promising
performance on turning collisions into useful transmissions. However, the
interference-embracing techniques are hard to apply in practical applications
due to their strict requirements. In this paper, we consider utilising the
interference-embracing techniques in a common scenario of two interfering
sender-receiver pairs. By employing opportunistic listening and analog network
coding (ANC), we show that compared to traditional ARQ retransmission, a higher
retransmission throughput can be achieved by allowing two interfering senders
to cooperatively retransmit selected lost packets at the same time. This
simultaneous retransmission is facilitated by a simple handshaking procedure
without introducing additional overhead. Simulation results demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed cooperative retransmission.
