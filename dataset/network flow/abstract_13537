We prove existence and regularity of the stochastic flows used in the
stochastic Lagrangian formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
(with periodic boundary conditions), and consequently obtain a
$\holderspace{k}{\alpha}$ local existence result for the Navier-Stokes
equations. Our estimates are independent of viscosity, allowing us to consider
the inviscid limit. We show that as $\nu \to 0$, solutions of the stochastic
Lagrangian formulation (with periodic boundary conditions) converge to
solutions of the Euler equations at the rate of $O(\sqrt{\nu t})$.
