This paper studies the problem of content distribution in wireless
peer-to-peer networks where all nodes are selfish and non-cooperative. We
propose a model that considers both the broadcast nature of wireless channels
and the incentives of nodes, where each node aims to increase its own download
rate and reduces its upload rate through the course of content distribution. We
then propose a protocol for these selfish nodes to exchange contents. Our
protocol is distributed and does not require the exchange of money, reputation,
etc., and hence can be easily implemented without additional infrastructure.
Moreover, we show that our protocol can be easily modified to employ network
coding.
  The performance of our protocol is studied. We derive a closed-form
expression of Nash Equilibriums when there are only two files in the system.
The prices of anarchy, both from each node's perspective and the whole system's
perspective, are also characterized. Moreover, we propose a distributed
mechanism where each node adjusts its strategies only based on local
information and show that the mechanism converges to a Nash Equilibrium. We
also introduce an approach for calculating Nash Equilibriums for systems that
incorporate network coding when there are more than two files.
