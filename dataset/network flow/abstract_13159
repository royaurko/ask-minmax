The transverse mass spectra and mid-rapidity yields for $\Xi$s and $\Omega$s
plus their anti-particles are presented. The 10% most central collision yields
suggest that the amount of multi-strange particles produced per produced
charged hadron increases from SPS to RHIC energies. A hydrodynamically inspired
model fit to the spectra, which assumes a thermalized source, seems to indicate
that these multi-strange particles experience a significant transverse flow
effect, but are emitted when the system is hotter and the flow is smaller than
values obtained from a combined fit to $\pi$, K, p and $\Lambda$s.
