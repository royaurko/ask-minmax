We consider theoretically a current flowing perpendicular to interfaces of a
spin-valve type ferromagnetic metallic junction. For the first time an
effective approach is investigated to calculate a simultaneous action of the
two current effects, namely, the nonequilibrium longitudinal spin injection and
the transversal spin-transfer surface torque. Dispersion relation for
fluctuations is derived and solved. Nonlinear problem is solved about steady
state arising due to instability for a thick enough free layer.
