The morphologic properties of the magnetic networks during Carrington
Rotations (CR) 1955 to 2091 (from 1999 to 2010) have been analyzed by applying
the watershed algorithm to magnetograms observed by the Michelson Doppler
Interferometer (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
spacecraft. We find that the average area of magnetic cells on the solar
surface at lower latitudes (within +-50 degree) are smaller than those at
higher latitudes (beyond +-50 degree). Statistical analysis of these data
indicates that the magnetic networks are of fractal in nature, and the average
fractal dimension is D_f = 1.253+-0.011. We also find that both the fractal
dimension and the size of the magnetic networks are anti-correlated with the
sunspot area. This is perhaps because a strong magnetic field can suppress
spatially modulated oscillation, compress the boundaries of network cells,
leading to smoother cell boundaries. The fractal dimension of the cell deviates
that predicted from an isobar of Kolmogorov homogeneous turbulence.
