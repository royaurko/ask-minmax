The complexity of biological, social and engineering networks makes it
desirable to find natural partitions into communities that can act as
simplified descriptions and provide insight into the structure and function of
the overall system. Although community detection methods abound, there is a
lack of consensus on how to quantify and rank the quality of partitions. We
show here that the quality of a partition can be measured in terms of its
stability, defined in terms of the clustered autocovariance of a Markov process
taking place on the graph. Because the stability has an intrinsic dependence on
time scales of the graph, it allows us to compare and rank partitions at each
time and also to establish the time spans over which partitions are optimal.
Hence the Markov time acts effectively as an intrinsic resolution parameter
that establishes a hierarchy of increasingly coarser clusterings. Within our
framework we can then provide a unifying view of several standard partitioning
measures: modularity and normalized cut size can be interpreted as one-step
time measures, whereas Fiedler's spectral clustering emerges at long times. We
apply our method to characterize the relevance and persistence of partitions
over time for constructive and real networks, including hierarchical graphs and
social networks. We also obtain reduced descriptions for atomic level protein
structures over different time scales.
