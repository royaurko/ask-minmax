Cells are regulated by networks of controllers having many targets, and
targets affected by many controllers, but these "many-to-many" combinatorial
control systems are poorly understood. Here we analyze distinct cellular
networks (transcription factors, microRNAs, and protein kinases) and a
drug-target network. Certain network properties seem universal across systems
and species, suggesting the existence of common control strategies in biology.
The number of controllers is ~8% of targets and the density of links is 2.5%
\pm 1.2%. Links per node are predominantly exponentially distributed, implying
conservation of the average, which we explain using a mathematical model of
robustness in control networks. These findings suggest that optimal
pharmacological strategies may benefit from a similar, many-to-many
combinatorial structure, and molecular tools are available to test this
approach.
