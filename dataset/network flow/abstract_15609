We report a convergent surface polymerization reaction scheme on Au(111),
based on a triple aldol condensation, yielding a carbon-rich, covalent
nanoporous two-dimensional network. The reaction is not self-poisoning and
proceeds up to a full surface coverage. The deposited precursor molecules
1,3,5-tri(4'-acetylphenyl) first form supramolecular assemblies that are
converted to the porous covalent network upon heating. The formation and
structure of the network and of the intermediate steps are studied with
scanning tunneling microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and density functional
theory.
