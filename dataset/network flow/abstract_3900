In this report, we present a formal approach that addresses the problem of
emergence of phase transitions in stochastic and attractive nonlinear threshold
Boolean automata networks. Nonlinear networks considered are informally defined
on the basis of classical stochastic threshold Boolean automata networks in
which specific interaction potentials of neighbourhood coalition are taken into
account. More precisely, specific nonlinear terms compose local transition
functions that define locally the dynamics of such networks. Basing our study
on nonlinear networks, we exhibit new results, from which we derive conditions
of phase transitions.
