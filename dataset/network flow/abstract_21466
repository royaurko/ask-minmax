We show that a phenomenological hydrodynamic lattice-gas model of two-phase
flow, developed by Rothman and Keller in 1988 and used extensively for
numerical simulations since then, can be derived from an underlying model of
particle interactions. From this result, we elucidate the nature of the
hydrodynamic limit of the Rothman-Keller model.
