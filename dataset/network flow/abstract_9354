The zero-temperature Glauber dynamics of the ferromagnetic Ising model on
small-world networks, rewired from a two-dimensional square lattice, has been
studied by numerical simulations. For increasing disorder in finite networks,
the nonequilibrium dynamics becomes faster, so that the ground state is found
more likely. For any finite value of the rewiring probability p, the likelihood
of reaching the ground state goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit, similarly
to random networks. The spin correlation xi(r) is found to decrease with
distance as xi(r) ~ exp(-r/lambda), lambda being a correlation length scaling
with p as lambda ~ p^(-0.73). These results are compared with those obtained
earlier for addition-type small world networks.
