Relativistic thermodynamics is generalized to accommodate four dimensional
rotation in a flat spacetime. An extended body can be in equilibrium when its
each element moves along a Killing flow. There are three types of basic Killing
flows in a flat spacetime, each of which corresponds to translational motion,
spatial rotation, and constant linear acceleration; spatial rotation and
constant linear acceleration are regarded as four dimensional rotation.
Translational motion has been mainly investigated in the past literature of
relativistic thermodynamics. Thermodynamics of the other two is derived in the
present paper.
