A projected order parameter is used to calculate, not only local minima of
the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional, but also saddle points or energy
barriers responsible for the metastabilities observed in superconducting
mesoscopic disks (Geim et al. Nature {\bf 396}, 144 (1998)). We calculate the
local minima magnetization and find the energetic instability points between
vortex configurations with different vorticity. We also find that, for any
vorticity, the supercurrent can reverse its flow direction on decreasing the
magnetic field before one vortex can escape.
