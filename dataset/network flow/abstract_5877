Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs representing independence
relationships among a set of random variables. A random variable can be
regarded as a set of exhaustive and mutually exclusive propositions. We argue
that there are several drawbacks resulting from the propositional nature and
acyclic structure of Bayesian networks. To remedy these shortcomings, we
propose a probabilistic network where nodes represent unary predicates and
which may contain directed cycles. The proposed representation allows us to
represent domain knowledge in a single static network even though we cannot
determine the instantiations of the predicates before hand. The ability to deal
with cycles also enables us to handle cyclic causal tendencies and to recognize
recursive plans.
