We study dynamics and scaling exponents in a nonlinear network model inspired
by the formation of planetary systems. Dynamics of this model leads to phase
separation to two types of condensate, light and heavy, distinguished by how
they scale with mass. Light condensate distributions obey power laws given in
terms of several identified scaling exponents that do not depend on initial
conditions. The analyzed properties of heavy condensates have been found to be
scale-free. Calculated mass distributions agree well with more complex models,
and fit observations of both our own Solar System, and the best observed
extra-solar planetary systems.
