We consider the Euler-Poincar\'e equation on $\mathbb R^d$, $d\ge 2$. For a
large class of smooth initial data we prove that the corresponding solution
blows up in finite time. This settles an open problem raised by Chae and Liu
\cite{Chae Liu}. Our analysis exhibits some new concentration mechanism and
hidden monotonicity formula associated with the Euler-Poincar\'e flow. In
particular we show the abundance of blowups emanating from smooth initial data
with certain sign properties. No size restrictions are imposed on the data. We
also showcase a class of initial data for which the corresponding solution
exists globally in time.
