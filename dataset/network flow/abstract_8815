Gu and Zhu have shown that Type-II Ricci flow singularities develop from
nongeneric rotationally symmetric Riemannian metrics on $S^m$, for all $m\geq
3$. In this paper, we describe and provide plausibility arguments for a
detailed asymptotic profile and rate of curvature blow-up that we predict such
solutions exhibit.
