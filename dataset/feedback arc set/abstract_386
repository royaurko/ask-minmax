We investigate how the probability of the formation of giant arcs in galaxy
clusters is expected to change in cosmological models dominated by dark energy
with an equation of state p=w rho c^2 compared to cosmological-constant or open
models. To do so, we use a simple analytic model for arc cross sections based
on the Navarro-Frenk-White density profile which we demonstrate reproduces
essential features of numerically determined arc cross sections. Since analytic
lens models are known to be inadequate for accurate absolute quantifications of
arc probabilities, we use them only for studying changes relative to
cosmological-constant models. Our main results are (1) the order of magnitude
difference between the arc probabilities in low density, spatially flat and
open CDM models found numerically is reproduced by our analytic model, and (2)
dark-energy cosmologies with w>-1 increase the arc optical depth by at most a
factor of two and are thus unlikely to reconcile arc statistics with spatially
flat cosmological models with low matter density.
