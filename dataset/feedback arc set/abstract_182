Extending recent findings on the two-user MISO broadcast channel (BC) with
imperfect and delayed channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), the
work here explores the performance of the two user MIMO BC and the two user
MIMO interference channel (MIMO IC), in the presence of feedback with evolving
quality and timeliness. Under standard assumptions, and in the presence of M
antennas per transmitter and N antennas per receiver, the work derives the DoF
region, which is optimal for a large regime of sufficiently good (but
potentially imperfect) delayed CSIT. This region concisely captures the effect
of having predicted, current and delayed-CSIT, as well as concisely captures
the effect of the quality of CSIT offered at any time, about any channel. In
addition to the progress towards describing the limits of using such imperfect
and delayed feedback in MIMO settings, the work offers different insights that
include the fact that, an increasing number of receive antennas can allow for
reduced quality feedback, as well as that no CSIT is needed for the direct
links in the IC.
