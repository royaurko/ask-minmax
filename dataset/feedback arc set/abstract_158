The class of Schoenberg transformations, embedding Euclidean distances into
higher dimensional Euclidean spaces, is presented, and derived from theorems on
positive definite and conditionally negative definite matrices. Original
results on the arc lengths, angles and curvature of the transformations are
proposed, and visualized on artificial data sets by classical multidimensional
scaling. A simple distance-based discriminant algorithm illustrates the theory,
intimately connected to the Gaussian kernels of Machine Learning.
