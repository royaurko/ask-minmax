We introduce and study a Markov field on the edges of a graph in dimension
$d\geq2$ whose configurations are spin networks. The field arises naturally as
the edge-occupation field of a Poissonian model (a soup) of non-backtracking
loops and arcs characterized by a spatial Markov property such that,
conditionally on the value of the edge-occupation field on a boundary set, the
distributions of the loops and arcs on either side of the boundary are
independent of each other. The free energy density and other quantities of the
model can be computed exactly in any dimension.
