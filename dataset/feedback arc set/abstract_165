The estimates of the uniform norm of the Chebyshev polynomial associated with
a compact set $K$ consisting of a finite number of continua in the complex
plane are established. These estimates are exact (up to a constant factor) in
the case where the components of $K$ are either quasismooth (in the sense of
Lavrentiev) arcs or closed Jordan domains bounded by a quasismooth curve.
