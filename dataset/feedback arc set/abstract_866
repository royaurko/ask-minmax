Angle resolved photoemission data in the pseudogap phase of underdoped
cuprates have revealed the presence of a truncated Fermi surface consisting of
Fermi arcs. We compare a number of proposed models for the arcs, and find that
the one that best models the data is a d-wave energy gap with a lifetime
broadening whose temperature dependence is suggestive of fluctuating pairs.
