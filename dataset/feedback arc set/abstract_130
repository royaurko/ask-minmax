We investigate strong mechanical feedback for the single-electron tunneling
device coupled to an underdamped harmonic oscillator in the high-frequency
case, when the mechanical energy of the oscillator exceeds the tunnel rate, and
for weak coupling. In the strong feedback regime, the mechanical oscillations
oscillated by the telegraph signal from the SET in their turn modify the
electric current. In contrast to the earlier results for the low frequencies,
the current noise in not enhanced above the Poisson value.
