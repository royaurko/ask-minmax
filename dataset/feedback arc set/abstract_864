We discuss the relation between arc index, maximal Thurston--Bennequin
number, and Khovanov homology for knots. As a consequence, we calculate the arc
index and maximal Thurston--Bennequin number for all knots with at most 11
crossings. For some of these knots, the calculation requires a consideration of
cables which also allows us to compute the maximal self-linking number for all
knots with at most 11 crossings.
