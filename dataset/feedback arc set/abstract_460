We experimentally demonstrate the occurrence of various synchronized states
in coupled piece-wise linear time-delayed electronic circuits using dynamic
environment coupling where the environment has its own intrinsic dynamics via
feedback from the circuits. We carry out these experiments in two different
coupling configurations, namely mutual and subsystem coupling configurations.
Depending upon the coupling strength and the nature of feedback, we observe a
transition from nonsynchronization to complete synchronization via phase
synchronization and from nonsynchronization to inverse synchronization via
inverse-phase synchronization between the circuits in hyperchaotic regime.
Snapshots of the time evolution, phase projection plots and localized sets of
the circuits as observed experimentally from the oscilloscope, along with
supporting numerical simulations confirm the existence of different
synchronized states. Further, the transition to different synchronized states
can be verified from the changes in the largest Lyapunov exponents, Correlation
of Probability of Recurrence and Correlation Coefficient as a function of the
coupling strength. We present a detailed linear stability analysis and obtain
conditions for different synchronized states.
