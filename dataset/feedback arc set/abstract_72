We describe the use of array expressions as constraints, which represents a
consequent generalisation of the "element" constraint. Constraint propagation
for array constraints is studied theoretically, and for a set of domain
reduction rules the local consistency they enforce, arc-consistency, is proved.
An efficient algorithm is described that encapsulates the rule set and so
inherits the capability to enforce arc-consistency from the rules.
