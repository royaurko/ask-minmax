A transitive decomposition of a graph is a partition of the edge set together
with a group of automorphisms which transitively permutes the parts. In this
paper we determine all transitive decompositions of the Johnson graphs such
that the group preserving the partition is arc-transitive and acts primitively
on the parts.
