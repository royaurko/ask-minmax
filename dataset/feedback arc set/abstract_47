We present the results of a set of numerical simulations aiming at evaluating
the effects of cluster galaxies on the arc statistics. At this goal we use nine
different galaxy clusters obtained from N-body simulations. We mimic the
presence of a population of galaxies inside each cluster, trying to reproduce
the observed luminosity function and the spatial distribution. We compare the
statistical distributions of the properties of the gravitational arcs produced
by our clusters with and without galaxies. We find that the cluster galaxies do
not introduce perturbations strong enough to significantly change the number of
arcs and the distributions of the properties of long arcs.
