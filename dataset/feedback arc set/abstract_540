We design a soft-in soft-out (SISO) decision feedback equalizer (DFE) that
performs better than its linear counterpart in turbo equalizer (TE) setting.
Unlike previously developed SISO-DFEs, the present DFE scheme relies on
extrinsic information formulation that directly takes into account the error
propagation effect. With this new approach, both error rate simulation and the
extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis indicate that the proposed
SISO-DFE is superior to the well-known SISO linear equalizer (LE). This result
is in contrast with the general understanding today that the error propagation
effect of the DFE degrades the overall TE performance below that of the TE
based on a LE. We also describe a new extrinsic information combining strategy
involving the outputs of two DFEs running in opposite directions, that explores
error correlation between the two sets of DFE outputs. When this method is
combined with the new DFE extrinsic information formulation, the resulting
"bidirectional" turbo-DFE achieves excellent performance-complexity tradeoffs
compared to the TE based on the BCJR algorithm or on the LE. Unlike turbo LE or
turbo DFE, the turbo BiDFE's performance does not degrade significantly as the
feedforward and feedback filter taps are constrained to be time-invariant.
