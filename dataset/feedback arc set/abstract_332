In 1981 Masur proved the existence of a dense geodesic in the moduli space
for a Teichm\"uller space. We prove an analogue theorem for reduced Outer Space
endowed with the Lipschitz metric. We also prove two results that may be of
independent interest: we show that Brun's unordered algorithm converges in
angle and from this prove that the set of Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors of
positive integer $m \times m$ matrices is dense in the positive cone
$\mathbb{R}^m_+$ (these matrices will in fact be the transition matrices of
positive automorphisms). Another result that we prove in the appendix is that
limits of fold lines have trivial arc stabilizers.
