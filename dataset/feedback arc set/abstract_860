The paper provides bounds for the ropelength of a link in terms of the
crossing numbers of its split components. As in earlier papers, the bounds grow
with the square of the crossing number; however, the constant involved is a
substantial improvement on previous results. The proof depends essentially on
writing links in terms of their arc-presentations, and has as a key ingredient
Bae and Park's theorem that an n-crossing link has an arc-presentation with
less than or equal to n+2 arcs.
