We consider self-similar Jordan arcs $\gamma$ in $R^d$, different from a line
segment and show that they cannot be projected to a line bijectively. Moreover,
we show that the set of points $x\in\gamma$, for which there is a hyperplane,
intersecting $\gamma$ at the point x only, is nowhere dense in $\gamma$. .
