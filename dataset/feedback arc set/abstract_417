We present a set of 3-dimensional, radiation-magnetohydrodynamic calculations
of the gravitational collapse of massive (300 Msun), star-forming molecular
cloud cores. We show that the combined effects of magnetic fields and radiative
feedback strongly suppress core fragmentation, leading to the production of
single star systems rather than small clusters. We find that the two processes
are efficient at suppressing fragmentation in different regimes, with the
feedback most effective in the dense, central region and the magnetic field
most effective in more diffuse, outer regions. Thus, the combination of the two
is much more effective at suppressing fragmentation than either one considered
in isolation. Our work suggests that typical massive cores, which have
mass-to-flux ratios of about 2 relative to critical, likely form a single star
system, but that cores with weaker fields may form a small star cluster. This
result helps us understand why the observed relationship between the core mass
function and the stellar initial mass function holds even for ~100 Msun cores
with many thermal Jeans masses of material. We also demonstrate that a ~40 AU
Keplerian disk is able to form in our simulations, despite the braking effect
caused by the strong magnetic field.
