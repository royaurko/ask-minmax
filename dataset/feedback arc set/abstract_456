Stabilizing state feedback controller has been designed in this paper for a
switched DC motor plant, controlled over communication network. The switched
system formulation for the networked control system (NCS) with additional
switching in a plant parameter along with the switching due to random packet
losses, have been formulated as few set of non-strict Linear Matrix
Inequalities (LMIs). In order to solve non-strict LMIs using standard LMI
solver and to design the stabilizing state feedback controller, the Cone
Complementary Linearization (CCL) technique has been adopted. Simulation
studies have been carried out for a DC motor plant, operating at two different
sampling times with random switching in the moment of inertia, representing
sudden jerks.
