We examine a strange chaotic attractor and its unstable periodic orbits in
case of one degree of freedom nonlinear oscillator with non symmetric
potential. We propose an efficient method of chaos control stabilizing these
orbits by a pulsive feedback technique. Discrete set of pulses enable us to
transfer the system from one periodic state to another.
