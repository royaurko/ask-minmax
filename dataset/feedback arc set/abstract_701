A flashing ratchet transports diffusive particles using a time-dependent,
asymmetric potential. Particle speed is predicted to increase when a feedback
algorithm based on particle positions is used. We have experimentally realized
such a feedback ratchet using an optical line trap, and observed that use of
feedback increases velocity by up to an order of magnitude. We compare two
different feedback algorithms for small particle numbers, and find good
agreement with simulations. We also find that existing algorithms can be
improved to be more tolerant to feedback delay times.
