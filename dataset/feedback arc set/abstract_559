We work with quasianalytic classes of functions. Consider a real-valued
function y = f(x) on an open subset U of Euclidean space, which satisfies a
quasianalytic equation G(x, y) = 0. We prove that f is arc-quasianalytic (i.e.,
its restriction to every quasianalytic arc is quasianalytic) if and only if f
becomes quasianalytic after (a locally finite covering of U by) finite
sequences of local blowing-ups. This generalizes a theorem of the first two
contributors on arc-analytic functions.
