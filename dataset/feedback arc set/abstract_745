Channel state information (CSI) provided by limited feedback channel can be
utilized to increase the system throughput. However, in multiple input multiple
output (MIMO) systems, the signaling overhead realizing this CSI feedback can
be quite large, while the capacity of the uplink feedback channel is typically
limited. Hence, it is crucial to reduce the amount of feedback bits. Prior work
on limited feedback compression commonly adopted the block fading channel model
where only temporal or spectral correlation in wireless channel is considered.
In this paper, we propose a differential feedback scheme with full use of the
temporal and spectral correlations to reduce the feedback load. Then, the
minimal differential feedback rate over MIMO doubly selective fading channel is
investigated. Finally, the analysis is verified by simulations.
