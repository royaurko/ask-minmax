We introduce the Hausdorff measure for definable sets in an o-minimal
structure, and prove the Cauchy-Crofton and co-area formulae for the o-minimal
Hausdorff measure. We also prove that every definable set can be partitioned
into "basic rectifiable sets", and that the Whitney arc property holds for
basic rectifiable sets.
