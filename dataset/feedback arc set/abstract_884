Suppose that D is an acyclic orientation of a graph G. An arc of D is called
dependent if its reversal creates a directed cycle. Let m and M denote the
minimum and the maximum of the number of dependent arcs over all acyclic
orientations of G. We call G fully orientable if G has an acyclic orientation
with exactly d dependent arcs for every d satisfying m <= d <= M. A graph G is
called chordal if every cycle in G of length at least four has a chord. We show
that all chordal graphs are fully orientable.
