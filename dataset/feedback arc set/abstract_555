We study a three-dimensional analogue to the well-known graph visualization
approach known as arc diagrams. We provide several algorithms that achieve good
angular resolution for 3D arc diagrams, even for cases when the arcs must
project to a given 2D straight-line drawing of the input graph. Our methods
make use of various graph coloring algorithms, including an algorithm for a new
coloring problem, which we call localized edge coloring.
