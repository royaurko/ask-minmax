Timed-arc Petri nets (TAPN) are a well-known time extension of the Petri net
model and several translations to networks of timed automata have been proposed
for this model. We present a direct, DBM-based algorithm for forward
reachability analysis of bounded TAPNs extended with transport arcs, inhibitor
arcs and age invariants. We also give a complete proof of its correctness,
including reduction techniques based on symmetries and extrapolation. Finally,
we augment the algorithm with a novel state-space reduction technique
introducing a monotonic ordering on markings and prove its soundness even in
the presence of monotonicity-breaking features like age invariants and
inhibitor arcs. We implement the algorithm within the model-checker TAPAAL and
the experimental results document an encouraging performance compared to
verification approaches that translate TAPN models to UPPAAL timed automata.
