In \cite{ThasHVM}, a characterization of the finite quadric Veronesean
$\mathcal{V}_{n}^{2^{n}}$ by means of properties of the set of its tangent
spaces is proved. These tangent spaces form a {\em regular generalised dual
arc}. We prove an extension result for regular generalised dual arcs. To
motivate our research, we show how they are used to construct a large class of
secret sharing schemes.
