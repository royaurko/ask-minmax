We give a geometric realization of module categories of type $\tilde{A}_n$.
We work with oriented arcs to define a translation quiver isomorphic to the
Auslander-Reiten quiver of the module category of type $\tilde{A}_n$. To get a
description of the module category, we introduce long moves between arcs. These
allow us to include the infinite radical in the geometric description. Finally,
our results can also be used to describe the corresponding cluster categories
by taking unoriented arcs instead.
