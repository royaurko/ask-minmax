Top quarks are produced at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider at
Fermilab and at the Large Hadron (proton-proton) Collider at CERN in two ways:
as quark-antiquark pairs, and singly. For each mode, the cross sections and
future experimental yields are presented. I then discuss some precision
measurements that can be made using the anticipated large data sets. These
measurements include the top quark mass, width and branching fractions, the
electroweak Wtb coupling, and the CKM matrix element Vtb. Detailed studies of
the top quark polarization and gluon radiation will also be possible, in
addition to sensitive searches for ttbar resonances and rare decay modes.
