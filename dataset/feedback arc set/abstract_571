We present a cluster dynamical mean-field treatment of the Hubbard model on a
square lattice to study the evolution of magnetism and quasiparticle properties
as the electron filling and interaction strength are varied. Our approach for
solving the dynamical mean-field equations is an extension of Potthoff's
"two-site" method [Phys. Rev. B. 64, 165114 (2001)] where the self-consistent
bath is represented by a highly restricted set of states. As well as the
expected antiferromagnetism close to half filling, we observe distortions of
the Fermi surface. The proximity of a van Hove point and the incipient
antiferromagnetism lead to the evolution from an electron-like Fermi surface
away from the Mott transition, to a hole-like one near half-filling. Our
results also show a gap opening anisotropically around the Fermi surface close
to the Mott transition (reminiscent of the pseudogap phenomenon seen in the
cuprate high-Tc superconductors). This leaves Fermi arcs which are closed into
pockets by lines with very small quasiparticle residue.
