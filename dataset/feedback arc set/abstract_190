We show that global constraints on finite domains like all-different can be
reformulated into answer set programs on which we achieve arc, bound or range
consistency. These reformulations offer a number of other advantages beyond
providing the power of global propagators to answer set programming. For
example, they provide other constraints with access to the state of the
propagator by sharing variables. Such sharing can be used to improve
propagation between constraints. Experiments with these encodings demonstrate
their promise.
