In this paper we use optimization-based methods to analyze the stability and
design state and output-feedback controllers for a class of one-dimensional
parabolic partial differential equations. The output may be the complete state
measurement or the boundary measurement of the state. The input considered is
Neumann boundary actuation. We use Lyapunov operators, duality, and the
Luenberger observer framework to reformulate the synthesis problem as a convex
optimization problem expressed as a set of Linear-Operator-Inequalities (LOIs).
We then show how feasibility of these LOIs may be tested using Semidefinite
Programming (SDP) and the Sum-of-Squares methodology. Moreover, we provide
numerical results which prove that the method can be generalized for
application to systems with other types of boundary conditions.
