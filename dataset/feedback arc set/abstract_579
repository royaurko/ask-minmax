Using QCD sum rules with nonlocal condensates the twist-2 pion distribution
amplitude is determined by means of its moments and their confidence intervals,
including also radiative corrections. An admissible set of pion distribution
amplitudes is constructed in the a_2, a_4 plane of the Gegenbauer polynomial
expansion coefficients. The determined a_2, a_4 region strongly overlaps with
that extracted from the CLEO data by Schmedding and Yakovlev. Comparisons are
given with results from Fermilab experiment E791 and recent lattice
calculations.
