In this paper, we consider the well-known Fattorini's criterion for
approximate controllability of infinite dimensional linear systems of type
$y'=A y+Bu$. We precise the result proved by H. O. Fattorini in
\cite{Fattorini1966} for bounded input $B$, in the case where $B$ can be
unbounded or in the case of finite-dimensional controls. More precisely, we
prove that if Fattorini's criterion is satisfied and if the set of geometric
multiplicities of $A$ is bounded then approximate controllability can be
achieved with finite dimensional controls. An important consequence of this
result consists in using the Fattorini's criterion to obtain the feedback
stabilizability of linear and nonlinear parabolic systems with feedback
controls in a finite dimensional space. In particular, for systems described by
partial differential equations, such a criterion reduces to a unique
continuation theorem for a stationary system. We illustrate such a method by
tackling some coupled Navier-Stokes type equations (MHD system and micropolar
fluid system) and we sketch a systematic procedure relying on Fattorini's
criterion for checking stabilizability of such nonlinear systems. In that case,
the unique continuation theorems rely on local Carleman inequalities for
stationary Stokes type systems.
