We are given a finite set of n points (guards) G in the plane R^2 and an
angle 0 < theta < 2 pi. A theta-cone is a cone with apex angle theta. We call a
theta-cone empty (with respect to G) if it does not contain any point of G. A
point p in R^2 is called theta-guarded if every theta-cone with its apex
located at p is non-empty. Furthermore, the set of all theta-guarded points is
called the theta-guarded region, or the theta-region for short.
  We present several results on this topic. The main contribution of our work
is to describe the theta-region with O(n/theta) circular arcs, and we give an
algorithm to compute it. We prove a tight O(n) worst-case bound on the
complexity of the theta-region for theta >= pi/2. In case theta is bounded from
below by a positive constant, we prove an almost linear bound O(n^(1+epsilon))
for any epsilon > 0 on the complexity. Moreover, we show that there is a
sequence of inputs such that the asymptotic bound on the complexity of their
theta-region is Omega(n^2). In addition we point out gaps in the proofs of a
recent publication that claims an O(n) bound on the complexity for any constant
angle theta.
