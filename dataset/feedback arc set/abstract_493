ARPES measurements on underdoped cuprates above the superconducting
transition temperature exhibit the unique phenomenon of Fermi arcs, gapless
arcs of Fermi surface around the nodal points of the superconducting gap, which
terminate before reaching the antinodes. We show that this phenomenon is easily
explained (including its temperature dependence and observed hole-electron
asymmetry) as the natural consequence of a time-fluctuating d-wave gap.
