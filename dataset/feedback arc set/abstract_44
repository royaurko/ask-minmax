For a subclass of matchings, set partitions, and permutations, we describe a
direct bijection involving only arc annotated diagrams that not only
interchanges maximum nesting and crossing numbers, but also all refinements of
crossing and nesting numbers. Furthermore, we show that the bijection cannot be
applied to a similar class of coloured arc annotated diagrams.
