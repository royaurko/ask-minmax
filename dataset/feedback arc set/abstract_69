This paper considers the problem of secret communication over a multiple
access channel with generalized feedback. Two trusted users send independent
confidential messages to an intended receiver, in the presence of a passive
eavesdropper. In this setting, an active cooperation between two trusted users
is enabled through using channel feedback in order to improve the communication
efficiency. Based on rate-splitting and decode-and-forward strategies,
achievable secrecy rate regions are derived for both discrete memoryless and
Gaussian channels. Results show that channel feedback improves the achievable
secrecy rates.
