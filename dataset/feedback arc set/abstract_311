We present a generally applicable reduction formalism which makes it possible
to express an arbitrary tensor and scalar one-loop Feynman integral, with N
external lines and massless propagators, in terms of a basic set of eight
fundamental scalar Feynman integrals with 2, 3, and 4 external lines, for
arbitrary external kinematics. The formalism is particularly suitable for the
NLO calculations of exclusive processes at large momentum transfer in pQCD,
where all previously developed reduction methods fail due to the presence of
collinear external on-shell lines.
