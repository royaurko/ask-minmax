We study two different ways to enhance PAFAS, a process algebra for modelling
asynchronous timed concurrent systems, with non-blocking reading actions. We
first add reading in the form of a read-action prefix operator. This operator
is very flexible, but its somewhat complex semantics requires two types of
transition relations. We also present a read-set prefix operator with a simpler
semantics, but with syntactic restrictions. We discuss the expressiveness of
read prefixes; in particular, we compare them to read-arcs in Petri nets and
justify the simple semantics of the second variant by showing that its
processes can be translated into processes of the first with timed-bisimilar
behaviour. It is still an open problem whether the first algebra is more
expressive than the second; we give a number of laws that are interesting in
their own right, and can help to find a backward translation.
