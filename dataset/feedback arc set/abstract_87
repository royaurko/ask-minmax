In this paper we show Whitney's fibering conjecture in the real and complex,
local analytic and global algebraic cases.
  For a given germ of complex or real analytic set, we show the existence of a
stratification satisfying a strong (real arc-analytic with respect to all
variables and analytic with respect to the parameter space) trivialization
property along each stratum. We call such a trivialization arc-wise analytic
and we show that it can be constructed under the classical Zariski
algebro-geometric equisingularity assumptions. Using a slightly stronger
version of Zariski equisingularity, we show the existence of Whitney's
stratified fibration, satisfying the conditions (b) of Whitney and (w) of
Verdier. Our construction is based on Puiseux with parameter theorem and a
generalization of Whitney interpolation. For algebraic sets our construction
gives a global stratification.
  We also give several applications of arc-wise analytic trivialization, mainly
to the stratification theory and the equisingularity of analytic set and
function germs. In the real algebraic case, for an algebraic family of
projective varieties, we show that Zariski equisingularity implies local
triviality of the weight filtration.
