Pen computing tools such as Tablet PC, Tablet Monitors and its various
supporting software tool offer another dimension to enhance our today's
digitally integrated and connected classroom learning environment. This paper
first reviews the various state-of-the-art pen-computing hardware and software
that have been applied in the classroom setting to introduce student-centric
learning, collaboration and making annotations and designing classroom
activities easier. We then propose a new classroom environment which is fully
equipped with Tablet devices and the supporting software tools for the goals of
1) easy electronic ink annotations with least constraints; 2) enhanced active
learning with timely feedback; 3) enhanced student collaborations and 4)
lecture recording. The classroom has been put into practical teaching and
learning environment as a pilot project in our higher learning environment.
After overcoming the initial learning curves, the environment received positive
feedbacks from the teaching faculties as well as from the students.
