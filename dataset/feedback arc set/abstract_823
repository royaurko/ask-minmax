The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, specifically the Very Wide
segment of data, is used to search for possible main-belt comets. In the first
data set, 952 separate objects with asteroidal orbits within the main-belt are
examined using a three-level technique. First, the full-width-half-maximum of
each object is compared to stars of similar magnitude, to look for evidence of
a coma. Second, the brightness profiles of each object are compared with three
stars of the same magnitude, which are nearby on the image to ensure any
extended profile is not due to imaging variations. Finally, the star profiles
are subtracted from the asteroid profile and the residuals are compared with
the background using an unpaired T-test. No objects in this survey show
evidence of cometary activity. The second survey includes 11438 objects in the
main-belt, which are examined visually. One object, an unknown comet, is found
to show cometary activity. Its motion is consistent with being a main-belt
asteroid, but the observed arc is too short for a definitive orbit calculation.
No other body in this survey shows evidence of cometary activity. Upper limits
of the number of weakly and strongly active main-belt comets are derived to be
630+/-77 and 87+/-28, respectively. These limits are consistent with those
expected from asteroid collisions. In addition, data extracted from the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope image archive of main-belt comet 176P/LINEAR is
presented.
