The task of approximation of points with circular arcs is performed in many
applications, such as polyline compression, noise filtering, and feature
recognition. However, development of algorithms that perform a significant
amount of circular arcs fitting require an efficient way of fitting circular
arcs with complexity O(1). The elegant solution to this task based on an
eigenvector problem for a square nonsymmetrical matrix is described in [1]. For
the compression algorithm described in [2], it is necessary to solve this task
when two points on the arc are known. This paper describes a different approach
to efficiently fitting the arcs and solves the task when one or two points are
known.
