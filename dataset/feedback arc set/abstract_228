We investigate the set of Nash equilibrium payoffs for two person
differential games. The main result of the paper is the characterization of the
set of Nash equilibrium payoffs in the terms of nonsmooth analysis. Also we
obtain the sufficient conditions for a pair of continuous function to provide a
Nash equilibrium. This result generalizes the method of system of
Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
