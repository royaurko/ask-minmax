We present the results of a search for gravitationally-lensed giant arcs
conducted on a sample of 825 SDSS galaxy clusters. Both a visual inspection of
the images and an automated search were performed and no arcs were found. This
result is used to set an upper limit on the arc probability per cluster. We
present selection functions for our survey, in the form of arc detection
efficiency curves plotted as functions of arc parameters, both for the visual
inspection and the automated search. The selection function is such that we are
sensitive only to long, high surface brightness arcs with g-band surface
brightness mu_g < 24.8 and length-to-width ratio l/w > 10. Our upper limits on
the arc probability are compatible with previous arc searches. Lastly, we
report on a serendipitous discovery of a giant arc in the SDSS data, known
inside the SDSS Collaboration as Hall's arc.
