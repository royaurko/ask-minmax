We study the strong gravitational lensing properties of galaxy clusters
obtained from N-body simulations with standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We have
used the 32 most massive clusters from a simulation at various redshifts and
ray-traced through the clusters to investigate the giant arcs statistics. We
have investigated the prevalence of multiple arc system, by looking at the
multiple arc fraction (defined in the paper) systematically in various clusters
and we have found that $\sim 40-50%$ of the clusters that produce giant arcs
give multiple arcs, which agrees with the RCS{\sc ii} observations. We have
also investigated the mass distributions that are efficient in lensing,
discussed effects of source sizes and various other factors that are very
important in the formation of giant arcs.
