We present an algorithm developed particularly to detect gravitationally
lensed arcs in clusters of galaxies. This algorithm is suited for automated
surveys as well as individual arc detections. New methods are used for image
smoothing and source detection. The smoothing is performed by so-called
anisotropic diffusion, which maintains the shape of the arcs and does not
disperse them. The algorithm is much more efficient in detecting arcs than
other source finding algorithms and the detection by eye.
