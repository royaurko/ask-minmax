We develop a Bayesian Poisson matrix factorization model for forming
recommendations from sparse user behavior data. These data are large user/item
matrices where each user has provided feedback on only a small subset of items,
either explicitly (e.g., through star ratings) or implicitly (e.g., through
views or purchases). In contrast to traditional matrix factorization
approaches, Poisson factorization implicitly models each user's limited
attention to consume items. Moreover, because of the mathematical form of the
Poisson likelihood, the model needs only to explicitly consider the observed
entries in the matrix, leading to both scalable computation and good predictive
performance. We develop a variational inference algorithm for approximate
posterior inference that scales up to massive data sets. This is an efficient
algorithm that iterates over the observed entries and adjusts an approximate
posterior over the user/item representations. We apply our method to large
real-world user data containing users rating movies, users listening to songs,
and users reading scientific papers. In all these settings, Bayesian Poisson
factorization outperforms state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods.
