The tricorn is the connectedness locus of antiholomorphic quadratic
polynomials. We investigate the structure of boundaries of hyperbolic
components: we prove that the structure of bifurcations at hyperbolic
components of even period is as one would expect for maps that depend
holomorphically on a complex parameter (for instance, as for the Mandelbrot
set; in this setting, this is a non-obvious fact), while the bifurcation
structure at hyperbolic components of odd period is very different. In
particular, the boundaries of odd period hyperbolic components consist only of
parabolic parameters and there are bifurcations between hyperbolic components
along entire arcs, but only of bifurcation ratio 2. We also count the number of
hyperbolic components of any period of the multicorns. Since antiholomorphic
polynomials depend only real-analytically on the parameters, most of the
techniques used in this paper are quite different from the ones used to prove
the corresponding results in a holomorphic setting. We do our analysis more
generally for multicorns: these are the connectedness loci for antiholomorphic
polynomials of arbitrary degrees with a single (degenerate) critical point.
