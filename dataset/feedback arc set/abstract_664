Current OFDMA systems group resource blocks into subband to form the basic
feedback unit. Homogeneous feedback design with a common subband size is not
aware of the heterogeneous channel statistics among users. Under a general
correlated channel model, we demonstrate the gain of matching the subband size
to the underlying channel statistics motivating heterogeneous feedback design
with different subband sizes and feedback resources across clusters of users.
Employing the best-M partial feedback strategy, users with smaller subband size
would convey more partial feedback to match the frequency selectivity. In order
to develop an analytical framework to investigate the impact of partial
feedback and potential imperfections, we leverage the multi-cluster subband
fading model. The perfect feedback scenario is thoroughly analyzed, and the
closed form expression for the average sum rate is derived for the
heterogeneous partial feedback system. We proceed to examine the effect of
imperfections due to channel estimation error and feedback delay, which leads
to additional consideration of system outage. Two transmission strategies: the
fix rate and the variable rate, are considered for the outage analysis. We also
investigate how to adapt to the imperfections in order to maximize the average
goodput under heterogeneous partial feedback.
