In this paper we studied the fermi arc and the fermi pocket in cuprates in a
short-range diagonal stripe phase with wave vectors $(7\pi/8, 7\pi/8)$, which
reproduce with a high accuracy the positions and sizes of the fermi arc and
fermi pocket and the superstructure in cuprates observed by Meng et
al\cite{Meng}. The low-energy spectral function indicates that the fermi pocket
results from the main band and the shadow band at the fermi energy. Above the
fermi energy the shadow band gradually departs away from the main band, leaving
a fermi arc. Thus we conclude that the fermi arc and fermi pocket can be fully
attributed to the stripe phase but has nothing to do with pairing.
Incorporating a d-wave pairing potential in the stripe phase the spectral
weight in the antinodal region is removed, leaving a clean fermi pocket in the
nodal region.
