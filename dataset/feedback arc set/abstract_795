The Degrees of Freedom (DoF) of a K-User MISO Broadcast Channel (BC) is
studied when the Transmitter (TX) has access to a delayed channel estimate in
addition to an imperfect estimate of the current channel. The current estimate
could be for example obtained from prediction applied on past estimates, in the
case where feedback delay is within the coherence time. Building on previous
recent works on this setting with two users, the estimation error of the
current channel is characterized by its scaling as P at the exponent \alpha,
where \alpha=1 (resp. \alpha=0) corresponds to an estimate being essentially
perfect (resp. useless) in terms of DoF. In this work, we contribute to the
characterization of the DoF region in such a setting by deriving an outerbound
for the DoF region and by providing an achievable DoF region. The achievable
DoF is obtained by developing a new alignment scheme, called the K\alpha-MAT
scheme, which builds upon both the principle of the MAT alignment scheme from
Maddah-Ali and Tse and Zero-Forcing to achieve a larger DoF when the delayed
CSIT received is correlated with the instantaneous channel state.
