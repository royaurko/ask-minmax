We consider a noncooperative $n$-player principal eigenvalue game which is
associated with an infinitesimal generator of a stochastically perturbed
multi-channel dynamical system -- where, in the course of such a game, each
player attempts to minimize the asymptotic rate with which the controlled state
trajectory of the system exits from a given bounded open domain. In particular,
we show the existence of a Nash-equilibrium point (i.e., an $n$-tuple of
equilibrium linear feedback operators) that is distinctly related to a unique
maximum closed invariant set of the corresponding deterministic multi-channel
dynamical system, when the latter is composed with this $n$-tuple of
equilibrium linear feedback operators.
