We present the Mediatrix filamentation method, a novell iterative procedure
that decomposes elongated objects in filaments along their main direction over
their intensity peak. From this decomposition, the method measures the object's
length and thickness. This technique is applied in preliminary tests to
arc-shaped objects (simulated gravitational arcs) to recover their curvature
center.
