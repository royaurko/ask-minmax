Let G be an abelian topological group. The symbol \hat{G} denotes the group
of all continuous characters \chi : G --> T endowed with the compact open
topology. A subset E of G is said to be qc-dense in G provided that \chi(E)
\subseteq \phi([-1/4,1/4]) holds only for the trivial character \chi \in
\hat{G}, where \phi : R --> T = R/Z is the canonical homomorphism. A
super-sequence is a non-empty compact Hausdorff space S with at most one
non-isolated point (to which S converges). We prove that an infinite compact
abelian group G is connected if and only if its arc component G_a contains a
super-sequence converging to 0 that is qc-dense in G. This gives as a corollary
a recent theorem of Aussenhofer: For a connected locally compact abelian group
G, the restriction homomorphism r : \hat{G} --> \hat{G}_a defined by r(\chi) =
\chi\restriction_{G_a} for \chi \in \hat{G}, is a topological isomorphism. We
also show that an infinite compact group G is connected if and only if its arc
component G_a contains a super-sequence S converging to the identity e that
generates a dense subgroup of G (equivalently, S \setminus {e} is an infinite
suitable set for G in the sense of Hofmann and Morris).
