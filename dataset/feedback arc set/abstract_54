By natural way the hierarchy structure is introduced on directed graphs with
weighted adjacencies. Embedded system of algebras of subsets of the set of
vertices of such digraph and it's consolidations, which vertices are the
elementary sets of corresponding algebra, are constructed. Weights of arcs of
consolidated graphs are determined.
