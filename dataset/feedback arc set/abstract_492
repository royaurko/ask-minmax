We prove that each injective simplicial map from the arc complex of a
compact, connected, nonorientable surface with nonempty boundary to itself is
induced by a homeomorphism of the surface. We also prove that the automorphism
group of the arc complex is isomorphic to the quotient of the mapping class
group of the surface by its center.
