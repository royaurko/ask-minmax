Radio galaxies are among the largest and most powerful single objects known
and are found at variety of redshifts, hence they are believed to have had a
significant impact on the evolving Universe. Their relativistic jets inject
considerable amounts of energy into the environments in which the sources
reside; thus the knowledge of the fundamental properties (such as kinetic
luminosities, lifetimes and ambient gas densities) of these sources is crucial
for understanding AGN feedback in galaxy clusters. In this work, we explore the
intrinsic and extrinsic fundamental properties of Fanaroff-Riley II (FR II)
objects through the construction of multidimensional Monte Carlo simulations
which use complete, flux limited radio catalogues and semi-analytical models of
FR IIs' time evolution to create artificial samples of radio galaxies. This
method allows us to set better limits on the confidence intervals of the
intrinsic and extrinsic fundamental parameters and to investigate the total
energy produced and injected to the clusters' environments by populations of FR
IIs at various cosmological epochs (0.0<z<2.0). We find the latter estimates to
be strikingly robust despite the strong degeneracy between the fundamental
parameters -- such a result points to a conclusive indicator of the scale of
AGN feedback in clusters of galaxies.
