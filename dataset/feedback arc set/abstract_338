Molecular level components, like carbon multiwalled nanotubes (MWNT), show
great potential for future nanoelectronics. At low frequencies, only the
outermost carbon layer determines the transport properties of the MWNT. Due to
the multiwalled structure and large capacitive interlayer coupling, also the
inner layers contribute to the conduction at high frequencies. Consequently,
the conduction properties of MWNTs are not very far from those of regular
conductors with well-defined electrical characteristics. In our work we have
experimentally utilized this fact in constructing various nanoelectronic
components out of MWNTs, such as single electron transistors (SET), lumped
resistors, and transmission lines. We present results on several nano- tube
samples, grown both using chemical vapor deposition as well as arc-discharge
vaporization. Our results show that SET-electrometers with a noise level as low
as 6x10^{-6}e/\sqrt{Hz} (at 45 Hz) can be built using arc-discharge-grown
carbon nanotubes. Moreover, short nanotubes with small contact areas are found
to work at 4.2 K with good gate modulation. Reactive ion etching on CVD tubes
is employed to produce nearly Ohmic components with a resistance of 200 kOhm
over a 2 micron section. At high frequencies, MWNTs work over micron distances
as special LC-transmission lines with high impedance, on the order of 5 kOhm.
