In a digraph $D = (X, \mathcal{U})$, not necessarily finite, an arc $(x, y)
\in \mathcal{U}$ is reachable from a vertex $u$ if there exists a directed walk
$W$ that originates from $u$ and contains $(x, y)$. A subset $S \subseteq X$ is
an arc-reaching set of $D$ if for every arc $(x, y)$ there exists a diwalk $W$
originating at a vertex $u \in S$ and containing $(x, y)$. A minimal
arc-reaching set is an arc-basis. $S$ is a point-reaching set if for every
vertex $v$ there exists a diwalk $W$ to $v$ originating at a vertex $u \in S$.
A minimal point-reaching set is a point-basis. We extend the results of Harary,
Norman, and Cartwright on point-bases in finite digraphs to point- and
arc-bases in infinite digraphs.
