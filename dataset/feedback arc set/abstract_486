In a former paper the contributors counted the number of non-isomorphic Mathon
maximal arcs of degree 8 in PG(2,2^h), h not 7 and prime. In this paper we will
show that in PG(2,2^7) a special class of Mathon maximal arcs of degree 8
arises which admits a Singer group (i.e. a sharply transitive group) on the 7
conics of these arcs. We will give a detailed description of these arcs, and
then count the total number of non-isomorphic Mathon maximal arcs of degree 8.
Finally we show that the special arcs found in PG(2,2^7) extend to two infinite
families of Mathon arcs of degree 8 in PG(2,2^k), k odd and divisible by 7,
while maintaining the nice property of admitting a Singer group.
