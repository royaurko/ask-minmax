In this paper we explore the stabilization of closed invariant sets for
passive systems, and present conditions under which a passivity-based feedback
asymptotically stabilizes the goal set. Our results rely on novel reduction
principles allowing one to extrapolate the properties of stability,
attractivity, and asymptotic stability of a dynamical system from analogous
properties of the system on an invariant subset of the state space.
