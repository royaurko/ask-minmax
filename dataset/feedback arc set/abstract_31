We study the problem of consensus emergence in multi-agent systems via
external feedback controllers. We consider a set of agents interacting with
dynamics given by a Cucker-Smale type of model, and study its consensus
stabilization by means of centralized and decentralized control configurations.
We present a characterization of consensus emergence for systems with different
feedback structures, such as leader-based configurations, perturbed information
feedback, and feedback computed upon spatially confined information. We
characterize consensus emergence for this latter design as a
parameter-dependent transition regime between self-regulation and centralized
feedback stabilization. Numerical experiments illustrate the different features
of the proposed designs.
