Predictor-based stabilization results are provided for nonlinear systems with
input delays and a compact absorbing set. The control scheme consists of an
inter-sample predictor, a global observer, an approximate predictor, and a
nominal controller for the delay-free case. The control scheme is applicable
even to the case where the measurement is sampled and possibly delayed. The
closed-loop system is shown to have the properties of global asymptotic
stability and exponential convergence in the disturbance-free case, robustness
with respect to perturbations of the sampling schedule, and robustness with
respect to measurement errors. In contrast to existing predictor feedback laws,
the proposed control scheme utilizes an approximate predictor of a dynamic type
which is expressed by a system described by Integral Delay Equations.
Additional results are provided for systems that can be transformed to systems
with a compact absorbing set by means of a preliminary predictor feedback.
