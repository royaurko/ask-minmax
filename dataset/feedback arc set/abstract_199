Let $C\subset {\mathbb R}^n$ be a convex body. We introduce two notions of
convexity associated to C. A set $K$ is $C$-ball convex if it is the
intersection of translates of $C$, or it is either $\emptyset$, or ${\mathbb
R}^n$. The $C$-ball convex hull of two points is called a $C$-spindle. $K$ is
$C$-spindle convex if it contains the $C$-spindle of any pair of its points. We
investigate how some fundamental properties of conventional convex sets can be
adapted to $C$-spindle convex and $C$-ball convex sets. We study separation
properties and Carath\'eodory numbers of these two convexity structures. We
investigate the basic properties of arc-distance, a quantity defined by a
centrally symmetric planar disc $C$, which is the length of an arc of a
translate of $C$, measured in the $C$-norm, that connects two points. Then we
characterize those $n$-dimensional convex bodies $C$ for which every $C$-ball
convex set is the $C$-ball convex hull of finitely many points. Finally, we
obtain a stability result concerning covering numbers of some $C$-ball convex
sets, and diametrically maximal sets in $n$-dimensional Minkowski spaces.
