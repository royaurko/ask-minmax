We consider a distributed non cooperative control setting in which systems
are interconnected via state constraints. Each of these systems is governed by
an agent which is responsible for exchanging information with its neighbours
and computing a feedback law using a nonlinear model predictive controller to
avoid violations of constraints. For this setting we present an algorithm which
generates a parallelizable hierarchy among the systems. Moreover, we show both
feasibility and stability of the closed loop using only abstract properties of
this algorithm. To this end, we utilize a trajectory based stability result
which we extend to the distributed setting.
