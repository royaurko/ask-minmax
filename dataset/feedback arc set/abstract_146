We give a new proof and a partial generalization of Jean Taylor's result [Ta]
that says that Almgren almost-minimal sets of dimension 2 in $\R^3$ are locally
$C^{1+\alpha}$-equivalent to minimal cones. The proof is rather elementary, but
uses a local separation result proved in [D3] and an extension of Reifenberg's
parameterization theorem [DDT]. The key idea is still that if $X$ is the cone
over an arc of small Lipschitz graph in the unit sphere, but $X$ is not
contained in a disk, we can use the graph of a harmonic function to deform $X$
and diminish substantially its area. The local separation result is used to
reduce to unions of cones over arcs of Lipschitz graphs. A good part of the
proof extends to minimal sets of dimension 2 in $\R^n$, but in this setting our
final regularity result on $E$ may depend on the list of minimal cones obtained
as blow-up limits of $E$ at a point.
