Mathematical learning environments give domain-specific and immediate
feedback to students solving a mathematical exercise. Based on a language for
specifying strategies, we have developed a feedback framework that
automatically calculates semantically rich feedback. We offer this feedback
functionality to mathematical learning environments via a set of web services.
Feedback is only effective when it is precise and to the point. The tests we
have performed give some confidence about the correctness of our feedback
services. To increase confidence in our services, we explicitly specify the
properties our feedback services should satisfy, and, if possible, prove them
correct. For this, we give a formal description of the concepts used in our
feedback framework services. The formalisation allows us to reason about these
concepts, and to state a number of desired properties of the concepts. Our
feedback services use exercise descriptions for their instances on domains such
as logic, algebra, and linear algebra. We formulate requirements these domain
descriptions should satisfy for the feedback services to react as expected.
