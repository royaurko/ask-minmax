By modifying a domain first suggested by Ruth Goodman in 1935 and by
exploiting the explicit solution by Fedorov of the Poly\'a-Chebotarev problem
in the case of four symmetrically placed points, an improved upper bound for
the univalent Bloch-Landau constant is obtained. The domain that leads to this
improved bound takes the form of a disk from which some arcs are removed in
such a way that the resulting simply connected domain is harmonically symmetric
in each arc with respect to the origin. The existence of domains of this type
is established, using techniques from conformal welding, and some general
properties of harmonically symmetric arcs in this setting are established.
