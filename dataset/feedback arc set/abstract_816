A new method for the Automated Protein Structure Analysis (APSA) is derived,
which simplifies the protein backbone to a smooth curve in 3-dimensional space.
For the purpose of obtaining this smooth line each amino acid is represented by
its C$_{\alpha}$ atom, which serves as suitable anchor point for a cubic spline
fit. The backbone line is characterized by arc length $s$, curvature
$\kappa(s)$, and torsion $\tau(s)$. The $\kappa(s)$ and $\tau(s)$ diagrams of
the protein backbone suppress, because of the level of coarse graining applied,
details of the bond framework of the backbone, however reveal accurately all
secondary structure features of a protein. Advantages of APSA are its
quantitative representation and analysis of 3-dimensional structure in form of
2-dimensional curvature and torsion patterns, its easy visualization of
complicated conformational features, and its general applicability. Typical
differences between 3$_{10}$-,$\alpha$-, $\pi$-helices, and $\beta$-strands are
quantified with the help of the $\kappa(s)$ and $\tau(s)$ diagrams. For a test
set of 20 proteins, 63 % of all helical residues and 48.5 % of all extended
residues are identified to be in ideal conformational environments with the
help of APSA. APSA is compared with other methods for protein structure
analysis and its applicability to higher levels of protein structure is
discussed.
