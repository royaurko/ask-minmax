Linear coding schemes have been the main choice of coding for the additive
white Gaussian noise broadcast channel (AWGN-BC) with noiseless feedback in the
literature. The achievable rate regions of these schemes go well beyond the
capacity region of the AWGN-BC without feedback. In this paper, a concatenating
coding design for the $K$-user AWGN-BC with noisy feedback is proposed that
relies on linear feedback schemes to achieve rate tuples outside the
no-feedback capacity region. Specifically, a linear feedback code for the
AWGN-BC with noisy feedback is used as an inner code that creates an effective
single-user channel from the transmitter to each of the receivers, and then
open-loop coding is used for coding over these single-user channels. An
achievable rate region of linear feedback schemes for noiseless feedback is
shown to be achievable by the concatenated coding scheme for sufficiently small
feedback noise level. Then, a linear feedback coding scheme for the $K$-user
symmetric AWGN-BC with noisy feedback is presented and optimized for use in the
concatenated coding scheme. Lastly, we apply the concatenated coding design to
the two-user AWGN-BC with a single noisy feedback link from one of the
receivers.
