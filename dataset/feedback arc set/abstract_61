Consider a pair of terminals connected by two independent (feedforward and
feedback) Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels, and limited by
individual power constraints. The first terminal would like to reliably send
information to the second terminal at a given rate. While the reliability in
the cases of no feedback and of noiseless feedback is well studied, not much is
known about the case of noisy feedback. In this work, we present an interactive
scheme that significantly improves the reliability relative to the no-feedback
setting, whenever the feedback Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is sufficiently
larger than the feedforward SNR. The scheme combines Schalkwijk-Kailath (S-K)
coding and modulo--lattice analog transmission.
