The role of immediate feedback in-group conversations has received scant
attention in the recent literature. While studies from the early 1990's
suggested that "added information" in the form of non-verbal cues would allow
video conferencing to "augment" the audio-only conference in terms of
effectiveness, stunningly little follow-on research has been done reflective of
the current state of computer mediated communication, video conferencing, "live
walls", etc. This article contrasts three studies of immediate feedback in
in-person settings as the basis for suggesting a new research program -
research to look at potential effects of augmenting video-conferencing with an
immediate feedback channel.
