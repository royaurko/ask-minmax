We consider a linear Gaussian noise channel used with delayed feedback. The
channel noise is assumed to be a ARMA (autoregressive and/or moving average)
process. We reformulate the Gaussian noise channel into an intersymbol
interference channel with white noise, and show that the delayed-feedback of
the original channel is equivalent to the instantaneous-feedback of the derived
channel. By generalizing results previously developed for Gaussian channels
with instantaneous feedback and applying them to the derived intersymbol
interference channel, we show that conditioned on the delayed feedback, a
conditional Gauss-Markov source achieves the feedback capacity and its Markov
memory length is determined by the noise spectral order and the feedback delay.
A Kalman-Bucy filter is shown to be optimal for processing the feedback. The
maximal information rate for stationary sources is derived in terms of channel
input power constraint and the steady state solution of the Riccati equation of
the Kalman-Bucy filter used in the feedback loop.
