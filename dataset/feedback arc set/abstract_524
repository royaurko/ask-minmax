Reinforcement algorithms refer to the schemes where the results of the
previous trials and a reward-punishment rule are used for parameter setting in
the next steps. In this paper, we use the concept of reinforcement algorithms
to develop different data transmission models in wireless networks. Considering
temporally-correlated fading channels, the results are presented for the cases
with partial channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). As
demonstrated, the implementation of reinforcement algorithms improves the
performance of communication setups remarkably, with the same feedback
load/complexity as in the state-of-the-art schemes.
