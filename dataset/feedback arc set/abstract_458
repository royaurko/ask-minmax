Demand side management has gained increasing importance as the penetration of
renewable energy grows. Based on a Markov jump process modelling of a group of
thermostatic loads, this paper proposes a two level feedback system design
between the independent system operator (ISO) and the regulation service
provider such that two objectives are achieved: (1) the ISO can optimally
dispatch regulation signals to multiple providers in real time in order to
reduce the requirement for expensive spinning reserves, and (2) each regulation
provider can control its thermostatic loads to respond the ISO signal. It is
also shown that the amount of regulation service that can be provided is
implicitly restricted by a few fundamental parameters of the provider itself,
such as the allowable set point choice and its thermal constant. An interesting
finding is that the regulation provider's ability to provide a large amount of
long term accumulated regulation and short term signal tracking restrict each
other. Simulation results are presented to verify and illustrate the
performance of the proposed framework.
