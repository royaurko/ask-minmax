The capacity region of the N-sender Gaussian multiple access channel with
feedback is not known in general. This paper studies the class of
linear-feedback codes that includes (nonlinear) nonfeedback codes at one
extreme and the linear-feedback codes by Schalkwijk and Kailath, Ozarow, and
Kramer at the other extreme. The linear-feedback sum-capacity C_L(N,P) under
symmetric power constraints P is characterized, the maximum sum-rate achieved
by linear-feedback codes when each sender has the equal block power constraint
P. In particular, it is shown that Kramer's code achieves this linear-feedback
sum-capacity. The proof involves the dependence balance condition introduced by
Hekstra and Willems and extended by Kramer and Gastpar, and the analysis of the
resulting nonconvex optimization problem via a Lagrange dual formulation.
Finally, an observation is presented based on the properties of the conditional
maximal correlation---an extension of the Hirschfeld--Gebelein--Renyi maximal
correlation---which reinforces the conjecture that Kramer's code achieves not
only the linear-feedback sum-capacity, but also the sum-capacity itself (the
maximum sum-rate achieved by arbitrary feedback codes).
