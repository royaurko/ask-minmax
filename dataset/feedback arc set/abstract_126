This article sets the foundations of a theory of perverse sheaves on arc
spaces as it was conjectured by Feigin-Frenkel in 1990. In particular, we
construct an intersection complex on an arc space $\mathcal{L} X$ for a
$k$-scheme of finite type $X$ and show that its fibers are the same as the
fibers of the intersection complexes of the finite dimensional pieces given by
Drinfeld and Grinberg-Kazhdan. Then, we show that this "local intersection
complex" is compatible with the global moduli spaces that were already
constructed in several contexts, Whittaker, $L$-monoids and semi-infinite flag
varieties. Our construction of the category of perverse sheaves on the arc
spaces also opens a way to the understanding of other aspects of representation
theory.
