In this paper we present GDR, a Guided Data Repair framework that
incorporates user feedback in the cleaning process to enhance and accelerate
existing automatic repair techniques while minimizing user involvement. GDR
consults the user on the updates that are most likely to be beneficial in
improving data quality. GDR also uses machine learning methods to identify and
apply the correct updates directly to the database without the actual
involvement of the user on these specific updates. To rank potential updates
for consultation by the user, we first group these repairs and quantify the
utility of each group using the decision-theory concept of value of information
(VOI). We then apply active learning to order updates within a group based on
their ability to improve the learned model. User feedback is used to repair the
database and to adaptively refine the training set for the model. We
empirically evaluate GDR on a real-world dataset and show significant
improvement in data quality using our user guided repairing process. We also,
assess the trade-off between the user efforts and the resulting data quality.
