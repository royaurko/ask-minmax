To a closed connected oriented surface $S$ of genus $g$ and a nonempty finite
subset $P$ of $S$ is associated a simplicial complex (the arc complex) that
plays a basic r\^ ole in understanding the mapping class group of the pair
$(S,P)$. It is known that this arc complex contains in a natural way the
product of the Teichm\"uller space of $(S,P)$ with an open simplex. In this
paper we give an interpretation for the whole arc complex and prove that it is
a quotient of a Deligne--Mumford extension of this Teichm\"uller space and a
closed simplex. We also describe a modification of the arc complex in the
spirit of Deligne--Mumford.
