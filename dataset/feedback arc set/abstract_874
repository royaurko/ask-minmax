A knot K in 1-bridge position with respect to a genus-g Heegaard surface in a
3-manifold can be moved by isotopy through knots in 1-bridge position until it
lies in a union of n parallel genus-g surfaces tubed together by n-1 straight
tubes, with K intersecting each tube in two arcs connecting the ends. We prove
that the minimum n for which this is possible is equal to a Hempel-type
distance invariant defined using an arc complex of the two holed genus-g
surface
