One of the key research interests in the area of Constraint Satisfaction
Problem (CSP) is to identify tractable classes of constraints and develop
efficient solutions for them. In this paper, we introduce generalized staircase
(GS) constraints which is an important generalization of one such tractable
class found in the literature, namely, staircase constraints. GS constraints
are of two kinds, down staircase (DS) and up staircase (US). We first examine
several properties of GS constraints, and then show that arc consistency is
sufficient to determine a solution to a CSP over DS constraints. Further, we
propose an optimal O(cd) time and space algorithm to compute arc consistency
for GS constraints where c is the number of constraints and d is the size of
the largest domain. Next, observing that arc consistency is not necessary for
solving a DSCSP, we propose a more efficient algorithm for solving it. With
regard to US constraints, arc consistency is not known to be sufficient to
determine a solution, and therefore, methods such as path consistency or
variable elimination are required. Since arc consistency acts as a subroutine
for these existing methods, replacing it by our optimal O(cd) arc consistency
algorithm produces a more efficient method for solving a USCSP.
