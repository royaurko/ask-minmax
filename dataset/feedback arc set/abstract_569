The structure of the dark matter and the thermodynamical status of the hot
gas in galaxy clusters is an interesting and widely discussed topic in modern
astrophysics. Recently, Rasia et al. (2004) have proposed a new dynamical model
for the mass density profile of clusters of galaxies as a result of a set of
high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation. We
investigate the lensing properties of this model evaluating the deflection
angle, the lensing potential and the amplification of the images. We reserve
particular attention to the structure and position of the critical curves in
order to see whether this model is able to produce radial and tangential arcs.
To this aim, we also investigate the effect of taking into account the
brightest cluster galaxy in the lensing potential and the deviations from
spherical symmetry mimicked by an external shear. We also analyze the
implication of the gas density and temperature profiles of the Rasia et
al.(2004) model on the properties of the X - ray emission and the
comptonization parameter that determines the CMBR temperature decrement due to
the Sunyaev - Zel'dovich effect.
