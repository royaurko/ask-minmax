In 1968, Israel Gohberg and Naum Krupnik discovered that local spectra of
singular integral operators with piecewise continuous coefficients on Lebesgue
spaces $L^p(\Gamma)$ over Lyapunov curves have the shape of circular arcs.
About 25 years later, Albrecht B\"ottcher and Yuri Karlovich realized that
these circular arcs metamorphose to so-called logarithmic leaves with a median
separating point when Lyapunov curves metamorphose to arbitrary Carleson
curves. We show that this result remains valid in a more general setting of
variable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p(\cdot)}(\Gamma)$ where $p:\Gamma\to(1,\infty)$
satisfies the Dini-Lipschitz condition. One of the main ingredients of the
proof is a new sufficient condition for the boundedness of the Cauchy singular
integral operator on variable Lebesgue spaces with weights related to
oscillations of Carleson curves.
