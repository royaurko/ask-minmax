Handling interference is one of the main challenges in the design of wireless
networks. One of the key approaches to interference management is node
cooperation, which can be classified into two main types: relaying and
feedback. In this work we consider simultaneous application of both cooperation
types in the presence of interference. We obtain exact characterization of the
capacity regions for Rayleigh fading and phase fading interference channels
with a relay and with feedback links, in the strong and very strong
interference regimes. Four feedback configurations are considered: (1) feedback
from both receivers to the relay, (2) feedback from each receiver to the relay
and to one of the transmitters (either corresponding or opposite), (3) feedback
from one of the receivers to the relay, (4) feedback from one of the receivers
to the relay and to one of the transmitters. Our results show that there is a
strong motivation for incorporating relaying and feedback into wireless
networks.
