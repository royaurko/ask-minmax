We present a study of the galaxy population predicted by hydrodynamical
simulations for a set of 19 galaxy clusters based on the GADGET-2 Tree+SPH
code. These simulations include gas cooling, star formation, a detailed
treatment of stellar evolution and chemical enrichment, as well as SN energy
feedback in the form of galactic winds. We compute the spectro-photometric
properties of the simulated galaxies. All simulations have been performed for
two choices of the stellar initial mass function: a standard Salpeter IMF, and
a top-heavier IMF. Several of the observational properties of the galaxy
population in nearby clusters are reproduced fairly well by simulations. A
Salpeter IMF is successful in accounting for the slope and the normalization of
the color-magnitude relation for the bulk of the galaxy population. Simulated
clusters have a relation between mass and optical luminosity which generally
agrees with observations, both in normalization and slope. We find that
galaxies are generally bluer, younger and more star forming in the cluster
outskirts, thus reproducing the observational trends. However, simulated
clusters have a total number of galaxies which is significantly smaller than
the observed one, falling short by about a factor 2-3. Finally, the brightest
cluster galaxies are always predicted to be too massive and too blue, when
compared to observations, due to gas overcooling in the core cluster regions,
even in the presence of a rather efficient SN feedback.
