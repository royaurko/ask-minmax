Instance sparsification is well-known in the world of exact computation since
it is very closely linked to the Exponential Time Hypothesis. In this paper, we
extend the concept of sparsification in order to capture subexponential time
approximation. We develop a new tool for inapproximability, called
approximation preserving sparsification and use it in order to get strong
inapproximability results in subexponential time for several fundamental
optimization problems as Max Independent Set, Min Dominating Set, Min Feedback
Vertex Set, and Min Set Cover.
