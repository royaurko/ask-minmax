This paper discusses about a sorting algorithm which uses the concept of
buckets where each bucket represents a certain number of digits. A two
dimensional data structure is used where one dimension represents buckets i. e;
number of digits and each bucket's corresponding dimensions represents the
input numbers that belong to that bucket. Each bucket is then individually
sorted. Since every preceding bucket elements will always be smaller than the
succeeding buckets no comparison between them is required. By doing this we can
significantly reduced the time complexity of any sorting algorithm used to sort
the given set of inputs.
