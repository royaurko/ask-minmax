In this paper Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays UHECRs data observed by the HiRes
fluorescence detector in stereo mode is analyzed to search for events in the
sky with an arrival direction lying on a great circle. Such structure is known
as the arc structure. The arc structure is expected when the charged cosmic
rays pass through the galactic magnetic field. The arcs searched for could
represent a broad or a small scale anisotropy depending on the proposed source
model for the UHECRs. The Arcs in this paper are looked for using Hough
transform were Hough transform is a technique used to looking for patterns in
images. No statistically significant arcs were found in this study.
