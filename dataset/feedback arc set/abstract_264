In this paper we explore the problem of achieving efficient packet
transmission over unreliable links with worst case occurrence of errors. In
such a setup, even an omniscient offline scheduling strategy cannot achieve
stability of the packet queue, nor is it able to use up all the available
bandwidth. Hence, an important first step is to identify an appropriate metric
for measuring the efficiency of scheduling strategies in such a setting. To
this end, we propose a relative throughput metric which corresponds to the long
term competitive ratio of the algorithm with respect to the optimal. We then
explore the impact of the error detection mechanism and feedback delay on our
measure. We compare instantaneous error feedback with deferred error feedback,
that requires a faulty packet to be fully received in order to detect the
error. We propose algorithms for worst-case adversarial and stochastic packet
arrival models, and formally analyze their performance. The relative throughput
achieved by these algorithms is shown to be close to optimal by deriving lower
bounds on the relative throughput of the algorithms and almost matching upper
bounds for any algorithm in the considered settings. Our collection of results
demonstrate the potential of using instantaneous feedback to improve the
performance of communication systems in adverse environments.
