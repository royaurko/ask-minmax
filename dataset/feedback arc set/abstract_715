Clustering ensemble is one of the most recent advances in unsupervised
learning. It aims to combine the clustering results obtained using different
algorithms or from different runs of the same clustering algorithm for the same
data set, this is accomplished using on a consensus function, the efficiency
and accuracy of this method has been proven in many works in literature. In the
first part of this paper we make a comparison among current approaches to
clustering ensemble in literature. All of these approaches consist of two main
steps: the ensemble generation and consensus function. In the second part of
the paper, we suggest engaging supervision in the clustering ensemble procedure
to get more enhancements on the clustering results. Supervision can be applied
in two places: either by using semi-supervised algorithms in the clustering
ensemble generation step or in the form of a feedback used by the consensus
function stage. Also, we introduce a flexible two parameter weighting
mechanism, the first parameter describes the compatibility between the datasets
under study and the semi-supervised clustering algorithms used to generate the
base partitions, the second parameter is used to provide the user feedback on
the these partitions. The two parameters are engaged in a "relabeling and
voting" based consensus function to produce the final clustering.
