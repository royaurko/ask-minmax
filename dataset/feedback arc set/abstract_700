This paper establishes the geometric structure of the lines of principal
curvature of a hypersurface immersed in ${\mathbb R}^4$ in a neighborhood of
the set $\mathcal{S}$ of its principal curvature singularities, consisting of
the points at which atF least two principal curvatures are equal.
  Under generic conditions defined by appropriate transversality hypotheses it
is proved that $\mathcal{S}$ is the union of regular smooth curves
$\mathcal{S}_{12}$ and $\mathcal{S}_{23}$, consisting of partially umbilic
points, where only two principal curvatures coincide. This curve is partitioned
into regular arcs consisting of points of Darbouxian types $D_1,\; D_2,\; D_3$,
with common boundary at isolated semi-Darbouxian transition points of types $
D_{12}$ and $D_{23}$.
  The stratified structure of the partially umbilic separatrix surfaces,
consisting of the boundary of the set of points through which the principal
lines approach $\mathcal S$, established in this work, extends to hypersurfaces
in ${\mathbb R}^4$ the results of Darboux for umbilic points on analytic
surfaces in ${\mathbb R}^3$, reformulated by Gutierrez and Sotomayor, to
describe the umbilic separatrix structures of the umbilic types $D_1,\; D_2,\;
D_3$, and further developed by Garcia, Gutierrez and Sotomayor, for their $
D_{12}$ and $D_{23}$ generic bifurcations. This work complements results of
Garcia on the structure of principal curvature lines around the generic
partially umbilic points of hypersurfaces in ${\mathbb R}^4$.
