A family of sets in the plane is simple if the intersection of its any
subfamily is arc-connected, and it is pierced by a line $L$ if the intersection
of its any member with $L$ is a nonempty segment. It is proved that the
intersection graphs of simple families of compact arc-connected sets in the
plane pierced by a common line have chromatic number bounded by a function of
their clique number.
