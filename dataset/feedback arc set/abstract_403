We propose a generalized feedback model and compressive sensing based
opportunistic feedback schemes for feedback resource reduction in MIMO
Broadcast Channels under the assumption that both uplink and downlink channels
undergo block Rayleigh fading. Feedback resources are shared and are
opportunistically accessed by users who are strong, i.e. users whose channel
quality information is above a certain fixed threshold. Strong users send same
feedback information on all shared channels. They are identified by the base
station via compressive sensing. Both analog and digital feedbacks are
considered. The proposed analog & digital opportunistic feedback schemes are
shown to achieve the same sum-rate throughput as that achieved by dedicated
feedback schemes, but with feedback channels growing only logarithmically with
number of users. Moreover, there is also a reduction in the feedback load. In
the analog feedback case, we show that the propose scheme reduces the feedback
noise which eventually results in better throughput, whereas in the digital
feedback case the proposed scheme in a noisy scenario achieves almost the
throughput obtained in a noiseless dedicated feedback scenario. We also show
that for a fixed given budget of feedback bits, there exist a trade-off between
the number of shared channels and thresholds accuracy of the feedback SINR.
