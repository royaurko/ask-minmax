We aim at providing a foundation of a theory of "good" SAT representations F
of boolean functions f. We argue that the hierarchy UC_k of unit-refutation
complete clause-sets of level k, introduced by the contributors, provides the most
basic target classes, that is, F in UC_k is to be achieved for k as small as
feasible. If F does not contain new variables, i.e., F is equivalent (as a CNF)
to f, then F in UC_1 is similar to "achieving (generalised) arc consistency"
known from the literature (it is somewhat weaker, but theoretically much nicer
to handle). We show that for polysize representations of boolean functions in
this sense, the hierarchy UC_k is strict. The boolean functions for these
separations are "doped" minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets of deficiency 1;
these functions have been introduced in [Sloan, Soerenyi, Turan, 2007], and we
generalise their construction and show a correspondence to a strengthened
notion of irredundant sub-clause-sets. Turning from lower bounds to upper
bounds, we believe that many common CNF representations fit into the UC_k
scheme, and we give some basic tools to construct representations in UC_1 with
new variables, based on the Tseitin translation. Note that regarding new
variables the UC_1-representations are stronger than mere "arc consistency",
since the new variables are not excluded from consideration.
