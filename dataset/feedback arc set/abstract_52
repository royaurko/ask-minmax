The recently developed feedback trap can be used to create arbitrary virtual
potentials, to explore the dynamics of small particles or large molecules in
complex situations. Experimentally, feedback traps introduce several finite
time scales: there is a delay between the measurement of a particle's position
and the feedback response; the feedback response is applied for a finite update
time; and a finite camera exposure integrates motion. We show how to
incorporate such timing effects into the description of particle motion. For
the test case of a virtual quadratic potential, we give the first accurate
description of particle dynamics, calculating the power spectrum and variance
of fluctuations as a function of feedback gain, testing against simulations. We
show that for small feedback gains, the motion approximates that of a particle
in an ordinary harmonic potential. Moreover, if the potential is varied in
time, for example by varying its stiffness, the work that is calculated
approximates that done in an ordinary changing potential. The quality of the
approximation is set by the ratio of the update time of the feedback loop to
the relaxation time of motion in the virtual potential.
