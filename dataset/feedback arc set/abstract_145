This note is a short elaboration of the conjecture of Saniga et al (J. Opt.
B: Quantum Semiclass. 6 (2004) L19-L20) by regarding a set of mutually unbiased
bases (MUBs) in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, d being a power of a prime, as
an analogue of an arc in a (Desarguesian) projective plane of order d. Complete
sets of MUBs thus correspond to (d+1)-arcs, i.e., ovals. The existence of two
principally distinct kinds of ovals for d even and greater than four, viz.
conics and non-conics, implies the existence of two qualitatively different
groups of the complete sets of MUBs for the Hilbert spaces of corresponding
dimensions.
