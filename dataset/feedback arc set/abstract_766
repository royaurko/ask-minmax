The frequency with which background galaxies appear as long arcs as a result
of gravitational lensing by foreground clusters of galaxies has recently been
found to be a very sensitive probe of cosmological models by Bartelmann et al.
(1998). They have found that such arcs would be expected far less frequently
than observed (by an order of magnitude) in the currently favored model for the
universe, with a large cosmological constant $\Omega_\Lambda \sim 0.7$. Here we
analyze whether including the effect of cluster galaxies on the likelihood of
clusters to generate long-arc images of background galaxies can change the
statistics. Taking into account a variety of constraints on the properties of
cluster galaxies, we find that there are not enough sufficiently massive
galaxies in a cluster for them to significantly enhance the cross section of
clusters to generate long arcs. We find that cluster galaxies typically enhance
the cross section by only $\lesssim 15%$.
