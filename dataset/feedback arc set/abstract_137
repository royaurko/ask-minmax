Existing document filtering systems learn user profiles based on user
relevance feedback on documents. In some cases, users may have prior knowledge
about what features are important. For example, a Spanish speaker may only want
news written in Spanish, and thus a relevant document should contain the
feature "Language: Spanish"; a researcher focusing on HIV knows an article with
the medical subject "Subject: AIDS" is very likely to be relevant to him/her.
  Semi-structured documents with rich metadata are increasingly prevalent on
the Internet. Motivated by the well-adopted faceted search interface in
e-commerce, we study the exploitation of user prior knowledge on faceted
features for semi-structured document filtering. We envision two faceted
feedback mechanisms, and propose a novel user profile learning algorithm that
can incorporate user feedback on features. To evaluate the proposed work, we
use two data sets from the TREC filtering track, and conduct a user study on
Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our experiment results show that user feedback on
faceted features is useful for filtering. The proposed user profile learning
algorithm can effectively learn from user feedback on both documents and
features, and performs better than several existing methods.
