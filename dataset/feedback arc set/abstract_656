We study dispersions of Fermi arcs in the Weyl semimetal phase by
constructing a simple effective model. We calculate how the surface Fermi-arc
dispersions for the top- and bottom surfaces merge into the bulk Dirac cones in
the Weyl semimetal at both ends of the arcs, and show that they have opposite
velocities. This result is also confirmed by a calculation using a
tight-binding model. Furthermore, by changing a parameter in the system while
preserving time-reversal symmetry, we show that two Fermi arcs evolve into a
surface Dirac cone when the system transits from the Weyl semimetal to the
topological insulator phase. We also demonstrate that choices of surface
terminations affect the pairing of Weyl nodes, from which the Fermi arcs are
formed.
