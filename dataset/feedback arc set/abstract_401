The article is devoted to investigation of robust stability of the
generalized linear control of the discrete autonomous dynamical systems. Sharp
necessary conditions on the size of the set of multipliers that guaranty robust
stabilization of the equilibrium of the system are provided. Surprisingly
enough it turns out that the generalized linear delayed feedback control has
same limitation as the classical Pyragas DFC. This generalized Ushio 1996 DFC
limitation statement. Note that in scalar case a generalized non-linear control
can robustly stabilize an equilibrium for any admissible range of multipliers.
In the current article similar result is obtained in the vector-valued setting.
