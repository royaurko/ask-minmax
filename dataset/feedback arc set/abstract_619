Let $\mu$ be a positive finite measure on the unit circle. The Dirichlet type
space $\mathcal{D}(\mu)$, associated to $\mu$, consists of holomorphic
functions on the unit disc whose derivatives are square integrable when
weighted against the Poisson integral of $\mu$. First, we give an estimate of
the norm of the reproducing kernel $k^\mu$ of $\mathcal{D}(\mu)$. Next, we
study the notion of $\mu$-capacity associated to $\mathcal{D}(\mu)$, in the
sense of Beurling--Deny. Namely, we give an estimate of $\mu$-capacity of arcs
in terms of the norm of $k^\mu$. We also provide a new condition on closed sets
to be $\mu$-polar. Note that in the particular case where $\mu$ is the Lebesgue
measure, this condition coincides with Carleson's condition \cite{Ca}. Our
method is based on sharp estimates of norms of some outer test functions which
allow us to transfer these problems to an estimate of the reproducing kernel of
an appropriate weighted Sobolev space.
