This document contains two presentations which describe the working
principles of a class of electrostatic multidimensional sensors and force
actuators. The subject of the study is the search of the most effective methods
for measuring the position of a cubical conducting proof mass which floats in a
weightless environment. The same proof mass must be controlled with a feedback
loop by applying forces with the same set of electrodes. For more information
