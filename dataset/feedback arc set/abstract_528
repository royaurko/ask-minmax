We consider the optimal control design problem for discrete-time LTI systems
with state feedback, when the actuation signal is subject to unmeasurable
switching propagation delays, due to e.g. the routing in a multi-hop
communication network and/or jitter. In particular, we set up a constrained
optimization problem where the cost function is the worst-case $\mathcal{L}_2$
norm for all admissible switching delays. We first show how to model these
systems as pure switching linear systems, and as main contribution of the paper
we provide an algorithm to compute a sub-optimal solution.
