Weyl semimetals harbor unusual surface states known as Fermi arcs, which are
essentially disjoint segments of a two dimensional Fermi surface. We describe a
prescription for obtaining Fermi arcs of arbitrary shape and connectivity by
stacking alternate two dimensional electron and hole Fermi surfaces and adding
suitable interlayer coupling. Using this prescription, we compute the local
density of states -- a quantity directly relevant to scanning tunneling
microscopy -- on a Weyl semimetal surface in the presence of a point scatterer
and present results for a particular model that is expected to apply to
pyrochlore iridate Weyl semimetals. For thin samples, Fermi arcs on opposite
surfaces conspire to allow nested backscattering, resulting in strong Friedel
oscillations on the surface. These oscillations die out as the sample thickness
is increased and Fermi arcs from the bottom surface retreat and weak
oscillations, due to scattering between the top surface Fermi arcs alone,
survive. The surface spectral function -- accessible to photoemission
experiments -- is also computed. In the thermodynamic limit, this calculation
can be done analytically and separate contributions from the Fermi arcs and the
bulk states can be seen.
