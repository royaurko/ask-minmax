The capacity of the semideterministic discrete memoryless broadcast channel
(SD-BC) with partial message side-information (P-MSI) at the receivers is
established. For the setting without a common message, it is shown that P-MSI
to the deterministic receiver can only increase capacity if also the stochastic
receiver has P-MSI, while P-MSI to the stochastic receiver alone can increase
capacity. For the setting where the encoder also conveys a common message, it
is shown that P-MSI to the deterministic receiver only can also increase
capacity.
  The capacity results are used to show that on the SD-BC with or without P-MSI
feedback from the stochastic receiver can increase capacity; with P-MSI at the
deterministic receiver it can, in particular, increase the sum-rate capacity.
In contrast, as we also show, when the stochastic receiver has full MSI
(F-MSI), feedback cannot increase capacity.
  The link between feedback and P-MSI is a new feedback code for the SD-BC,
which---roughly speaking---turns feedback into P-MSI at the stochastic
receiver. The P-MSI allows the stochastic receiver to better mitigate
experienced interference.
