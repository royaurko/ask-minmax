We propose a two dimensional (2D) adaptive nodes technique for irregular
regions. The method is based on equi-distribution principal and dimension
reduction. The mesh generation is carried out by first producing some adaptive
nodes in a rectangle based on equi-distribution along the coordinate axes and
then transforming the generated nodes to the physical domain. Since the
produced mesh is applied to the meshless-type methods, the connectivity of the
points is not used and only the grid points are important, though the grid
lines are utilized in the adapting process. The performance of the adaptive
points is examined by considering a collocation meshless method which is based
on interpolation in terms of a set of radial basis functions.
  A generalized thin plate spline with sufficient smoothness is used as a basis
function and the arc-length is employed as a monitor in the equi-distribution
process.
  Some experimental results will be presented to illustrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.
