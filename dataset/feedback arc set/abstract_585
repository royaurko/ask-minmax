Adding small random parametric noise to an arc of diffeomophisms of a
manifold of dimension 3, generically unfolding a codimension one quadratic
homoclinic tangency q associated to a sectionally dissipative saddle fixed
point p, we obtain not more than a finite number of physical probability
measures, whose ergodic basins cover the orbits which are recurrent to a
neighborhood of the tangency point $q$. This result is in contrast to the
extension of Newhouse's phenomenon of coexistence of infinitely many sinks
obtained by Palis and Viana in this setting.
  There is a similar result for the simpler bidimensional case whose proof
relies on geometric arguments. We now extend the arguments to cover three
dimensional manifolds.
