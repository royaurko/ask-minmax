Elementary complex analysis and Hilbert space methods show that a union of at
most n arcs on the circle is uniquely determined by the nth Fourier partial sum
of its characteristic function. The endpoints of the arcs can be recovered from
the coefficients appearing in the partial sum by solving two polynomial
equations.
