Different hydrodynamic regimes for the gaseous outflows generated by multiple
supernovae explosions and stellar winds occurring within compact and massive
star clusters are discussed. It is shown that there exists the threshold energy
that separates clusters whose outflows evolve in the quasi-adiabatic or
radiative regime from those within which catastrophic cooling and a positive
feedback star-forming mode sets in. The role of the surrounding ISM and the
observational appearance of the star cluster winds evolving in different
hydrodynamic regimes are also discussed.
