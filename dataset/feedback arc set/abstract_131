Consider a lossy packet network of queues, communicating over a wireless
medium. This paper presents a throughput-optimal transmission strategy for a
unicast network when feedback is available, which has the following advantages:
It requires a very limited form of acknowledgment feedback. It is completely
distributed, and independent of the network topology. Finally, communication at
the information theoretic cut-set rate requires no network coding and no
rateless coding on the packets. This simple strategy consists of each node
randomly choosing a packet from its buffer to transmit at each opportunity.
However, the packet is only deleted from a node's buffer once it has been
successfully received by the final destination
