The geometric motivic Poincar\'e series of a variety, which was introduced by
Denef and Loeser, takes into account the classes in the Grothendieck ring of
the sequence of jets of arcs in the variety. Denef and Loeser proved that this
series has a rational form. We describe it in the case of an affine toric
variety of arbitrary dimension. The result, which provides an explicit set of
candidate poles, is expressed in terms of the sequence of Newton polyhedra of
certain monomial ideals, which we call logarithmic jacobian ideals, associated
to the modules of differential forms with logarithmic poles outside the torus
of the toric variety.
