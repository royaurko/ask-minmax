Using an energy-momentum dispersion for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 obtained from
angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy we show that the shrinking Fermi arc
model of the pseudogap is inconsistent with Raman scattering below Tc and
specific heat near T*. By simulating the quasiparticle energy dispersion curves
we show that Fermi arcs are an artifact of a T-dependent scattering rate.
