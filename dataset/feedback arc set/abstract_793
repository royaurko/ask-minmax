It is demonstrated that under the hypothesis of boundedness, the semantics
appears as a property of spontaneous physical processes. It turns that both
semantic structure and semantic meaning have their own physical agents each of
which is represented trough generic for the state space property. The
boundedness sets an exclusive two-fold representation of a semantic unit: as a
specific sequence of letters and as a performance of a specific engine so that
their interplay serves as grounds for building a multi-layer hierarchy of
semantic structures. It is established that in this setting the semantics
admits both non-extensivity, permutation sensitivity and Zipf`s law. The
robustness of the hierarchical organization of semantic structures is
maintained by new generic form of non-local feedback that appears as a result
of the necessary for sustaining boundeness matter wave emitting.
