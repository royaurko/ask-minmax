We present new Keck observations of giant arcs in the cluster Abell 2390.
High resolution two-dimensional spectra of two arcs show metal lines at z=4.040
+/- 0.005 with Lyman-alpha emission spatially separated from the stellar
continuum. In addition, spectroscopy along the notorious `straight' arc reveals
two unrelated galaxies, at z=0.913 and z=1.033, with absorption lines of MgII
and FeII at z=0.913 seen against the more distant object, indicating the
presence of a large gaseous halo.
