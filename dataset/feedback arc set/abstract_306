The status of SUSY searches at LEP2 up to centre-of-mass energy of 202 GeV is
presented. Search strategies for sleptons, squarks, charginos and neutralinos
are discussed in the framework of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with
R-parity conservation. With no indication for the production of these particles
new limits are set on their masses.
