The E831/FOCUS experiment at Fermilab is a photoproduction experiment which
generated high quality charm particles. During its run, we obtained a large
data set, including more than 1 million charm mesons in the Kpi/K2pi/K3pi mode
decays. The current analysis efforts by the collaboration members are quite
active and diverse. I will summarize the recent papers published by the FOCUS
group on topics of semileptonic decays of charm mesons.
