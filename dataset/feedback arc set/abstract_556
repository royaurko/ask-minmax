We show that all finite-dimensional resolvable generalized manifolds with the
piecewise disjoint arc-disk property are codimension one manifold factors. We
then show how the piecewise disjoint arc-disk property and other general
position properties that detect codimension one manifold factors are related.
We also note that in every example presently known to the contributors of a
codimension one manifold factor of dimension $n\geq 4$ determined by general
position properties, the piecewise disjoint arc-disk property is satisfied.
