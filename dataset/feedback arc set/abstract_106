We characterize the spectrum of one-dimensional Jacobi operators
H=aS^{+}+a^{-}S^{-}+b in l^{2}(\Z) with quasi-periodic complex-valued
algebro-geometric coefficients (which satisfy one (and hence infinitely many)
equation(s) of the stationary Toda hierarchy) associated with nonsingular
hyperelliptic curves. The spectrum of H coincides with the conditional
stability set of H and can explicitly be described in terms of the mean value
of the Green's function of H.
  As a result, the spectrum of H consists of finitely many simple analytic arcs
in the complex plane. Crossings as well as confluences of spectral arcs are
possible and discussed as well.
