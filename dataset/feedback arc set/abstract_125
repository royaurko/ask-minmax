A space is `n-strong arc connected' (n-sac) if for any n points in the space
there is an arc in the space visiting them in order. A space is omega-strong
arc connected (omega-sac) if it is n-sac for all n. We study these properties
in finite graphs, regular continua, and rational continua. There are no 4-sac
graphs, but there are 3-sac graphs and graphs which are 2-sac but not 3-sac.
For every n there is an n-sac regular continuum, but no regular continuum is
omega-sac. There is an omega-sac rational continuum. For graphs we give a
simple characterization of those graphs which are 3-sac. It is shown, using
ideas from descriptive set theory, that there is no simple characterization of
n-sac, or omega-sac, rational continua.
