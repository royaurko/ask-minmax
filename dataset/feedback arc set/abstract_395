A multipartite tournament is an orientation of a complete $c$-partite graph.
In [L. Volkmann, A remark on cycles through an arc in strongly connected
multipartite tournaments, Appl. Math. Lett. 20 (2007) 1148--1150], Volkmann
proved that a strongly connected $c$-partite tournament with $c \ge 3$ contains
an arc that belongs to a directed cycle of length $m$ for every $m \in \{3, 4,
\ldots, c\}$. He also conjectured the existence of three arcs with this
property. In this note, we prove the existence of two such arcs.
