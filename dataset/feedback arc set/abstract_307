This paper describes the searches for the Higgs boson performed by the CDF
and D0 collaborations at the Tevatron ppbar Collider using the data collected
in the 1992-95 run. Searches for standard model Higgs and as well for neutral
and charged minimal SUSY Higgs bosons are also presented. No signal has been
observed and limits are set for production cross sections.
