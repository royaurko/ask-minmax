The traditional method to generate pulses in the range of some nanoseconds
with high amplitudes, is the using of the avalanche-effect of transistors.
However the problem with this method is the poor possibility for
parameterizing. That was the trigger to look for a different way: under using
of modern electronic components, a pulse generator, which is parameterizable,
was developed. The parameters can be set by using a Windows- or Linux-PC. The
pulse width can be adjusted in the range of 3....80 ns; the pulse amplitude in
the range of 18...84 V and the pulse repetition rate in the range of 1 Hz to 50
kHz.
