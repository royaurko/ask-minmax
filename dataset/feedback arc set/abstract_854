Coding schemes for discrete memoryless multicast networks with rate-limited
feedback from the receivers and relays to the transmitter are proposed. The
coding schemes are based on block-Markov coding, {joint backward decoding} and
hybrid relaying strategy. In each block, the receivers and relays compress
their channel outputs and send the compression indices to the transmitter
through the feedback links. In the next block, after obtaining the compression
indices, the transmitter sends them together with the source message. Each
receiver uses backward decoding to jointly decode the source message and all
compression indices. Our coding schemes generalize Gabbai and Bross's results
for the single relay channel with partial feedback, where they proposed coding
schemes based on restricted decoding and deterministic partitioning. It is
shown that for the single relay channel with relay-transmitter feedback, our
coding schemes can strictly improve on noisy network coding, distributed
decode-forward coding and all known lower bounds on the achievable rate in the
absence of feedback. Furthermore, motivated by the feedback coding schemes, we
propose a new coding scheme for discrete memoryless multicast networks without
feedback, which also improves noisy network coding and distributed
decode-forward coding.
