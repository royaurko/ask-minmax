We study a class of holomorphic matrix models. The integrals are taken over
middle dimensional cycles in the space of complex square matrices. As the size
of the matrices tends to infinity, the distribution of eigenvalues is given by
a measure with support on a collection of arcs in the complex planes. We show
that the arcs are level sets of the imaginary part of a hyperelliptic integral
connecting branch points.
