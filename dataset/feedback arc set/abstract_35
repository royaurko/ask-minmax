The arc-length continuation framework is used for the design of state
feedback control laws that enable a microscopic simulator trace its own
open-loop coarse bifurcation diagram. The steering of the system along solution
branches is achieved through the manipulation of the bifurcation parameter,
which becomes our actuator. The design approach is based on the assumption that
the eigenvalues of the linearized system can be decomposed into two well
separated clusters: one containing eigenvalues with large negative real parts
and one containing (possibly unstable) eigenvalues close to the origin.
