A novel model of a semiconductor laser with optical feedback is presented,
generalizing Lang-Kobayashi equations to the case of incoherent feedback. The
equations are supplemented by a stochastic variable which models random phase
difference between the field inside laser cavity and the feedback field. It is
shown that for weak-to-moderate feedback the transition from coherent to
incoherent feedback leads to replacement of dynamical chaos by almost
stationary lasing with slightly fluctuating intensity. Nevertheless, incoherent
feedback can lead to chaotic oscillations, but at considerably larger feedback
levels.
