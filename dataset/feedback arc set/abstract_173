We show a kernel of at most $13k$ vertices for the Planar Feedback Vertex Set
problem restricted to planar graphs, i.e., a polynomial-time algorithm that
transforms an input instance $(G,k)$ to an equivalent instance with at most
$13k$ vertices. To this end we introduce a few new reduction rules. However,
our main contribution is an application of the region decomposition technique
in the analysis of the kernel size. We show that our analysis is tight, up to a
constant additive term.
