Motivic measure on the space of functions was introduced by Campillo, Delgado
and Gusein-Zade as an analog of the motivic measure on the space of arcs . In
this paper we prove that the measure on the space of functions can be related
to the motivic measure on the space of arcs by a factor, which can be defined
explicitly in geometric terms. This provides a possibility to rewrite motivic
integrals over the space of functions as integrals over the union of all
symmetric powers of the space of arcs.
