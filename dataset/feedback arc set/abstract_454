Recent information theoretic results suggest that precoding on the multi-user
downlink MIMO channel with delayed channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT) could lead to data rates much beyond the ones obtained without any CSIT,
even in extreme situations when the delayed channel feedback is made totally
obsolete by a feedback delay exceeding the channel coherence time. This
surprising result is based on the ideas of interference repetition and
alignment which allow the receivers to reconstruct information symbols which
canceling out the interference completely, making it an optimal scheme in the
infinite SNR regime. In this paper, we formulate a similar problem, yet at
finite SNR. We propose a first construction for the precoder which matches the
previous results at infinite SNR yet reaches a useful trade-off between
interference alignment and signal enhancement at finite SNR, allowing for
significant performance improvements in practical settings. We present two
general precoding methods with arbitrary number of users by means of virtual
MMSE and mutual information optimization, achieving good compromise between
signal enhancement and interference alignment. Simulation results show
substantial improvement due to the compromise between those two aspects.
