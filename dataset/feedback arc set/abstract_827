Our analysis of a VLBA 12-hour synthesis observations of the OH masers in
W49N has provided detailed high angular-resolution images of the maser sources,
at 1612, 1665 and 1667 MHz. The images, of several dozens of spots, reveal
anisotropic scatter broadening; with typical sizes of a few tens of
milli-arc-seconds and axial ratios between 1.5 to 3. The image position angles
oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane are interpreted in terms of
elongation of electron-density irregularities parallel to the galactic plane,
due to a similarly aligned local magnetic field. However, we find the apparent
angular sizes on the average a factor of 2.5 less than those reported by Desai
et al., indicating significantly less scattering than inferred earlier. The
average position angle of the scattered broadened images is also seen to
deviate significantly (by about 10 degrees) from that implied by the magnetic
field in the Galactic plane. More intriguingly, for a few Zeeman pairs in our
set, we find significant differences in the scatter broadened images for the
two hands of polarization, even when apparent velocity separation is less than
0.1 km/s. Here we present the details of our observations and analysis, and
discuss the interesting implications of our results for the intervening
anisotropic magneto-ionic medium, as well as a comparison with the expectations
based on earlier work.
