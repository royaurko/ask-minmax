Classical billiards constitute an important class of dynamical systems. They
have not only been in used in mathematical disciplines such as ergodic theory,
but their properties demonstrate fundamental physical phenomena that can be
observed in laboratory settings. This document provides instructions for a
Matlab module that simulates classical billiard systems. It is intended to be
used as both a research and teaching tool. At present, the program efficiently
simulates tables that are constructed entirely from line segments and
elliptical arcs. It functions less reliably for tables with more complex
boundary components. The program and documentation can be downloaded from
