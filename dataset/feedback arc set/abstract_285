Models for piezoelectric beams and structures with piezoelectric patches
generally ignore magnetic effects. This is because the magnetic energy has a
relatively small effect on the overall dynamics. Piezoelectric beam models are
known to be exactly observable, and can be exponentially stabilized in the
energy space by using a mechanical feedback controller. In this paper, a
variational approach is used to derive a model for a piezoelectric beam that
includes magnetic effects. It is proven that the partial differential equation
model is well-posed. Magnetic effects have a strong effect on the
stabilizability of the control system. For almost all system parameters the
piezoelectric beam can be strongly stabilized, but is not exponentially
stabilizable in the energy space. Strong stabilization is achieved using only
electrical feedback. Furthermore, using the same electrical feedback, an
exponentially stable closed-loop system can be obtained for a set of system
parameters of zero Lebesgue measure. These results are compared to those of a
beam without magnetic effects.
