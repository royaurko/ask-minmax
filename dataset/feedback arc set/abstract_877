We give a linear-time algorithm that checks for isomorphism between two 0-1
matrices that obey the circular-ones property. This algorithm leads to
linear-time isomorphism algorithms for related graph classes, including Helly
circular-arc graphs, \Gamma-circular-arc graphs, proper circular-arc graphs and
convex-round graphs.
