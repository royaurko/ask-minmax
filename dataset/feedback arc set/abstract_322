It is known that for any permutation group $G$ of odd order one can find a
subset of the permuted set whose stabilizer in $G$ is trivial, and if $G$ is
primitive, then also a base of size at most 3. Both of these results are
generalized to the coherent configuration of $G$ (that is in this case a
schurian antisymmetric coherent configuration). This enables us to construct a
polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing and isomorphism testing of schurian
tournaments (i.e. arc colored tournaments the coherent configurations of which
are schurian).
