In this paper, we consider a smooth arc of diffeomorphisms which has a
saddle-node bifurcation inside a nontrivial invariant set which is a
deformation of a horseshoe. We show that this saddle-node bifurcation is
isolated, that is, its hyperbolicity is maintained before and after the
saddle-node bifurcation. Moreover we construct a $C^2$-open set of arcs having
the same property.
