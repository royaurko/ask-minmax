We have demonstrated that a rather weak external optical feedback with delay
can lead to the mode switching of the counterpropogating modes. The delay time
should be longer then any system characteristic time. The equations describing
the ring resonator with the delayed optical feedback was obtained from the ?rst
principles. The analytical formula for the necessary external feedback strength
was derived. Other than the regular behavior, the system demonstrates a complex
chaotic behavior.
