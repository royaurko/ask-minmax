One distinguishing feature of rational curves is that they have algebraic
parameterizations. Arc spaces are a way of describing approximations to
parameterizations of all curves in some fixed space. Playing on these
descriptions, this paper introduces rationally generated arcs, and applies them
towards the description and enumeration of rational curves in algebraic
varieties.
