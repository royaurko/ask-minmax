In this paper, we study the frequency response of uncertain systems using
Kharitonov stability theory on first order complex polynomial set. For an
interval transfer function, we show that the minimal real part of the frequency
response at any fixed frequency is attained at some prescribed vertex transfer
functions. By further geometric and algebraic analysis, we identify an index
for strict positive realness of interval transfer functions. Some extensions
and applications in positivity verification and robust absolute stability of
feedback control systems are also presented.
