In this paper, we study the effect of feedback channel noise on the
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in multiuser MIMO systems using quantized
feedback, where each user has m transmit antennas and the base-station receiver
has n antennas. We derive an achievable tradeoff and use it to show that in
SNR-symmetric channels, a single bit of imperfect feedback is sufficient to
double the maximum diversity order to 2mn compared to when there is no feedback
(maximum is mn at multiplexing gain of zero). Further, additional feedback bits
do not increase this maximum diversity order beyond 2mn. Finally, the above
diversity order gain of mn over non-feedback systems can also be achieved for
higher multiplexing gains, albeit requiring more than one bit of feedback.
