We present ROSAT HRI X-ray observations of all the galaxy clusters in the Le
F\`evre et al. arc survey sample in order to study the spatial distribution of
the intra-cluster medium, and examine the expected number of giant luminous
arcs for the sample using two spherically symmetric lens models constrained by
our X-ray data.
