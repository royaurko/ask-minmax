Stabilizing unstable periodic orbits in a chaotic invariant set not only
reveals information about its structure but also leads to various interesting
applications. For the successful application of a chaos control scheme,
convergence speed is of crucial importance. Here we present a predictive
feedback chaos control method that adapts a control parameter online to yield
optimal asymptotic convergence speed. We study the adaptive control map both
analytically and numerically and prove that it converges at least linearly to a
value determined by the spectral radius of the control map at the periodic
orbit to be stabilized. The method is easy to implement algorithmically and may
find applications for adaptive online control of biological and engineering
systems.
