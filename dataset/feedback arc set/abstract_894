In this paper we deal with additional control structures for decorated PT
Nets. The main contribution are inhibitor arcs and priorities. The first ensure
that a marking can inhibit the firing of a transition. Inhibitor arcs force
that the transition may only fire when the place is empty. an order of
transitions restrict the firing, so that an transition may fire only if it has
the highest priority of all enabled transitions. This concept is shown to be
compatible with reconfigurable Petri nets.
