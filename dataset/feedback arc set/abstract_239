Systems for which the backstepping technique cannot be applied are
considered. A criterion for the design of a hybrid feedback law is proposed by
blending a local stabilizer with a backstepping controller. This hybrid
feedback law renders the origin globally asymptotically stable for the
closed-loop system. The selection criterion is based on choice of the size of a
compact set included in the basin of attraction of the local controller. The
results are illustrated by simulations.
