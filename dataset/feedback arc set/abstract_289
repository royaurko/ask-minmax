We develop a learning principle and an efficient algorithm for batch learning
from logged bandit feedback. This learning setting is ubiquitous in online
systems (e.g., ad placement, web search, recommendation), where an algorithm
makes a prediction (e.g., ad ranking) for a given input (e.g., query) and
observes bandit feedback (e.g., user clicks on presented ads). We first address
the counterfactual nature of the learning problem through propensity scoring.
Next, we prove generalization error bounds that account for the variance of the
propensity-weighted empirical risk estimator. These constructive bounds give
rise to the Counterfactual Risk Minimization (CRM) principle. We show how CRM
can be used to derive a new learning method -- called Policy Optimizer for
Exponential Models (POEM) -- for learning stochastic linear rules for
structured output prediction. We present a decomposition of the POEM objective
that enables efficient stochastic gradient optimization. POEM is evaluated on
several multi-label classification problems showing substantially improved
robustness and generalization performance compared to the state-of-the-art.
