We investigate oscillation death in systems of coupled nonlinear oscillators
with feedback loop. We find that feedback results in oscillation death both in
small sets or large ensembles. More importantly, the death zone in parameter
space is significantly enlarged and oscillation death could occur even in
coupled identical oscillators in the presence of feedback. We find that there
are two different ways to oscillation death, namely desynchronization and
completely synchronization induced oscillation death. Feedback induced
oscillation death may be used to suppress unexpected oscillations, e.g., in
chaotic laser arrays.
