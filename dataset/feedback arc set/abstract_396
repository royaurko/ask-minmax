Continuing the description of rf vacuum arcs from an earlier paper, we
describe some aspects of the interaction of vacuum arcs that involve the
surface. This paper describes aspects of plasma materials interactions that
affect the arc and models measurement of the surface field using the
Tonks-Frenkel and the spinodal electrohydrodynamic instabilities, a realistic
model for the generation and evaluation of high field enhancements, unipolar
arcs, creep and other effects.
