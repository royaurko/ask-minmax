In this paper we show that the non-analyticity locus of an arc-analytic
function is arc-symmetric. Recall that a function is called arc-analytic if it
is real analytic on each real analytic arc.
  By a result of Bierstone and Milman a big class of arc-analytic function,
namely those that satisfy a polynomial equation with real analytic
coefficients, can be made analytic by a sequence of global blowings-up with
smooth centers. We show that these centers can be chosen, at each stage of the
resolution, inside the non-analyticity locus.
