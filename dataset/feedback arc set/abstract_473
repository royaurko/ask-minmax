We consider a MIMO interference channel in which the transmitters and
receivers operate in frequency-division duplex mode. In this setting,
interference management through coordinated transceiver design necessitates
channel state information at the transmitters (CSI-T). The acquisition of CSI-T
is done through feedback from the receivers, which entitles a loss in degrees
of freedom, due to training and feedback. This loss increases with the amount
of CSI-T. In this work, after formulating an overhead model for CSI acquisition
at the transmitters, we propose a distributed mechanism to find for each
transmitter a subset of the complete CSI, which is used to perform interference
management. The mechanism is based on many-to-many stable matching. We prove
the existence of a stable matching and exploit an algorithm to reach it.
Simulation results show performance improvement compared to full and minimal
CSI-T.
