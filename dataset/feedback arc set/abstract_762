In the previous works of the contributors, a step-by-step algorithm FOP which uses
any $fixed~order~of~points$ in the projective plane $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ is
proposed for constructing small complete arcs. In every step, the algorithm
adds to a running arc the first point in the fixed order not lying on the
bisecants of the arc. In this work we $\textbf{collect the sizes of complete
lexiarcs}$ (i.e. complete arcs in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ obtained by the algorithm
FOP with the lexicographical orders of points) in the following regions:
  $\textbf{all}$ $q\le301813$, $q$ prime power;
  23 sporadic $q$'s in the interval $[301897\ldots430007]$, see Table 2.
  In the work [9], the smallest $known$ sizes of complete arcs in
$\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ are collected for all $q\leq160001$, $q$ prime power. The
sizes of complete arcs collected in this work and in the work [9] provide the
following upper bounds on the smallest size $t_{2}(2,q)$ of a complete arc in
the projective plane $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$:
  \begin{align*} t_{2}(2,q)&< 0.998\sqrt{3q\ln q}<1.729\sqrt{q\ln q}&\mbox{ for
}&&7&\le q\le160001; \\ t_{2}(2,q)&<1.05\sqrt{3q\ln q}<1.819\sqrt{q\ln
q}&\mbox{ for }&&7&\le q\le301813;\\ t_{2}(2,q)&<\sqrt{q}\ln^{0.7295}q&\mbox{
for }&&109&\le q\le160001;\\ t_{2}(2,q)&<\sqrt{q}\ln^{0.7404}q&\mbox{ for
}&&160001&<q\le301813. \end{align*} Our investigations and results allow to
conjecture that the 2-nd and 3-rd bounds above hold for all $q\geq109$.
  In addition, it is shown that sizes of complete lexiarcs in
$\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, $q\gtrapprox90000$, exceed the smallest known sizes of
complete arcs by only at most $6\%$. It is noted also that sizes of the random
complete arcs and complete lexiarcs behave similarly.
  This work can be considered as a continuation and development of the paper
[10].
