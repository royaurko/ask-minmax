In this paper, we present an approach for designing feedback controllers for
polynomial systems that maximize the size of the time-limited backwards
reachable set (BRS). We rely on the notion of occupation measures to pose the
synthesis problem as an infinite dimensional linear program (LP) and provide
finite dimensional approximations of this LP in terms of semidefinite programs
(SDPs). The solution to each SDP yields a polynomial control policy and an
outer approximation of the largest achievable BRS. In contrast to traditional
Lyapunov based approaches which are non-convex and require feasible
initialization, our approach is convex and does not require any form of
initialization. The resulting time-varying controllers and approximated
reachable sets are well-suited for use in a trajectory library or feedback
motion planning algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our
approach on five nonlinear systems.
