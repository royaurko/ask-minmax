Physiological sensors are gaining the attention of manufacturers and users.
As denoted by devices such as smartwatches or the newly released Kinect 2 --
which can covertly measure heartbeats -- or by the popularity of smartphone
apps that track heart rate during fitness activities. Soon, physiological
monitoring could become widely accessible and transparent to users. We
demonstrate how one could take advantage of this situation to increase users'
engagement and enhance user experience in human-agent interaction. We created
an experimental protocol involving embodied agents -- "virtual avatars". Those
agents were displayed alongside a beating heart. We compared a condition in
which this feedback was simply duplicating the heart rates of users to another
condition in which it was set to an average heart rate. Results suggest a
superior social presence of agents when they display feedback similar to users'
internal state. This physiological "similarity-attraction" effect may lead,
with little effort, to a better acceptance of agents and robots by the general
public.
