Topological feedback entropy (TFE) was introduced in 2004 to measure the
intrinsic rate at which a continuous, fully observed, deterministic control
system generates information for controlled set-invariance. In this paper, we
generalise this notion in two directions, first to continuous, partially
observed systems and then to discontinuous, fully observed systems. In each
case, we show that the corresponding generalised TFE coincides with the the
smallest feedback bit rate that allows a form of controlled invariance to be
achieved.
