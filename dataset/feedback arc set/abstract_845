Feedback loops are major components of biochemical systems. Many systems show
multiple such (positive or negative) feedback loops. Nevertheless, very few
quantitative analyses address the question how such multiple feedback loops
evolved. Based on published models from the mitotic cycle in embryogenesis, we
build a few case studies. Using a simple core architecture (transcription,
phosphorylation and degradation), we define oscillatory models having either
one positive feedback or one negative feedback, or both loops. With these
models, we address the following questions about evolvability: could a system
evolve from a simple model to a more complex one with a continuous transition
in the parameter space? How do new feedback loops emerge without disrupting the
proper function of the system? Our results show that progressive formation of a
second feedback loop is possible without disturbing existing oscillatory
behavior. For this process, the parameters of the system have to change during
evolution to maintain predefined properties of oscillations like period and
amplitude.
