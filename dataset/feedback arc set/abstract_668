We compare two closed-loop beamforming algorithms, one based on singular
value decomposition (SVD) and the other based on equal diagonal QR
decomposition (QRS). SVD has the advantage of parallelizing the MIMO channel,
but each of the sub-channels has different gain. QRS has the advantage of
having equal diagonal value for the decomposed channel, but the subchannels are
not fully parallelized, hence requiring successive interference cancellation or
other techniques to perform decoding. We consider a closed-loop system where
the feedback information is a unitary beamforming matrix. Due to the discrete
and limited modulation set, SVD may have inferior performance to QRS when no
modulation set selection is performed. However, if the selection of modulation
set is performed optimally, we show that SVD can outperform QRS.
