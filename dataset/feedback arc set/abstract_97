Motion camouflage is a stealth strategy observed in nature. We formulate the
problem as a feedback system for particles moving at constant speed, and define
what it means for the system to be in a state of motion camouflage. (Here we
focus on the planar setting, although the results can be generalized to
three-dimensional motion.) We propose a biologically plausible feedback law,
and use a high-gain limit to prove accessibility of a motion camouflage state
in finite time. We discuss connections to work in missile guidance. We also
present simulation results to explore the performance of the motion camouflage
feedback law for a variety of settings.
