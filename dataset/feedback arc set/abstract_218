We study dismantling properties of the arc, disc and sphere graphs. We prove
that any finite subgroup H of the mapping class group of a surface with
punctures, the handlebody group, or Out(F_n) fixes a filling (resp. simple)
clique in the appropriate graph. We deduce realisation theorems, in particular
the Nielsen Realisation Problem in the case of a nonempty set of punctures. We
also prove that infinite H have either empty or contractible fixed point sets
in the corresponding complexes. Furthermore, we show that their spines are
classifying spaces for proper actions for mapping class groups and Out(F_n).
