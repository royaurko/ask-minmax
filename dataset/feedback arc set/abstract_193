While self-similar sets have no tangents at any single point, self-affine
curves can be smooth. We consider plane self-affine curves without double
points and with two pieces. There is an open subset of parameter space for
which the curve is differentiable at all points except for a countable set. For
a parameter set of codimension one, the curve is continuously differentiable.
However, there are no twice differentiable self-affine curves in the plane,
except for parabolic arcs.
