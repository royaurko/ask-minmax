We investigate the connection between the entropy of equilibrium measures and
game-theoretic equilibrium feedback operators in a multi-channel dynamical
system. Specifically, we show that the existence of an equilibrium measure,
which maximizes the free energy (i.e., the sum of the entropy and the integral
over a potential), is related to an equilibrium or "maximum entropy" state for
the multi-channel dynamical system that is composed with a set of feedback
operators. Further, we observe that such a connection makes sense when this set
of feedback operators strategically interacts over an infinite-horizon, in a
game-theoretic sense, using the current state-information of the system.
Finally, we briefly comment on the implication of our result to the resilient
behavior of the equilibrium feedback operators, when there is a random
perturbation in the system.
