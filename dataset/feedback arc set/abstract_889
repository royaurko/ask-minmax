Sopena in his survey [E. Sopena, The oriented chromatic number of graphs: A
short survey, preprint 2013] writes, without any proof, that an oriented cycle
$\vec C$ can be colored with three colors if and only if $\lambda(\vec C)=0$,
where $\lambda(\vec C)$ is the number of forward arcs minus the number of
backward arcs in $\vec C$. This is not true. In this paper we show that $\vec
C$ can be colored with three colors if and only if $\lambda(\vec C)=0(\bmod~3)$
or $\vec C$ does not contain three consecutive arcs going in the same
direction.
