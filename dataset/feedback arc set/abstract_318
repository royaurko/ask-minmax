In 1966, P. Guenther proved the following result: Given a continuous function
f on a compact surface M of constant curvature -1 and its periodic lift g to
the universal covering, the hyperbolic plane, then the averages of the lift g
over increasing spheres converge to the average of the function f over the
surface M. In this article, we prove similar results for functions on the
vertices and edges of regular and semiregular graphs, with special emphasis on
the convergence rate. We also consider averages over more general sets like
arcs, tubes and horocycles.
