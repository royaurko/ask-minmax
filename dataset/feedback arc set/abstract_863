In 1974, J. Thas constructed a new class of maximal arcs for the Desarguesian
plane of order $q^2$. The construction relied upon the existence of a regular
spread of tangent lines to an ovoid in $\PG(3,q)$ and, in particular, it does
apply to the Suzuki--Tits ovoid. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for
obtaining a possible representation of such arcs in $\PG(2,q^2)$.
