A variational principle is further developed for out of equilibrium dynamical
systems by using the concept of maximum entropy. With this new formulation it
is obtained a set of two first-order differential equations, revealing the same
formal symplectic structure shared by classical mechanics, fluid mechanics and
thermodynamics. In particular, it is obtained an extended equation of motion
for a rotating dynamical system, from where it emerges a kind of topological
torsion current of the form $\epsilon_{ijk} A_j \omega_k$, with $A_j$ and
$\omega_k$ denoting components of the vector potential (gravitational or/and
electromagnetic) and $\omega$ is the angular velocity of the accelerated frame.
In addition, it is derived a special form of Umov-Poynting's theorem for
rotating gravito-electromagnetic systems, and obtained a general condition of
equilibrium for a rotating plasma. The variational method is then applied to
clarify the working mechanism of some particular devices, such as the Bennett
pinch and vacuum arcs, to calculate the power extraction from an hurricane, and
to discuss the effect of transport angular momentum on the radiactive heating
of planetary atmospheres. This development is seen to be advantageous and opens
options for systematic improvements.
