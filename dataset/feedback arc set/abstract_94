We study the problem of feedback control for skew-symmetric and
skew-Hamiltonian transfer functions using skew-symmetric controllers. This
extends work of Helmke, et al., who studied static symmetric feedback control
of symmetric and Hamiltonian linear systems. We identify spaces of linear
systems with symmetry as natural subvarieties of the moduli space of rational
curves in a Grassmannian, give necessary and sufficient conditions for pole
placement by static skew-symmetric complex feedback, and use Schubert calculus
for the orthogonal Grassmannian to count the number of complex feedback laws
when there are finitely many of them. Finally, we also construct a real
skew-symmetric linear system with only real feedback for any set of real poles.
