We report the discovery with the Keck telescope of two new multiply-imaged
arcs in the luminous X-ray cluster A2219 ($z=0.225$). The brighter arc in the
field is red and we use spectroscopic and photometric information to identify
it as a $z \sim 1$ moderately star-forming system. The brightness of this arc
implies that it is formed from two merging images of the background source, and
we identify possible candidates for the third image of this source. The second
giant arc in this cluster is blue, and while fainter than the red arc it has a
similarly large angular extent (32 arcsec). This arc comprises three images of
a single nucleated source -- the relative parities of the three images are
discernible in our best resolution images. The presence of several bright
multiply imaged arcs in a single cluster allows detailed modelling of the
cluster mass distribution, especially when redshift information is available.
We present a lensing model of the cluster which explains the properties of the
various arcs, and we contrast this model with the optical and X-ray information
available on the cluster. We uncover significant differences between the
distributions of mass and X-ray gas in the cluster. We suggest that such
discrepancies may indicate an on-going merger event in the cluster core,
possibly associated with a group around the second brightest cluster member.
The preponderance of similar merger signatures in a large fraction of the
moderate redshift clusters would indicate their dynamical immaturity.
