Feedback from quasars and AGNs is being invoked frequently in several
cosmological settings. Currently, order of magnitude, or more, uncertainties in
the structure of both the wind and the 'obscuring torus' make predictions
highly uncertain. To make testable models of this 'cosmological feedback' it is
essential to understand the detailed structure of AGNs sufficiently well to
predict their properties for the whole quasar population, at all redshifts.
Progress in both areas is rapid, and I describe the near-term prospects for
reducing these uncertainties for 'slow' (non-relativistic) AGN winds and the
obscuring torus.
