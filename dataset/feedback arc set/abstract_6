In this paper, we give a definition of volume for subsets in the space of
arcs of an algebraic variety, and study its properties. Our main result relates
the volume of a set of arcs on a Cohen-Macaulay variety to its jet-codimension,
a notion which generalizes the codimension of a cylinder in the arc space of a
smooth variety.
