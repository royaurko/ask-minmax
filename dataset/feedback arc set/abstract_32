If the COBE detection of CMB fluctuations is used to normalize the power
spectrum of primordial density fluctuations in a cold dark matter--dominated
universe, early reionization is likely to result in a substantial diminution of
primordial temperature fluctuations on degree scales. I argue that the
reionization may be non--Gaussian because of feedback effects. Secondary
fluctuations on arc--minute scales provide an important probe of the efficiency
of rescattering.
