In "Tunnel one, fibered links", the second contributor showed that the tunnel of a
tunnel number one, fibered link can be isotoped to lie as a properly embedded
arc in the fiber surface of the link. In this paper, we analyze how the arc
behaves under the monodromy action, and show that the tunnel arc is nearly
clean, with the possible exception of twisting around the boundary of the
fiber.
