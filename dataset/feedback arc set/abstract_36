This paper gives a map from the set of families of arcs on a variety to the
set of valuations on the rational function field of the variety We characterize
a family of arcs which corresponds to a divisorial valuation by this map. We
can see that both the Nash map and a certain McKay correspondence are the
restrictions of this map. This paper also gives the affirmative answer to the
Nash problem for a non-normal variety in a certain category. As a corollary, we
get the affirmative answer for a non-normal toric variety.
