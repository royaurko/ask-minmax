In this paper we study the effect of rate-limited feedback on the sum-rate
capacity of the deterministic interference channel. We characterize the
sum-rate capacity of this channel in the symmetric case and show that having
feedback links can increase the sum-rate capacity by at most the rate of the
available feedback. Our proof includes a novel upper-bound on the sum-rate
capacity and a set of new achievability strategies.
