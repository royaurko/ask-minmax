In this article we study the dynamics of coupled oscillators. We use
mechanical metronomes that are placed over a rigid base. The base moves by a
motor in a one-dimensional direction and the movements of the base follow some
functions of the phases of the metronomes (in other words, it is controlled to
move according to a provided function). Because of the motor and the feedback,
the phases of the metronomes affect the movements of the base while on the
other hand, when the base moves, it affects the phases of the metronomes in
return.
  For a simple function for the base movement (such as $y = \gamma_{x} [r
\theta_1 + (1 - r) \theta_2]$ in which $y$ is the velocity of the base,
$\gamma_{x}$ is a multiplier, $r$ is a proportion and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$
are phases of the metronomes), we show the effects on the dynamics of the
oscillators. Then we study how this function changes in time when its
parameters adapt by a feedback. By numerical simulations and experimental
tests, we show that the dynamic of the set of oscillators and the base tends to
evolve towards a certain region. This region is close to a transition in
dynamics of the oscillators; where more frequencies start to appear in the
frequency spectra of the phases of the metronomes.
