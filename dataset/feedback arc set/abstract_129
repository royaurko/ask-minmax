We perform a comprehensive study of stability of a pumped atom laser in the
presence of pumping, damping and outcoupling. We also introduce a realistic
feedback scheme to improve stability by extracting energy from the condensate
and determine its effectiveness. We find that while the feedback scheme is
highly efficient in reducing condensate fluctuations, it usually does not alter
the stability class of a particular set of pumping, damping and outcoupling
parameters.
