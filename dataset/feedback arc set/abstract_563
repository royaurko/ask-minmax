Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) and Clock with Adaptive Replacement (CAR)
are state-of-the-art "adaptive" cache replacement algorithms invented to
improve on the shortcomings of classical cache replacement policies such as LRU
and Clock. Both ARC and CAR have been shown to outperform their classical and
popular counterparts in practice. However, for over a decade, no theoretical
proof of the competitiveness of ARC and CAR is known. We prove that for a cache
of size N, (a) ARC is 4N-competitive, and (b) CAR is 21N-competitive, thus
proving that no "pathological" worst-case request sequence exists that could
make them perform much worse than LRU.
