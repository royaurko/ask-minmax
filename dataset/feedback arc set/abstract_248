It was shown by several contributors that closed high pressure arc a.c. discharge
in mercury vapors with addition of metal halide cannot be described in frames
of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model. However some plasma
parameters (electron and high lying excited states densities as well as Hg
metastable levels densities) are assumed to be in equilibrium with electron
temperature and these assumptions are applied in plasma diagnostics. To verify
these supposition the method of local plasma spectroscopy based on spatial and
temporal distribution of spectral line profiles was developed. The experimental
set up is based on diffraction spectrometer with large aperture, spatial
scanning device and photodetector, which allows to carry out the measurements
in chosen phases of current period. The software for data acquisition and
processing is based on LabVIEW system. The original method of joint data
processing was applied to data arrays containing spatial, spectral and temporal
distribution of a source surface radiance. The method is based on principal
component theory, it takes into account the correlation between spectral
emissivities inside spectral line profiles and allows ...
