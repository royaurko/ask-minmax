Boolean-width is a recently introduced graph parameter. Many problems are
fixed parameter tractable when parametrized by boolean-width, for instance
"Minimum Weighted Dominating Set" (MWDS) problem can be solved in $O^*(2^{3k})$
time given a boolean-decomposition of width $k$, hence for all graph classes
where a boolean-decomposition of width $O(\log n)$ can be found in polynomial
time, MWDS can be solved in polynomial time. We study graph classes having
boolean-width $O(\log n)$ and problems solvable in $O^*(2^{O(k)})$, combining
these two results to design polynomial algorithms. We show that for trapezoid
graphs, circular permutation graphs, convex graphs, Dilworth-$k$ graphs,
circular arc graphs and complements of $k$-degenerate graphs,
boolean-decompositions of width $O(\log n)$ can be found in polynomial time. We
also show that circular $k$-trapezoid graphs have boolean-width $O(\log n)$,
and find such a decomposition if a circular $k$-trapezoid intersection model is
given. For many of the graph classes we also prove that they contain graphs of
boolean-width $\Theta(\log n)$.
  Further we apply the results from \cite{boolw2} to give a new polynomial time
algorithm solving all vertex partitioning problems introduced by Proskurowski
and Telle \cite{TP97}. This extends previous results by Kratochv\'il, Manuel
and Miller \cite{KMM95} showing that a large subset of the vertex partitioning
problems are polynomial solvable on interval graphs.
