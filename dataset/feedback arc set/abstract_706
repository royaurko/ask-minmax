We study, both analytically and numerically, an ARCH-like, multiscale model
of volatility, which assumes that the volatility is governed by the observed
past price changes on different time scales. With a power-law distribution of
time horizons, we obtain a model that captures most stylized facts of financial
time series: Student-like distribution of returns with a power-law tail,
long-memory of the volatility, slow convergence of the distribution of returns
towards the Gaussian distribution, multifractality and anomalous volatility
relaxation after shocks. At variance with recent multifractal models that are
strictly time reversal invariant, the model also reproduces the time assymmetry
of financial time series: past large scale volatility influence future small
scale volatility. In order to quantitatively reproduce all empirical
observations, the parameters must be chosen such that our model is close to an
instability, meaning that (a) the feedback effect is important and
substantially increases the volatility, and (b) that the model is intrinsically
difficult to calibrate because of the very long range nature of the
correlations. By imposing the consistency of the model predictions with a large
set of different empirical observations, a reasonable range of the parameters
value can be determined. The model can easily be generalized to account for
jumps, skewness and multiasset correlations.
