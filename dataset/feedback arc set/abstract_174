We study the effects of Supernova (SN) feedback on the formation of disc
galaxies. For that purpose we run simulations using the extended version of the
code GADGET-2 which includes a treatment of chemical and energy feedback by SN
explosions. We found that our model succeeds in setting a self-regulated star
formation process since an important fraction of the cold gas from the center
of the haloes is efficiently heated up and transported outwards. The impact of
SN feedback on galactic systems is also found to depend on virial mass: smaller
systems are more strongly affected with star formation histories in which
several starbursts can develop. Our implementation of SN feedback is also
successful in producing violent outflows of chemical enriched material.
