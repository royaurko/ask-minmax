We describe a Thompson-like group of homeomorphisms of the Basilica Julia
set. Each element of this group acts as a piecewise-linear homeomorphism of the
unit circle that preserves the invariant lamination for the Basilica. We
develop an analogue of tree pair diagrams for this group which we call arc pair
diagrams, and we use these diagrams to prove that the group is finitely
generated. We also prove that the group is virtually simple.
