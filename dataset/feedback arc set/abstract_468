Almost sure asymptotic stabilization of a discrete-time switched stochastic
system is investigated. Information on the active operation mode of the
switched system is assumed to be available for control purposes only at random
time instants. We propose a stabilizing feedback control framework that
utilizes the information obtained through mode observations. We first consider
the case where stochastic properties of mode observation instants are fully
known. We obtain sufficient asymptotic stabilization conditions for the
closed-loop switched stochastic system under our proposed control law. We then
explore the case where exact knowledge of the stochastic properties of mode
observation instants is not available. We present a set of alternative
stabilization conditions for this case. The results for both cases are
predicated on the analysis of a sequence-valued process that encapsulates the
stochastic nature of the evolution of active operation mode between mode
observation instants. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our results with
numerical examples.
