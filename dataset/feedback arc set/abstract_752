Information-theoretic fundamental limitation in feedback control system is an
important topic for decades. In this paper, a new bode-like fundamental
inequality in causal feedback control system is developed. This inequality
relates directed information, mutual information and bode sensitivity
functions. This inequality recovers previous known results in feedback system
as special cases.
