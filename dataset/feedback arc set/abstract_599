We study the weighted boundedness of the Cauchy singular integral operator
$S_\Gm$ in Morrey spaces $L^{p,\lambda}(\Gm)$ on curves satisfying the
arc-chord condition, for a class of "radial type" almost monotonic weights. The
non-weighted boundedness is shown to hold on an arbitrary Carleson curve. We
show that the weighted boundedness is reduced to the boundedness of weighted
Hardy operators in Morrey spaces $L^{p,\lambda}(0,\ell), \ell>0$. We find
conditions for weighted Hardy operators to be bounded in Morrey spaces. To
cover the case of curves we also extend the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood
maximal operator in Morrey spaces, known in the Euclidean setting, to the case
of Carleson curves.
