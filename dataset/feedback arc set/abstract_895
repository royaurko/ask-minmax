We study the relation between the geometric properties of a
quasicircle~$\Gamma$ and the complex dilatation~$\mu$ of a quasiconformal
mapping that maps the real line onto~$\Gamma$. Denoting by~$S$ the Beurling
transform, we characterize Bishop-Jones quasicircles in terms of the
boundedness of the operator~$(I-\mu S)$ on a particular weighted $L^2$~space,
and chord-arc curves in terms of its invertibility. As an application we
recover the~$L^2$ boundedness of the Cauchy integral on chord-arc curves.
