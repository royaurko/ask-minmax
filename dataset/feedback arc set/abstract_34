A digraph X=(V, E) is max-\lambda, if \lambda(X)=\delta(X). A digraph X is
super-\lambda if every minimum cut of X is either the set of inarcs of some
vertex or the set of outarcs of some vertex. In this paper, we will prove that
for all but a few exceptions, the strongly connected mixed Cayley digraphs are
max-\lambda and super-\lambda.
