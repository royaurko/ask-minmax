We use Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) to study the
relationship between the pseudogap, pairing and Fermi arcs in cuprates. High
quality data measured over a wide range of dopings reveals a consistent picture
of Fermiology and pairing in these materials. The pseudogap is due to an
ordered state that competes with superconductivity rather then preformed pairs.
Pairing does occur below Tpair~150K and significantly above Tc, but well below
T* and the doping dependence of this temperature scale is distinct from that of
the pseudogap. The d-wave gap is present below Tpair, and its interplay with
strong scattering creates "artificial" Fermi arcs for Tc<T<Tpair. However,
above Tpair, the pseudogap exists only at the antipodal region. This leads to
presence of real, gapless Fermi arcs close to the node. The length of these
arcs remains constant up to T*, where the full Fermi surface is recovered. We
demonstrate that these findings resolve a number of seemingly contradictory
scenarios.
