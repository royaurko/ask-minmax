We review theoretical models of Population III.1 star formation, focusing on
the protostellar feedback processes that are expected to terminate accretion
and thus set the mass of these stars. We discuss how dark matter annihilation
may modify this standard feedback scenario. Then, under the assumption that
dark matter annihilation is unimportant, we predict the mass of stars forming
in 12 cosmological minihalos produced in independent numerical simulations.
This allows us to make a simple estimate of the Pop III.1 initial mass function
and how it may evolve with redshift.
