We propose an encoding and control strategy for the stabilization of switched
systems with limited information, supposing the controller is given for each
mode. Only the quantized output and the active mode of the plant at each
sampling time are transmitted to the controller. Due to switching, the active
mode of the plant may be different from that of the controller in the
closed-loop system. Hence if switching occurs, the quantizer must recalculate a
bounded set containing the estimation error for quantization at the next
sampling time. We establish the global asymptotic stability under a
slow-switching assumption on dwell time and average dwell time. To this end, we
construct multiple discrete-time Lyapunov functions with respect to the
estimated state and the size of the bounded set.
