The CDOI outcome measure - a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument
utilizing direct client feedback - was implemented in a large, real-world
behavioral healthcare setting in order to evaluate previous findings from
smaller controlled studies. PROs provide an alternative window into treatment
effectiveness based on client perception and facilitate detection of
problems/symptoms for which there is no discernible measure (e.g. pain). The
principal focus of the study was to evaluate the utility of the CDOI for
predictive modeling of outcomes in a live clinical setting. Implementation
factors were also addressed within the framework of the Theory of Planned
Behavior by linking adoption rates to implementation practices and clinician
perceptions. The results showed that the CDOI does contain significant capacity
to predict outcome delta over time based on baseline and early change scores in
a large, real-world clinical setting, as suggested in previous research. The
implementation analysis revealed a number of critical factors affecting
successful implementation and adoption of the CDOI outcome measure, though
there was a notable disconnect between clinician intentions and actual
behavior. Most importantly, the predictive capacity of the CDOI underscores the
utility of direct client feedback measures such as PROs and their potential use
as the basis for next generation clinical decision support tools and
personalized treatment approaches.
