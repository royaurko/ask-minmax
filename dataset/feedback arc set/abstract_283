We consider the time-correlated multiple-antenna interference channel where
the transmitters have (i) delayed channel state information (CSI) obtained from
a latency-prone feedback channel as well as (ii) imperfect current CSIT,
obtained e.g. from prediction on the basis of these past channel samples. We
derive the degrees of freedom (DoF) region for the two-user multiple-antenna
interference channel under such conditions. The proposed DoF achieving scheme
exploits a particular combination of the space-time alignment protocol designed
for fully outdated CSIT feedback channels (initially developed for the
broadcast channel by Maddah-Ali et al, later extended to the interference
channel by Vaze et al. and Ghasemi et al.) together with the use of simple
zero-forcing (ZF) precoders. The essential ingredient lies in the quantization
and feedback of the residual interference left after the application of the
initial imperfect ZF precoder. Our focus is on the MISO setting albeit
extensions to certain MIMO cases are also considered.
