A Morse 2-function is a generic map from a manifold M of arbitrary finite
dimension to a surface B. Its critical set is a smooth 1-submanifold of M that
maps to an immersed collection of circles and (in the case that M and B are
closed with nonempty boundary) properly embedded arcs in B. The aim of this
paper is to explain exactly when it is possible to move these circles around in
B and to give a few examples when M is a closed 4-manifold.
