We report on a significant improvement of the classical time-delayed feedback
control method for stabilization of unstable periodic orbits or steady states.
In an electronic circuit experiment we were able to realize time-varying and
distributed delays in the control force leading to successful control for large
parameter sets including large time delays. The presented technique makes
advanced use of the natural torsion of the orbits, which is also necessary for
the original control method to work.
