We study arc spaces and jet schemes of generic determinantal varieties. Using
the natural group action, we decompose the arc spaces into orbits, and analyze
their structure. This allows us to compute the number of irreducible components
of jet schemes, log canonical thresholds, and topological zeta functions.
