We establish Luzin $N$ and Morse-Sard properties for $BV_2$-functions defined
on open domains in the plane. Using these results we prove that almost all
level sets are finite disjoint unions of Lipschitz arcs whose tangent vectors
are of bounded variation. In the case of $W^{2,1}$-functions we strengthen the
conclusion and show that almost all level sets are finite disjoint unions of
$C^1$-arcs whose tangent vectors are absolutely continuous.
