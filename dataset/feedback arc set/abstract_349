We study the expected properties and statistics of giant arcs produced by
galaxy clusters in a LambdaCDM universe and investigate how the characteristics
of CDM clusters determine the properties of the arcs they generate. Due to the
triaxiality and substructure of CDM halos, the giant arc cross section for
individual clusters varies by more than an order of magnitude as a function of
viewing angle. In addition, the shallow density cusps and triaxiality of CDM
clusters cause systematic alignments of giant arcs which should be testable
with larger samples from forthcoming lensing surveys. We compute the predicted
statistics of giant arcs for the LambdaCDM model and compare to results from
previous surveys. The predicted arc statistics are in excellent agreement with
the numbers of giant arcs observed around low redshift (0.2 < z < 0.6) clusters
from the EMSS sample, however there are hints of a possible excess of arcs
observed around high redshift z > 0.6 clusters. This excess, if real, appears
to be due to the presence of highly massive or concentrated clusters at high
redshifts.
