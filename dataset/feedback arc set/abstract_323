We study the non-uniqueness sets for solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation
in 1 space dimension, for solutions whose Fourier transform is a finite complex
measure absolutely continuous with respect to arc length. We show that
generally, in the non-unique case for lattice-crosses, the space of solutions
that vanish there is infinite-dimensional.
