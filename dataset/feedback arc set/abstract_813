Using events in which one of two neutral B mesons from the decay of an Y(4S)
resonance is fully reconstructed, we set limits on the lifetime difference
between the two neutral-B mass eigenstates and on CP, T, and CPT violation in
B0-B0bar mixing. Both CP and non-CP eigenstates were obtained from the 88
million Y(4S)->B0B0bar decays collected between 1999 and 2002 with the BABAR
detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy B-Factory at SLAC. We determine six
independent parameters governing mixing (dm, dGamma/Gamma), CPT/CP violation
(Re(z), Im(z)), and CP/T violation (Im\lambda(CP), |q/p|), where \lambda(CP)
characterizes B0 and B0bar decays to states of charmonium plus K_S or K_L. The
preliminary results are: sgn(Re\lambda(CP))*dGamma/Gamma =
-0.008+-0.037(stat)+-0.018(syst) [-0.084,0.068], |q/p| =
1.029+-0.013(stat)+-0.011(syst) [1.001,1.057],
(Re\lambda(CP)/|\lambda(CP)|)*Rez = 0.014+-0.035(stat)+-0.034(syst)
[-0.072,0.101], Imz = 0.038+-0.029(stat)+-0.025(syst) [-0.028,0.104] . The
values inside square brackets indicate the 90% confidence-level intervals. For
Im\lambda(CP)/|\lambda(CP)| and dm we find values consistent with recent
results from other analyses. These results are consistent with Standard Model
expectations.
