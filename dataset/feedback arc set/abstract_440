In many simulation studies involving networks there is the need to rely on a
sample network to perform the simulation experiments. In many cases, real
network data is not available due to privacy concerns. In that case we can
recourse to synthetic data sets with similar properties to the real data. In
this paper we discuss the problem of generating synthetic data sets for a
certain kind of online social network, for simulation purposes. Some popular
online social networks, such as LinkedIn and ResearchGate, allow user
endorsements for specific skills. For each particular skill, the endorsements
give rise to a directed subgraph of the corresponding network, where the nodes
correspond to network members or users, and the arcs represent endorsement
relations. Modelling these endorsement digraphs can be done by formulating an
optimization problem, which is amenable to different heuristics. Our
construction method consists of two stages: The first one simulates the growth
of the network, and the second one solves the aforementioned optimization
problem to construct the endorsements.
