In 1966, P. G\"unther proved the following result: Given a continuous
function $f$ on a compact surface $M$ of constant curvature -1 and its periodic
lift $\tilde{f}$ to the universal covering, the hyperbolic plane, then the
averages of the lift $\tilde{f}$ over increasing spheres converge to the
average of the function $f$ over the surface $M$. In this article, we prove
similar results for functions on the vertices and edges of regular and
semiregular graphs, with special emphasis on the convergence rate. However, we
consider averages over more general sets, namely spherical arcs, which in turn
imply results for tubes and horocycles as well as spheres.
