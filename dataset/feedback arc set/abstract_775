We consider multipoint Pad\'e approximation to Cauchy transforms of complex
measures. We show that if the support of a measure is an analytic Jordan arc
and if the measure itself is absolutely continuous with respect to the
equilibrium distribution of that arc with Dini-smooth non-vanishing density,
then the diagonal multipoint Pad\'e approximants associated with appropriate
interpolation schemes converge locally uniformly to the approximated Cauchy
transform in the complement of the arc. This asymptotic behavior of Pad\'e
approximants is deduced from the analysis of underlying non-Hermitian
orthogonal polynomials, for which we use classical properties of Hankel and
Toeplitz operators on smooth curves. A construction of the appropriate
interpolation schemes is explicit granted the parametrization of the arc.
