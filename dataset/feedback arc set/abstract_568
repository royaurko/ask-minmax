COMPASS is an on-axis 2.6 meter telescope coupled to a correlation
polarimeter operating at a wavelength of 1 cm. The entire instrument was built
specifically for CMB polarization studies. We report here on observations of
February 2001 - April 2001 using this system. We set an upper limit on E-mode
polarized anisotropies of 33.5 uK (95% confidence limit) in the l-range
200-600.
