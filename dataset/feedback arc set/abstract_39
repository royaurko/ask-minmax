The boundaries of the hyperbolic components of odd period of the multicorns
contain real-analytic arcs consisting of quasi-conformally conjugate parabolic
parameters. The principal result of this paper asserts that the Hausdorff
dimension of the Julia sets is a real-analytic function of the parameter along
these parabolic arcs. This is achieved by constructing a complex
one-dimensional quasiconformal deformation space of the parabolic arcs which
are contained in the dynamically defined algebraic curves $\mathrm{Per}_n(1)$.
  As another application of this deformation step, we show that the dynamically
natural parametrization of the parabolic arcs has a non-vanishing derivative at
all but (possibly) finitely many points. An appendix deals with some more
general examples of the algebraic sets $\mathrm{Per}_n(1)$ (in various families
of polynomials), the nature of their singularities, and the `dynamical'
behavior of these singular parameters.
