We analyze the global temperature change due to the Mt. Pinatubo eruption
using a simple two-layer model of the atmosphere and surface to obtain results
consistent with satellite data. Through analytic and numerical analysis we find
a principal characteristic response time of 5 to 8 months and a climate
sensitivity of 0.17 to 0.20 C/(W/m^2), corresponding to a negative
instantaneous feedback. Our solutions were fit to the data, reproducing the
results of a one-box model, and providing somewhat more detailed information
about the feedbacks related to surface layer temperature. The formalism for
coupling of the surface layer to the thermocline is set up but not applied.
