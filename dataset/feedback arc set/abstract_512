We have performed a set of high resolution, three dimensional simulations of
a jetted AGN embedded in a relaxed cooling cluster. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first simulation to include both full jet dynamics and
a feedback model. These ideal hydrodynamic simulations show that, although
there is enough energy present to offset cooling on average, the jet heating is
not spatially deposited in a way that can prevent catastrophic cooling of the
cluster.
