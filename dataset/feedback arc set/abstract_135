It was recently shown that the use of feedback control can improve the
performance of a flashing ratchet. We investigate the effect of a time delay in
the implementation of feedback control in a closed-loop collective flashing
ratchet, using Langevin dynamics simulations. Surprisingly, for a large
ensemble, a well-chosen delay time improves the ratchet performance by allowing
the system to synchronize into a quasi-periodic stable mode of oscillation that
reproduces the optimal average velocity for a periodically flashing ratchet.
For a small ensemble, on the other hand, finite delay times significantly
reduce the benefit of feedback control for the time-averaged velocity, because
the relevance of information decays on a time scale set by the diffusion time
of the particles. Based on these results, we establish that experimental use of
feedback control is realistic.
