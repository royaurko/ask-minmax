We propose an improved beamforming matrix compression by Givens Rotation with
the use of variable feedback rate. The variable feedback rate means that the
number of bits used to represent the quantized beamforming matrix is based on
the value of the matrix. Compared with the fixed feedback rate scheme, the
proposed method has better performance without additional feedback bandwidth.
