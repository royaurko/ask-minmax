The temperature at the chemical freeze-out and at zero baryochemical
potential has been extracted in a global analysis of $e^+e^-$, $p+p$, $p+
\overline{p}$ and $A+A$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=2-1800 GeV per N+N pair. We
demonstrate that the temperature at $\mu_B$=0, rises with the initial energy
density $\epsilon_i$, and saturates above $\epsilon_i$ $\sim$ 1 GeV/fm$^3$.
This behaviour is interpreted as mapping out the QCD phase transition
universally in particle and nuclear collisions. The critical energy density is
therefore identified to be $\epsilon_{crit}$ $\sim$ 1 $\pm$ 0.3 GeV/fm$^3$. We
show that strange particles at $\mu_B$=0, are not significantly enhanced in A+A
collisions as compared to $p+ \overline{p}$. The so called 'strangeness
suppression factor' ($\lambda_s = \frac{(2 \overline{s})} {(\overline{u} +
\overline{d})}$) as a function of $\epsilon_i$ is following the temperature,
rising and saturating universally above $\epsilon_{crit}$. This leads to a
reinterpretation of strangeness enhancement as QGP signature. Within this
interpretation the experimental puzzles with respect to strangeness production
can be naturally explained: e.g. the recent measured maximum of $K^+/\pi^+$ in
Pb+Pb collisions at 40 A GeV, is explained as due to $\mu_B$. We discuss under
which conditions 'strangeness enhancement' and '$J/\Psi$ suppresion' both set
in at $\epsilon_{crit}$ $\sim$ 1 GeV/fm$^3$.
