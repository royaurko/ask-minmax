We introduce a construction of highly arc transitive digraphs using a
layerwise direct product. This product generalizes some known classes of highly
arc transitive digraphs but also allows to construct new such. We use the
product to obtain counterexamples to a conjecture by Cameron, Praeger and
Wormald on the structure of certain highly arc transitive digraphs.
