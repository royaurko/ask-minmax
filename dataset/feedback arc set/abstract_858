Spectral weight is investigated for metallic diagonal stripe state in two
dimensional Hubbard model, and Fermi arc observed by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy on LSCO is discussed. The Fermi arc coming from the
mid-gap state of diagonal stripe appears near $(\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$
and equivalent position in the reciprocal space, and the gap opens below the
mid-gap state. We show how these spectral weight structure depends on the
phasing of stripes, i.e., site-centered or bond-centered stripes.
