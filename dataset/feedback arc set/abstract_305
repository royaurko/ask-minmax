Hydrodynamical SPH simulations of galaxy clusters are used to investigate the
metal enrichment of the intracluster medium. The final metallicity abundances
of the simulated clusters are determined according to the numerical resolution
and a number of model parameters. For a fiducial set of model prescriptions the
results of the simulations indicate iron abundances in broad agreement with
data. Final X-ray properties are not sensitive to the heating of the ICM. This
supports a scenario where the ICM evolution of cool clusters is driven by
radiative cooling.
