We present a new approach to enhancing Answer Set Programming (ASP) with
Constraint Processing techniques which allows for solving interesting
Constraint Satisfaction Problems in ASP. We show how constraints on finite
domains can be decomposed into logic programs such that unit-propagation
achieves arc, bound or range consistency. Experiments with our encodings
demonstrate their computational impact.
