The layered two-hop, two-flow interference network is considered that
consists of two sources, two relays and two destinations with the first hop
network between he sources and the relays and the second hop network between
relays and destinations both being i.i.d. Rayleigh fading Gaussian interference
channels. Two feedback models are studied. In the first one, called the delayed
channel state information at the sources (delayed CSI-S) model, the sources
know all channel coefficients with a finite delay but the relays have no side
information whatsoever. In the second feedback model, referred to as the
limited Shannon feedback model, the relays know first hop channel coefficients
instantaneously and the second hop channel with a finite delay and one relay
knows the received signal of one of the destinations with a finite delay and
the other relay knows the received signal of the other destination with a
finite delay but there is no side information at the sources whatsoever. It is
shown in this paper that under both these settings, the layered two-hop,
two-flow interference channel has 4/3 degrees of freedom. The result is
obtained by developing a broadcast-channel-type upper-bound and new
achievability schemes based on the ideas of retrospective interference
alignment and retro-cooperative interference alignment, respectively.
