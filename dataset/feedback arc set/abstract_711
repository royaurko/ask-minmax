We address the problem of universal communications over an unknown channel
with an instantaneous noiseless feedback, and show how rates corresponding to
the empirical behavior of the channel can be attained, although no rate can be
guaranteed in advance. First, we consider a discrete modulo-additive channel
with alphabet $\mathcal{X}$, where the noise sequence $Z^n$ is arbitrary and
unknown and may causally depend on the transmitted and received sequences and
on the encoder's message, possibly in an adversarial fashion. Although the
classical capacity of this channel is zero, we show that rates approaching the
empirical capacity $\log|\mathcal{X}|-H_{emp}(Z^n)$ can be universally
attained, where $H_{emp}(Z^n)$ is the empirical entropy of $Z^n$. For the more
general setting where the channel can map its input to an output in an
arbitrary unknown fashion subject only to causality, we model the empirical
channel actions as the modulo-addition of a realized noise sequence, and show
that the same result applies if common randomness is available. The results are
proved constructively, by providing a simple sequential transmission scheme
approaching the empirical capacity. In part II of this work we demonstrate how
even higher rates can be attained by using more elaborate models for channel
actions, and by utilizing possible empirical dependencies in its behavior.
