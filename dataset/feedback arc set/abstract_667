We show that biological networks with serial regulation (each node regulated
by at most one other node) are constrained to {\it direct functionality}, in
which the sign of the effect of an environmental input on a target species
depends only on the direct path from the input to the target, even when there
is a feedback loop allowing for multiple interaction pathways. Using a
stochastic model for a set of small transcriptional regulatory networks that
have been studied experimentally, we further find that all networks can achieve
all functions permitted by this constraint under reasonable settings of
biochemical parameters. This underscores the functional versatility of the
networks.
