Graph constraint logic is a framework introduced by Hearn and Demaine, which
provides several problems that are often a convenient starting point for
reductions. We study the parameterized complexity of Constraint Graph
Satisfiability and both bounded and unbounded versions of Nondeterministic
Constraint Logic (NCL) with respect to solution length, treewidth and maximum
degree of the underlying constraint graph as parameters. As a main result we
show that restricted NCL remains PSPACE-complete on graphs of bounded
bandwidth, strengthening Hearn and Demaine's framework. This allows us to
improve upon existing results obtained by reduction from NCL. We show that
reconfiguration versions of several classical graph problems (including
independent set, feedback vertex set and dominating set) are PSPACE-complete on
planar graphs of bounded bandwidth and that Rush Hour, generalized to $k\times
n$ boards, is PSPACE-complete even when $k$ is at most a constant.
