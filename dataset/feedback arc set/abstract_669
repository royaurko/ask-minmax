We explore similarities and differences in recent works on blind interference
alignment under different models such as staggered block fading model and the
delayed CSIT model. In particular we explore the possibility of achieving
interference alignment with delayed CSIT when the transmitters are distributed.
Our main contribution is an interference alignment scheme, called retrospective
interference alignment in this work, that is specialized to settings with
distributed transmitters. With this scheme we show that the 2 user X channel
with only delayed channel state information at the transmitters can achieve 8/7
DoF, while the interference channel with 3 users is able to achieve 9/8 DoF. We
also consider another setting where delayed channel output feedback is
available to transmitters. In this setting the X channel and the 3 user
interference channel are shown to achieve 4/3 and 6/5 DoF, respectively.
