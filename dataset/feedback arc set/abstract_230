We formulate and analyze a three-dimensional model of motion camouflage, a
stealth strategy observed in nature. A high-gain feedback law for motion
camouflage is formulated in which the pursuer and evader trajectories are
described using natural Frenet frames (or relatively parallel adapted frames),
and the corresponding natural curvatures serve as controls. The biological
plausibility of the feedback law is discussed, as is its connection to missile
guidance. Simulations illustrating motion camouflage are also presented. This
paper builds on recent work on motion camouflage in the planar setting [1].
