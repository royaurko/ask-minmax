Circular arc graphs are graphs whose vertices can be represented as arcs on a
circle such that any two vertices are adjacent if and only if their
corresponding arcs intersect. Proper circular arc graphs are graphs which have
a circular arc representation where no arc is completely contained in any other
arc. Hadwiger's conjecture states that if a graph $G$ has chromatic number $k$,
then a complete graph of $k$ vertices is a minor of $G$. We prove Hadwiger's
conjecture for proper circular arc graphs.
