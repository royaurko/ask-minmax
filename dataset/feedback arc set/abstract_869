The one-particle spectral function of a state formed by superconducting (SC)
clusters is studied via Monte Carlo techniques. The clusters have similar SC
amplitudes but randomly distributed phases. This state is stabilized by the
competition with anti-ferromagnetism, after quenched disorder is introduced.
Fermi arcs between the critical temperature Tc and the cluster formation
temperature scale T* are observed, similarly as in the pseudo-gap state of the
cuprates. The arcs originate at metallic regions in between the neighboring
clusters that present large SC phase differences.
