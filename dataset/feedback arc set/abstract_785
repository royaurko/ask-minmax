The Einstein-Gordon equations for Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometries
in feedback reaction with the quartically self-interacting physical field,
arisen from the "inner parity" spontaneous breaking, are explicitly formulated.
The Hamiltonian density non-positive extrema would classically forbid both
spatially closed and flat homogeneous and isotropic worlds if these were to
allow the physical field to (repeatedly) go through and to (finally) settle
down in a ground state. In this respect, the fixed point exact solutions of the
spontaneous Z_2-symmetry breaking Einstein-Gordon equations (mandatory)
describe (k=-1)-FRW manifolds which actually are either Milne or anti-de Sitter
Universes. Setting the Z_2-invariance breaking scale at the one of the
electroweak symmetry, we speculate on the cosmological implications of the
Higgs-anti-de Sitter bubbles and derive a set of particular closed-form
solutions to the S_2-cobordism with a spatially flat FRW Universe.
