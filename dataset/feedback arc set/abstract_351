We characterize planar diagrams which may be divided into n arc embeddings in
terms of their chord diagrams, generalizing a result of Taniyama for the case n
= 2. Two algorithms are provided, one which finds a minimal arc embedding (in
quadradic time in the number of crossings), and one which constructs a minimal
subdiagram having same arc number as D.
