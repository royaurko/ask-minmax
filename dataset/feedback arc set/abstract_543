A Stackelberg game is played between a leader and a follower. The leader
first chooses an action, and then the follower plays his best response, and the
goal of the leader is to pick the action that will maximize his payoff given
the follower's best response. Stackelberg games capture, for example, the
following interaction between a producer and a consumer. The producer chooses
the prices of the goods he produces, and then a consumer chooses to buy a
utility-maximizing bundle of goods. The goal of the seller here is to set
prices to maximize his profit--his revenue, minus the production cost of the
purchased bundle. It is quite natural that the seller in this example should
not know the buyer's utility function. However, he does have access to revealed
preference feedback--he can set prices, and then observe the purchased bundle
and his own profit. We give algorithms for efficiently solving, in terms of
both computation and query-complexity, a broad class of Stackelberg games in
which the follower's utility function is unknown, using only "revealed
preference" access to it. This class includes in particular the profit
maximization problem, as well as the optimal tolling problem in nonatomic
congestion games, when the latency functions are unknown. Surprisingly, we are
able to solve these problems even though the optimization problems are
non-convex in the leader's actions.
