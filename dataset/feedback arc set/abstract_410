This paper studies the ergodic capacity of wideband multipath channels with
limited feedback. Our work builds on recent results that have established the
possibility of significant capacity gains in the wideband/low-SNR regime when
there is perfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter.
Furthermore, the perfect CSI benchmark gain can be obtained with the feedback
of just one bit per channel coefficient. However, the input signals used in
these methods are peaky, that is, they have a large peak-to-average power
ratios. Signal peakiness is related to channel coherence and many recent
measurement campaigns show that, in contrast to previous assumptions, wideband
channels exhibit a sparse multipath structure that naturally leads to coherence
in time and frequency. In this work, we first show that even an instantaneous
power constraint is sufficient to achieve the benchmark gain when perfect CSI
is available at the receiver. In the more realistic non-coherent setting, we
study the performance of a training-based signaling scheme. We show that
multipath sparsity can be leveraged to achieve the benchmark gain under both
average as well as instantaneous power constraints as long as the channel
coherence scales at a sufficiently fast rate with signal space dimensions. We
also present rules of thumb on choosing signaling parameters as a function of
the channel parameters so that the full benefits of sparsity can be realized.
