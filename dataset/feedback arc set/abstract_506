We propose new ergodic interference alignment techniques for $K$-user
interference channels with delayed feedback. Two delayed feedback scenarios are
considered -- delayed channel information at transmitter (CIT) and delayed
output feedback. It is proved that the proposed techniques achieve total
$2K/(K+2)$ DoF which is higher than that by the retrospective interference
alignment for the delayed feedback scenarios.
