A new framework for adaptive regulation to invariant sets is proposed.
Reaching the target dynamics (invariant set) is to be ensured by state feedback
while adaptation to parametric uncertainties is provided by additional
adaptation algorithm. We show that for a sufficiently large class of nonlinear
systems it is possible to adaptively steer the system trajectories to the
desired non-equilibrium state without requiring knowledge or existence of a
specific strict Lyapunov function.
