An L(2,1)-labelling of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is $\lambda_{2,1}(G)$ a function
$f$ from the vertex set V (G) to the set of non-negative integers such that
adjacent vertices get numbers at least two apart, and vertices at distance two
get distinct numbers. The L(2,1)-labelling number denoted by $\lambda_{2,1}(G)$
of $G$ is the minimum range of labels over all such labelling. In this article,
it is shown that, for a circular-arc graph $G$, the upper bound of
$\lambda_{2,1}(G)$ is $\Delta+3\omega$, where $\Delta$ and $\omega$ represents
the maximum degree of the vertices and size of maximum clique respectively.
