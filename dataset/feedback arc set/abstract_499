We show that the automorphism group, Aut(L), of a projective Fraisse limit L,
whose natural quotient is the pseudo-arc, has a comeager conjugacy class. This
generalizes an unpublished result of Oppenheim that Aut(L) (and consequently,
the group of all homeomorphisms of the pseudo-arc) has a dense conjugacy class.
We also present a simple proof of the result of Oppenheim.
