Let $a, \ b \ (b \geq a)$ and $n \ (n \geq 2)$ be nonnegative integers and
let $\mathcal{T}(a,b,n)$ be the set of such generalised tournaments, in which
every pair of distinct players is connected at most with $b$, and at least with
$a$ arcs. In \cite{Ivanyi2009} we gave a necessary and sufficient condition to
decide whether a given sequence of nonnegative integers $D = (d_1, d_2,...,
d_n)$ can be realized as the out-degree sequence of a $T \in
\mathcal{T}(a,b,n)$. Extending the results of \cite{Ivanyi2009} we show that
for any sequence of nonnegative integers $D$ there exist $f$ and $g$ such that
some element $T \in \mathcal{T}(g,f,n)$ has $D$ as its out-degree sequence, and
for any $(a,b,n)$-tournament $T'$ with the same out-degree sequence $D$ hold
$a\leq g$ and $b\geq f$. We propose a $\Theta(n)$ algorithm to determine $f$
and $g$ and an $O(d_n n^2)$ algorithm to construct a corresponding tournament
$T$.
