Dynamical systems with complex delayed interactions arise commonly when
propagation times are significant, yielding complicated oscillatory
instabilities. In this Letter, we introduce a class of systems with multiple,
hierarchically long time delays, and using a suitable space-time representation
we uncover features otherwise hidden in their temporal dynamics. The behaviour
in the case of two delays is shown to ''encode'' two-dimensional spiral defects
and defects turbulence. A multiple scale analysis sets the equivalence to a
complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and a novel criterium for the attainment of
the long-delay regime is introduced. We also demonstrate this phenomenon for a
semiconductor laser with two delayed optical feedbacks.
