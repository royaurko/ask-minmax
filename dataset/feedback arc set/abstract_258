It is well known that every rational parameter ray of the Mandelbrot set
lands at a single parameter. We study the rational parameter rays of the
multicorns, the connectedness loci of unicritical antiholomorphic polynomials,
and give a complete description of their accumulation properties. One of the
principal results is that the parameter rays accumulating on the boundaries of
odd period (except period one) hyperbolic components of the multicorns do not
land, but accumulate on arcs of positive length consisting of parabolic
parameters.
  We also show the existence of undecorated real-analytic arcs on the
boundaries of the multicorns, which implies that the centers of hyperbolic
components are not equidistributed with respect to the harmonic measures of the
multicorns.
