We define invariants of the blow-Nash equivalence of real analytic function
germs, in a similar way that the motivic zeta functions of Denef & Loeser. As a
key ingredient, we extend the virtual Betti numbers, which were known for real
algebraic sets, as a generalized Euler characteristics for projective
constructible arc-symmetrics sets. Actually we prove more: the virtual Betti
numbers are not only algebraic invariant, but also Nash-invariant of
arc-symmetric sets. Our zeta functions enable to sketch the blow-Nash
equivalence classes of Brieskorn polynomials of two variables.
