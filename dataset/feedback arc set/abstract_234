Synchronization of coupled continuous-time linear systems is studied in a
general setting. For identical neutrally-stable linear systems that are
detectable from their outputs, it is shown that a linear output feedback law
exists under which the coupled systems globally asymptotically synchronize
under all fixed (directed) connected network topologies. An algorithm is
provided to compute one such feedback law based on individual system
parameters. The dual case, where individual systems are neutrally stable and
stabilizable from their inputs, is also considered and parallel results are
established.
