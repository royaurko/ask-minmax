In this study we consider rateless coding over discrete memoryless channels
(DMC) with feedback. Unlike traditional fixed-rate codes, in rateless codes
each codeword is infinitely long, and the decoding time depends on the
confidence level of the decoder. Using rateless codes along with sequential
decoding, and allowing a fixed probability of error at the decoder, we obtain
results for several communication scenarios. The results shown here are
non-asymptotic, in the sense that the size of the message set is finite. First
we consider the transmission of equiprobable messages using rateless codes over
a DMC, where the decoder knows the channel law. We obtain an achievable rate
for a fixed error probability and a finite message set. We show that as the
message set size grows, the achievable rate approaches the optimum rate for
this setting. We then consider the universal case, in which the channel law is
unknown to the decoder. We introduce a novel decoder that uses a mixture
probability assignment instead of the unknown channel law, and obtain an
achievable rate for this case. Finally, we extend the scope for more advanced
settings. We use different flavors of the rateless coding scheme for joint
source-channel coding, coding with side-information and a combination of the
two with universal coding, which yields a communication scheme that does not
require any information on the source, the channel, or the amount the side
information at the receiver.
