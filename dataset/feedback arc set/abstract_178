This paper investigates the optimum source transmission strategy to maximize
the capacity of a multiple-input single-output (MISO) amplify-and-forward relay
channel, assuming source-relay channel mean feedback at the source. The
challenge here is that relaying introduces a nonconvex structure in the
objective function, thereby excluding the possible use of previous methods
dealing with mean feedback that generally rely on the concavity of the
objective function. A novel method is employed, which divides the feasible set
into two subsets and establishes the optimum from one of them by comparison. As
such, the optimization is transformed into the comparison of two nonnegative
random variables in the Laplace transform order, which is one of the important
stochastic orders. It turns out that the optimum transmission strategy is to
transmit along the known channel mean and its orthogonal eigenchannels. The
condition for rank-one precoding (beamforming) to achieve capacity is also
determined. Our results subsume those for traditional MISO precoding with mean
feedback.
