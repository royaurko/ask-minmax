We prove that, if X is a variety over an uncountable algebraically closed
field k of characteristic zero, then any irreducible exceptional divisor E on a
resolution of singularities of X which is not uniruled, belongs to the image of
the Nash map, i.e. corresponds to an irreducible component of the space of arcs
on X centered in Sing X. This reduces the Nash problem of arcs to understanding
which uniruled essential divisors are in the image of the Nash map, more
generally, how to determine the uniruled essential divisors from the space of
arcs.
