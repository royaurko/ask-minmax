We prove that a polynomial Julia set which is a finitely irreducible
continuum is either an arc or an indecomposable continuum. For the more general
case of rational functions, we give a topological model for the dynamics when
the Julia set is an irreducible continuum and all indecomposable subcontinua
have empty interior.
