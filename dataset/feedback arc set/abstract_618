Weyl semimetals (WSMs) constitute a 3D phase with linearly-dispersing Weyl
excitations at low energy, which lead to unusual electrodynamic responses and
open Fermi arcs on boundaries. We derive a simple criterion to identify and
characterize WSMs in an interacting setting using the exact electronic Green's
function at zero frequency, which defines a topological Bloch Hamiltonian. We
apply this criterion by numerically analyzing, via cluster and other methods,
interacting lattice models with and without time-reversal symmetry. We identify
various mechanisms for how interactions move and renormalize Weyl fermions. Our
methods remain valid in the presence of long-ranged Coulomb repulsion. Finally,
we introduce a WSM-like phase for which our criterion breaks down due to
fractionalization: the charge-carrying Weyl quasiparticles are orthogonal to
the electron.
