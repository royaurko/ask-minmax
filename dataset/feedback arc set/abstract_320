The object of this study is an integral operator $\mathcal{S}$ which averages
functions in the Euclidean upper half-space $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ over the
half-spheres centered on the topological boundary $\partial
\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$. By generalizing Norton's approach to the inversion of arc
means in the upper half-plane, we intertwine $\mathcal{S}$ with a convolution
operator $\mathcal{P}$. The latter integrates functions in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
over the translates of a paraboloid of revolution. Our main result is a set of
inversion formulas for $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ derived using a
combination of Fourier analysis and classical Radon theory. These formulas
appear to be new and are suitable for practical reconstructions.
