Most communication systems use some form of feedback, often related to
channel state information. The common models used in analyses either assume
perfect channel state information at the receiver and/or noiseless state
feedback links. However, in practical systems, neither is the channel estimate
known perfectly at the receiver and nor is the feedback link perfect. In this
paper, we study the achievable diversity multiplexing tradeoff using i.i.d.
Gaussian codebooks, considering the errors in training the receiver and the
errors in the feedback link for FDD systems, where the forward and the feedback
are independent MIMO channels.
  Our key result is that the maximum diversity order with one-bit of feedback
information is identical to systems with more feedback bits. Thus,
asymptotically in $\mathsf{SNR}$, more than one bit of feedback does not
improve the system performance at constant rates. Furthermore, the one-bit
diversity-multiplexing performance is identical to the system which has perfect
channel state information at the receiver along with noiseless feedback link.
This achievability uses novel concepts of power controlled feedback and
training, which naturally surface when we consider imperfect channel estimation
and noisy feedback links. In the process of evaluating the proposed training
and feedback protocols, we find an asymptotic expression for the joint
probability of the $\mathsf{SNR}$ exponents of eigenvalues of the actual
channel and the estimated channel which may be of independent interest.
