The arc metric is an asymmetric metric on the Teichm\"uller space T(S) of a
surface S with nonempty boundary. In this paper we study the relation between
Thurston's compactification and the horofunction compactification of T(S)
endowed with the arc metric. We prove that there is a natural homeomorphism
between the two compactifications.
