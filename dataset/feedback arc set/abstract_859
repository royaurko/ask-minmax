Let X be an algebraic variety over a field k, and L(X) be the scheme of
formal arcs in X. Let f be an arc whose image is not contained in the
singularities of X. Grinberg and Kazhdan proved that if k has characteristic 0
then the formal neighborhood of f in L(X) admits a decomposition into a product
of an infinite-dimensional smooth piece and a piece isomorphic to the formal
neighborhood of a closed point of a scheme of finite type. We give a short
proof of this theorem without the characteristic 0 assumption.
