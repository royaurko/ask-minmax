We construct a sample of numerical models for clusters of galaxies and employ
these to investigate their capability of imaging background sources into long
arcs. Emphasis is laid on the statistics of these arcs. We study cross sections
for arc length and length-to-width ratio and optical depths for these arc
properties, we examine the distribution of arc widths and curvature radii among
long arcs, and we compare these results to predictions based on simplified
(radially symmetric) cluster models. We find that the capability of the
numerically modeled clusters to produce long arcs is larger by about two orders
of magnitude than that of spherically symmetric cluster models with the same
observable parameters (core radii and velocity dispersions), and that they are
similarly efficient as singular isothermal spheres with the same
velocity-dispersion distribution. The influence of source ellipticity is also
investigated; we find that the optical depth for arcs with a length-to-width
ratio $\ga10$ is significantly larger for elliptical than for circular sources.
Given these results, we conclude that spherically symmetric lens models for
galaxy clusters, adapted to the observable parameters of these clusters,
grossly underestimate the frequency of long arcs. We attribute this difference
between numerically constructed and simplified analytical lens models to the
abundance and the extent of intrinsic asymmetry and to substructure in galaxy
clusters.
