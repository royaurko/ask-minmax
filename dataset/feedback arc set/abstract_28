Although N-body simulations of cosmic structure formation suggest that dark
matter halos have density profiles shallower than isothermal at small radii and
steeper at large radii, whether observed galaxy clusters follow this profile is
still ambiguous. We use one such density profile, the asymmetric NFW profile,
to model the mass distributions of 11 galaxy clusters with gravitational arcs
observed by HST. We characterize the galaxy lenses in each cluster as NFW
ellipsoids, each defined by an unknown scale convergence, scale radius,
ellipticity, and position angle. For a given set of values of these parameters,
we compute the arcs that would be produced by such a lens system. To define the
goodness of fit to the observed arc system, we define a chi^2 function
encompassing the overlap between the observed and reproduced arcs as well as
the agreement between the predicted arc sources and the observational
constraints on the source system. We minimize this chi^2 to find the values of
the lens parameters that best reproduce the observed arc system in a given
cluster. Here we report our best-fit lens parameters and corresponding mass
estimates for each of the 11 lensing clusters. We find that cluster mass models
based on lensing galaxies defined as NFW ellipsoids can accurately reproduce
the observed arcs, and that the best-fit parameters to such a model fall within
the reasonable ranges defined by simulations. These results assert NFW profiles
as an effective model for the mass distributions of observed clusters.
