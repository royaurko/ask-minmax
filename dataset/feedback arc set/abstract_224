This paper is a continuation of a study by Douglass and Clader. We extend the
analysis through December 2003 using the latest updates of the observational
temperature and solar irradiance data sets in addition to a new volcano proxy
data set. We have re-determined the solar effect on the temperature from
satellite measurements of the solar irradiance and the temperature of the lower
troposphere the sensitivity to solar irradiance. This re-analysis calculates
two newly recognized dynamic and non-radiative flux factors which must be
applied to the observed sensitivity. The sensitivity is about twice that
expected from a no-feedback Stefan-Boltzmann radiation balance model, which
implies positive feedback. The sensitivity to volcano forcing is also
determined. Preliminary results indicate that negative feedback is present in
this case. Response times of fractions of a year are found for both solar and
volcano forcing. We note that climate models generally assume relaxation times
of 5 to 10 years and we comment on the consequences of this large disparity. We
also have determined a linear trend in the data.
