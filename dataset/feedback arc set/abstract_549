In 1969 Denniston gave a construction of maximal arcs of degree d in
Desarguesian projective planes of even order q, for all d dividing q. In 2002
Mathon gave a construction method generalizing the one of Denniston. We will
give a new geometric approach to these maximal arcs. This will allow us to
count the number of isomorphism classes of Mathon maximal arcs of degree 8 in
PG(2,2^h), h prime.
