We study the impact of merger events on the strong lensing properties of
galaxy clusters. Previous lensing simulations were not able to resolve
dynamical time scales of cluster lenses, which arise on time scales which are
of order a Gyr. In this case study, we first describe qualitatively with an
analytic model how some of the lensing properties of clusters are expected to
change during merging events. We then analyse a numerically simulated lens
model for the variation in its efficiency for producing both tangential and
radial arcs while a massive substructure falls onto the main cluster body. We
find that: (1) during the merger, the shape of the critical lines and caustics
changes substantially; (2) the lensing cross sections for long and thin arcs
can grow by one order of magnitude and reach their maxima when the extent of
the critical curves is largest; (3) the cross section for radial arcs also
grows, but the cluster can efficiently produce this kind of arcs only while the
merging substructure crosses the main cluster centre; (4) while the arc cross
sections pass through their maxima as the merger proceeds, the cluster's X-ray
emission increases by a factor of $\sim5$. Thus, we conclude that accounting
for these dynamical processes is very important for arc statistics studies. In
particular, they may provide a possible explanation for the arc statistics
problem.
