Search for single top quark and Higgs boson production is among the main
goals for the upgraded Tevatron. We study the feasibility of single top quark
and Higgs boson search at Tevatron both together since these processes have
very similar final state signatures and so backgrounds. Calculation of the
cross sections and a detailed analysis of various kinematic distributions for
signal and for main backgrounds has been performed.
  As a result of this study an opimized set of cuts has been worked out for
background suppression and for extraction of the signal. This study gives proof
to the possibility of testing the nature of the {\wtb} coupling and of a direct
measurement of the {\vtb} CKM parameter. The \bbbar -- pair effective mass
distribution study allows to extract the signal of Higgs with mass up to about
$100\gev$ at $\sqs = 2\tev$ and up to about $120\gev$ at $\sqs = 4\tev$ for
integrated luminosity $L= 1000\ipb$.
