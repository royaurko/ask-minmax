We propose a new mechanism to explain the radio Arc and threads in the
Galactic Center by current sheets produced by local magnetic shears due to
interaction of a moving cloud and the vertical field based on three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. Magnetic reconnetion and acceleration of
cosmic-ray electrons in the current sheet will result in high contrast of radio
emissivity inside and outside the Arc and threads.
