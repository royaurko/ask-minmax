We present imaging and spectroscopic observations of the gravitationally
lensed arcs in the field of RX J1347.5-1145, the most X-ray luminous galaxy
cluster known. Based on the detection of the [OII] 3727 emission line, we
confirm that the redshift of one of the arcs is z = 0.806. Its color and [OII]
line strength are consistent with those of distant, actively star forming
galaxies. In a second arc, we tentatively identify a pair of absorption lines
superposed on a red continuum; the lines are consistent with Ca II H & K at z =
0.785. We detected a faint blue continuum in two additional arcs, but no
spectral line features could be measured. We establish lower limits to their
redshifts based on the absence of [OII] emission, which we argue should be
present and detectable in these objects. Redshifts are also given for a number
of galaxies in the field of the cluster.
