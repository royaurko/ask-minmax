We study the implementation of a weak multiple delayed feedback for
controlling coherence of chaotic oscillations. The specific system we treat is
the Lorenz system with classical set of parameters. There are two reasons
behind the interest to feedback with multiple (incommensurable) delay times:
(1) two delay times provide more flexibility in control than the single one;
(2) some dynamic systems posses an inherent internal delay (e.g.,
traveling-wave tube), and the introducing of the second delayed feedback is a
natural measure for dealing with stray effects brought about by the inherent
one. Specifically, for the Lorenz system we show that two incommensurable delay
times enable achieving suppression of the phase diffusion constant (quantifying
the oscillation coherence) by 2-3 orders of magnitude without destruction of
chaos, while the single one does by 20 times.
