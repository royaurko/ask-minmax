It is known that the arc index of alternating knots is the minimal crossing
number plus two and the arc index of prime nonalternating knots is less than or
equal to the minimal crossing number. We study some cases when the arc index is
strictly less than the minimal crossing number. We also give minimal grid
diagrams of some prime nonalternating knots with 13 crossings and 14 crossings
whose arc index is the minimal crossing number minus one.
