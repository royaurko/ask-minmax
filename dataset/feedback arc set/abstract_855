We study the problem of communication over an additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channel with an AWGN feedback channel. When the feedback channel is
noiseless, the classic Schalkwijk-Kailath (S-K) scheme is known to achieve
capacity in a simple sequential fashion, while attaining reliability superior
to non-feedback schemes. In this work, we show how simplicity and reliability
can be attained when the feedback is noisy. We introduce a low-complexity
low-delay scheme that operates close to capacity for a fixed bit error
probability (e.g. $10^{-6}$). We further provide an asymptotic construction
admitting an error exponent that can significantly exceed the best possible
non-feedback exponent. Both results hold when the feedback channel is
sufficiently better than the feedforward channel. Our approach is based on the
interpretation of feedback transmission as a side-information problem, and
employs an interactive modulo-lattice solution.
