The particle-hole asymmetry electronic state of cuprate superconductors and
the related doping and temperature dependence of the Fermi arc length are
studied based on the kinetic energy driven superconducting mechanism. By taking
into account the interplay between the SC gap and normal-state pseudogap, the
essential feature of the evolution of the Fermi arc length with doping and
temperature is qualitatively reproduced. It is shown that the particle-hole
asymmetry electronic state is a natural consequence due to the presence the
normal-state pseudogap in the particle-hole channel. The Fermi arc length
increases with increasing temperatures below the normal-state pseudogap
crossover temperature $T^{*}$, and it covers the full length of the Fermi
surface for $T>T^{*}$. In particular, in analogy to the temperature dependence
of the Fermi arc length, the low-temperature Fermi arc length in the underdoped
regime increases with increasing doping, and then it evolves into a continuous
contour in momentum space near the end of the superconducting dome. The theory
also predicts an almost linear doping dependence of the Fermi arc length.
