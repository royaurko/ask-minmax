The searches for supersymmetric particles by the four LEP experiments, ALEPH,
DELPHI, L3, OPAL, have been made for many different theoretical models and
phenomenological scenarios. Since no significant signs of a SUSY signal have
been observed the results have been used to set exclusion limits and to
constrain the supersymmetric parameter space. This talk will focus on combined
SUSY searches, within the mSUGRA framework, from the four LEP experiments. The
results are based mainly on the data recorded between the years 1996-2000,
which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb$^{-1}$ and
center-of-mass energies from 161 up to 208 GeV.
