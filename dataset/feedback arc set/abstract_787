Past research shows that spreadsheet models are prone to such a high
frequency of errors and data security implications that the risk management of
spreadsheet development and spreadsheet use is of great importance to both
industry and academia. The underlying rationale for this paper is that
spreadsheet training courses should specifically address risk management in the
development process both from a generic and a domain-specific viewpoint. This
research specifically focuses on one of these namely those generic issues of
risk management that should be present in a training course that attempts to
meet good-practice within industry. A pilot questionnaire was constructed
showing a possible minimum set of risk management issues and sent to academics
and industry practitioners for feedback. The findings from this pilot survey
will be used to refine the questionnaire for sending to a larger body of
possible respondents. It is expected these findings will form the basis of a
risk management teaching approach to be trialled in a number of selected
ongoing spreadsheet training courses.
