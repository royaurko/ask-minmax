Optimal coding over the additive white Gaussian noise channel under the peak
energy constraint is studied when there is noisy feedback over an orthogonal
additive white Gaussian noise channel. As shown by Pinsker, under the peak
energy constraint, the best error exponent for communicating an M-ary message,
M >= 3, with noise-free feedback is strictly larger than the one without
feedback. This paper extends Pinsker's result and shows that if the noise power
in the feedback link is sufficiently small, the best error exponent for
conmmunicating an M-ary message can be strictly larger than the one without
feedback. The proof involves two feedback coding schemes. One is motivated by a
two-stage noisy feedback coding scheme of Burnashev and Yamamoto for binary
symmetric channels, while the other is a linear noisy feedback coding scheme
that extends Pinsker's noise-free feedback coding scheme. When the feedback
noise power $\alpha$ is sufficiently small, the linear coding scheme
outperforms the two-stage (nonlinear) coding scheme, and is asymptotically
optimal as $\alpha$ tends to zero. By contrast, when $\alpha$ is relatively
larger, the two-stage coding scheme performs better.
