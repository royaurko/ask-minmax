We consider the problem of communication over a multi-path network in the
presence of a causal adversary. The limited-view causal adversary is able to
eavesdrop on a subset of links and also jam on a potentially overlapping subset
of links based on the current and past information. To ensure that the
communication takes place reliably and secretly, resilient network codes with
necessary redundancy are needed. We study two adversarial models - additive and
overwrite jamming and we optionally assume passive feedback from decoder to
encoder, i.e., the encoder sees everything that the decoder sees. The problem
assumes transmissions are in the large alphabet regime. For both jamming
models, we find the capacity under four scenarios - reliability without
feedback, reliability and secrecy without feedback, reliability with passive
feedback, reliability and secrecy with passive feedback. We observe that, in
comparison to the non-causal setting, the capacity with a causal adversary is
strictly increased for a wide variety of parameter settings and present our
intuition through several examples.
