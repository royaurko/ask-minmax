Let D be an acyclic orientation of a simple graph G. An arc of D is called
dependent if its reversal creates a directed cycle. Let d(D) denote the number
of dependent arcs in D. Define m and M to be the minimum and the maximum number
of d(D) over all acyclic orientations D of G. We call G fully orientable if G
has an acyclic orientation with exactly k dependent arcs for every k satisfying
m <= k <= M. In this paper, we prove that the square of a cycle C_n of length n
is fully orientable except n=6.
