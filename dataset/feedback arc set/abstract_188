Let f and g two rational functions having the same Julia set J_f. Lets
suppose that f has a rational indifferent periodic point and that the critical
set of f is disjoint of J_f. Then or J_f has to be equal to P^1, a circle, an
arc of a circle for some cordinate or f and g has to verify an equation of the
type: $$f^{m_1}\circ g\circ f^{m_2}\circ\cdotc\circ f^{m_n}\circ g=f^m.$$
