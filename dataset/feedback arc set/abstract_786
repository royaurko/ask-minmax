The SPring-8 control system provides data acquisition software called
Poller/Collector for periodic data taking. Its polling scheme does not support
taking data synchronized with an event, and simultaneity in the data from the
different VME systems is not guaranteed. Recently, requirement for fast and
event-driven data acquisition has increased, and the synchronization of a set
of data from the different VME systems is requested. We added new data-taking
software to the standard framework with a shared memory network. We designed
the software on the VME by updating the original framework that was already
used for feedback control. The data filling process on a PC stores sets of the
synchronized data on a shared memory board to the database. The shared memory
boards provide 250Mbit/s transmission rate and are linked with optical fiber
cables. We will install the system to the linac beam position monitors data
acquisition as the first application.
