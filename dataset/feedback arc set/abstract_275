The pole placement problem asks to find laws to feed the output of a plant
governed by a linear system of differential equations back to the input of the
plant so that the resulting closed-loop system has a desired set of
eigenvalues. Converting this problem into a question of enumerative geometry,
efficient numerical homotopy algorithms to solve this problem for general
Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) systems have been proposed recently. While
dynamic feedback laws offer a wider range of use, the realization of the output
of the numerical homotopies as a machine to control the plant in the time
domain has not been addressed before. In this paper we present symbolic-numeric
algorithms to turn the solution to the question of enumerative geometry into a
useful control feedback machine. We report on numerical experiments with our
publicly available software and illustrate its application on various control
problems from the literature.
