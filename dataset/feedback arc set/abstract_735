We show that time-delayed feedback methods, which have successfully been used
to control unstable periodic ortbits, provide a tool to stabilize unstable
steady states. We present an analytical investigation of the feedback scheme
using the Lambert function and discuss effects of both a low-pass filter
included in the control loop and non-zero latency times associated with the
generation and injection of the feedback signal.
