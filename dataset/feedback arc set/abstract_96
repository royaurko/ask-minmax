One particular challenge in AI is the computational modelling and simulation
of creativity. Feedback and learning from experience are key aspects of the
creative process. Here we investigate how we could implement feedback in
creative systems using a social model. From the field of creative writing we
borrow the concept of a Writers Workshop as a model for learning through
feedback. The Writers Workshop encourages examination, discussion and debates
of a piece of creative work using a prescribed format of activities. We propose
a computational model of the Writers Workshop as a roadmap for incorporation of
feedback in artificial creativity systems. We argue that the Writers Workshop
setting describes the anatomy of the creative process. We support our claim
with a case study that describes how to implement the Writers Workshop model in
a computational creativity system. We present this work using patterns other
people can follow to implement similar designs in their own systems. We
conclude by discussing the broader relevance of this model to other aspects of
AI.
