In this paper we consider connected locally $G$-arc-transitive graphs with
vertices of valence 3 and 4, such that the kernel $G_{uv}^{[1]}$ of the action
of an edge-stabiliser on the neighourhood $\Gamma(u) \cup \Gamma(v)$ is
trivial. We find nineteen finitely presented groups with the property that any
such group $G$ is a quotient of one of these groups. As an application, we
enumerate all connected locally arc-transitive graphs of valence ${3,4}$ on at
most 350 vertices whose automorphism group contains a locally arc-transitive
subgroup $G$ with $G_{uv}^{[1]} = 1$.
