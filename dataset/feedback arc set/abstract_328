Let $\Omega$ be a planar Jordan domain. We consider double-dome-like surfaces
$\Sigma$ defined by graphs of functions of $dist( \cdot ,\partial \Omega)$ over
$\Omega$. The goal is to find the right conditions on the geometry of the base
$\Omega$ and the growth of the height so that $\Sigma$ is a quasisphere, or
quasisymmetric to $\mathbb{S}^2$. An internal uniform chord-arc condition on
the constant distance sets to $\partial \Omega$, coupled with a mild growth
condition on the height, gives a close-to-sharp answer. Our method also
produces new examples of quasispheres in $\mathbb{R}^n$, for any $n\ge 3$.
