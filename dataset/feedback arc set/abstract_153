Albeit the implicit feedback based recommendation problem - when only the
user history is available but there are no ratings - is the most typical
setting in real-world applications, it is much less researched than the
explicit feedback case. State-of-the-art algorithms that are efficient on the
explicit case cannot be automatically transformed to the implicit case if
scalability should be maintained. There are few implicit feedback benchmark
data sets, therefore new ideas are usually experimented on explicit benchmarks.
In this paper, we propose a generic context-aware implicit feedback recommender
algorithm, coined iTALS. iTALS applies a fast, ALS-based tensor factorization
learning method that scales linearly with the number of non-zero elements in
the tensor. We also present two approximate and faster variants of iTALS using
coordinate descent and conjugate gradient methods at learning. The method also
allows us to incorporate various contextual information into the model while
maintaining its computational efficiency. We present two context-aware variants
of iTALS incorporating seasonality and item purchase sequentiality into the
model to distinguish user behavior at different time intervals, and product
types with different repetitiveness. Experiments run on six data sets shows
that iTALS clearly outperforms context-unaware models and context aware
baselines, while it is on par with factorization machines (beats 7 times out of
12 cases) both in terms of recall and MAP.
