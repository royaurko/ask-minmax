The XXXVIIth Rencontres de Moriond on "The Cosmological Model" is briefly
summarized. Almost none of the current observations argues against the popular
Cold Dark Matter + Lambda concordance model. However, it remains to be tested
how astrophysical uncertainties involved in the interpretation of the different
data sets affect the derived cosmological parameters. Independent tests are
still required to establish if the Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy components
are `real', or just `epicycles' that happen to fit the current data sets well.
