In the framework of Randall-Sundrum model, we discuss the evolution of
microscopic black holes created by cosmic particles hitting a neutron or a
strange star. We set up the general equations of evolution for the black hole
mass and momentum in a dense medium, and discuss the possibility of collapse
due to the black hole's growth inside the star.
