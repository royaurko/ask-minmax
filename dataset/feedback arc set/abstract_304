From a set of 3D cosmological simulations which incorporate a self-consistent
model of the star-gas interactions, we have been able to obtain a statistically
significant sample of galaxy-type halos with observational properties, like
colors and luminosities. Using this data-base, we have studied general
relations of galaxies, such as the Tully-Fisher relation, luminosity functions,
environmental dependences, or cosmic star formation density.
