Chen, Deng, Du, Stanley, and Yan introduced the notion of $k$-crossings and
$k$-nestings for set partitions, and proved that the sizes of the largest
$k$-crossings and $k$-nestings in the partitions of an $n$-set possess a
symmetric joint distribution. This work considers a generalization of these
results to set partitions whose arcs are labeled by an $r$-element set (which
we call \emph{$r$-colored set partitions}). In this context, a $k$-crossing or
$k$-nesting is a sequence of arcs, all with the same color, which form a
$k$-crossing or $k$-nesting in the usual sense. After showing that the sizes of
the largest crossings and nestings in colored set partitions likewise have a
symmetric joint distribution, we consider several related enumeration problems.
We prove that $r$-colored set partitions with no crossing arcs of the same
color are in bijection with certain paths in $\NN^r$, generalizing the
correspondence between noncrossing (uncolored) set partitions and 2-Motzkin
paths. Combining this with recent work of Bousquet-M\'elou and Mishna affords a
proof that the sequence counting noncrossing 2-colored set partitions is
P-recursive. We also discuss how our methods extend to several variations of
colored set partitions with analogous notions of crossings and nestings.
