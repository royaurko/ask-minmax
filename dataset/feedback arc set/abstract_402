Additive combinatorics is built around the famous theorem by Szemer\'edi
which asserts existence of arithmetic progressions of any length among the
integers. There exist several different proofs of the theorem based on very
different techniques. Szemer\'edi's theorem is an existence statement, whereas
the ultimate goal in combinatorics is always to make enumeration statements. In
this article we develop new methods based on real algebraic geometry to obtain
several quantitative statements on the number of arithmetic progressions in
fixed density sets. We further discuss the possibility of a generalization of
Szemer\'edi's theorem using methods from real algebraic geometry.
