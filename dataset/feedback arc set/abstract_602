A theory of complexity for pairs (M,G) with M an arbitrary closed 3-manifold
and G a 3-valent graph in M was introduced by the first two named contributors,
extending the original notion due to Matveev. The complexity c is known to be
always additive under connected sum away from the graphs, but not always under
connected sum along (unknotted) arcs of the graphs. In this article we prove
the slightly surprising fact that if in M there is a sphere intersecting G
transversely at one point, and this point belongs to an edge e of G, then e can
be canceled from G without affecting the complexity. Using this fact we
completely characterize the circumstances under which complexity is additive
under connected sum along graphs. For the set of pairs (M,K) with K a knot in
M, we also prove that any function that is fully additive under connected sum
along knots is actually a function of the ambient manifold only.
