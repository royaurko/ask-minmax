We consider a Markov decision process with deterministic state transition
dynamics, adversarially generated rewards that change arbitrarily from round to
round, and a bandit feedback model in which the decision maker only observes
the rewards it receives. In this setting, we present a novel and efficient
online decision making algorithm named MarcoPolo. Under mild assumptions on the
structure of the transition dynamics, we prove that MarcoPolo enjoys a regret
of O(T^(3/4)sqrt(log(T))) against the best deterministic policy in hindsight.
Specifically, our analysis does not rely on the stringent unichain assumption,
which dominates much of the previous work on this topic.
