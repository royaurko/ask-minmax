Real time control of many plasma parameters will be an essential aspect in
the development of reliable high performance operation of Next Step Tokamaks.
The main prerequisites for any feedback scheme are the precise real-time
determination of the quantities to be controlled, requiring top quality and
highly reliable diagnostics, and the availability of robust control algorithms.
A new set of real time diagnostics was recently implemented on JET to prove the
feasibility of determining, with high accuracy and time resolution, the most
important plasma quantities. With regard to feedback algorithms, new
model&#8211;based controllers were developed to allow a more robust control of
several plasma parameters. Both diagnostics and algorithms were successfully
used in several experiments, ranging from H-mode plasmas to configuration with
ITBs. Since elaboration of computationally heavy measurements is often
required, significant attention was devoted to non-algorithmic methods like
Digital or Cellular Neural/Nonlinear Networks. The real time hardware and
software adopted architectures are also described with particular attention to
their relevance to ITER.
