We present methods for online linear optimization that take advantage of
benign (as opposed to worst-case) sequences. Specifically if the sequence
encountered by the learner is described well by a known "predictable process",
the algorithms presented enjoy tighter bounds as compared to the typical worst
case bounds. Additionally, the methods achieve the usual worst-case regret
bounds if the sequence is not benign. Our approach can be seen as a way of
adding prior knowledge about the sequence within the paradigm of online
learning. The setting is shown to encompass partial and side information.
Variance and path-length bounds can be seen as particular examples of online
learning with simple predictable sequences.
  We further extend our methods and results to include competing with a set of
possible predictable processes (models), that is "learning" the predictable
process itself concurrently with using it to obtain better regret guarantees.
We show that such model selection is possible under various assumptions on the
available feedback. Our results suggest a promising direction of further
research with potential applications to stock market and time series
prediction.
