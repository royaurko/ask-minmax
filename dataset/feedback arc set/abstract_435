The Helly number of a family of sets with empty intersection is the size of
its largest inclusion-wise minimal sub-family with empty intersection. Let F be
a finite family of open subsets of an arbitrary locally arc-wise connected
topological space Gamma. Assume that for every sub-family G of F the
intersection of the elements of G has at most r connected components, each of
which is a Q-homology cell. We show that the Helly number of F is at most
r(d_Gamma+1), where d_Gamma is the smallest integer j such that every open set
of Gamma has trivial Q-homology in dimension j and higher. (In particular
d_{R^d} = d). This bound is best possible. We prove, in fact, a stronger
theorem where small sub-families may have more than r connected components,
each possibly with nontrivial homology in low dimension. As an application, we
obtain several explicit bounds on Helly numbers in geometric transversal theory
for which only ad hoc geometric proofs were previously known; in certain cases,
the bound we obtain is better than what was previously known.
