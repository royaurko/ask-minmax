A random access scheme for the collision channel without feedback is
proposed. The scheme is based on erasure correcting codes for the recovery of
packet segments that are lost in collisions, and on successive interference
cancellation for resolving collisions. The proposed protocol achieves reliable
communication in the asymptotic setting and attains capacities close to 1
[packets/slot]. A capacity bound as a function of the overall rate of the
scheme is derived, and code distributions tightly approaching the bound
developed.
