We present a semi-analytical model of high redshift galaxy formation. In our
model the star formation inside a galaxy is regulated by the feedback from
supernova (SNe) driven outflows. We derive a closed analytical form for star
formation rate in a single galaxy taking account of the SNe feedback in a
self-consistent manner. We show that our model can explain the observed
correlation between the stellar mass and the circular velocity of galaxies from
dwarf galaxies to massive galaxies of $10^{12} M_\odot$. For small mass dwarf
galaxies additional feedback other than supernova feedback is needed to explain
the spread in the observational data. Our models reproduce the observed 3-D
fundamental correlation between the stellar mass, gas phase metallicity and
star formation rate in galaxies establishing that the SNe feedback plays a
major role in building this relation. Further, the observed UV luminosity
functions of Lyman-Break galaxies (LBGs) are well explained by our feedback
induced star formation model for a vast redshift range of $1.5 \le z \le 8$. In
particular, the flattening of the luminosity functions at the low luminosity
end naturally arises due to our explicit SNe feedback treatment.
