N. Hamilton and J. A. Thas describe a link between maximal arcs of Mathon
type and partial flocks of the quadratic cone. This link is of a rather
algebraic nature. In this paper we establish a geometric connection between
these two structures. We also define a composition on the flock planes and use
this to work out an analogue of the synthetic version of Mathon's Theorem.
Finally, we show how it is possible to construct a maximal arc of Mathon type
of degree 2d, containing a Denniston arc of degree d provided that there is a
solution to a certain given system of trace conditions.
