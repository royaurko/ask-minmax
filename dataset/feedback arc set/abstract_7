Let X=(V, E) be a digraph. X is maximally connected, if \kappa(X)=\delta(X).
X is maximally arc-connected, if \lambda(X)=\delta(X). And X is super
arc-connected, if every minimum arc-cut of X is either the set of inarcs of
some vertex or the set of outarcs of some vertex. In this paper, we will prove
that the strongly connected Bi-Cayley digraphs are maximally connected and
maximally arc-connected, and the most of strongly connected Bi-Cayley digraphs
are super arc-connected.
