In this paper we study well-posedness and asymptotic stability for a class of
nonlinear second-order evolution equations with intermittent delay damping.
More precisely, a delay feedback and an undelayed one act alternately in time.
We show that, under suitable conditions on the feedback operators, asymptotic
stability results are available. Concrete examples included in our setting are
illustrated. We give also stability results for an abstract model with
alternate positive-negative damping, without delay.
