Bicovering arcs in Galois affine planes of odd order are a powerful tool for
constructing complete caps in spaces of higher dimensions. In this paper we
investigate whether some arcs contained in nodal cubic curves are bicovering.
For $m_1$, $m_2$ coprime divisors of $q-1$, bicovering arcs in $AG(2,q)$ of
size $k\le (q-1)\frac{m_1+m_2}{m_1m_2}$ are obtained, provided that
$(m_1m_2,6)=1$ and $m_1m_2<\sqrt[4]{q}/3.5$. Such arcs produce complete caps of
size $kq^{(N-2)/2}$ in affine spaces of dimension $N\equiv 0 \pmod 4$. For
infinitely many $q$'s these caps are the smallest known complete caps in
$AG(N,q)$, $N \equiv 0 \pmod 4$.
