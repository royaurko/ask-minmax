Two reactions, the photoproduction of a direct photon plus a jet and the
photoproduction of a charged hadron plus a jet, are studied in view of their
potential to constrain the gluon distribution in the proton. The results are
based on a program of partonic event generator type which includes the full set
of NLO corrections.
