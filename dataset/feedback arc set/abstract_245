This paper extends the decorated Teichm\"uller theory developed before for
punctured surfaces to the setting of ``bordered'' surfaces, i.e., surfaces with
boundary, and there is non-trivial new structure discovered. The main new
result identifies the arc complex of a bordered surface up to proper homotopy
equivalence with a certain quotient of the moduli space, namely, the quotient
by the natural action of the positive reals by homothety on the hyperbolic
lengths of geodesic boundary components. One tool in the proof is a
homeomorphism between two versions of a ``decorated'' moduli space for bordered
surfaces. The explicit homeomorphism relies upon points equidistant to suitable
triples of horocycles.
