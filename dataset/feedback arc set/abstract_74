A graph is called cubic and tetravalent if all of its vertices have valency 3
and 4, respectively. It is called vertex-transitive and arc-transitive if its
automorphism group acts transitively on its vertex-set and on its arc- set,
respectively. In this paper, we combine some new theoretical results with
computer calculations to construct all cubic vertex-transitive graphs of order
at most 1280. In the process, we also construct all tetravalent arc-transitive
graphs of order at most 640.
