Large numbers of people all over the world read and contribute to various
review sites. Many contributors are understandably concerned about privacy;
specifically, about linkability of reviews (and accounts) across review sites.
In this paper, we study linkability of community reviewing and try to answer
the question: to what extent are "anonymous" reviews linkable, i.e., likely
contributored by the same contributor? Based on a very large set of reviews from a
popular site (Yelp), we show that a high percentage of ostensibly anonymous
reviews can be linked with very high confidence. This is despite the fact that
we use very simple models and equally simple features set. Our study suggests
that contributors reliably expose their identities in reviews. This has
important implications for cross-referencing accounts between different review
sites. Also, techniques used in our study could be adopted by review sites to
give contributors feedback about privacy of their reviews.
