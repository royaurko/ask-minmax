Orbit feedback system plays crucial roles for the operation of the 3rd
generation light source. There are various issues in orbit feedback system
should be addressed to achieve ultimate performance. The orbit feedback system
in SRRC is upgraded recently to satisfy the requirement of demanding users.
Based upon operational experiences of the last few years, new system was
designed with more robustness and flexibility. Performance analysis tools are
also developed to monitor system performance. Algorithms for feedback control,
data acquisition and analysis are described and measurement is also presented.
