A mixed graph is a graph with both directed and undirected edges. We present
an algorithm for deciding whether a given mixed graph on $n$ vertices contains
a feedback vertex set (FVS) of size at most $k$, in time $2^{O(k)}k! O(n^4)$.
This is the first fixed parameter tractable algorithm for FVS that applies to
both directed and undirected graphs.
