For an integer k >= 1, the k-th interlacing adjoint of a digraph G is the
digraph i_k(G) with vertex-set V(G)^k, and arcs ((u_1, ..., u_k), (v_1, ...,
v_k)) such that (u_i,v_i) \in A(G) for i = 1, ..., k and (v_i, u_{i+1}) \in
A(G) for i = 1, ..., k-1. For every k we derive upper and lower bounds for the
chromatic number of i_k(G) in terms of that of G. In particular, we find tight
bounds on the chromatic number of interlacing adjoints of transitive
tournaments. We use this result in conjunction with categorial properties of
adjoint functors to derive the following consequence. For every integer ell,
there exists a directed path Q_{\ell} of algebraic length ell which admits
homomorphisms into every directed graph of chromatic number at least 4. We
discuss a possible impact of this approach on the multifactor version of the
weak Hedetniemi conjecture.
