This paper describes a new concept of cellular automata (CA). XCA consists of
a set of arcs (edges). These arcs correspond to cells in CA. At a definite
time, the arcs are connected to a directed graph. With each next time step, the
arcs are exchanging their neighbors (adjacent arcs) according to rules that are
dependent on the status of the adjacent arcs. With the extended cellular
automaton (XCA) an artificial world may be simulated starting with a Big Bang.
XCA does not require a grid like CA do. However, it can create one, just as the
real universe after the big bang generated its own space, which previously did
not exist. Examples with different rules show how manifold the concept of XCA
is. Like the game of life simulates birth, survival, and death, this game
should simulate a system that starts from a singularity, and evolves to a
complex space.
