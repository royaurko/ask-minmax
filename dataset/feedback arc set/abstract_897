Substrate temperature required for synthesis of graphene in arc discharge
plasma was studied. It was shown that increase of the copper substrate
temperature up to melting point leads to increase in the amount of graphene
production and quality of graphene sheets. Favorable range of substrate
temperatures for arc-based graphene synthesis was determined in relatively
narrow range of about 1340-1360K which is near the melting point of copper.
