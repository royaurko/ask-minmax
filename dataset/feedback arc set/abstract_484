Using ray tracing for simple analytic profiles, we demonstrate that the
lensing cross section for producing giant arcs has distinct contributions due
to arcs formed through image distortion only, and arcs form from the merging of
two or three images. We investigate the dependence of each of these
contributions on halo ellipticity and on the slope of the density profile, and
demonstrate that at fixed Einstein radius, the lensing cross section increases
as the halo profile becomes steeper. We then compare simulations with and
without baryonic cooling of the same cluster for a sample of six clusters, and
demonstrate that cooling can increase the overall abundance of giant arcs by
factors of a few. The net boost to the lensing probability for individual
clusters is mass dependent, and can lower the effective low mass limit of
lensing clusters. This last effect can potentially increase the number of
lensing clusters by an extra 50%. While the magnitude of these effects may be
overestimated due to the well known overcooling problem in simulations, it is
evident that baryonic cooling has a non-negligible impact on the expected
abundance of giant arcs, and hence cosmological constraints from giant arc
abundances may be subject to large systematic errors.
