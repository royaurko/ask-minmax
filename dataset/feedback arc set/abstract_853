We show that for the multi-antenna Gaussian multi-access channel (MAC) and
broadcast channel (BC) with perfect feedback, the rate regions achieved by
linear-feedback coding schemes (called linear-feedback capacity regions)
coincide when the same total input-power constraint is imposed on both channels
and when the MAC channel matrices are the transposes of the BC channel
matrices. Such a pair of MAC and BC is called dual. We also identify
sub-classes of linear-feedback coding schemes that achieve the linear-feedback
capacity regions of these two channels and present multi-letter expressions for
the linear-feedback capacity regions. Moreover, within the two sub-classes of
coding schemes that achieve the linear-feedback capacity regions for a given
MAC and its dual BC, we identify for each MAC scheme a BC scheme and for each
BC scheme a MAC scheme so that the two schemes have same total input power and
achieve the same rate regions.
