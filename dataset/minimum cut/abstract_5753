We construct immersions of trivalent abstract tropical curves in the
Euclidean plane and embeddings of all abstract tropical curves in higher
dimensional Euclidean space. Since not all curves have an embedding in the
plane, we define the tropical crossing number of an abstract tropical curve to
be the minimum number of self-intersections, counted with multiplicity, over
all its immersions in the plane. We show that the tropical crossing number is
at most quadratic in the number of edges and this bound is sharp. For curves of
genus up to two, we systematically compute the crossing number. Finally, we use
our immersed tropical curves to construct totally faithful nodal algebraic
curves via lifting results of Mikhalkin and Shustin.
