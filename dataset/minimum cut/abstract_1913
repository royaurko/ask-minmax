We prove ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels for XXX Heisenberg chains of
any spin and XXZ spin chains with all spins equal to 1/2. Ferromagnetic
ordering means that the minimum energies in the invariant subspaces of fixed
total spin are monotone decreasing as a function of the total spin. This result
provides a ferromagnetic analogue of the well-known theorem by Lieb and Mattis
about ordering of energy levels in antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic systems
on bipartite graphs.
