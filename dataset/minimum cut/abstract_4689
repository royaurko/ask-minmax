We study the bosonic atoms with a wide Feshbach resonance at zero temperature
in terms of the renormalization group. We indicate that this system will always
collapse in the dilute limit. On the side with a positive scattering length,
the atomic superfluid is an unstable local minimum in the dilute limit and it
determines the thermodynamics of this system within its lifetime. We calculate
the equilibrium properties at zero temperature in the unitary regime. They
exhibit universal scaling forms in the dilute limit due to the presence of a
nontrivial zero temperature, zero density fixed point. Moreover, we find that
the T=0 thermodynamics of this system in the unitary limit is exactly identical
to the one for an ideal Fermi gas.
