We present an operational method to determine the 'locally preferred
structure'' of model liquids, a notion often put forward to explain
supercooling of a liquid and glass formation. The method relies on finding the
global minimum in the (free) energy landscape of clusters of atoms or molecules
embedded in a liquid-like environment. We propose a more systematic approach of
the external potential mimicking the influence of the surrounding bulk liquid
on the cluster than in our previous work [S. Mossa and G. Tarjus, J. Chem. Phys
119, 8069 (2003)]. The procedure is tested on the one-component Lennard-Jones
liquid and we recover, without a priori input, that the locally preferred
structure is an icosahedral arrangement of thirteen atoms.
