The UCu(5-x)Pd(x) system exhibits non-Fermi liquid (NFL) in the thermodynamic
and transport properties at low temperatures for Pd concentrations 0.9 <~ x <~
1.5. The local structure around the U, Cu, and Pd atoms has been measured for 0
<= x <= 1.5 using the X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) technique in order
to quantify the effects of lattice disorder on the NFL properties. A model
which allows a percentage of the Pd atoms to occupy nominal Cu (16e) sites, s,
was used to fit the Pd and Cu K edge and U L(III) edge data. Pd/Cu site
interchange was found to occur in all samples (x != 0), reaching a minimum
value of s ~0.17 at x = 0.7 and increasing monotonically to s ~ 0.4 at x=1.5.
These data also determine the static disorder the nearest neighbor U--Cu pairs.
The results indicate that the measured U--Cu static disorder is not sufficient
to explain the NFL behavior of the magnetic susceptibility within the
single-ion Kondo disorder model and casts doubt on the applicability of this
model to UCu(5-x)Pd(x).
