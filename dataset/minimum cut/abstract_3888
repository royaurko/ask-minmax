We explore the possibility of gauge mediation in a paradigm whereby
supersymmetry is posited to be an accidental symmetry of Nature and the
Standard Model fields are composite bound states that emerge from a conformal
field theory. The resultant effective theory can, through sequestering and
conformal dynamics, exhibit most of the properties of low energy supersymmetry
breaking while averting a number of cosmological and astrophysical constraints
of the traditional framework of gauge mediation via dynamical supersymmetry
breaking. Of particular phenomenological interest is that in our scenario, the
gravitino is superheavy, the neutralino LSP is a viable candidate for cold dark
matter and the flavor changing neutral currents are constrained to be, at the
very minimum, only an order of magnitude below current experimental bounds.
