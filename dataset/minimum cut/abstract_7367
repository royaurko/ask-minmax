The problem of detecting an abrupt change in a sequence of independent and
identically distributed (IID) random variables is addressed. Sequentially
received samples are IID both before and after a single unknown change time.
Unlike previous approaches to change detection that assume a known probability
density function (PDF) at the start, the problem here is to detect a change
between two given PDFs in either direction, meaning that the number of
hypotheses to be tracked is always twice the number of samples received. A
Bayesian multiple hypothesis approach is proposed and shown to have the
following properties: (i) unlike previous tests that require a threshold, the
minimum cost hypothesis is tracked through time, (ii) under an exponential
delay cost function and suitable parameter choices, the proposed procedure's
probability of detecting a change in the incorrect direction asymptotically
vanishes with time, (iii) the method is recursive with constant computation per
unit time, and (iv) the probabilities of false alarm and incorrect detection
may be directly traded off with average delay. Performance results using
simulation confirm the derived properties and also reveal that the average
delay, after a transient period corresponding to when the starting state is
uncertain, approaches that of the optimal one-sided test, CUSUM.
