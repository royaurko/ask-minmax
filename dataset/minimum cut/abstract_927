We have made an extensive search for grouping amongst the near Earth
asteroids (NEAs). We used two D- functions and rigorous cluster analysis
approach. We have found sev- eral new groups (associations) among the NEAs: the
objects moving on similar orbits with small minimum orbital intersection
distances (MOID) with the Earth trajectory. Reliability of some of these groups
is quite high.
