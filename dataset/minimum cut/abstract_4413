The Gaussian formula and spherical aberrations of the static and relativistic
curved mirrors are analyzed using the optical path length (OPL) and Fermat's
principle. The geometrical figures generated by the rotation of conic sections
about their symmetry axes are considered for the shapes of the mirrors. By
comparing the results in static and relativistic cases, it is shown that the
focal lengths and the spherical aberration relations of the relativistic
mirrors obey the Lorentz contraction. Further analysis of the spherical
aberrations for both static and relativistic cases have resulted in the
information about the limits for the paraxial approximation, as well as for the
minimum speed of the systems to reduce the spherical aberrations.
