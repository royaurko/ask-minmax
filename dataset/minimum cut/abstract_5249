This article proposes a method to quantify the structure of a bipartite graph
using a network entropy per link. The network entropy of a bipartite graph with
random links is calculated both numerically and theoretically. As an
application of the proposed method to analyze collective behavior, the affairs
in which participants quote and trade in the foreign exchange market are
quantified. The network entropy per link is found to correspond to the
macroeconomic situation. A finite mixture of Gumbel distributions is used to
fit the empirical distribution for the minimum values of network entropy per
link in each week. The mixture of Gumbel distributions with parameter estimates
by segmentation procedure is verified by the Kolmogorov--Smirnov test. The
finite mixture of Gumbel distributions that extrapolate the empirical
probability of extreme events has explanatory power at a statistically
significant level.
