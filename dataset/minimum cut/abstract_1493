We employ an automated detection algorithm to perform a global study of solar
prominence characteristics. We process four months of TESIS observations in the
He II 304 A line taken close to the solar minimum of 2008-2009 and focus mainly
on quiescent and quiescent-eruptive prominences. We detect a total of 389
individual features ranging from 25x25 to 150x500 Mm in size and obtain
distributions of many their spatial characteristics, such as latitudinal
position, height, size and shape. To study their dynamics, we classify
prominences as either stable or eruptive and calculate their average centroid
velocities, which are found to be rarely exceeding 3 km/s. Besides, we give
rough estimates of mass and gravitational energy for every detected prominence
and use these values to evaluate the total mass and gravitational energy of all
simultaneously existing prominences (10e12-10e14 kg and 10e29-10e31 erg,
respectively). Finally, we investigate the form of the gravitational energy
spectrum of prominences and derive it to be a power-law of index -1.1 +- 0.2.
