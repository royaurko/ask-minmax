The weighty evidences of specific transformations of the thermal motion in
pure water in the physiological temperature interval (PTI) from (30 +(-) 3)o C
to (42 +(-) 3)o C for warm-blooded organisms are presented. It is shown that
near the right end of the PTI (42 +(-) 3)o C the crystal-like thermal motion in
water transforms to argon-like one (i.e. the dynamic phase transition (DPT)
occurs). It is show that the similar transformation takes also place in
water-Mioglobin solutions. It is proposed that the DPT takes also place in the
intracellular water, where it stimulates the denaturation of proteins. The
restriction of the PTI on the left of (30 +(-) 3)o C is naturally explained by
the clusterization of water molecules, which strongly increases when
temperature drops. The middle, ((36 +(-) 1)o C), of the PTI for warm-blooded
organisms is disposed at the minimum of the heat capacity at constant pressure,
that forwards to the stability of heat-exchange for bio-cells.
