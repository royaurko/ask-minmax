We analyze the structure of the energy landscape of a well-relaxed 1000-atom
model of amorphous silicon using the activation-relaxation technique (ART
nouveau). Generating more than 40,000 events starting from a single minimum, we
find that activated mechanisms are local in nature, that they are distributed
uniformly throughout the model and that the activation energy is limited by the
cost of breaking one bond, independently of the complexity of the mechanism.
The overall shape of the activation-energy-barrier distribution is also
insensitive to the exact details of the configuration, indicating that
well-relaxed configurations see essentially the same environment. These results
underscore the localized nature of relaxation in this material.
