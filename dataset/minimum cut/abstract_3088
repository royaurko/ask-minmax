We use the KOI-13 transiting star-planet system as a test case for the
recently developed BEER algorithm (Faigler & Mazeh 2011), aimed at identifying
non-transiting low-mass companions by detecting the photometric variability
induced by the companion along its orbit. Such photometric variability is
generated by three mechanisms, including the beaming effect, tidal ellipsoidal
distortion, and reflection/heating. We use data from three Kepler quarters,
from the first year of the mission, while ignoring measurements within the
transit and occultation, and show that the planet's ephemeris is clearly
detected. We fit for the amplitude of each of the three effects and use the
beaming effect amplitude to estimate the planet's minimum mass, which results
in M_p sin i = 9.2 +/- 1.1 M_J (assuming the host star parameters derived by
Szabo et al. 2011). Our results show that non-transiting star-planet systems
similar to KOI-13.01 can be detected in Kepler data, including a measurement of
the orbital ephemeris and the planet's minimum mass. Moreover, we derive a
realistic estimate of the amplitudes uncertainties, and use it to show that
data obtained during the entire lifetime of the Kepler mission, of 3.5 years,
will allow detecting non-transiting close-in low-mass companions orbiting
bright stars, down to the few Jupiter mass level. Data from the Kepler Extended
Mission, if funded by NASA, will further improve the detection capabilities.
