Imposing a minimum principle in the framework of the so called crystal basis
model of the genetic code, we determine the structure of the minimum set of 22
anticodons which allows the translational-transcription for animal
mitochondrial code. The results are in very good agreement with the observed
anticodons.
  Then, we analyze the evolution of the genetic code, with 20 amino acids
encoded from the beginning, from the viewpoint of codon-anticodon interaction.
Following the same spirit as above, we determine the structure of the
anticodons in the Ancient, Archetypal and Early Genetic codes. Most of our
results agree with the generally accepted scheme.
