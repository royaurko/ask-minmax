The Minimum Ignition Energy (MIE) of an initially Gaussian temperature
profile is found both by Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and from a new
novel model. The model is based on solving the heat diffusion equation in zero
dimensions for a Gaussian velocity distribution. The chemistry is taken into
account through the ignition delay time, which is required as input to the
model. The model results reproduce the DNS results very well for the Hydrogen
mixture investigated.
  Furthermore, the effect of ignition source dimensionality is explored, and it
is shown that for compact ignition kernels there is a strong effect on
dimensionality. Here, three, two and one dimensional ignition sources represent
a spherical kernel, a long spark and an ignition sheet, respectively.
