We report the use of photoassociative spectroscopy to determine the ground
state s-wave scattering lengths for the main bosonic isotopes of strontium,
86Sr and 88Sr. Photoassociative transitions are driven with a laser red-detuned
by up to 1400 GHz from the 1S0-1P1 atomic resonance at 461 nm. A minimum in the
transition amplitude for 86Sr at -494+/-5 GHz allows us to determine the
scattering lengths 610a0 < a86 < 2300a0 for 86Sr and a much smaller value of
-1a0 < a88 < 13a0 for 88Sr.
