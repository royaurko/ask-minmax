We show that fractional flux from Wilson lines can stabilize the moduli of
heterotic string compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. We observe that
the Wilson lines used in GUT symmetry breaking naturally induce a fractional
flux. When combined with a hidden-sector gaugino condensate, this generates a
potential for the complex structure moduli, Kahler moduli, and dilaton. This
potential has a supersymmetric AdS minimum at moderately weak coupling and
large volume. Notably, the necessary ingredients for this construction are
often present in realistic models. We explore the type IIA dual phenomenon,
which involves Wilson lines in D6-branes wrapping a three-cycle in a
Calabi-Yau, and comment on the nature of the fractional instantons which change
the Chern-Simons invariant.
