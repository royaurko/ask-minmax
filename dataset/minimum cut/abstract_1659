We report measurements of microwave transmission over the first five Mie
resonances of alumina spheres randomly positioned in a waveguide. Though
precipitous drops in transmission and sharp peaks in the photon transit time
are found near all resonances, measurements of transmission fluctuations show
that localization occurs only in a narrow frequency window above the first
resonance. There the drop in the photon density of states is found to be more
pronounced than the fall in the photon transit time, leading to a minimum in
the Thouless number.
