We find the minimum number $k=\mu'(\Sigma)$ for any surface $\Sigma$, such
that every $\Sigma$-embeddable non-bipartite graph is not $k$-extendable. In
particular, we construct the so-called bow-tie graphs $C_6\bowtie P_n$, and
show that they are $3$-extendable. This confirms the existence of an infinite
number of $3$-extendable non-bipartite graphs which can be embedded in the
Klein bottle.
