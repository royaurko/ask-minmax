In this paper we explore an identity in distribution of hitting times of a
finite variation process (Yor's process) and a diffusion process (geometric
Brownian motion with affine drift), which arise from various applications in
financial mathematics. As a result, we provide analytical solutions to the fair
charge of variable annuity guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) from a
policyholder's point of view, which was only previously obtained in the
literature by numerical methods. We also use complex inversion methods to
derive analytical solutions to the fair charge of the GMWB from an insurer's
point of view, which is used in the market practice, however, based on Monte
Carlo simulations. Despite of their seemingly different formulations, we can
prove under certain assumptions the two pricing approaches are equivalent.
