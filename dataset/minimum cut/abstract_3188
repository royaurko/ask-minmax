Recent observations of the solar corona with the LASCO coronagraph on board
of the SOHO spacecraft have revealed the occurrence of triple helmet streamers
even during solar minimum, which occasionally go unstable and give rise to
particularly huge coronal mass ejections. We present a method to calculate
(semi-)analytically self-consistent stationary configurations of triple helmet
streamers which can serve as input for stability considerations and dynamical
calculations. The method is based on an asymptotic expansion procedure using
the elongated structure of the streamers. The method is very flexible and can
be used in both Cartesian and spherical geometry. We discuss the effects of
magnetic shear, gravity and field-aligned flow on open field lines. Example
solutions illustrating the influence of each of these features on the solution
are presented.
