An $r$-graph is an $r$-regular graph where every odd set of vertices is
connected by at least $r$ edges to the rest of the graph. Seymour conjectured
that any $r$-graph is $r+1$-edge-colorable, and also that any $r$-graph
contains $2r$ perfect matchings such that each edge belongs to two of them. We
show that the minimum counter-example to either of these conjectures is a
brick. Furthermore we disprove a variant of a conjecture of Fan, Raspaud.
