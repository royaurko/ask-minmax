Optical monitoring of S5 0716+714 was performed with a 60/90 Schmidt
telescope in 2003 November and December and 2004 January for studying the
variability of the object on short timescales. Due to the high brightness of
the source we could carry out quasi-simultaneous measurements in three bands
with a temporal resolution of about 20 minutes by using one single telescope.
Intraday and intranight variations were observed with an overall change of ~0.9
mag during the whole campaign. Two outbursts were recorded on JD 2453005 and JD
2453009. Minimum timescales of a few hours were derived from the light curves
of individual nights but were different from night to night. A
bluer-when-brighter chromatism was present when the object was in fast flare,
but was absent when it was in a relatively quiescent state. Our results are
basically consistent with the shock-in-jet model and demonstrate that the
geometrical effects can sometimes play an important role in the variability of
blazars.
