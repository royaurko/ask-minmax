The squeezed states are states of minimum uncertainty, but unlike the
coherent states, in which the uncertainty in the position and the momentum are
the same, these allow to reduce the uncertainty, either in the position or in
the momentum, while maintaining the principle of uncertainty in its minimum. It
seems that this property of the squeezed states would allow you to get the
position eigenstates as a limit case of them, doing null the uncertainty in the
position and infinite at the momentum. However, there are two equivalent ways
to define the squeezed states, which lead to different expressions for the
limit states. In this work, we analyze these two definitions of the squeezed
states and show the advantages and disadvantages of using such definition to
find the position eigenstates. With this idea in mind, but leaving aside the
definitions of the squeezed states, we find an operator applied to the vacuum
that gives us the position eigenstates. We also analyze some properties of the
squeezed states, based on the new expressions obtained for the eigenstates of
the position.
