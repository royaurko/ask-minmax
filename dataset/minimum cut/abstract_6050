Quashnock and Lamb (1993) defined a sub-sample of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs)
from the publicly available BATSE database which shows clumping toward the
galactic plane, and concluded that all GRBs are galactic in origin. The
selection of these bursts (duplicated in this work in Sample 1) involved a peak
countrate (in counts s-1) uncorrected for aspect. We assert that the peak flux
of a burst is physically more meaningful than peak count-rate. Using, as
limits, the corresponding peak fluxes (in photons cm-2 s-1) for the bursts in
the QL sample, we find an additional 24 bursts, which we include in a new
sample (Sample 2). We find that the significance of anisotropy in Sample 2 is
much less than that of Sample 1, which does not support QL's interpretation of
the anisotropies as being due to a galactic population. To make meaningful
statistical statements regarding isotropy, burst samples must have peak fluxes
above a minimum flux, set by the requirement that a burst be detectable from
any direction (above the horizon) with respect to GRO, at any detection
threshold at which a burst was observed in that sample. We find that a sample
of such bursts has a marginal (2.6 sigma) deviation from isotropy, which we
consider insufficient to justify the claim that GRBs are galactic in origin.
