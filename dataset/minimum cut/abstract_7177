We present a composite light-curve model of the symbiotic nova PU Vul (Nova
Vulpeculae 1979) that shows a long-lasted flat optical peak followed by a slow
decline. Our model light-curve consists of three components of emission, i.e.,
an outbursting white dwarf (WD), its M-giant companion, and nebulae. The WD
component dominates in the flat peak while the nebulae dominate after the
photospheric temperature of the WD rises to log T (K) >~ 4.5, suggesting its WD
origin. We analyze the 1980 and 1994 eclipses to be total eclipses of the WD
occulted by the pulsating M-giant companion with two sources of the nebular
emission; one is an unocculted nebula of the M-giant's cool-wind origin and the
other is a partially occulted nebula associated to the WD. We confirmed our
theoretical outburst model of PU Vul by new observational estimates, that
spanned 32 yr, of the temperature and radius. Also our eclipse analysis
confirmed that the WD photosphere decreased by two orders of magnitude between
the 1980 and 1994 eclipses. We obtain the reddening E(B-V) ~ 0.3 and distance
to PU Vul d ~ 4.7 kpc. We interpret the recent recovery of brightness in terms
of eclipse of the hot nebula surrounding the WD, suggesting that hydrogen
burning is still going on. To detect supersoft X-rays, we recommend X-ray
observations around June 2014 when absorption by neutral hydrogen is minimum.
