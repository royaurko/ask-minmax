We investigate compactifications with duality twists and their relation to
orbifolds and compactifications with fluxes. Inequivalent compactifications are
classified by conjugacy classes of the U-duality group and result in gauged
supergravities in lower dimensions with nontrivial Scherk-Schwarz potentials on
the moduli space. For certain twists, this mechanism is equivalent to
introducing internal fluxes but is more general and can be used to stabilize
some of the moduli. We show that the potential has stable minima with zero
energy precisely at the fixed points of the twist group. In string theory, when
the twist belongs to the T-duality group, the theory at the minimum has an
exact CFT description as an orbifold. We also discuss more general twists by
nonperturbative U-duality transformations.
