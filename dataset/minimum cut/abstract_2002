We develop a simple thermodynamic model to describe the heat transfer
mechanisms and generation of acoustic waves in photoacoustic Raman spectroscopy
by small particulate suspensions in a gas. Using Langevin methods to describe
the thermal noise we study the signal and noise properties, and from the noise
equivalent power we determine the minimum number density of the suspended
particles that can be detected. We find that for some relevant cases, as few as
100 particles per cubic meter can be detected.
