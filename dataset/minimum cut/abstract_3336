The mergers of black hole-neutron star binaries are calcuated using a
pseudo-general relativistic potential that incorporates ${\mathcal
O}(v^2/c^2)^3$ post-Newtonian corrections. Both normal matter neutron stars and
self-bound strange quark matter stars are considered as black hole partners. As
long as the neutron stars are not too massive relative to the black hole mass,
orbital decay terminates in stable mass transfer rather than an actual merger.
For a normal neutron star, mass transfer results in a widening of the orbit but
the stable transfer ends before the minimum neutron star mass is reached. For a
strange star, mass transfer does not result in an appreciable enlargement of
the orbital separation, and the stable transfer continues until the strange
star essentially disappears. These differences might be observable through
their respective gravitational wave signatures.
