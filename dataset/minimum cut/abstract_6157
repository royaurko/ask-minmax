The influence of exponential magnetic field decay (MFD) on the spin evolution
of isolated neutron stars is studied. The ROSAT observations of several X-ray
sources, which can be accreting old isolated neutron stars, are used to
constrain the exponential and power-law decay parameters. We show that for the
exponential decay the ranges of minimum value of magnetic moment, $\mu_b$, and
the characteristic decay time, $t_d$, $\sim 10^{29.5}\ge \mu_b \ge 10^{28} {\rm
G} {\rm cm}^3$, $\sim 10^8\ge t_d \ge 10^7 {\rm yrs}$ are excluded assuming the
standard initial magnetic moment, $\mu_0=10^{30} {\rm G} {\rm cm}^3$. For these
parameters, neutron stars would never reach the stage of accretion from the
interstellar medium even for a low space velocity of the stars and a high
density of the ambient plasma. The range of excluded parameters increases for
lower values of $\mu_0$.
  We also show, that, contrary to exponential MFD, no significant restrictions
can be made for the parameters of power-law decay from the statistics of
isolated neutron star candidates in ROSAT observations.
  Isolated neutron stars with constant magnetic fields and initial values of
them less than $\mu_0 \sim 10^{29} {\rm G} {\rm cm}^3$ never come to the stage
of accretion.
  We briefly discuss the fate of old magnetars with and without MFD, and
describe parameters of old accreting magnetars.
