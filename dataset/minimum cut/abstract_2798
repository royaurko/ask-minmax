An important ingredient in the construction of phenomenologically viable
superstring models is the uplifting of Anti-de Sitter supersymmetric critical
points in the moduli sector to metastable Minkowski or de Sitter vacua with
broken supersymmetry. In all cases described so far, uplifting results in a
displacement of the potential minimum away from the critical point and, if the
uplifting is large, can lead to the disappearance of the minimum altogether. We
propose a variant of F-term uplifting which exactly preserves supersymmetric
critical points and shift symmetries at tree level. In spite of a direct
coupling, the moduli do not contribute to supersymmetry breaking. We analyse
the stability of the critical points in a toy one-modulus sector before and
after uplifting, and find a simple stability condition depending solely on the
amount of uplifting and not on the details of the uplifting sector. There is a
region of parameter space, corresponding to the uplifting of local AdS {\em
maxima} --or, more importantly, local minima of the Kahler function-- where the
critical points are stable for any amount of uplifting. On the other hand,
uplifting to (non- supersymmetric) Minkowski space is special in that all SUSY
critical points, that is, for all possible compactifications, become stable or
neutrally stable.
