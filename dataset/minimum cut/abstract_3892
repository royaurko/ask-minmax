The problem of mass generation is addressed by a Gaussian variational method
for the minimal left-right symmetric model of electroweak interactions. Without
any scalar bidoublet, the Gaussian effective potential is shown to have a
minimum for a broken symmetry vacuum with a finite expectation value for both
the scalar Higgs doublets. The symmetry is broken by the fermionic coupling
that destabilizes the symmetric vacuum, yielding a self consistent fermionic
mass. In this framework a light Higgs is only compatible with the existence of
a new high energy mass scale below 2 TeV.
