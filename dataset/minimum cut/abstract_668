The most median-based de noising methods works fine for restoring the images
corrupted by Randomn Valued Impulse Noise with low noise level but very poor
with highly corrupted images. In this paper a directional weighted minimum
deviation (DWMD) based filter has been proposed for removal of high random
valued impulse noise (RVIN). The proposed approach based on Standard Deviation
(SD) works in two phases. The first phase detects the contaminated pixels by
differencing between the test pixel and its neighbor pixels aligned with four
main directions. The second phase filters only those pixels keeping others
intact. The filtering scheme is based on minimum standard deviation of the four
directional pixels. Extensive simulations show that the proposed filter not
only provide better performance of de noising RVIN but can preserve more
details features even thin lines or dots. This technique shows better
performance in terms of PSNR, Image Fidelity and Computational Cost compared to
the existing filters.
