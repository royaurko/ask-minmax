We argue that the proton multiplicities measured in Roman pot detectors at an
electron ion collider can be used to determine centrality classes in incoherent
diffractive scattering. Incoherent diffraction probes the fluctuations in the
interaction strengths of multi-parton Fock states in the nuclear wavefunctions.
In particular, the saturation scale that characterizes this multi-parton
dynamics is significantly larger in central events relative to minimum bias
events. As an application, we study the centrality dependence of incoherent
diffractive vector meson production. We identify an observable which is
simultaneously very sensitive to centrality triggered parton fluctuations and
insensitive to details of the model.
