Context. Dome Fuji, the second highest region on the Antarctic plateau, is
expected to have some of the best astronomical seeing on Earth. However, site
testing at Dome Fuji is still in its very early stages.
  Aims. To investigate the astronomical seeing in the free atmosphere above
Dome Fuji, and to determine the height of the surface boundary layer.
  Methods. A Differential Image Motion Monitor was used to measure the seeing
in the visible (472 nm) at a height of 11 m above the snow surface at Dome Fuji
during the austral summer of 2012/2013.
  Results. Seeing below 0.2'' has been observed. The seeing often has a local
minimum of ~0.3'' near 18 h local time. Some periods of excellent seeing, 0.3''
or smaller, were also observed, sometimes extending for several hours at local
midnight. The median seeing is higher, at 0.52''---this large value is believed
to be caused by periods when the telescope was within the turbulent boundary
layer.
  Conclusions. The diurnal variation of the daytime seeing at Dome Fuji is
similar to that reported for Dome C, and the height of the surface boundary
layer is consistent with previous simulations for Dome Fuji. The free
atmosphere seeing is ~0.2'', and the height of the surface boundary layer can
be as low as ~11 m.
