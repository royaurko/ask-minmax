In this article we have suggested an improved estimator for estimating the
population mean in simple random sampling using auxiliary information under the
presence of measurement errors. The mean square error (MSE) of the proposed
estimator has been derived under large sample approximation. Besides,
considering the minimum case of the MSE equation, the efficient conditions
between the proposed and existing estimators are obtained. These theoretical
findings are supported by a numerical example.
