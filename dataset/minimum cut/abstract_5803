We consider the following interpolation problem. Suppose one is given a
finite set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, a function $f: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$,
and possibly the gradients of $f$ at the points of $E$ as well. We want to
interpolate the given information with a function $F \in C^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$
with the minimum possible value of $\mathrm{Lip} (\nabla F)$. We present
practical, efficient algorithms for constructing an $F$ such that
$\mathrm{Lip}(\nabla F)$ is minimal, or for less computational effort, within a
small dimensionless constant of being minimal.
