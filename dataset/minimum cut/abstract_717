Using 72 Short Gamma Ray Bursts (SGRBs) with well determined spectral data
observed by BATSE, we determine their redshift and the luminosity by applying
$E_p$--$L_p$ correlation for SGRBs found by \cite{tsutsui13}. For 53 SGRBs with
the observed flux brighter than $4 \times 10^{-6}~{\rm erg~cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$, the
cumulative redshift distribution up to $z=1$ agrees well with that of 22 {\it
Swift}~SGRBs. This suggests that the redshift determination by the $E_p$--$L_p$
correlation for SGRBs works well. The minimum event rate at $z=0$ is estimated
as $\rho_{SGRB}(0) = 6.3_{-3.9}^{+3.1} \times 10^{-10}~{\rm
events~Mpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ so that the minimum beaming angle is
$0.6^\circ-7.8^\circ$ assuming the merging rate of $10^{-7}-4\times
10^{-6}~{\rm events~Mpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ suggested from the binary pulsar data.
Interestingly, this angle is consistent with that for SGRB130603B of $\sim
4^\circ-8^\circ$\citep{fong13b}. On the other hand, if we assume the beaming
angle of $\sim 6^\circ$ suggested from four SGRBs with the observed value of
beaming angle, the minimum event rate including off-axis SGRBs is estimated as
$\rho_{SGRB,all}^{min}(0)=1.15_{-0.71}^{+0.57}\times 10^{-7}~{\rm
events~Mpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. If SGRBs are induced by coalescence of binary neutron
stars (NSs) and/or black holes (BHs), this event rate leads to the minimum
gravitational-wave detection rate of $\rm 3.9_{-2.4}^{+1.9}
(152_{-94}^{+75})~events~y^{-1}$ for NS-NS (NS-BH) binary, respectively, by a
worldwide network with KAGRA, advanced-LIGO, advanced-Virgo, and GEO.
