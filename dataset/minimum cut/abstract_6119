Radiative deceleration of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei as the
result of inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from accretion discs is
discussed. The Klein-Nishina (KN) cross section is used in the calculation of
the radiation force due to inverse Compton scattering. Our result shows that
deceleration due to scattering in the KN regime is important only for jets
starting with a bulk Lorentz factor larger than 1000. When the bulk Lorentz
factor satisfies this condition, particles scattering in the Thomson regime
contribute positively to the radiation force (acceleration), but those
particles scattering in the KN regime are dominant and the overall effect is
deceleration. In the KN limit, the drag due to Compton scattering, though less
severe than in the Thomson limit, strongly constrains the bulk Lorentz factor.
Most of the power from the deceleration goes into radiation and hence the
ability of the jet to transport significant power (in particle kinetic energy)
out of the subparsec region is severely limited. The deceleration efficiency
decreases significantly if the jet contains protons and the proton to electron
number density ratio satisfies the condition $n_p/n_{e0}>2\gamma_{\rm
min}/\mu_p$ where $\gamma_{\rm min}$ is the minimum Lorentz factor of
relativistic electrons (or positrons) in the jet frame and $\mu_p$ is the
proton to electron mass ratio.
