This paper presents a selective historical perspective of fission research
over the last thirty-five years while Ray Nix has made central contributions to
the field. The emphasis is placed on early studies of the shell stabilized
secondary minimum in the static fission barrier and on the dynamic properties
of fission of hot nuclei, which have recently been the focus of intense study.
