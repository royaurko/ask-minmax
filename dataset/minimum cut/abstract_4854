We introduce a physical scalar sector in a SU(2)xU(1) electroweak theory in
which the gauge group is realized non linearly. By invoking theoretical as well
as experimental constraints, we build a phenomenologically viable model in
which a minimum of four scalar resonances appear, and the mass of the CP even
scalar is controlled by a vacuum expectation value; however, the masses of all
other particles (both matter as well as vector boson fields) are unrelated to
spontaneous symmetry breaking and generated by the St\"uckelberg mechanism. We
evaluate in this model the CP-even scalar decay rate to two photons and use
this amplitude to perform a preliminary comparison with the recent LHC
measurements. As a result, we find that the model exhibits a preference for a
negative Yukawa coupling between the top quark and the CP-even resonance.
