I consider model for flares proposed by P.-G de Gennes (PNAS, 101 (44),
15778-15781, 2004) and suggest a range for amplification factor (I) for
inhibitory neurons for the time evolution of non-divergent generations of
excitatory neurons which eventually die out. The exact numerical solution of
the model for the suggested range of the factor (I) then provides minimum
number of neurons describing size (M) for memory objects. The obtained size is
M = 8 to 12.75 and which is larger than the size M = 2 to 4 as obtained
theoretically by de Gennes.
