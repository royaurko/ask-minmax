We search for correlations between positions of extragalactic objects and
arrival directions of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) with primary
energy $E \ge 40$ EeV as observed by the surface detector array of the
Telescope Array (TA) experiment during the first 40 months of operation. We
examined several public astronomical object catalogs, including the Veron-Cetty
and Veron catalog of active galactic nuclei. We counted the number of TA events
correlated with objects in each catalog as a function of three parameters: the
maximum angular separation between a TA event and an object, the minimum energy
of the events, and the maximum redshift of the objects. We determine
combinations of these parameters which maximize the correlations, and calculate
the chance probabilities of having the same levels of correlations from an
isotropic distribution of UHECR arrival directions. No statistically
significant correlations are found when penalties for scanning over the above
parameters and for searching in several catalogs are taken into account.
