Using an advanced version of the hadron resonance gas model we have found
remarkable irregularities of relativistic heavy-ion collisions at chemical
freeze-out. They include an abrupt change of the effective number of degrees of
freedom at laboratory energies 8.9-11.6 AGeV and plateaus in the
collision-energy dependence of the entropy per baryon, total pion number per
baryon, and thermal pion number per baryon at laboratory energies 6.9-11.6
AGeV. Also at chemical freeze-out we observe a sharp peak in the dimensionless
trace anomaly at laboratory energy 11.6 AGeV. On the basis of the generalized
shock-adiabat model we demonstrate that these observations give evidence for
the anomalous thermodynamic properties of the mixed phase at its boundary to
the quark-gluon plasma. We argue that the trace anomaly peak and the local
minimum of the generalized specific volume observed at a laboratory energy of
11.6 AGeV provide a signal for the formation of a mixed phase between the
quark-gluon plasma and the hadron phase.
