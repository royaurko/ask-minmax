The model-free analysis of experimental data in the intensities of two-step
cascades into 163Dy shows, that the basically special features of the cascade
gamma-decay of its compound-state completely correspond to those observed in
other nuclei. Thus, the density of the levels in this nucleus with good
precision it is reproduced as sum of three, five, seven-quasiparticle
excitations with the tenfold, as the minimum, by an increase due to vibration
type excitations. The greatest changes in the sum of the radiation strength
functions of dipole primary gamma-transitions correlate with a change in the
number of excitable quasi-particles. Accordingly, model presentations about the
radiation strength functions of larger, than for those existing, accuracy must
consider as a quantity of excited quasi-particles, so the presence of the
vibration type excitations of all possible types. Moreover, the reliable
picture of the studied process can be obtained only from the approximation of
the distributions of the intensities of cascades in the function of energies of
their primary gamma-transitions.
