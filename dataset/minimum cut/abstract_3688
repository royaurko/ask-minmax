The phase ordering dynamics of coupled chaotic bistable maps on lattices with
defects is investigated. The statistical properties of the system are
characterized by means of the average normalized size of spatial domains of
equivalent spin variables that define the phases. It is found that spatial
defects can induce the formation of domains in bistable spatiotemporal systems.
The minimum distance between defects acts as parameter for a transition from a
homogeneous state to a heterogeneous regime where two phases coexist The
critical exponent of this transition also exhibits a transition when the
coupling is increased, indicating the presence of a new class of domain where
both phases coexist forming a chessboard pattern.
