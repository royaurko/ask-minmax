The truncation scheme dependence of the exact renormalization group equations
is investigated for scalar field theories in three dimensions. The exponents
are numerically estimated to the next-to-leading order of the derivative
expansion. It is found that the convergence property in various truncations in
the number of powers of the fields is remarkably improved if the expansion is
made around the minimum of the effective potential. It is also shown that this
truncation scheme is suitable for evaluation of infrared effective potentials.
The physical interpretation of this improvement is discussed by considering
O(N) symmetric scalar theories in the large-N limit.
