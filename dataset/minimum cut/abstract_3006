Measurements of the top quark forward-backward asymmetry performed at the
Tevatron suggest that new-physics may be playing a role in t-tbar production.
To better understand the source of the asymmetry, recent proposals have called
for a measurement of the bottom and charm forward-backward asymmetries at the
Tevatron, using jets with embedded muons. Here we propose a corresponding
measurement of the bottom quark forward-central asymmetry designed to look for
similar effects in the b-sector at ATLAS and CMS. We construct a set of cuts
designed to enhance sensitivity to this asymmetry, and test our analysis on a
toy axigluon model representative of those used to explain the top asymmetry.
We find that if the relevant new-physics couplings to the bottom quark are
similar to those of the top, then the effects should be visible at the two
sigma level in less than 10 fb-1 of 7 TeV LHC data. Such a measurement would be
of general importance, and would provide valuable model-building input, serving
to restrict the set of models put forward to explain the Tevatron t-tbar
anomaly. However, a relatively low trigger threshold on non-isolated muons
inside hard jets must be maintained to allow for this measurement.
