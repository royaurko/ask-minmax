Amongst the many hundreds of transiting planet candidates discovered by the
Kepler Mission, one finds a large number of candidates with sizes between that
of the Earth and Neptune. The composition of these worlds is not immediately
obvious with no Solar System analog to draw upon and there exists some
ambiguity as to whether a given candidate is a rocky Super-Earth or a
gas-enveloped Mini-Neptune. The potential scientific value and observability of
the atmospheres of these two classes of worlds varies significantly and given
the sheer number of candidates in this size-range, there is evidently a need
for a quick, simple metric to rank whether the planets have an extended
atmosphere or not. In this work, we propose a way to calculate the 'minimum
atmospheric height' (R_MAH) using only a planet's radius and mass as inputs. We
assume and exploit the boundary condition that the bulk composition of a
solid/liquid Super-Earth cannot be composed of a material lighter than that of
water. Mass-radius loci above a pure-water composition planet correspond to
R_MAH>0. The statistical confidence of a planet maintaining an extended
atmosphere can be therefore easily calculated to provide a simple ranking of
target planets for follow-up observations. We also discuss how this metric can
be useful in the interpretation of the spectra of observed planetary
atmospheres.
