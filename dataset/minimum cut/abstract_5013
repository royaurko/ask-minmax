I discuss the key features of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) as a
numerical method - in particular the key differences between SPH and more
standard grid based approaches - that are important to the practitioner. These
include the exact treatment of advection, the absence of intrinsic dissipation,
exact conservation and more subtle properties that arise from its Hamiltonian
formulation such as the existence of a minimum energy state for the particles.
The implications of each of these are discussed, showing how they can be both
advantages and disadvantages.
