We present the results of study of random sequential adsorption of linear
segments (needles) on sites of a square lattice. We show that the percolation
threshold is a nonmonotonic function of the length of the adsorbed needle,
showing a minimum for a certain length of the needles, while the jamming
threshold decreases to a constant with a power law. The ratio of the two
thresholds is also nonmonotonic and it remains constant only in a restricted
range of the needles length. We determine the values of the correlation length
exponent for percolation, jamming and their ratio.
