A noncommutative complex scalar field, satisfying the deformed canonical
commutation relations proposed by Carmona et al. [27]-[31], is constructed.
Using these noncommutative deformed canonical commutation relations, a model
describing the dynamics of the noncommutative complex scalar field is proposed.
The noncommutative field equations are solved, and the vacuum energy is
calculated to the second order in the parameter of noncommutativity. As an
application to this model, the Casimir effect, due to the zero point
fluctuations of the noncommutative complex scalar field, is considered. It
turns out that in spite of its smallness, the noncommutativity gives rise to a
repulsive force at the microscopic level, leading to a modifed Casimr potential
with a minimum at the point amin= racine(5/84){\pi}{\theta}.
