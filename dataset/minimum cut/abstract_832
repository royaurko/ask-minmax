We investigate a decay of a bulk tachyon with a Kaluza-Klein momentum in
bosonic and Type 0 string theories compactified on S^1. Potential for the
tachyon has a (local) minimum. A decay of the tachyon would lead the original
theory to a strongly coupled theory. An endpoint of the decay would exist if
the strong coupling limit exists and it is a stable theory.
