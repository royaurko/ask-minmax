We discuss the recent application to strongly disordered systems of the
Critical Minimum Energy Subspace (CMES) method, used to limit the energy
subspace of the Wang-Landau sampling. We compare with our results on the 3D
Random Field Ising Model obtained by a multi-range Wang-Landau simulation in
the whole energy range. We point out at some problems that may arise when
applying the CMES scheme to models having a complex free energy landscape. PACS
