We define the AWGNC, BSC, and max-fractional pseudocodeword redundancy of a
code as the smallest number of rows in a parity-check matrix such that the
corresponding minimum pseudoweight is equal to the minimum Hamming distance. We
show that most codes do not have a finite pseudocodeword redundancy. We also
provide bounds on the pseudocodeword redundancy for some families of codes,
including codes based on designs.
