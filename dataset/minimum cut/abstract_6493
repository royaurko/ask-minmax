We have estimated the limiting branching ratio of the R-parity violating
(RPV) decay of the lighter top squark, $\tilde t_1 \ar l^+ d$ ($l=e$ or $\mu $
and d is a down type quark of any flavor), as a function of top squark
mass($\MST$) for an observable signal in the di-lepton plus di-jet channel at
the Tevatron RUN-II experiment with 2 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity. Our simulations
indicate that the lepton number violating nature of the underlying decay
dynamics can be confirmed via the reconstruction of $\MST$. The above decay is
interesting in the context of RPV models of neutrino mass where the RPV
couplings ($\lambda'_{i3j}$) driving the above decay are constrained to be
small ($\lsim 10^{-3} - 10^{-4} $). If $\tilde t_1$ is the next lightest super
particle - a theoretically well motivated scenario - then the RPV decay can
naturally compete with the R-parity conserving (RPC) modes which also have
suppressed widths. The model independent limiting BR can delineate the
parameter space in specific supersymmetric models, where the dominating RPV
decay is observable and predict the minimum magnitude of the RPV coupling that
will be sensitive to Run-II data. We have found it to be in the same ballpark
value required by models of neutrino mass, for a wide range of $\MST$. A
comprehensive future strategy for linking top squark decays with models of
neutrino mass is sketched.
