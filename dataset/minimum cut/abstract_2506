In this work, we study a class of generalized quasi-cyclic (GQC) codes called
skew GQC codes. By the factorization theory of ideals, we give the Chinese
Remainder Theorem over the skew polynomial ring, which leads to a canonical
decomposition of skew GQC codes. We also focus on some characteristics of skew
GQC codes in details. For a 1-generator skew GQC code, we define the
parity-check polynomial, determine the dimension and give a lower bound on the
minimum Hamming distance. The skew quasi-cyclic (QC) codes are also discussed
briefly.
