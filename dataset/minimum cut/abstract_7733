We compute the real-space power spectrum and the redshift-space distortions
of galaxies in the 2dF 100k galaxy redshift survey using pseudo-Karhunen-Loeve
eigenmodes and the stochastic bias formalism. Our results agree well with those
published by the 2dFGRS team, and have the added advantage of producing
easy-to-interpret uncorrelated minimum-variance measurements of the
galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-velocity and velocity-velocity power spectra in 27
k-bands, with narrow and well-behaved window functions in the range 0.01h/Mpc <
k < 0.8h/Mpc. We find no significant detection of baryonic wiggles, although
our results are consistent with a standard flat Omega_Lambda=0.7
``concordance'' model and previous tantalizing hints of baryonic oscillations.
We measure the galaxy-matter correlation coefficient r > 0.4 and the
redshift-distortion parameter beta=0.49+/-0.16 for r=1 (beta=0.47+/- 0.16
without finger-of-god compression). Since this is an apparent-magnitude limited
sample, luminosity-dependent bias may cause a slight red-tilt in the power
spectum. A battery of systematic error tests indicate that the survey is not
only impressive in size, but also unusually clean, free of systematic errors at
the level to which our tests are sensitive. Our measurements and window
functions are available at http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/2df.html together with
the survey mask, radial selection function and uniform subsample of the survey
that we have constructed.
