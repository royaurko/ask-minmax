We present direct evidence that magnetic clouds (MCs) have highly flattened
and curved cross section resulting from their interaction with the ambient
solar wind. Lower limits on the transverse size are obtained for three MCs
observed by ACE and Ulysses from the latitudinal separation between the two
spacecraft, ranging from 40$^{\circ}$ to 70$^{\circ}$. The cross-section aspect
ratio of the MCs is estimated to be no smaller than $6:1$. We offer a simple
model to extract the radius of curvature of the cross section, based on the
elevation angle of the MC normal distributed over latitude. Application of the
model to Wind observations from 1995 - 1997 (close to solar minimum) shows that
the cross section is bent concavely outward by a structured solar wind with a
radius of curvature of $\sim$ 0.3 AU. Near solar maximum, MCs tend to be convex
outward in the solar wind with a uniform speed; the radius of curvature is
proportional to the heliographic distance of MCs, as demonstrated by Ulysses
observations between 1999 and 2003. These results improve our knowledge of the
global morphology of MCs in the pre-Stereo era, which is crucial for space
weather prediction and heliosphere studies.
