This paper is the continuation of the research of the contributor and his
colleagues of the {\it canonical} decomposition of graphs. The idea of the
canonical decomposition is to define the binary operation on the set of graphs
and to represent the graph under study as a product of prime elements with
respect to this operation. We consider the graph together with the arbitrary
partition of its vertex set into $n$ subsets ($n$-partitioned graph). On the
set of $n$-partitioned graphs distinguished up to isomorphism we consider the
binary algebraic operation $\circ_H$ ($H$-product of graphs), determined by the
digraph $H$. It is proved, that every operation $\circ_H$ defines the unique
factorization as a product of prime factors. We define $H$-threshold graphs as
graphs, which could be represented as the product $\circ_{H}$ of one-vertex
factors, and the threshold-width of the graph $G$ as the minimum size of $H$
such, that $G$ is $H$-threshold. $H$-threshold graphs generalize the classes of
threshold graphs and difference graphs and extend their properties. We show,
that the threshold-width is defined for all graphs, and give the
characterization of graphs with fixed threshold-width. We study in detail the
graphs with threshold-widths 1 and 2.
