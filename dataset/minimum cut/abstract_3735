We derive upper and lower limits for the basic physical parameters
(mass-radius ratio, anisotropy, redshift and total energy) for arbitrary
anisotropic general relativistic matter distributions in the presence of a
cosmological constant. The values of these quantities are strongly dependent on
the value of the anisotropy parameter (the difference between the tangential
and radial pressure) at the surface of the star. In the presence of the
cosmological constant, a minimum mass configuration with given anisotropy does
exist. Anisotropic compact stellar type objects can be much more compact than
the isotropic ones, and their radii may be close to their corresponding
Schwarzschild radii. Upper bounds for the anisotropy parameter are also
obtained from the analysis of the curvature invariants. General restrictions
for the redshift and the total energy (including the gravitational
contribution) for anisotropic stars are obtained in terms of the anisotropy
parameter. Values of the surface redshift parameter greater than two could be
the main observational signature for anisotropic stellar type objects.
