We investigate the scattering of long-wavelength flexural phonons against
grain boundaries in graphene using molecular dynamics simulations. Three
symmetric tilt grain boundaires are considered: one with a misorientation angle
of $17.9^\circ$ displaying an out-of-plane buckling 1.5 nm high and 5 nm wide,
one with a misorientation angle of $9.4^\circ$ and an out-of-plane buckling 0.6
nm high and 1.7 nm wide, and one with a misorientation angle of $32.2^\circ$
and no out-of-plane buckling. At the flat grain boundary, the phonon
transmission exceeds 95 % for wavelengths above 1 nm. The buckled boundaries
have a substantially lower transmission in this wavelength range, with a
minimum transmission of 20 % for the $17.9^\circ$ boundary and 40 % for the
$9.4^\circ$ boundary. At the buckled boundaries, coupling between flexural and
longitudinal phonon modes is also observed. The results indicate that
scattering of long-wavelength flexural phonons at grain boundaries in graphene
is mainly due to out-of-plane buckling. A continuum mechanical model of the
scattering process has been developed, providing a deeper understanding of the
scattering process as well as a way to calculate the effect of a grain boundary
on long-wavelength flexural phonons based on the buckling size.
