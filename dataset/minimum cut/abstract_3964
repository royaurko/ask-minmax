We find examples of non-supersymmetric attractors in Type II string theory
compactified on a Calabi Yau three-fold. For a non-supersymmetric attractor the
fixed values to which the moduli are drawn at the horizon must minimise an
effective potential. For Type IIA at large volume, we consider a configuration
carrying D0, D2, D4 and D6 brane charge. When the D6 brane charge is zero, we
find for some range of the other charges, that a non-supersymmetric attractor
solution exists. When the D6 brane charge is non-zero, we find for some range
of charges, a supersymmetry breaking extremum of the effective potential.
Closer examination reveals though that it is not a minimum of the effective
potential and hence the corresponding black hole solution is not an attractor.
Away from large volume, we consider the specific case of the quintic in CP^4.
Working in the mirror IIB description we find non-supersymmetric attractors
near the Gepner point.
