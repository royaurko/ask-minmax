An experimental demonstration of two-qutrit state tomography via one-qutrit
symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM)
is presented. A two-qutrit state is encoded in the transversal paths of a
spontaneous parametric down-converted photon pair. A spatial light modulator
allows to implement the necessary 81 POVM elements to reconstruct the state.
The quality of the reconstruction is evaluated by comparing independent
measurements with the predicted results calculated with the reconstructed
state. Entanglement in the system is calculated via negativity and generalized
robustness from the two-qutrit reconstructed density operator.
