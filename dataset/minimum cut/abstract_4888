We studied the nonequilibrium magnetisation reversal in kinetic Ising
ferromagnets driven by periodic impulsive magnetic field in meanfield
approximation. The meanfield differential equation was solved by sixth order
Runge-Kutta-Felberg method. The periodicity and strength of the applied
impulsive magnetic field play the key role in magnetisation reversal. We
studied the minimum strength of impulsive field required for magnetisation
reversal at any temperature as a function of the periodicity of the impulsive
field. In the high temperature and small period this is observed to be linear.
The results are compared with that obtained from Monte Carlo simulation of a
three dimensional Ising ferromagnet.
