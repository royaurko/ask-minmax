Let $G$ be a finite graph with minimum degree $r$. Form a random subgraph
$G_p$ of $G$ by taking each edge of $G$ into $G_p$ independently and with
probability $p$. We prove that for any constant $\epsilon>0$, if
$p=\frac{1+\epsilon}{r}$, then $G_p$ is non-planar with probability approaching
1 as $r$ grows. This generalizes classical results on planarity of binomial
random graphs.
