The potential energy landscape in the Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones binary
mixture model has been studied carefully from liquid down to the supercooled
regime, from T =2 down to T =0.46. One thousand of independent configurations
along the time evolution have been examined at each investigated temperature.
  From the starting configuration we searched the nearest saddle (or
quasi-saddle) and minimum of the potential energy. The vibrational densities of
states for the starting and the two derived configurations have been evaluated.
Besides the number of negative eigenvalues of saddle, other quantities show
some signature of the approaching of the dynamical arrest temperature.
