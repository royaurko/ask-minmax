A suspended fluid film with two free surfaces convects when a sufficiently
large voltage is applied across it. We present a linear stability analysis for
this system. The forces driving convection are due to the interaction of the
applied electric field with space charge which develops near the free surfaces.
Our analysis is similar to that for the two-dimensional B\'enard problem, but
with important differences due to coupling between the charge distribution and
the field. We find the neutral stability boundary of a dimensionless control
parameter ${\cal R}$ as a function of the dimensionless wave number ${\kappa}$.
${\cal R}$, which is proportional to the square of the applied voltage, is
analogous to the Rayleigh number. The critical values ${{\cal R}_c}$ and
${\kappa_c}$ are found from the minimum of the stability boundary, and its
curvature at the minimum gives the correlation length ${\xi_0}$. The
characteristic time scale ${\tau_0}$, which depends on a second dimensionless
parameter ${\cal P}$, analogous to the Prandtl number, is determined from the
linear growth rate near onset. ${\xi_0}$ and ${\tau_0}$ are coefficients in the
Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation which describes the flow pattern near onset
in this system. We compare our results to recent experiments.
