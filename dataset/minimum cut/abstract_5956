An \emph{edge coloring} of a graph $G$ is strong if each color class is an
induced matching of $G$. The \emph{strong chromatic index} of $G$, denoted by
$\chi _{s}^{\prime }(G)$, is the minimum number of colors for which $G$ has a
strong edge coloring. The strong chromatic index of $G$ is equal to the
chromatic number of the square of the line graph of $G$. The chromatic number
of the square of the line graph of $G$ is greater than or equal to the clique
number of the square of the line graph of $G$, denoted by $\omega(L)$.
  In this note we prove that $\omega(L) \le 1.5 \Delta_{G}^2$ for every graph
$G$. Our result allows to calculate an upper bound for the fractional strong
chromatic index of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{fs}^\prime(G)$. We prove that
$\chi_{fs}^{\prime}(G) \le 1.75 \Delta_G^2$ for every graph $G$.
