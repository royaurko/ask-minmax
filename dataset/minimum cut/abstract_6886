Internet has played a vital role in this modern world, the possibilities and
opportunities offered are limitless. Despite all the hype, Internet services
are liable to intrusion attack that could tamper the confidentiality and
integrity of important information. An attack started with gathering the
information of the attack target, this gathering of information activity can be
done as either fast or slow attack. The defensive measure network administrator
can take to overcome this liability is by introducing Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDSs) in their network. IDS have the capabilities to analyze the
network traffic and recognize incoming and on-going intrusion. Unfortunately
the combination of both modules in real time network traffic slowed down the
detection process. In real time network, early detection of fast attack can
prevent any further attack and reduce the uncontributorized access on the targeted
machine. The suitable set of feature selection and the correct threshold value,
add an extra advantage for IDS to detect anomalies in the network. Therefore
this paper discusses a new technique for selecting static threshold value from
a minimum standard features in detecting fast attack from the victim
perspective. In order to increase the confidence of the threshold value the
result is verified using Statistical Process Control (SPC). The implementation
of this approach shows that the threshold selected is suitable for identifying
the fast attack in real time.
