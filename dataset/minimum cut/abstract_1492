The requirement for large bulk resistivity in topological insulators has led
to the design of complex ternary and quaternary phases with balanced donor and
acceptor levels. A common feature of the optimized phases is that they lie
close to the p to n transition. The tetradymite Bi2Te3_xSex system exhibits
minimum bulk conductance at the ordered composition Bi2Te2Se. By combining
local and integral measurements of the density of states, we find that the
point of minimum electrical conductivity at x=1.0 where carriers change from
hole-like to electron-like is characterized by conductivity of the mixed type.
Our experimental findings, which are interpreted within the framework of a two
band model for the different carrier types, indicate that the mixed state
originates from different type of native defects that strongly compensate at
the crossover point.
