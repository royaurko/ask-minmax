Exotic nuclear structures such as bubbles and tori are analyzed through
semiclassical extended Thomas-Fermi calculations with the Skyrme force SkM$^*$.
The variational equations for neutron and proton densities are solved fully
self-consistently in spherical (bubbles) and cylindrical (tori) symmetries. The
possible existence of bubble configurations in some astrophysical scenarios is
discussed. The stability of toroidal structures against change of quadrupole
moment is studied. A global minimum of the energy is found in heavy
