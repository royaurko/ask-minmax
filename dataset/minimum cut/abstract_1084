A consistent interpretation is given to some previously unexplained phenomena
seen in nature in terms of the recently discovered long-lived high spin super-
and hyper-deformed isomeric states. The Po halos seen in mica are interpreted
as due to the existence of such isomeric states in corresponding Po or nearby
nuclei which eventually decay by gamma- or beta-decay to the ground states of
210Po, 214Po and 218Po nuclei. The low-energy 4.5 MeV alpha-particle group
observed in several minerals is interpreted as due to a very enhanced alpha
transition from the third minimum of the potential-energy surface in a
superheavy nucleus with atomic number Z=108 (Hs) and atomic mass number around
271 to the corresponding minimum in the daughter.
