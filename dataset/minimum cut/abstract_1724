We study the flux pinning properties of superconductor/magnetic micro-rings
lattice hybrid structures. The used open triangular micromagnets represent an
eight-fold degree of freedom system, with six polarized and two flux-closure
possible states. By conveniently choosing the magnetic state of the underlying
rings it is possible to induce different pinning potentials. We show that the
magnetic vortex state with minimum stray field produces a weaker pinning in
comparison with the polarized states.
