We present an asymptotic analysis of the minimum probability of error (MPE)
in inferring the correct hypothesis in a Bayesian multi-hypothesis testing
(MHT) formalism using many pixels of data that are corrupted by signal
dependent shot noise, sensor read noise, and background illumination. We
perform this error analysis for a variety of combined noise and background
statistics, including a pseudo-Gaussian distribution that can be employed to
treat approximately the photon-counting statistics of signal and background as
well as purely Gaussian sensor read-out noise and more general, exponentially
peaked distributions. We subsequently apply the MPE asymptotics to characterize
the minimum conditions needed to localize a point source in three dimensions by
means of a rotating-PSF imager and compare its performance with that of a
conventional imager in the presence of background and sensor-noise
fluctuations. In a separate paper, we apply the formalism to the related but
qualitatively different problem of 2D super-resolution imaging of a closely
spaced pair of point sources in the plane of best focus.
