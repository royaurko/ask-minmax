The 11-year cycle of solar activity follows Hale's law by reversing the
magnetic polarity of leading and following sunspots in bipolar regions during
the minima of activity. In the 1996-97 solar minimum, most solar activity
emerged in narrow longitudinal zones - `active longitudes' but over a range in
latitude. Investigating the distribution of solar magnetic flux, we have found
that the Hale sunspot polarity reversal first occurred in these active zones.
We have estimated the rotation rates of the magnetic flux in the active zones
before and after the polarity reversal. Comparing these rotation rates with the
internal rotation inferred by helioseismology, we suggest that both `old' and
`new' magnetic fluxes were probably generated in a low-latitude zone near the
base of the solar convection zone. The reversal of active region polarity
observed in certain longitudes at the beginning of a new solar cycle suggests
that the phenomenon of active longitudes may give fundamental information about
the mechanism of the solar cycle. The non-random distribution of old-cycle and
new-cycle fluxes presents a challenge for dynamo theories, most of which assume
a uniform longitudinal distribution of solar magnetic fields.
