A new method of constructing optimum constant weight codes over F_2 based on
a generalized $(u, u+v)$ construction is presented. We present a new method of
constructing superimposed code $C_{(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_I)}^{(h_1, h_2, \cdots,
h_I)}$ bound. and presented a large class of optimum constant weight codes over
F_2 that meet the bound due to Brouwer and Verhoeff, which will be referred to
as BV . We present large classes of optimum constant weight codes over F_2 for
$k=2$ and $k=3$ for $n \leqq 128$. We also present optimum constant weight
codes over F_2 that meet the BV bound for $k=2,3,4,5$ and 6, for $n \leqq 128$.
The contributors would like to present the following conjectures :
  $C_{I}$: $C_{(s_1)}^{(h_1)}$ presented in this paper yields the optimum
constant weight codes for the code-length $n=3h_1$, number of information
symbols $k=2$ and minimum distance $d=2h_1$ for any positive integer $h_1$.
  $C_{II}$: $C_{(s_1)}^{(h_1)}$ yields the optimum constant weight codes at
$n=7h_1, k=3$ and $d=4h_1$ for any $h_1$.
  $C_{III}$: Code $C_{(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_I)}^{(h_1, h_2, \cdots, h_I)}$ yields
the optimum constant weight codes of length $n=2^{k+1}-2$, and minimum distance
$d=2^{k}$ for any number of information symbols $k\geq 3$.
