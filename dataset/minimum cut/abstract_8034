The Doppler wobble induced by the extra-solar planet HD 134987b was first
detected by data from the Keck Telescope nearly a decade ago, and was
subsequently confirmed by data from the Anglo-Australian Telescope. However, as
more data have been acquired for this star over the years since, the quality of
a single Keplerian fit to that data has been getting steadily worse. The best
fit single Keplerian to the 138 Keck and AAT observations now in hand has an
root-mean-square (RMS) scatter of 6.6 m/s. This is significantly in excess of
both the instrumental precision achieved by both the Keck and Anglo-Australian
Planet Searches for stars of this magnitude, and of the jitter expected for a
star with the properties of HD134987. However, a double Keplerian (i.e. dual
planet) fit delivers a significantly reduced RMS of 3.3 m/s. The best-fit
double planet solution has minimum planet masses of 1.59 and 0.82Mjup, orbital
periods of 258 and 5000d, and eccentricities of 0.23 and 0.12 respectively. We
find evidence that activity-induced jitter is a significant factor in our fits
and do not find evidence for asteroseismological p-modes. We also present seven
years of photometry at a typical precision of 0.003mag with the T8 0.8m
automatic photometric telescope at Fairborn observatory. These observations do
not detect photometric variability and support the inference that the detected
radial-velocity periods are due to planetary mass companions rather than due to
photospheric spots and plages.
