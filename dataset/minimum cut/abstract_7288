The term "Active Plasma Resonance Spectroscopy" (APRS) denotes a class of
related techniques which utilize, for diagnostic purposes, the natural ability
of plasmas to resonate on or near the electron plasma frequency $\omega_{\rm
pe}$: A radio frequent signal (in the GHz range) is coupled into the plasma via
an antenna or probe, the spectral response is recorded, and a mathematical
model is used to determine plasma parameters like the electron density or the
electron temperature.
  This manuscript provides a kinetic description of APRS valid for all
pressures and probe geometries. Subject of the description is the interaction
of the probe with the plasma of its influence domain. In a first step, the
kinetic free energy of that domain is established which has a definite time
derivative with respect to the RF power. In the absence of RF excitation, it
assumes the properties of a Lyapunov functional; its minimum provides the
stable equilibrium of the plasma-probe system. Equipped with a scalar product
motivated by the second variation of the free energy, the set of all
perturbations of the equilibrium forms a Hilbert space. The dynamics of the
perturbations can be cast in an evolution equation in that space. The spectral
response function of the plasma-probe system consists of matrix elements of the
resolvent of the dynamical operator. An interpretation in terms of an
equivalent electric circuit model is given and the residual broadening of the
spectrum in the collisionless regime is explained.
