A $d$-dimensional hypercube drawing of a graph represents the vertices by
distinct points in $\{0,1\}^d$, such that the line-segments representing the
edges do not cross. We study lower and upper bounds on the minimum number of
dimensions in hypercube drawing of a given graph. This parameter turns out to
be related to Sidon sets and antimagic injections.
