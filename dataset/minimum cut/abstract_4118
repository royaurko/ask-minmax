We investigate the work dissipated during the irreversible unfolding of
single molecules by mechanical force, using the simplest model necessary to
represent experimental data. The model consists of two levels (folded and
unfolded states) separated by an intermediate barrier. We compute the
probability distribution for the dissipated work and give analytical
expressions for the average and variance of the distribution. To first order,
the amount of dissipated work is directly proportional to the rate of
application of force (the loading rate), and to the relaxation time of the
molecule. The model yields estimates for parameters that characterize the
unfolding kinetics under force in agreement with those obtained in recent
experimental results (Liphardt, J., et al. (2002) {\em Science}, {\bf 296}
1832-1835). We obtain a general equation for the minimum number of repeated
experiments needed to obtain an equilibrium free energy, to within $k_BT$, from
non-equilibrium experiments using the Jarzynski formula. The number of
irreversible experiments grows exponentially with the ratio of the average
dissipated work, $\bar{\Wdis}$, to $k_BT$.}
