The Balitskii-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) multi-Pomeron model of Levin and
Rezaeian, with extension to the gluon saturation region, is applied to
long-range pseudorapidity correlations on relative azimuth for low momentum
final-state hadrons produced in $\sqrt{s}$ = 200~GeV and 7~TeV p+p collisions.
The multi-Pomeron exchange probabilities in the model were estimated by fitting
the minimum-bias p+p multiplicity frequency distributions. The multi-Pomeron
model prediction for the amplitude of the minimum-bias average quadrupole
correlation, proportional to $\cos 2(\phi_1 - \phi_2)$, is consistent with the
200~GeV data when theoretically expected gluon saturation momentum scales are
used. Correlation predictions for the high multiplicity 7~TeV p+p collision
data are also consistent with the long-range pseudorapidity correlations at
small relative azimuth observed in the data. The results presented here show
that the present application of a multiple parton-shower, gluon interference
mechanism for generating the long-range pseudorapidity, azimuthal quadrupole
correlation is not excluded by the data.
