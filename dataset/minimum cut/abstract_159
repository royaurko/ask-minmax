The article introduces spatial long-range dependent models based on the
fractional difference operators associated with the Gegenbauer polynomials. The
results on consistency and asymptotic normality of a class of minimum contrast
estimators of long-range dependence parameters of the models are obtained. A
methodology to verify assumptions for consistency and asymptotic normality of
minimum contrast estimators is developed. Numerical results are presented to
confirm the theoretical findings.
