We present a unified large system analysis of linear receivers for a class of
random matrix channels. The technique unifies the analysis of both the
minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) receiver and the adaptive least-squares (ALS)
receiver, and also uses a common approach for both random i.i.d. and random
orthogonal precoding. We derive expressions for the asymptotic
signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) of the MMSE receiver, and both the
transient and steady-state SINR of the ALS receiver, trained using either
i.i.d. data sequences or orthogonal training sequences. The results are in
terms of key system parameters, and allow for arbitrary distributions of the
power of each of the data streams and the eigenvalues of the channel
correlation matrix. In the case of the ALS receiver, we allow a diagonal
loading constant and an arbitrary data windowing function. For i.i.d. training
sequences and no diagonal loading, we give a fundamental relationship between
the transient/steady-state SINR of the ALS and the MMSE receivers. We
demonstrate that for a particular ratio of receive to transmit dimensions and
window shape, all channels which have the same MMSE SINR have an identical
transient ALS SINR response. We demonstrate several applications of the
results, including an optimization of information throughput with respect to
training sequence length in coded block transmission.
