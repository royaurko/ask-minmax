We report the discovery of a Neptune-mass planet around Gl 581 (M3V, M = 0.31
Msol), based on precise Doppler measurements with the HARPS spectrograph at La
Silla Observatory. The radial velocities reveal a circular orbit of period P =
5.366 days and semi-amplitude K1 = 13.2 m/s. The resulting minimum mass of the
planet (m2 sin i) is only 0.052 Mjup = 0.97 Mnep = 16.6 Mearth making Gl 581b
one of the lightest extra-solar planet known to date. The Gl 581 planetary
system is only the third centered on an M dwarf, joining the Gl 876
three-planet system and the lone planet around Gl 436. Its discovery reinforces
the emerging tendency of such planets to be of low mass, and found at short
orbital periods. The statistical properties of the planets orbiting M dwarfs do
not seem to match a simple mass scaling of their counterparts around solar-type
stars.
