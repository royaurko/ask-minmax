The XMM-Newton observation of the nearby FR-II radio galaxy 3C 98 is
reported. In two exposures on the target, faint diffuse X-ray emission
associated with the radio lobes was significantly detected, together with a
bright X-ray active nucleus, of which the 2 -- 10 keV intrinsic luminosity is
(4 -- 8) \times 10^{42} erg s-1. The EPIC spectra of the northern and southern
lobes are reproduced by a single power law model modified by the Galactic
absorption, with a photon index of 2.2-0.5+0.6 and 1.7-0.6+0.7 respectively.
These indices are consistent with that of the radio synchrotron spectrum, 1.73
+- 0.01 The luminosity of the northern and southern lobes are measured to be
8.3-2.6+3.3 \times 10^{40} erg s-1 and 9.2-4.3+5.7 \times 10^{40} erg s-1,
respectively, in the 0.7 -- 7 keV range. The diffuse X-ray emission is
interpreted as an inverse-Compton emission, produced when the
synchrotron-emitting energetic electrons in the lobes scatter off the cosmic
microwave background photons. The magnetic field in the lobes is calculated to
be about 1.7 \mu G, which is about 2.5 times lower than the value estimated
under the minimum energy condition. The energy density of the electrons is
inferred to exceed that in the magnetic fields by a factor of 40 -- 50.
