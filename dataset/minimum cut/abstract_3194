Two dimensional realizations of self-consistent models for the ``perfect
elliptic disks'' were tested for global stability by gravitational N-body
integration. The family of perfect elliptic disk potentials have two isolating
integrals; time independent distribution functions f(E,I_2) which
self-consistently reproduce the density distribution can be found numerically,
using a modified marching scheme to compute the relative contributions of each
member in a library of orbits. The possible solutions are not unique: for a
given ellipticity, the models can have a range of angular momenta. Here results
are presented for cases with minimal angular momentum, hence maximal random
motion. As in previous work, N-body realizations were constructed using a
modified quiet start technique to place particles on these orbits uniformly in
action-angle space, making the initial conditions as smooth as possible. The
most elliptical models initially showed bending instabilities; by the end of
the run they had become slightly rounder. The most nearly axisymmetric models
tended to become more elongated, reminiscent of the radial orbit instability in
spherical systems. Between these extremes, there is a range of axial ratios
0.305 < b/a < 0.570 for which the minimum streaming models appear to be stable.
