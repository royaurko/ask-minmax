Adhesive forces are capable of deforming a soft elastic object when it comes
in contact with a flat rigid substrate. The contact is in stable equilibrium if
the total energy of the system arising from the elastic and surface forces
exhibits a minimum at a zero or at a slightly negative load. However, as the
system is continually unloaded, the energy barrier decreases and it eventually
disappears, thus leading to a ballistic separation of the contact. While this
type of contact splitting has received wide recognition, what has not been much
appreciated with these types of soft adhesion problems is that rupture of a
contact can also occur at any finite sub critical load in the presence of a
noise. The soft contact problems are unique in that the noise can be a-thermal,
whereas the metastable and stable states of the thermodynamic potential can
arise from the competition of the elastic and the inter-facial energies of the
system. Analysis based on activated rate theory and simulations based on
stochastic dynamics show that the contact rupture dynamics is amenable to a
force and noise induced escape of a particle from a potential well that is
generic to various types of colloidal and macromolecular processes. These ideas
are useful in understanding the results of a recent experiment involving the
noise activated rolling dynamics of a rigid sphere on a surface, where it is
pinned by soft micro-fibrils.
