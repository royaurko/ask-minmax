The phonon thermal conductivity of a multilayer is calculated for transport
perpendicular to the layers. There is a cross over between particle transport
for thick layers to wave transport for thin layers. The calculations shows that
the conductivity has a minimum value for a layer thickness somewhat smaller
then the mean free path of the phonons.
