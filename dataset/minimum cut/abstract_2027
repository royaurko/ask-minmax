A leptogenesis scenario in a supersymmetric standard model extended with
introducing right-handed neutrinos is reconsidered. Lepton asymmetry is
produced in the condensate of a right-handed sneutrino via the Affleck-Dine
mechanism. The LH_u direction develops large value due to a negative effective
mass induced by the right-handed sneutrino condensate through the Yukawa
coupling of the right-handed neutrino, even if the minimum during the inflation
is fixed at the origin. The lepton asymmetry is nonperturbatively transfered to
the LH_u direction by this Yukawa coupling.
