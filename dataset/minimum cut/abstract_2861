We study the Higgs potential in No-Scale F-SU(5), a model built on the
tripodal foundations of the Flipped SU(5) x U(1)_X Grand Unified Theory, extra
F-theory derived TeV scale vector-like particle multiplets, and the high scale
boundary conditions of No-Scale Supergravity. V_min, the minimum of the
potential following radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, is a function at
fixed Z-Boson mass of the universal gaugino boundary mass M_{1/2} and
tan{\beta}, the ratio of Higgs vacuum expectation values. The No-Scale
nullification of the bilinear Higgs soft term B_mu at the boundary reduces
V_min(M_{1/2}) to a one dimensional dependency, which may be secondarily
minimized. This "Super No-Scale" condition dynamically fixes tan beta and
M_{1/2} at the local minimum minimorum of V_min. Fantastically, the walls of
this theoretically established secondary potential coalesce in descent to a
striking concurrency with the previously phenomenologically favored "golden
point" and "golden strip".
