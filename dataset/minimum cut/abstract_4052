We describe a new complex system model of an evolving production economy.
This model is the simplest we can envisage which incorporates the new
observation that the rate of an economic production process depends only on the
minimum of its supplies of inputs. We describe how this condition gives rise to
a new type of complex multiple timescale dynamical evolution through a novel
type of bifurcation we call a `trapping bifurcation', which is also shown to be
one cause of non-equilibrium economic behaviour. Such dynamics is an example of
meta-level coupling which may also arise in other fields such as the
organization of a living cell as a network of molecular machines.
