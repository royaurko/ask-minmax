We discuss in this Letter the association of the candidate magnetar CXOU
J171405.7-381031 with the supernova remnant CTB 37B. The recent detection of
the period derivative of the object allowed an estimation of a young
characteristic age of only $\sim 1000 yr$. This value is too small to be
compatible even with the minimum radius of the remnant $\geq 10 pc$, the value
corresponding to the {\it lower} limit of the estimated distance of $10.2 \pm
3.5 kpc$, unless the true distance happens to be even smaller than the lower
limit. We argue that a consistent scenario for the remnant origin, in which the
latter is powered by the energy injected by a young magnetar, is indeed more
accurate to explain the young age, and points out to its non-standard (i.e.
magnetar-driven) nature.
