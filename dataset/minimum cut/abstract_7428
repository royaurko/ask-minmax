We present the results of a multi-wavelength study of circumstellar discs
around 44 young stellar objects in the 3 Myr old nearby Chamaeleon I
star-forming region. In particular, we explore the far-infrared/submm regime
using Herschel fluxes. We show that Herschel fluxes at 160-500$\,\mu$m can be
used to derive robust estimates of the disc mass. The median disc mass is
0.005$M_{\odot}$ for a sample of 28 Class IIs and 0.006$M_{\odot}$ for 6
transition disks (TDs). The fraction of objects in Chamaeleon-I with at least
the `minimum mass solar nebula' is 2-7%. This is consistent with previously
published results for Taurus, IC348, $\rho$ Oph. Diagrams of spectral slopes
show the effect of specific evolutionary processes in circumstellar discs.
Class II objects show a wide scatter that can be explained by dust settling. We
identify a continuous trend from Class II to TDs. Including Herschel fluxes in
this type of analysis highlights the diversity of TDs. We find that TDs are not
significantly different to Class II discs in terms of far-infrared luminosity,
disc mass or degree of dust settling. This indicates that inner dust clearing
occurs independently from other evolutionary processes in the discs.
