The generalized Fitting height of a finite group $G$ is the least number
$h=h^*(G)$ such that $F^*_h(G)=G$, where the $F^*_i(G)$ is the generalized
Fitting series: $F^*_1(G)=F^*(G)$ and $F^*_{i+1}(G)$ is the inverse image of
$F^*(G/F^*_{i}(G))$. It is proved that if $G$ admits a soluble group of
automorphisms $A$ of coprime order, then $h^*(G)$ is bounded in terms of $h^*
(C_G(A))$, where $C_G(A)$ is the fixed-point subgroup, and the number of prime
factors of $|A|$ counting multiplicities. The result follows from the special
case when $A=\langle\varphi\rangle$ is of prime order, where it is proved that
$F^*(C_G(\varphi ))\leqslant F^*_{9}(G)$.
  The nonsoluble length $\lambda (G)$ of a finite group $G$ is defined as the
minimum number of nonsoluble factors in a normal series each of whose factors
either is soluble or is a direct product of nonabelian simple groups. It is
proved that if $A$ is a group of automorphisms of $G$ of coprime order, then
$\lambda (G)$ is bounded in terms of $\lambda (C_G(A))$ and the number of prime
factors of $|A|$ counting multiplicities.
