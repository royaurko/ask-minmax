Using available multiwavelength data for the pulsars of different ages
detected in the optical range, we analyze the efficiencies of the conversion of
the pulsar spindown power \dot{E} into the observed non-thermal luminosity L in
different spectral domains. We find that these pulsars show significantly
non-monotonic dependencies of the optical and X-ray efficiencies (\eta =
L/\dot{E}) versus pulsar age with a pronounced minimum at the beginning of the
middle-age epoch and comparably higher efficiencies of younger and older
pulsars. In addition, we find a strong correlation between the optical and
2--10 keV X-ray luminosities of these pulsars that implies the same origin of
their nonthermal emission in both spectral domains.
