Stellar population and the interstellar gas-dust medium in the vicinity of
the open star cluster vdB 130 are analysed using optical observations taken
with the 6-m telescope of the SAO RAS and the 125-cm telescope of the SAI MSU
along with the data of Spitzer and Herschel. Based on proper motions and BV and
JHKs 2MASS photometric data, we select additional 36 stars as probable cluster
members. Some stars in vdB 130 are classified as B stars. Our estimates of
minimum colour excess, apparent distance modulus and the distance are
consistent with young age (from 5 to 10 Myrs) of the cluster vdB 130. We
suppose the large deviations from the conventional extinction law in the
cluster direction, with $R_V$ ~ 4 - 5. The cluster vdB 130 appears to be
physically related to the supershell around Cyg OB1, a cometary CO cloud,
ionized gas, and regions of infrared emission. There are a few regions of
bright mid-infrared emission in the vicinity of vdB 130. The largest of them is
also visible on H-alpha and [SII] emission maps. We suggest that the infrared
blobs that coincide in projection with the head of the molecular cloud are HII
regions, excited by the cluster B-stars. Some signatures of a shock front are
identified between these IR-bright regions.
