We demonstrate rather interesting manifestations of co-existence of resonance
features in characteristics of the photoionization of 3d-electrons in Xe, Cs
and Ba endohedral atoms. It is shown that for all of the considered atoms the
reflection by the fullerene shell of photoelectrons produced by the 3d subshell
photoionization affects greatly partial photoionization cross-sections of 3d5/2
and 3d3/2 levels and respective angular anisotropy parameters, both dipole and
non-dipole adding to all of them additional maximums and minimums. The results
obtained demonstrate distinctive differences between the three atoms.
  The calculations are performed treating the 3/2 and 5/2 electrons as
electrons of different kinds with their spins "up" and "down". The effect of
C60 shell is accounted for in the frame of the "orange" skin potential model.
It is essential that in the considered photon frequency region presented
resonance features are not affected by the C60 polarization.
