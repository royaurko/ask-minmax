We present high resolution 0.45" x 0.32" observations from the BIMA array
toward the Herbig Ae system MWC 480 in the lambda = 1.4 mm dust continuum. We
resolve a circumstellar disk of radius ~170 AU and constrain the disk
parameters by comparing the observations to flat disk models. These results
show that the typical fit parameters of the disk, such as the mass, Md ~
0.04-0.18 Mo, and the surface density power law index, p=0.5 or 1, are
comparable to those of the lower mass T Tauri stars. The dust in the MWC 480
disk can be modeled as processed dust material (beta ~ 0.8), similar to the
Herbig Ae star CQ Tau disk; the fitted disk parameters are also consistent with
less-evolved dust (beta ~ 1.2). The possibility of grain growth in the MWC 480
circumstellar disk is supported by the acceptable fits with beta ~ 0.8. The
surface density power-law profiles of p=0.5 and p=1 can be easily fit to the
MWC 480 disk; however, a surface density power-law profile similiar to the
minimum mass solar nebula model p=1.5 is ruled out at an 80% confidence level.
