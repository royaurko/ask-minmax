The angular momentum of the Kerr singularity should not be larger than a
threshold value so that it is enclosed by an event horizon: The Kerr
singularity with the angular momentum exceeding the threshold value is naked.
This fact suggests that if the cosmic censorship exists in our Universe, an
over-spinning body without releasing its angular momentum cannot collapse to
spacetime singularities. A simple kinematical estimate of two particles
approaching each other supports this expectation and suggests the existence of
a minimum size of an over-spinning body. But this does not imply that the
geometry near the naked singularity cannot appear. By analyzing initial data,
i.e., a snapshot of a spinning body, we see that an over-spinning body may
produce a geometry close to the Kerr naked singularity around itself at least
as a transient configuration.
