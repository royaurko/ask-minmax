In the framework of type IIB string compactifications on Calabi-Yau
orientifolds we describe how to construct consistent global embeddings of
models with fractional D3-branes and connected `flavour' D7-branes at del Pezzo
singularities with moduli stabilisation. Our results are applied to build an
explicit compact example with a left-right symmetric model at a dP_0
singularity which features three families of chiral matter and gauge coupling
unification at the intermediate scale. We show how to stabilise the moduli
obtaining a controlled de Sitter minimum and spontaneous supersymmetry
breaking. We find an interesting non-trivial dynamical relation between the
requirement of TeV-scale soft terms and the correct phenomenological values of
the unified gauge coupling and unification scale.
