Electron conductance in planar magnetic tunnel junctions with long-range
barrier disorder is studied within Glauber-eikonal approximation enabling exact
disorder ensemble averaging by means of the Holtsmark-Markov method. This
allows us to address a hitherto unexplored regime of the tunneling
magnetoresistance effect characterized by the crossover from
momentum-conserving to random tunneling as a function of the defect
concentration. We demonstrate that such a crossover results in a reentrant
magnetoresistance: It goes through a pronounced minimum before reaching
disorder- and geometry-independent Julliere's value at high defect
concentrations.
