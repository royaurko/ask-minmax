We study the remanent domain configurations of rectangular permalloy antidot
lattices over a range of lattice parameters. The influence of antidot diameter,
antidot spacing, and the aspect ratio of the lattice on the remanent domain
configuration are investigated by magnetic force microscopy and supported by
micromagnetic simulations. In the remanent state, areas of cells with the same
orientation of average magnetization form magnetic super domains separated by
super domain walls (SDWs). Two types of SDWs are identified. The first type is
characterized by low stray field energy, is linear, and expands over many
lattice constants. In contrast the second type shows high stray field energy
and is situated at kinks of low energy SDWs. Its width can vary from a minimum
of two lattice cells up to several lattice constants, depending on the lattice
parameters. The occurrence and structure of these two types of SDWs as function
of lattice parameters are classified and discussed in terms of the interplay of
stray field and exchange energy.
