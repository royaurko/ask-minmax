Modulation of galactic cosmic ray intensity is governed by several mechanisms
including diffusion, convection, adiabatic energy losses and drift. Relative
roles of these factors change in the course of an 11-year solar cycle. That can
result in the changes in the energy dependence of the 11-year cosmic ray
modulation. The minimum between the solar cycles 23 and 24 was extremely deep
and long-lasting which led to the record high cosmic ray fluxes low-energy
particles dominating. This was a signature of unusually soft energy spectrum of
the cosmic rays. In this work we examine the energy dependence of the 11-year
modulation during the last three solar cycles and argue that a soft energy
spectrum was observed in the minimum of each cycle however only for particles
below of energy around 10 GeV. From mid 1980s the energy dependence of cosmic
rays became softer from minimum to minimum of solar activity. The work is based
on the cosmic ray data of the spacecraft, balloon-borne and the ground-based
observations.
