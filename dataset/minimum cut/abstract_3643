Mesoscale objects with unusual structural features may serve as the analogues
of atoms in the design of larger-scale materials with novel optical, electronic
or mechanical behaviour. In this paper we investigate the structural features
and the equilibrium dynamics of micron-scale spherical crystals formed by
polystyrene particles adsorbed on the surface of a spherical water droplet. The
ground state of sufficiently large crystals possesses finite-length grain
boundaries (scars). We determine the elastic response of the crystal by
measuring single-particle diffusion and quantify the fluctuations of individual
dislocations about their equilibrium positions within a scar determining the
dislocation spring constants. We observe rapid dislocation glide with
fluctuations over the barriers separating one local Peierls minimum from the
next and rather weak binding of dislocations to their associated scars. The
long-distance (renormalised) dislocation diffusion glide constant is extracted
directly from the experimental data and is found to be moderately faster than
single particle diffusion. We are also able to determine the parameters of the
Peierls potential induced by the underlying crystalline lattice.
