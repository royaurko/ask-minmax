We demonstrate theoretically that one can obtain repulsive Casimir forces and
stable nanolevitations by using chiral metamaterials. By extending the Lifshitz
theory to treat chiral metamaterials, we find that a repulsive force and a
minimum of the interaction energy exist for strong chirality, under realistic
frequency dependencies and correct limiting values (for zero and infinite
frequencies) of the permittivity, permeability, and chiral coefficients.
