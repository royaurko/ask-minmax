In this monograph we develop results on global existence and convergence of
solutions to the gradient flow equation for the Yang-Mills energy functional on
a principal bundle, with compact Lie structure group, over a closed,
four-dimensional, Riemannian, smooth manifold, including the following. If the
initial connection is close enough to a minimum of the Yang-Mills energy
functional, in a norm or energy sense, then the Yang-Mills gradient flow exists
for all time and converges to a Yang-Mills connection. If the initial
connection is allowed to have arbitrary energy but we restrict to the setting
of a Hermitian vector bundle over a compact, complex, Hermitian (but not
necessarily Kaehler) surface and the initial connection has curvature of type
$(1,1)$, then the Yang-Mills gradient flow exists for all time, though bubble
singularities may (and in certain cases must) occur in the limit as time tends
to infinity. The Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality plays a crucial role in
our approach and we develop two versions of that inequality for the Yang-Mills
energy functional.
