We investigate the problem of fine tuning of the potential in the KKLMMT
warped flux compactification scenario for brane-antibrane inflation in Type IIB
string theory. We argue for the importance of an additional parameter psi_0
(approximated as zero by KKLMMT), namely the position of the antibrane,
relative to the equilibrium position of the brane in the absence of the
antibrane. We show that for a range of values of a particular combination of
the Kahler modulus, warp factor, and psi_0, the inflaton potential can be
sufficiently flat. We point out a novel mechanism for dynamically achieving
flatness within this part of parameter space: the presence of multiple mobile
branes can lead to a potential which initially has a metastable local minimum,
but gradually becomes flat as some of the branes tunnel out. Eventually the
local minimum disappears and the remaining branes slowly roll together, with
assisted inflation further enhancing the effective flatness of the potential.
With the addition of Kahler and superpotential corrections, this mechanism can
completely remove the fine tuning problem of brane inflation, within large
regions of parameter space. The model can be falsified if future cosmic
microwave background observations confirm the hint of a large running spectral
index.
