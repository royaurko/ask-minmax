We demonstrate that the recently proposed interacting growth walk (IGW)
model, modified for generating self-avoiding heteropolymers, proves to be a
simpler alternative to the other Monte Carlo methods available in the
literature for obtaining minimum energy conformation of lattice proteins. In
fact, this simple growth algorithm seems to be capable of quickly leading to
low energy states for all the three dimensional bench mark HP-sequences
investigated.
