The identification of low-energy conformers for a given molecule is a
fundamental problem in computational chemistry and cheminformatics. We assess
here a conformer search that employs a genetic algorithm for sampling the
conformational space of molecules. The algorithm is designed to work with
first-principles methods, facilitated by the incorporation of local
optimization and blacklisting conformers that prevents repeated evaluations of
very similar solutions. The aim of the search is not only to find the global
minimum, but to predict all conformers within an energy window above the global
minimum. The performance of the search strategy is evaluated for a reference
data set extracted from a database with amino acid dipeptide conformers
obtained by an extensive combined force field and first-principles search.
