We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the Ca II H & K core
strengths in a sample of 60 solar-type stars that are members of the solar-age
and solar-metallicity open cluster M67. We adopt the HK index, defined as the
summed H+K core strengths in 0.1 nm bandpasses centered on the H and K lines,
respectively, as a measure of the chromospheric activity that is present. We
compare the distribution of mean HK index values for the M67 solar-type stars
with the variation of this index as measured for the Sun during the
contemporary solar cycle. We find that the stellar distribution in our HK index
is broader than that for the solar cycle. Approximately 17% of the M67 sun-like
stars exhibit average HK indices that are less than solar minimum. About 7%-12%
are characterized by relatively high activity in excess of solar maximum values
while 72%-80% of the solar analogs exhibit Ca II H+K strengths within the range
of the modern solar cycle. The ranges given reflect uncertainties in the most
representative value of the maximum in the HK index to adopt for the solar
cycle variations observed during the period A.D. 1976--2004. Thus, ~ 20% - 30%
of our homogeneous sample of sun-like stars have mean chromospheric H+K
strengths that are outside the range of the contemporary solar cycle. Any
cycle-like variability that is present in the M67 solar-type stars appears to
be characterized by periods greater than ~ 6 years. Finally, we estimate a mean
chromospheric age for M67 in the range of 3.8--4.3 Gyr.
