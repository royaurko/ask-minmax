Can a gravitational lens magnify gravity? Leading theories of gravity likely
indicate "no", but the possibility might be testable by using our Sun as a
gravitational lens and carefully aligning a satellite past the minimum
transparent focal distance of about 25 AU. Here the magnitude of a maximal
effect is estimated and found potentially observable.
