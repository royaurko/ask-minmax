Spontaneous symmetry breaking usually occurs due to the tachyonic (spinodal)
instability of a scalar field near the top of its effective potential at $\phi
= 0$. Naively, one might expect the field $\phi$ to fall from the top of the
effective potential and then experience a long stage of oscillations with
amplitude O(v) near the minimum of the effective potential at $\phi = v$ until
it gives its energy to particles produced during these oscillations. However,
it was recently found that the tachyonic instability rapidly converts most of
the potential energy V(0) into the energy of colliding classical waves of the
scalar field. This conversion, which was called "tachyonic preheating," is so
efficient that symmetry breaking typically completes within a single
oscillation of the field distribution as it rolls towards the minimum of its
effective potential. In this paper we give a detailed description of tachyonic
preheating and show that the dynamics of this process crucially depend on the
shape of the effective potential near its maximum. In the simplest models where
$V(\phi) \sim -m^2\phi^2$ near the maximum, the process occurs solely due to
the tachyonic instability, whereas in the theories $-\lambda\phi^n$ with n > 2
one encounters a combination of the effects of tunneling, tachyonic instability
and bubble wall collisions.
