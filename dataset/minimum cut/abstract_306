Geometric optimisation algorithms are developed that efficiently find the
nearest low-rank correlation matrix. We show, in numerical tests, that our
methods compare favourably to the existing methods in the literature. The
connection with the Lagrange multiplier method is established, along with an
identification of whether a local minimum is a global minimum. An additional
benefit of the geometric approach is that any weighted norm can be applied. The
problem of finding the nearest low-rank correlation matrix occurs as part of
the calibration of multi-factor interest rate market models to correlation.
