We approach the Minimum Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) from an E_6 GUT
by using the spectral cover construction and non-abelian gauge fluxes in
F-theory. We start with an E_6 singularity unfolded from an E_8 singularity and
obtain E_6 GUTs by using an SU(3) spectral cover. By turning on SU(2) X U(1)^2
gauge fluxes, we obtain a rank 5 model with the gauge group SU(3) X SU(2) X
U(1)^2. Based on the well-studied geometric backgrounds in the literature, we
demonstrate several models and discuss their phenomenology.
