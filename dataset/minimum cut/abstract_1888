Given a graph G and a configuration C of pebbles on the vertices of G, a
pebbling step removes two pebbles from one vertex and places one pebble on an
adjacent vertex. The cover pebbling number g=g(G) is the minimum number so that
every configuration of g pebbles has the property that, after some sequence of
pebbling steps, every vertex has a pebble on it. We prove that the cover
pebbling number of the d-dimensional hypercube Q^d equals 3^d.
