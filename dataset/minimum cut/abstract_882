We construct examples of simply connected surfaces with genus 2 fibrations
over the projective line which are of "general type" according to the
definition of Campana. These fibrations have special fibres such that the
minimum of the multiplicities of the components is greater or equal to 2 while
the g.c.d is 1. We can extend the construction to any even genus g.
