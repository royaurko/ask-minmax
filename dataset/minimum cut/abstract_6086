The estimate of the ionizing UV background through the proximity effect
analysis is discussed. Taking into account the correct bending of the column
density distribution which appears in high resolution high s/n data, a value of
the UV background ~5x10^{-22} cgs is obtained in the redshift interval z=1.7-4
without indication of any appreciable redshift evolution. Inferences on the
spectral shape of the UV background between the HI and HeII edges are provided
by the study of metal line ratios like SiIV/CIV in optically thin systems. The
presence of a jump near the HeII edge seems favoured at very high redshifts
z>3. An increasing HeII jump with increasing redshift can be responsible for
the decreasing in the minimum temperatures of the Lyman alpha clouds with
increasing z. New studies of the cosmic evolution of star-forming galaxies
allow the estimate of a galaxy-dominated UV background intensity ~1.3 x10^{-21}
f_{esc} cgs at z=0.5 where f_{esc}<20% is the escape fraction of ionizing UV
photons from the galaxies. Finally it is also shown that in a UV background
dominated by QSOs and/or star-forming galaxies the cosmological baryon density
of the Lyman alpha clouds decreases rapidly with cosmic time possibly due to
increasing bulk heating in the intergalactic medium with cosmic time.
