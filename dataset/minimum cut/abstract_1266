We study a construction of Quantum LDPC codes proposed by MacKay, Mitchison
and Shokrollahi. It is based on the Cayley graph of Fn together with a set of
generators regarded as the columns of the parity-check matrix of a classical
code. We give a general lower bound on the minimum distance of the Quantum code
in $\mathcal{O}(dn^2)$ where d is the minimum distance of the classical code.
When the classical code is the $[n, 1, n]$ repetition code, we are able to
compute the exact parameters of the associated Quantum code which are $[[2^n,
2^{\frac{n+1}{2}}, 2^{\frac{n-1}{2}}]]$.
