The theory of superconductor-ferromagnet (S-F) heterostructures with two
ferromagnetic layers predicts the generation of a long-range, odd-in-frequency
triplet pairing at non-collinear alignment (NCA) of the magnetizations of the
F-layers. This triplet pairing has been detected in a Nb/Cu41Ni59/nc-Nb/Co/CoOx
spin-valve type proximity effect heterostructure, in which a very thin Nb film
between the F-layers serves as a normal conducting (nc) spacer. The resistance
of the sample as a function of an external magnetic field shows that for not
too high fields the system is superconducting at a collinear alignment of the
Cu41Ni59 and Co layer magnetic moments, but switches to the normal conducting
state at a NCA configuration. This indicates that the superconducting
transition temperature Tc for NCA is lower than the fixed measuring
temperature. The existence of a minimum Tc, at the NCA regime below that one
for parallel or antiparallel alignments of the F-layer magnetic moments, is
consistent with the theoretical prediction of a singlet superconductivity
suppression by the long-range triplet pairing generation.
