Erasure-correcting codes, that support {\em local repair} of codeword
symbols, have attracted substantial attention recently for their application in
distributed storage systems. This paper investigates a generalization of the
usual locally recoverable codes. In particular, this paper studies a class of
codes with the following property: any small set of codeword symbols is
recoverable from a small number of other symbols. This is referred to as {\em
cooperative local repair}. The main contribution of this paper is bounds on the
trade-off of minimum distance and the dimension of such codes, as well as
explicit constructions of families of codes that enable cooperative local
repair. Some other results regarding cooperative local repair are also
presented, including an analysis for the well-known Hadamard codes.
