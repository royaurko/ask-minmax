Magnetic 3d-ions doped into wide-gap oxides show signatures of room
temperature ferromagnetism, although their concentration is two orders of
magnitude smaller than that in conventional magnets. The prototype of these
exceptional materials is Co-doped ZnO, for which an explanation of the room
temperature ferromagnetism is still elusive. Here we demonstrate that magnetism
originates from Co2+ oxygen-vacancy pairs with a partially filled level close
to the ZnO conduction band minimum. The magnetic interaction between these
pairs is sufficiently long-ranged to cause percolation at moderate
concentrations. However, magnetically correlated clusters large enough to show
hysteresis at room temperature already form below the percolation threshold and
explain the current experimental findings. Our work demonstrates that the
magnetism in ZnO:Co is entirely governed by intrinsic defects and a phase
diagram is presented. This suggests a recipe for tailoring the magnetic
properties of spintronics materials by controlling their intrinsic defects.
