Let $G$ be a finite cyclic group. Every sequence $S$ of length $l$ over $G$
can be written in the form $S=(n_1g)\cdot\ldots\cdot(n_lg)$ where $g\in G$ and
$n_1, \ldots, n_l\in[1, \ord(g)]$, and the index $\ind(S)$ of $S$ is defined to
be the minimum of $(n_1+\cdots+n_l)/\ord(g)$ over all possible $g\in G$ such
that $\langle g \rangle =G$. In this paper, we determine the index of any
minimal zero-sum sequence $S$ of length 5 when $G=\langle g\rangle$ is a cyclic
group of a prime order and $S$ has the form $S=g^2(n_2g)(n_3g)(n_4g)$. It is
shown that if $G=\langle g\rangle$ is a cyclic group of prime order $p \geq
31$, then every minimal zero-sum sequence $S$ of the above mentioned form has
index 1 except in the case that
$S=g^2(\frac{p-1}{2}g)(\frac{p+3}{2}g)((p-3)g)$.
