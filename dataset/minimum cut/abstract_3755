We report studies of semileptonic decays, B --> X_c l nu, based on a sample
of 88 million BB events recorded with the BABAR detector. We have measured four
moments of the electron energy distribution and four moments of the hadronic
mass distribution, each as a function of the minimum electron energy. From
these moments we determine the inclusive branching fraction, the CKM matrix
element |V_cb|, and other heavy quark parameters, using Heavy Quark Expansions
(HQE) to order 1/m_b^3 in the kinetic mass scheme. In addition, we have studied
a large sample of exclusive B^0 --> D^*- l^+ nu decays. This sample is used to
extract the vector and axial form factors, the normalization and slope of the
HQET form factor to determine |V_cb|.
