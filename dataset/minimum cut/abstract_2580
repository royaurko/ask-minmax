The hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (HMCA) is applied for Bayesian parameter
estimation of the realized stochastic volatility (RSV) model. Using the 2nd
order minimum norm integrator (2MNI) for the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
in the HMCA, we find that the 2MNI is more efficient than the conventional
leapfrog integrator. We also find that the autocorrelation time of the
volatility variables sampled by the HMCA is very short. Thus it is concluded
that the HMCA with the 2MNI is an efficient algorithm for parameter estimations
of the RSV model.
