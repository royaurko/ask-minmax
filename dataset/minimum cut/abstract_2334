This paper concerns the reconstruction of possibly complex-valued
coefficients in a second-order scalar elliptic equation posed on a bounded
domain from knowledge of several solutions of that equation. We show that for a
sufficiently large number of solutions and for an open set of corresponding
boundary conditions, all coefficients can be uniquely and stably reconstructed
up to a well characterized gauge transformation. We also show that in some
specific situations, a minimum number of such available solutions equal to
$I_n=\frac12n(n+3)$ is sufficient to uniquely and globally reconstruct the
unknown coefficients. This theory finds applications in several coupled-physics
medical imaging modalities including photo-acoustic tomography, transient
elastography, and magnetic resonance elastography.
