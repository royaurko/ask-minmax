We propose experimental schemes to create and probe minimum forms of
different topologically ordered states in a plaquette of an optical lattice:
Resonating Valence Bond, Laughlin and string-net condensed states. We show how
to create anyonic excitations on top of these liquids and detect their
fractional statistics. In addition, we propose a way to design a plaquette
ring-exchange interaction, the building block Hamiltonian of a lattice
topological theory. Our preparation and detection schemes combine different
techniques already demonstrated in experiments with atoms in optical
superlattices.
