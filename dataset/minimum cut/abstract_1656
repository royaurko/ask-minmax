A system of self-consistent integral equations for the superconducting gap is
formulated and solved taking account of the instability of the normal phase of
bilayered cuprates against charge-density waves. The critical parameters are
calculated as a function of the wave vector, temperature, and doping index. It
is found that the region in which superconductivity coexists with d-type
charge-density waves depends strongly on the doping index. The effective
energy-gap parameter, determined as the interval between the peaks of the
density of states, can have a local minimum at temperatures T$<$T$_C$.
