The dynamics of polymeric salt solutions are presented. The salt consists of
chains $\rm A$ and $\rm B$, which are chemically different and interact with a
Flory-interaction parameter $\chi$, the $\rm A$ chain ends carry a positive
charge whereas the $\rm B$ chain ends are modified by negative charges. The
static structure factor shows a peak corresponding to a micro phase separation.
At low momentum transfer, the interdiffusion mode is driven by electrostatics
and is of the plasmon-type, but with an unusually low frequency, easily
accessible by experiments. This is due to the polymer connectivity that
introduces high friction and amplifies the charge scattering thus allowing for
low charge densities. The interdiffusion mode shows a minimum (critical slowing
down) at finite $k$ when the interaction parameter increases we find then a low
$k$ frequency quasi-plateau.
