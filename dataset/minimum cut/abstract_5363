Infrared photometry of the probable triple WC4(+O?)+O8I: Wolf-Rayet system HD
36402 (= BAT99-38) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) shows emission
characteristic of heated dust. The dust emission is variable on a time-scale of
years, with a period near 4.7 yr, possibly associated with orbital motion of
the O8 supergiant and the inner P ~ 3.03-d WC4+O binary. The phase of maximum
dust emission is close to that of the X-ray minimum, consistent with both
processes being tied to colliding wind effects in an elliptical binary orbit.
It is evident that Wolf-Rayet dust formation occurs also in metal-poor
environments.
