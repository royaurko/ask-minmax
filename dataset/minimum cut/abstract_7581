Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a simple polygon with $n$ vertices. The \emph{dual
graph} $T^*$ of a triangulation $T$ of $\mathcal{P}$ is the graph whose
vertices correspond to the bounded faces of $T$ and whose edges connect those
faces of $T$ that share an edge. We consider triangulations of $\mathcal{P}$
that minimize or maximize the diameter of their dual graph. We show that both
triangulations can be constructed in $O(n^3\log n)$ time using dynamic
programming. If $\mathcal{P}$ is convex, we show that any minimizing
triangulation has dual diameter exactly $2\cdot\lceil\log_2(n/3)\rceil$ or
$2\cdot\lceil\log_2(n/3)\rceil -1$, depending on $n$. Trivially, in this case
any maximizing triangulation has dual diameter $n-2$. Furthermore, we
investigate the relationship between the dual diameter and the number of
\emph{ears} (triangles with exactly two edges incident to the boundary of
$\mathcal{P}$) in a triangulation. For convex $\mathcal{P}$, we show that there
is always a triangulation that simultaneously minimizes the dual diameter and
maximizes the number of ears. In contrast, we give examples of general simple
polygons where every triangulation that maximizes the number of ears has dual
diameter that is quadratic in the minimum possible value. We also consider the
case of point sets in general position in the plane. We show that for any such
set of $n$ points there are triangulations with dual diameter in $O(\log n)$
and in $\Omega(\sqrt n)$.
