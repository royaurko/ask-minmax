Recently, we have discussed the coexistence of a finite energy one-half
monopole and a 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole of opposite magnetic charges. In this
paper, we would like to introduce electric charge into this new monopoles
configuration, thus creating a one and a half dyon. This new dyon possesses
finite energy, magnetic dipole moment and angular momentum and is able to
precess in the presence of an external magnetic field. Similar to the other
dyon solutions, when the Higgs self-coupling constant, $\lambda$, is
nonvanishing, this new dyon solution possesses critical electric charge, total
energy, magnetic dipole moment, and dipole separation as the electric charge
parameter, $\eta$, approaches one. The electric charge and total energy
increase with $\eta$ to maximum critical values as $\eta\rightarrow1$ for all
nonvanishing $\lambda$. However, the magnetic dipole moment decreases with
$\eta$ when $\lambda\geq0.1$ and the dipole separation decreases with $\eta$
when $\lambda\geq1$ to minimum critical values as $\eta\rightarrow1$.
