We analyse spectroscopic observations of WR20a revealing that this star is a
massive early-type binary system with a most probable orbital period of \sim
3.675 days. Our spectra indicate that both components are most likely of WN6ha
or O3If^*/WN6ha spectral type. The orbital solution for a period of 3.675 days
yields extremely large minimum masses of 70.7 \pm 4.0 and 68.8 \pm 3.8
M_{\odot} for the two stars. These properties make WR20a a cornerstone system
for the study of massive star evolution.
