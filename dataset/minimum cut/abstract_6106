We present late-time imaging and spectroscopic observations of the optical
transient (OT) of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 970508. Imaging observations roughly
200 and 300 days after the burst provide unambiguous evidence for the
flattening of the light-curve. The spectroscopic observations reveal two
persistent features which we identify with [O II] 3727 Angstrom and [Ne III]
3869 Angstrom at a redshift of z= 0.835 -- the same redshift as the absorption
system seen when the transient was bright. The OT was coincident with the
underlying galaxy to better than 370 milliarcsec or a projected radial
separation of less than 2.7 kpc. The luminosity of the [O II] line implies a
minimum star-formation rate of > 1 M_solar per year. In our assumed cosmology,
the implied restframe absolute magnitude is M_B = -18.55, or L_B = 0.12 L_*.
This object, the likely host of GRB 970508, can thus be characterized as an
actively star-forming dwarf galaxy. The close spatial connection between this
dwarf galaxy and the GRB requires that at least some fraction of progenitors be
not ejected in even the weakest galactic potentials.
