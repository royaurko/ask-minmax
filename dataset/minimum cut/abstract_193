Hadwiger's Conjecture states that every $K_{t+1}$-minor-free graph is
$t$-colourable. It is widely considered to be one of the most important
conjectures in graph theory. If every $K_{t+1}$-minor-free graph has minimum
degree at most $\delta$, then every $K_{t+1}$-minor-free graph is
$(\delta+1)$-colourable by a minimum-degree-greedy algorithm. The purpose of
this note is to prove a slightly better upper bound.
