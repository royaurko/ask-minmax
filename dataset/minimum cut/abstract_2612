We study the holographic mutual information in AdS4 of disjoint spatial
domains in the boundary which are delimited by smooth closed curves. A
numerical method which approximates a local minimum of the area functional
through triangulated surfaces is employed. After some checks of the method
against existing analytic results for the holographic entanglement entropy, we
compute the holographic mutual information of equal domains delimited by
ellipses, superellipses or the boundaries of two dimensional spherocylinders,
finding also the corresponding transition curves along which the holographic
mutual information vanishes.
