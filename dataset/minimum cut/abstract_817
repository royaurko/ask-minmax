At the LHC the resolution of dijet mass is compromised by the pile up of
energy from overlapping minimum bias events. Using anxillary measurements of
the jet mass and the energy in distant cones, the resolution can be improved,
as illustrated by a study of Z' of 120 GeV mass with the LHC operating at
design luminosity.
