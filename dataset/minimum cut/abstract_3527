We propose that the liquid-gas spinodal line of helium 3 reaches a minimum at
0.4 K. This feature is supported by our cavitation measurements. We also show
that it is consistent with extrapolations of sound velocity measurements.
Speedy [J. Phys. Chem. 86, 3002 (1982)] previously proposed this peculiar
behavior for the spinodal of water and related it to a change in sign of the
expansion coefficient alpha, i. e. a line of density maxima. Helium 3 exhibits
such a line at positive pressure. We consider its extrapolation to negative
pressure. Our discussion raises fundamental questions about the sign of alpha
in a Fermi liquid along its spinodal.
