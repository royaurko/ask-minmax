There are several mining algorithms of association rules. One of the most
popular algorithms is Apriori that is used to extract frequent itemsets from
large database and getting the association rule for discovering the knowledge.
Based on this algorithm, this paper indicates the limitation of the original
Apriori algorithm of wasting time for scanning the whole database searching on
the frequent itemsets, and presents an improvement on Apriori by reducing that
wasted time depending on scanning only some transactions. The paper shows by
experimental results with several groups of transactions, and with several
values of minimum support that applied on the original Apriori and our
implemented improved Apriori that our improved Apriori reduces the time
consumed by 67.38% in comparison with the original Apriori, and makes the
Apriori algorithm more efficient and less time consuming.
