We revisit the concavity property of the thermodynamic entropy in order to
formulate a general proof of the minimum energy principle as well as of other
equivalent extremum principles that are valid for thermodynamic potentials and
corresponding Massieu functions under different constraints. The current
derivation aims at providing a coherent formal framework for such principles
which may be also pedagogically useful as it fully exploits and highlights the
equivalence between different schemes. We also elucidate the consequences of
the extremum principles for the general shape of thermodynamic potentials in
relation to first-order phase transitions.
