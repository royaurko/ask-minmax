We report the discovery of two new short-period variable stars in the Lyra
constellation, GSC2.3 N208000326 and GSC2.3 N20B000251, observed at the
Astronomical Observatory of Autonomous Region of the Aosta Valley. Photometric
measurements collected during several days are presented and discussed. One
star appears to be a delta Scuti pulsating star (P=0.07848018+/-0.00000006
days; pulsation amplitudes V=0.055 mag and R=0.045; average
(V-R)=0.378+/-0.009, probable spectral type F2). Th identity of the second star
(P=0.402714+/-0.000008 days) resulted more difficult to be understood. We
propose that this object should be classified as an eclipsing binary system
where 0.065 and 0.055 are, respectively, the depths of the primary and
secondary minimum in the light curve, as observed with a non standard R filter.
