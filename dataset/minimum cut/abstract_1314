A set $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is a dominating set for $G$ if every
vertex outside of $S$ is adjacent to at least one vertex belonging to $S$. The
minimum cardinality of a dominating set for $G$ is called the domination number
of $G$. A map $f : V \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2\}$ is a Roman dominating function on
a graph $G$ if for every vertex $v$ with $f(v) = 0$, there exists a vertex $u$,
adjacent to $v$, such that $f(u) = 2$. The weight of a Roman dominating
function is given by $f(V) =\sum_{u\in V}f(u)$. The minimum weight of a Roman
dominating function on $G$ is called the Roman domination number of $G$. In
this article we study the Roman domination number of Cartesian product graphs
and strong product graphs. More precisely, we study the relationships between
the Roman domination number of product graphs and the (Roman) domination number
of the factors.
