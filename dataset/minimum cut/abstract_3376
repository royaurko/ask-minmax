We discuss the relation between angular momenta and masses of galaxy
structures base on the Li model of the universe with global rotation. In our
previous paper (God{\l}owski et al 2002) it was shown that the model predicts
the presence of a minimum in this relation. In the present paper we discuss
observational evidence allowing us to verify this relation. We find null
angular momentum J=0 for the masses corresponding to mass of galaxy grups and
non-vanishing angular momenta for other galactic structures. We check these
theoretical predictions analysing Tully's galaxy grups. The existing data
comparing alignment in different galactic structure are consistent with
obtained theoretical relation $J(M)$ if we interpret the groving alignment as
the galactic increasing angular momenta in the galactic structure.
