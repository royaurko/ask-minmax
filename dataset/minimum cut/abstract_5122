The very high momentum particle identification detector proposed for the
ALICE upgrade is a focusing RICH using a C4F10 gaseous radiator. For the
detection of Cherenkov photons, one of the options currently under
investigation is to use a CsI coated Triple-Thick-GEM (CsI-TTGEM) with metallic
or resistive electrodes. We will present results from the laboratory studies as
well as preliminary results of beam tests of a RICH detector prototype
consisting of a CaF2 radiator coupled to a 10x10 cm2 CsI-TTGEM equipped with a
pad readout and GASSIPLEX-based front-end electronics. With such a prototype
the detection of Cherenkov photons simultaneously with minimum ionizing
particles has been achieved for the first time in a stable operation mode.
