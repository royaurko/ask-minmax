Due to their ultra-short duration and peak currents in the kA range,
laser-wakefield accelerated electron bunches are promising drivers for
ultrafast X-ray generation in compact free-electron-lasers (FELs),
Thomson-scattering or betatron sources. Here we present the first single-shot,
high-resolution measurements of the longitudinal bunch profile obtained without
prior assumptions about the bunch shape. Our method allows complex features,
such as multi-bunch structures, to be detected. Varying the length of the gas
target, and thus the acceleration length, enables an assessment of the bunch
profile evolution during the acceleration process. We find a minimum bunch
duration of 4.2 fs (full width at half maximum) with shot-to-shot fluctuation
of 11% rms. Our results suggest that after depletion of the laser energy, a
transition from a laser-driven to a particle-driven wakefield occurs,
associated with the injection of a secondary bunch. The resulting double-bunch
structure might act as an elegant approach for driver-witness type experiments,
i.e. allowing a non-dephasing-limited acceleration of the secondary bunch in a
plasma-afterburner stage.
