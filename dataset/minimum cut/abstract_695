For any bipartite graph $H$, we determine a minimum degree threshold for a
balanced bipartite graph $G$ to contain a perfect $H$-tiling. We show that this
threshold is best possible up to a constant depending only on $H$.
Additionally, we prove a corresponding minimum degree threshold to guarantee
that $G$ has an $H$-tiling missing only a constant number of vertices. Our
threshold for the perfect tiling depends on either the chromatic number
$\chi(H)$ or the critical chromatic number $\chi_{cr}(H)$ while the threshold
for the almost perfect tiling only depends on $\chi_{cr}(H)$. Our results
answer two questions of Zhao. They can be viewed as bipartite analogs to the
results of Kuhn and Osthus and of Shokoufandeh and Zhao.
