The phase noise and intensity noise of a pulse train are theoretically
analyzed in the demodulation measurement. The effect of pulse asymmetry is
discussed for the first time using Fourier series. Experimentally,
photodetectors with different bandwidth and incident power levels are compared
to achieve minimum pulse distortion.
