We demonstrate that the multicanonical approach is not restricted to Monte
Carlo simulations, but can also be applied to simulation techniques such as
molecular dynamics, Langevin, and hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms. The
effectiveness of the methods are tested with an energy function for the protein
folding problem. Simulations in the multicanonical ensemble by the three
methods are performed for a penta peptide, Met-enkephalin. For each algorithm,
it is shown that from only one simulation run one can not only find the
global-minimum-energy conformation but also obtain probability distributions in
canonical ensemble at any temperature, which allows the calculation of any
thermodynamic quantity as a function of temperature.
