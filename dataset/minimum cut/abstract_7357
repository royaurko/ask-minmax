In a sequence of four papers, we prove the following results (via a unified
approach) for all sufficiently large $n$:
  (i) [1-factorization conjecture] Suppose that $n$ is even and $D\geq 2\lceil
n/4\rceil -1$. Then every $D$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has a
decomposition into perfect matchings. Equivalently, $\chi'(G)=D$.
  (ii) [Hamilton decomposition conjecture] Suppose that $D \ge \lfloor n/2
\rfloor $. Then every $D$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has a decomposition
into Hamilton cycles and at most one perfect matching.
  (iii) We prove an optimal result on the number of edge-disjoint Hamilton
cycles in a graph of given minimum degree.
  According to Dirac, (i) was first raised in the 1950s. (ii) and (iii) answer
questions of Nash-Williams from 1970. The above bounds are best possible. In
the current paper, we prove results on the decomposition of sparse graphs into
path systems. These are used in the proof of (i) and (ii) in the case when $G$
is close to the union of two disjoint cliques.
