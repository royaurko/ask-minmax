We report on a theoretical study of the electronic interface reconstruction
(EIR) induced by polarity discontinuity at a heterojunction between a polar and
a nonpolar Mott insulators, and of the two-dimensional strongly-correlated
electron systems (2DSCESs) which accompany the reconstruction. We derive an
expression for the minimum number of polar layers required to drive the EIR,
and discuss key parameters of the heterojunction system which control 2DSCES
properties. The role of strong correlations in enhancing confinement at the
interface is emphasized.
