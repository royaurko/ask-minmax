Using three-dimensional, moving-mesh simulations, we investigate the future
evolution of the recently discovered gas cloud G2 traveling through the
galactic center. From our simulations we expect an average feeding rate onto
Sgr A* in the range of $(5-19) \times 10^{-8} M_\odot\mathrm{~yr}^{-1}$
beginning in 2014. This accretion varies by less than a factor of three on
timescales of about 1 month, and shows no more than a factor of 10 difference
between the maximum and minimum observed rates within any given model. These
rates are comparable to the current estimated accretion rate in the immediate
vicinity of Sgr A*, although they represent only a small (<10%) increase over
the current expected feeding rate at the effective inner boundary of our
simulations $(r_\mathrm{acc} = 750 R_S \sim 10^{15} \mathrm{cm})$. We also
explore multiple possible equations of state to describe the gas. In examining
the Br-$\gamma$ light curves produced from our simulations, we find that all of
our isothermal models predict significant (factor of 10) enhancements in the
luminosity of G2 as it approaches pericenter, in conflict with observations.
Models that instead allow the cloud to heat as it is compressed do better at
matching observations.
