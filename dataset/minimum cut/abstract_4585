We report the results of pulsar searches in ten globular clusters using the
Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. One new binary millisecond pulsar has been
discovered in NGC 5986 with P=2.6 ms, P_orb=1.3 d, and a minimum companion mass
of 0.16 M_sun. The companion is most likely a Helium white dwarf. Eight of the
globular clusters we searched have central densities <10^4 L_sun pc^-3, making
this a good sample for studying the pulsar content of low density clusters. We
find no evidence for pulsars in clusters with very low densities <10^3 L_sun
pc^-3, consistent with theoretical predictions. Null results in many of
clusters we searched with moderate densities indicate that these systems do not
contain a bright MSP. Two clusters in particular, one with very low
metallicity, stand in contrast to theoretical calculations by Ivanova et al.
(2008). We also find that three body exchange interaction rates calculated by
Phinney (1996) seem to over predict the pulsar content in the clusters we
studied.
