The model of endofullerenes M@C60 with M=Li,Na,Cs,Cu,Ag are proposed for
study an effect of the nature of endoatoms upon features of the minimum energy
structures. They were calculated by SCF Hartree-Fock method with ECP (Ag and
Cs) and all-electronic basis sets assuming arbitrary symmetry distortion (C1
point group). All models display the off-center position for the endoatoms and
the charge transfer between M and the carbon cage strongly dependent on the
nature of endoatoms. Ionization potentials and atomic radii are proposed as the
basic factors providing the properties of endofullerenes
