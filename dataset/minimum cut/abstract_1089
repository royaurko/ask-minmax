Radiative strength functions (RSFs) in 93-98Mo have been extracted using the
(3He,alpha gamma) and (3He,3He' gamma) reactions. The RSFs are U-shaped as
function of gamma energy with a minimum at around E_gamma=3 MeV. The minimum
values increase with neutron number due to the increase in the low-energy tail
of the giant electric dipole resonance with nuclear deformation. The unexpected
strong increase in strength below E_gamma=3 MeV, here called soft pole, is
established for all 93-98Mo isotopes. The soft pole is present at all initial
excitation energies in the 5-8 MeV region.
