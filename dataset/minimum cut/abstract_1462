In the analysis of panel data that includes a time-varying covariate, a
Hausman pretest is commonly used to decide whether subsequent inference is made
using the random effects model or the fixed effects model. We consider the
effect of this pretest on the coverage probability of a confidence interval for
the slope parameter. We prove three new finite sample theorems that make it
easy to assess, for a wide variety of circumstances, the effect of the Hausman
pretest on the minimum coverage probability of this confidence interval. Our
results show that for the small levels of significance of the Hausman pretest
commonly used in applications, the minimum coverage probability of the
confidence interval for the slope parameter can be far below nominal.
