Dust emission from the Type II supernova SN 2002hh in NGC 6946 has been
detected at mid-infrared wavelengths by the Spitzer Space Telescope from 590 to
758 days after outburst and confirmed by higher angular resolution Gemini-N
mid-IR observations. The day-600 5.8-24 micron emission can be fit by a 290-K
blackbody having a luminosity of 1.6E+7 L_Sol. The minimum emitting radius of
1.1E+17 cm is too large for the emitting dust to have been formed in the
supernova ejecta. Using radiative transfer models and realistic dust grain
parameters, fits to the observed flux distribution could be obtained with an
optically thick dust shell having a mass of 0.10-0.15 M_Sol, corresponding to a
total dust+gas mass in excess of 10 M_Sol, suggesting a massive M supergiant or
luminous blue variable precursor to this self-obscured object.
