We have calculated the energies of the phase-separated states for degenerate
antiferromagnetic semiconductors including the possibility of the existence of
conduction electrons in the antiferromagnetic part of the phase-separated
states. It is demonstrated that, at T=0, the minimum energy corresponds to a
droplet phase with absence of electrons in the antiferromagnetic part.
