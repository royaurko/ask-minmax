There are quasi-conformal theories, like the Minimal and Ultraminimal
Technicolor models, which may break dynamically the gauge symmetry of the
Standard Model and at the same time are compatible with electroweak precision
data. The main characteristic of this type of models is their fermionic content
in one or more higher dimensional representations, therefore it is not
immediate to know which model leads to the most attractive channel or the
minimum vacuum energy state. We discuss the effective potential for composite
operators for these models, verifying that their vacuum energy values are
different, with the Ultraminimal model having a deeper minimum of energy.
