In the Standard Model, the Higgs potential allows only one minimum at
tree-level. But the open possibility that there might be two scalar doublets
enriches the vacuum structure, allowing for the risk that we might now be in a
metastable state, which we dub the panic vacuum. Current experiments at the LHC
are probing the Higgs particle predicted as a result of the spontaneous
symmetry breaking. Remarkably, in the two Higgs model with a softly broken U(1)
symmetry, the LHC experiments already preclude panic vacuum solutions.
