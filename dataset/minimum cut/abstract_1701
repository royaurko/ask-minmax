The influence of fluctuations and periodical driving on temporal
characteristics of short overdamped Josephson junction is analyzed. We obtain
the standard deviation of the switching time in the presence of a dichotomous
driving force for arbitrary noise intensity and in the frequency range of
practical interest. For sinusoidal driving the resonant activation effect has
been observed. The mean switching time and its standard deviation have a
minimum as a function of driving frequency. As a consequence the optimization
of the system for fast operation will simultaneously lead to minimization of
timing errors.
