We study a limited set of optical circuits for creating near maximal
polarisation entanglement {\em without} the usual large vacuum contribution.
 The optical circuits we consider involve passive interferometers, feed-forward
detection, down-converters and squeezers. For input vacuum fields we find that
the creation of maximal entanglement using such circuits is impossible when
conditioned on two detected auxiliary photons. So far, there have been no
experiments with more auxiliary photons. Thus, based on the minimum complexity
of the circuits required, if near maximal polarisation entanglement is possible
it seems unlikely that it will be implemented experimentally with the current
resources.
