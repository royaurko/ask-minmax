We study the occurrence of shell crossing in spherical weakly charged dust
collapse in the presence of a non-vanishing cosmological constant. We find that
shell crossing always occurs from generic time-symmetric regular initial data,
near the center of the matter configuration. For non-time-symmetric initial
data, the occurrence---or lack thereof---of shell crossing is determined by the
initial velocity profile, for a given mass and charge distribution. Physically
reasonable initial data inevitably leads to shell crossing (near the center)
before the minimum bounce radius is reached.
