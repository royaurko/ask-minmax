We predict the emergence of a roton minimum in the dispersion relation of
elementary excitations in cold atomic gases in the presence of diffusive light.
In large magneto-topical traps, multiple-scattering of light is responsible for
the collective behavior of the system, which is associated to an effective
Coulomb-like interaction between the atoms. In optically thick clouds, the
re-scattered light undergoes diffusive propagation, which is responsible for a
stochastic short-range force acting on the atoms. We show that the dynamical
competition between these two forces results on a new polariton mode, which
exhibits a roton minimum. Making use of Feynman's formula for the static
structure factor, we show that the roton minimum is related to the appearance
of long-range order in the system.
