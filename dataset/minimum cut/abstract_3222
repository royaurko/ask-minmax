In this paper a cluster is modelled as a smooth potential (due to the cluster
stars) plus the steady tidal field of the Galaxy. In this model there is a
minimum energy below which stars cannot escape. Above this energy, however, the
time scale on which stars escape varies with the orbital parameters of the star
(mainly its energy) in a way which we attempt to quantify, with both
theoretical arguments and computer simulations. Within the limitations of the
model we show that the time scale is long enough to complicate the
interpretation of full N-body simulations of clusters, and that stars above the
escape energy may remain bound to the cluster for about a Hubble time.
