The wave-vector (q) and doping dependences of the magnetic energy, iron
moment, and effective exchange interactions in LaFeAsO, BaFe2As2, and SrFe2As2\
are studied by self-consistent LSDA calculations for co-planar spin spirals.
For the undoped compounds, the calculated total energy, E(q), reaches its
minimum at q corresponding to stripe anti-ferromagnetic order. In LaFeAsO, this
minimum becomes flat already at low levels of electron-doping and shifts to an
incommensurate q at delta=0.2, where delta is the number of additional
electrons (delta>0) or holes (delta<0) per Fe. In BaFe2As2 and SrFe2As2, stripe
order remains stable for hole doping down to delta=-0.3. Under electron doping,
on the other hand, the E(q) minimum shifts to incommensurate q already at
delta=0.1.
