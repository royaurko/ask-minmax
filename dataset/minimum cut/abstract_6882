We present the discovery of substellar-mass companions to three stars by the
ongoing Penn State - Toru\' n Planet Search (PTPS) conducted with the 9.2-m
Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The K2-dwarf, BD +14 4559, has a 1.5 M$_{J}$ companion
with the orbital period of 269 days and shows a non-linear, long-term radial
velocity trend, which indicates a possible presence of another planet-mass body
in the system. The K3-giant, HD 240210, exhibits radial velocity variations
that require modeling with multiple orbits, but the available data are not yet
sufficient to do it unambiguously. A tentative, one-planet model calls for a
6.9 M$_J$ planet in a 502-day orbit around the star. The most massive of the
three stars, the K2-giant, BD +20 2457, whose estimated mass is 2.8$\pm$1.5
M$_\odot$, has two companions with the respective minimum masses of 21.4 M$_J$
and 12.5 M$_J$ and orbital periods of 380 and 622 days. Depending on the
unknown inclinations of the orbits, the currently very uncertain mass of the
star, and the dynamical properties of the system, it may represent the first
detection of two brown dwarf-mass companions orbiting a giant. The existence of
such objects will have consequences for the interpretation of the so-called
brown dwarf desert known to exist in the case of solar-mass stars.
