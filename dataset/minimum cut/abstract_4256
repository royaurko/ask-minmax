We discuss the identity of black hole entropy and show that the first law of
black hole thermodynamics, in the case of a Schwarzschild black hole, can be
derived from Landauer's principle by assuming that the black hole is one of the
most efficient information erasers in systems of a given temperature. The term
"most efficient" implies that minimal energy is required to erase a given
amount of information. We calculate the discrete mass spectra and the entropy
of a Schwarzschild black hole assuming that the black hole processes
information in unit of bits. The black hole entropy acquires a sub-leading
contribution proportional to the logarithm of its mass-squared in addition to
the usual mass-squared term without an artificial cutoff. We also argue that
the minimum of the black hole mass is $\sqrt{\log 2/(8\pi)}M_P$.
