We examine heterotic M-theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold with an
additional parallel M5 brane. The dominant non-perturbative effect stems from
open membrane instantons connecting the M5 with the boundaries. We derive the
four-dimensional low-energy supergravity potential for this situation including
subleading contributions as it turns out that the leading term vanishes after
minimisation. At the minimum of the potential the M5 gets stabilised at the
middle of the orbifold interval while the vacuum energy is shown to be
manifestly positive. Moreover, induced by the non-trivial running of the
Calabi-Yau volume along the orbifold which is driven by the G-fluxes, we find
that the orbifold-length and the Calabi-Yau volume modulus are stabilised at
values which are related by the G-flux of the visible boundary. Finally we
determine the supersymmetry-breaking scale and the gravitino mass for this open
membrane vacuum.
