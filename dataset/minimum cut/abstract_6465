A search for charginos and neutralinos, predicted by supersymmetric theories,
has been performed using a data sample of 10.3 pb^-1 at centre-of-mass energies
of sqrt(s) = 170 and 172 GeV with the OPAL detector at LEP. No evidence for
these particles has been found. The results are combined with those from
previous OPAL chargino and neutralino searches at lower energies to obtain
limits. Exclusion regions at 95% C.L. of parameters of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model are determined. Within this framework, for
tan(beta) >= 1.0, lower mass limits are placed on the lightest chargino and the
three lightest neutralinos. The 95% C.L. lower mass limit on the lightest
chargino, assuming that it is heavier than the lightest neutralino by more than
10 GeV, is 84.5 GeV for the case of a large universal scalar mass (m_0 > ~1
TeV) and 65.7 GeV for the smallest m_0 compatible with current limits on the
sneutrino and slepton masses. The lower limit on the lightest neutralino mass
at 95% C.L. for tan(beta) >= 1.0 is 24.7 GeV for m_0 = 1 TeV and 13.3 GeV for
the minimum m_0 scenario. These mass limits are higher for increasing values of
tan(beta). The interpretation of the limits in terms of gluino and scalar quark
mass limits is also given.
