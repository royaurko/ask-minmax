Let $X_{1},X_{2},...$ be a sequence of independent random variables ($rv$)
with common distribution function ($df$) $F$ such that $F(1)=0$. We consider
the simple statistical problem : find a statistics family of size $m\geq 1$
whose convergence, in probability or almost surely, to a point of some domain
$\mathcal{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ is equivalent that $F$ lies in the extremal
domain of attraction $\Gamma$. Such a family, whenever it exists, is called an
Empirical Characterizing Statistics Family for the EXTtremes (ECSFEXT). The
departure point of this theory goes back to Mason, who proved that the Hill
estimator converges a.s. to a positive real number for some particular
sequences if and only $F$ lies in the attaction domain of a Fr\'echet's law.
Considered for the whole attraction domain, the question becomes more complex.
We provide here an ECSFEXT of nine (9) elements and also characterize the
subdomains of $\Gamma$. The question of lowering m=9 to a minimum number is
launched.
