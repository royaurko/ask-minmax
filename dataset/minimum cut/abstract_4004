Multiplicative relations in the cohomology ring of a manifold impose
constraints upon its stable systoles. Given a compact Riemannian manifold
(X,g), its real homology H_*(X,R) is naturally endowed with the stable norm.
Briefly, if h\in H_k(X,R) then the stable norm of h is the infimum of the
Riemannian k-volumes of real cycles representing h. The stable k-systole is the
minimum of the stable norm over nonzero elements in the lattice of integral
classes in H_k(X,R). Relying on results from the geometry of numbers due to W.
Banaszczyk, and extending work by M. Gromov and J. Hebda, we prove
metric-independent inequalities for products of stable systoles, where the
product can be as long as the real cup length of X.
