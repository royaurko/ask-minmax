The number of contending neighbors of a node in a multihop ad hoc network has
to be adjusted while analyzing the performance of the network such as computing
the end-to-end delays along a path from a given source to a destination. In
this paper, we describe a method to adjust the number of contending neighbors
of a node in a multihop wireless ad hoc network. Our method is based on the
minimum number of neighbors that has to be common between two consecutive nodes
along a path. We derive an analytical expression for the adjustment factor.
