We present a method for automated segmentation of the vasculature in retinal
images. The method produces segmentations by classifying each image pixel as
vessel or non-vessel, based on the pixel's feature vector. Feature vectors are
composed of the pixel's intensity and continuous two-dimensional Morlet wavelet
transform responses taken at multiple scales. The Morlet wavelet is capable of
tuning to specific frequencies, thus allowing noise filtering and vessel
enhancement in a single step. We use a Bayesian classifier with
class-conditional probability density functions (likelihoods) described as
Gaussian mixtures, yielding a fast classification, while being able to model
complex decision surfaces and compare its performance with the linear minimum
squared error classifier. The probability distributions are estimated based on
a training set of labeled pixels obtained from manual segmentations. The
method's performance is evaluated on publicly available DRIVE and STARE
databases of manually labeled non-mydriatic images. On the DRIVE database, it
achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of
0.9598, being slightly superior than that presented by the method of Staal et
al.
