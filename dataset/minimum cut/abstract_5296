Dynamic-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) in liquid remains complicated due
to the strong viscous damping of the cantilever resonance. Here we show that a
high-quality resonance (Q>20) can be achieved in aqueous solution by attaching
a microgram-bead at the end of the nanogram-cantilever. The resulting increase
in cantilever mass causes the resonance frequency to drop significantly.
However, the force sensitivity --- as expressed via the minimum detectable
force gradient --- is hardly affected, because of the enhanced quality factor.
Via the enhancement of the quality factor, the attached bead also reduces the
relative importance of noise in the deflection detector. It can thus yield an
improved signal-to-noise ratio when this detector noise is significant. We
describe and analyze these effects for a set-up which includes magnetic
actuation of the cantilevers and which can be easily implemented in any AFM
system that is compatible with an inverted optical microscope.
