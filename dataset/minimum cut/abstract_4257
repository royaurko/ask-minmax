We present a simple and realistic model of supersymmetry breaking. In
addition to the minimal supersymmetric standard model, we only introduce a
hidden sector gauge group SU(5) and three fields X, F and \bar{F}.
Supersymmetry is broken at a local minimum of the potential, and its effects
are transmitted to the supersymmetric standard model sector through both
standard model gauge loops and local operators suppressed by the cutoff scale,
which is taken to be the unification scale. The form of the local operators is
controlled by a U(1) symmetry. The generated supersymmetry breaking and mu
parameters are comparable in size, and no flavor or CP violating terms arise.
The spectrum of the first two generation superparticles is that of minimal
gauge mediation with the number of messengers N_mess = 5 and the messenger
scale 10^11 GeV < M_mess < 10^13 GeV. The spectrum of the Higgs bosons and
third generation superparticles, however, can deviate from it. The lightest
supersymmetric particle is the gravitino with a mass of order (1-10) GeV.
