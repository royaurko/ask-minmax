The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have measured properties of minimum bias
events and have determined characteristics of the underlying event in
proton-proton collisions at three LHC centre-of-mass energies. Comparisons to
common phenomenological models and partially to other experiments have been
made. The production of the strange particles K0s, Lambda and Xi is discussed.
Particle correlation studies, in particular Bose-Einstein as well as long- and
short-range angular correlations in proton-proton and lead ion events are
explained.
