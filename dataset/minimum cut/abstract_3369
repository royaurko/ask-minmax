We describe the model of protogalaxy formation around the cluster of
primordial black holes with a minimum extension of standard cosmological model.
Namely, it is supposed, that a mass fraction of the universe ~10^-3 is composed
of the compact clusters of primordial (relict) black holes produced during the
phase transitions in the early universe. These clusters are the centers of the
dark matter (DM) condensations. As a result the protogalaxies with a mass
2x10^8Msun form at the redshift z=15. These induced protogalaxies contain the
central black holes of mass ~10^5Msun and look like the dwarf spheroidal
galaxies with a central density spike. Subsequent merging of the induced
protogalaxies and ordinary DM haloes leads to the standard scenario of the
large scale structure formation. Black holes merging gives the nowadays
supermassive black holes and reproduces the observed correlations between their
masses and velocity dispersions in the bulges.
