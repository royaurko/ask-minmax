In this paper we study the algebraic geometry of any two-point code on the
Hermitian curve and reveal the purely geometric nature of their dual minimum
distance. We describe the minimum-weight codewords of many of their dual codes
through an explicit geometric characterization of their supports. In
particular, we show that they appear as sets of collinear points in many cases.
