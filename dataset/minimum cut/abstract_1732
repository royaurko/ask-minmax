We present the first in-place algorithm for sorting an array of size n that
performs, in the worst case, at most O(n log n) element comparisons and O(n)
element transports.
  This solves a long-standing open problem, stated explicitly, e.g., in [J.I.
Munro and V. Raman, Sorting with minimum data movement, J. Algorithms, 13,
374-93, 1992], of whether there exists a sorting algorithm that matches the
asymptotic lower bounds on all computational resources simultaneously.
