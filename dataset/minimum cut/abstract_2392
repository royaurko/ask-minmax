We show that there are extremely simple signal detection schemes where the
finiteness of energy resources places no limit to the resolution. On the
contrary, larger resolution can be obtained with lower energy. To this end the
generator of the signal-dependent transformation encoding the signal
information on the probe state must be different from the energy. We show that
the larger the deviation of the probe state from being minimum-uncertainty
state, the better the resolution.
