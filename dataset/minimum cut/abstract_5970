We introduce a counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) framework
for synthesizing continuous-time switching controllers that guarantee reach
while stay (RWS) properties of the closed loop system. The solution is based on
synthesizing specially defined class of control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for
switched systems, that yield switching controllers with a guaranteed minimum
dwell time in each mode. Next, we use a CEGIS-based approach to iteratively
solve the resulting quantified exists-forall constraints, and find a CLF. We
introduce relaxations to guarantee termination, as well as heuristics to
increase convergence speed. Finally, we evaluate our approach on a set of
benchmarks ranging from two to six state variables. Our evaluation includes a
preliminary comparison with related tools. The proposed approach shows the
promise of nonlinear SMT solvers for the synthesis of provably correct
switching control laws.
