The aim of this article is to provide a systematic analysis of the conditions
such that Fourier transform valuation formulas are valid in a general
framework; i.e. when the option has an arbitrary payoff function and depends on
the path of the asset price process. An interplay between the conditions on the
payoff function and the process arises naturally. We also extend these results
to the multi-dimensional case, and discuss the calculation of Greeks by Fourier
transform methods. As an application, we price options on the minimum of two
assets in L\'evy and stochastic volatility models.
