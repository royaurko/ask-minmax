We generalize a simple model for superlattices to include the effect of
differential capacitance. It is shown that the model always has a stable
steady-state solution (SSS) if all differential capacitances are positive. On
the other hand, when negative differential capacitance is included, the model
can have no stable SSS and be in a self-sustained current oscillation behavior.
Therefore, we find a possible minimum toy model with both negative differential
resistance and negative differential capacitance which can include the
phenomena of both self-sustained current oscillation and $I-V$ oscillation of
stable SSSs.
