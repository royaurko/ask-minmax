Rh17S15 has recently been shown to be a strongly correlated superconductor
with a transition temperature of 5.4 K. In order to understand the nature of
strong correlations we study the effect of substitution of some of the Rh and S
atoms by other elements such as Fe, Pd, Ir and Ni on the Rh side and Se on the
S side in this work. We find that while substitution of Ir and Se lower the
transition temperature considerably, that of Fe, Pd and Ni destroy
superconductivity down to 1.5 K. The resistivity data in these doped samples
show a minimum which is presumably disorder induced. A reduction of Tc is
always accompanied by a reduction of electron correlations as deduced from heat
capacity and magnetization data. Interestingly, the Fe doped sample shows some
possible antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures.
