Web search engines retrieve a vast amount of information for a given search
query. But the user needs only trustworthy and high-quality information from
this vast retrieved data. The response time of the search engine must be a
minimum value in order to satisfy the user. An optimum level of response time
should be maintained even when the system is overloaded. This paper proposes an
optimal Load Shedding algorithm which is used to handle overload conditions in
real-time data stream applications and is adapted to the Information Retrieval
System of a web search engine. Experiment results show that the proposed
algorithm enables a web search engine to provide trustworthy search results to
the user within an optimum response time, even during overload conditions.
