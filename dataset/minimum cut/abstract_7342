In the frame of the search for extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around
early-type main-sequence stars, we present the detection of a giant planet
around the young F-type star HD113337. We estimated the age of the system to be
150 +100/-50 Myr. Interestingly, an IR excess attributed to a cold debris disk
was previously detected on this star. The SOPHIE spectrograph on the 1.93m
telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence was used to obtain ~300 spectra
over 6 years. We used our SAFIR tool, dedicated to the spectra analysis of A
and F stars, to derive the radial velocity variations. The data reveal a 324.0
+1.7/-3.3 days period that we attribute to a giant planet with a minimum mass
of 2.83 +- 0.24 Mjup in an eccentric orbit with e=0.46 +- 0.04. A long-term
quadratic drift, that we assign to be probably of stellar origin, is
superimposed to the Keplerian solution.
