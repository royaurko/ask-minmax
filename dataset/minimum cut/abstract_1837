A gauge theory model in which there exists a specific interaction between
instantons is considered. An effective action describing this interaction
possesses a minimum when the instantons have identical orientation. The
considered interaction might provide a phase transition into the state where
instantons have a preferred orientation. This phase of the gauge-field theory
is important because it can give the description of gravity in the framework of
the gauge theory.
