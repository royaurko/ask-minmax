The {\it Randi\'c index} $R(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined as the sum of
1/\sqrt{d_ud_v} over all edges $uv$ of $G$, where $d_u$ and $d_v$ are the
degrees of vertices $u$ and $v,$ respectively. Let $D(G)$ be the diameter of
$G$ when $G$ is connected. Aouchiche-Hansen-Zheng conjectured that among all
connected graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices the path $P_n$ achieves the minimum values
for both $R(G)/D(G)$ and $R(G)- D(G)$. We prove this conjecture completely. In
fact, we prove a stronger theorem: If $G$ is a connected graph, then
$R(G)-(1/2)D(G)\geq \sqrt{2}-1$, with equality if and only if $G$ is a path
with at least three vertices.
