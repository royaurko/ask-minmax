The value memristor devices offer to the neuromorphic computing hardware
design community rests on the ability to provide effective device models that
can enable large scale integrated computing architecture application
simulations. Therefore, it is imperative to develop practical, functional
device models of minimum mathematical complexity for fast, reliable, and
accurate computing architecture technology design and simulation. To this end,
various device models have been proposed in the literature seeking to
characterize the physical electronic and time domain behavioral properties of
memristor devices. In this work, we analyze some promising and practical
non-quasi-static linear and non-linear memristor device models for neuromorphic
circuit design and computing architecture simulation.
