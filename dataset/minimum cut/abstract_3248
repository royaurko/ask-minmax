SIMPLE (Superheated Instrument for Massive ParticLE searches) employs
superheated droplet detectors (SDDs) to search for Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle (WIMP) dark matter. As a result of the intrinsic SDD insensitivity to
minimum ionizing particles and high fluorine content of target liquids,
competitive WIMP limits were already obtained at the early prototype stage. We
comment here on the expected immediate increase in sensitivity of the program
and on future plans to exploit this promising technnique.
