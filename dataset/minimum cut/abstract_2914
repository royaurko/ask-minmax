Let $(G_t)_{t \geq 0}$ be the random graph process ($G_0$ is edgeless and
$G_t$ is obtained by adding a uniformly distributed new edge to $G_{t-1}$), and
let $\tau_k$ denote the minimum time $t$ such that the $k$-core of $G_t$ (its
unique maximal subgraph with minimum degree at least $k$) is nonempty. For any
fixed $k\geq 3$ the $k$-core is known to emerge via a discontinuous phase
transition, where at time $t=\tau_k$ its size jumps from 0 to linear in the
number of vertices with high probability. It is believed that for any $k\geq 3$
the core is Hamiltonian upon creation w.h.p., and Bollob\'as, Cooper, Fenner
and Frieze further conjectured that it in fact admits $\lfloor(k-1)/2\rfloor$
edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles. However, even the asymptotic threshold for
Hamiltonicity of the $k$-core in $G(n,p)$ was unknown for any $k$. We show here
that for any fixed $k\ge 15$ the $k$-core of $G_t$ is w.h.p. Hamiltonian for
all $t \geq \tau_k$, i.e., immediately as the $k$-core appears and indefinitely
afterwards. Moreover, we prove that for large enough fixed $k$ the $k$-core
contains $\lfloor (k-3)/2\rfloor$ edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles w.h.p. for all
$t\geq \tau_k$.
