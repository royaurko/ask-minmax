We aim to detect and characterize substellar companions to K giant stars, to
further our knowledge of planet formation and stellar evolution of
intermediate-mass stars. For more than a decade we have used Doppler
spectroscopy to acquire high precision radial velocity measurements of K giant
stars. All data for this survey have been taken at Lick Observatory. Our survey
includes 373 G and K giants. Radial velocity data showing periodic variations
are fitted with Keplerian orbits using a chi^2 minimization technique. We
report the presence of two substellar companions to the K giant stars tau Gem
and 91 Aqr. The brown dwarf orbiting tau Gem has an orbital period of 305.5 +/-
0.1 days, a minimum mass of 20.6 M_Jup, and an eccentricity of 0.031 +/- 0.009.
The planet orbiting 91 Aqr has an orbital period of 181.4 +/- 0.1 days, a
minimum mass of 3.2 M_Jup, and an eccentricity of 0.027 +/- 0.026. Both
companions have exceptionally circular orbits for their orbital distance, as
compared to all previously discovered planetary companions.
