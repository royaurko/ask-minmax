This article presents a novel utilization of the concept of entropy in
information theory to model-free 3D reconstruction of weld joint in presence of
noise. We show that our formulation attains its global minimum at the upper
edge of this joint. This property significantly simplifies the extraction of
this welding joint. Furthermore, we present an approach to compute the volume
of this extracted space to facilitate the monitoring of the progress of the
welding task. Moreover, we provide a preliminary analysis of the effect of
variation of the noise on the extraction process of this space to realize the
impact of this noise on the computation of its area and volume.
