The SphinX X-ray spectrophotometer on the CORONAS-PHOTON spacecraft measured
soft X-ray emission in the 1-15 keV energy range during the deep solar minimum
of 2009 with a sensitivity much greater than GOES. Several intervals are
identified when the X-ray flux was exceptionally low, and the flux and solar
X-ray luminosity are estimated. Spectral fits to the emission at these times
give temperatures of 1.7-1.9 MK and emission measures between 4 x 10^47 cm^-3
and 1.1 x 10^48 cm^-3. Comparing SphinX emission with that from the Hinode
X-ray Telescope, we deduce that most of the emission is from general coronal
structures rather than confined features like bright points. For one of 27
intervals of exceptionally low activity identified in the SphinX data, the
Sun's X-ray luminosity in an energy range roughly extrapolated to that of ROSAT
(0.1-2.4 keV) was less than most nearby K and M dwarfs.
