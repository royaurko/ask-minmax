One of the key predictions of modeling from the IR excess of Herbig Ae stars
is that for protoplanetary disks, where significant grain growth and settling
has occurred, the dust disk has flattened to the point that it can be partially
or largely shadowed by the innermost material at or near the dust sublimation
radius. When the self-shadowing has already started, the outer disk is expected
to be detected in scattered light only in the exceptional cases that the scale
height of the dust disk at the sublimation radius is smaller than usual.
High-contrast imaging combined with the IR spectral energy distribution allow
us to measure the degree of flattening of the disk, as well as to determine the
properties of the outer disk. We present polarimetric differential imaging in
$H$ band obtained with Subaru/HiCIAO of one such system, MWC 480. The HiCIAO
data were obtained at a historic minimum of the NIR excess. The disk is
detected in scattered light from 0\farcs2-1\farcs0 (27.4-137AU). Together with
the marginal detection of the disk from 1998 February 24 by HST/NICMOS, our
data constrain the opening half angle for the disk to lie between
1.3$\leq\theta\leq 2.2^\circ$. When compared with similar measures in CO for
the gas disk from the literature, the dust disk subtends only $\sim$30% of the
gas disk scale height (H/R$\sim$0.03). Such a dust disk is a factor of 5-7
flatter than transitional disks, which have structural signatures that giant
planets have formed.
