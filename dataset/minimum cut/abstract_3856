We study a possibility of combining an origin of the $\mu$-term and the
baryon and lepton number asymmetry. If we assume that the $\mu$-term is
generated through a flat direction of a singlet scalar field, the coherent
oscillation of this condensate around its potential minimum can store the
global U(1) charge asymmetry. The decay of this condensate can distribute this
asymmetry into the lepton and baryon number asymmetry as far as its decay
occurs at an appropriate temperature. We examine the compatibility between this
scenario and the small neutrino mass generation based on both the ordinary
seesaw mechanism and the bilinear R-parity violating terms.
