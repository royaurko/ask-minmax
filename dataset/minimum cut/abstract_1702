We study a reaction diffusion system of the activator-inhibitor type with
inhomogeneous reaction terms showing spatiotemporal chaos. We analyze the
topological properties of the unstable periodic orbits in the slow chaotic
dynamics appearing, which can be embedded in three dimensions. We perform a
bi-orthogonal decomposition analyzing the minimum number of modes necessary to
find the same organization of unstable orbits.
