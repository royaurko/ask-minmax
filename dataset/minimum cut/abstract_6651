We construct explicit rate-one, full-diversity, geometrically dense matrix
lattices with large, non-vanishing determinants (NVD) for four transmit antenna
multiple-input single-output (MISO) space-time (ST) applications. The
constructions are based on the theory of rings of algebraic integers and
related subrings of the Hamiltonian quaternions and can be extended to a larger
number of Tx antennas. The usage of ideals guarantees a non-vanishing
determinant larger than one and an easy way to present the exact proofs for the
minimum determinants. The idea of finding denser sublattices within a given
division algebra is then generalized to a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
case with an arbitrary number of Tx antennas by using the theory of cyclic
division algebras (CDA) and maximal orders. It is also shown that the explicit
constructions in this paper all have a simple decoding method based on sphere
decoding. Related to the decoding complexity, the notion of sensitivity is
introduced, and experimental evidence indicating a connection between
sensitivity, decoding complexity and performance is provided. Simulations in a
quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel show that our dense quaternionic
constructions outperform both the earlier rectangular lattices and the rotated
ABBA lattice as well as the DAST lattice. We also show that our quaternionic
lattice is better than the DAST lattice in terms of the diversity-multiplexing
gain tradeoff.
