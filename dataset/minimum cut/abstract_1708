The concept of "recombination resistance" introduced by Shockley and Read
(Phys. Rev. 87, 835 (1952)) is discussed within the framework of the
thermodynamics of irreversible processes ruled by the principle of the minimum
rate of entropy production. It is shown that the affinities of recombination
processes represent "voltages" in a thermodynamic Ohm-like law where the net
rates of recombinations represent the "currents". The quantities thus found
allow for the definition of the "dissipated power" which is to be related to
the rate of entropy production of the recombination processes dealt with.
