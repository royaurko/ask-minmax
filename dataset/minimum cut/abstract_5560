It is discussed that the point spread function (PSF) of multiplexing parallel
beam (MPB) is shift-invariant; the spatial resolution is linear as a function
of depth h and the geometrical sensitivity is converged to a constant value at
far field, by using Monte Carlo simulation in this work. The results indicate
that the MPB collimator may maintain the same system characteristics as
parallel beam (PB) collimator. Although the minimum standard deviation (SD) of
MPB is more 3.7% than the PB with high sensitivity (HSPB), the improved
resolution is 55.2% at h=160mm, compared with HSPB in this work. The
reconstruction process also indicates that the convergence rate of MPB is
slower than the HSPB because the projection counts are part of overlapping and
the PSF of oblique PB (OPB) is asymmetrical. However the effective hole length
is used in the calculation of the system matrix to correct for the penetration,
which has a satisfactory result. From a visual assessment, the reconstructed
image may well satisfy clinical criteria and it is therefore worth
investigating this novel MPB collimator system for clinical imaging.
