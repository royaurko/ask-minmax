In 1962, Erd\H{o}s gave a sufficient condition for Hamilton cycles in terms
of the vertex number, edge number, and minimum degree of graphs which
generalized Ore's theorem. One year later, Moon and Moser gave an analogous
result for Hamilton cycles in balanced bipartite graphs. In this paper we
present the spectral analogues of Erd\H{o}s' theorem and Moon-Moser's theorem,
respectively. Let $\mathcal{G}_n^k$ be the class of non-Hamiltonian graphs of
order $n$ and of minimum degree at least $k$. We determine the largest
(signless Laplacian) spectral radius of graphs in $\mathcal{G}_n^k$ (for large
enough $n$), and the minimum (signless Laplacian) spectral radius of the
complements of graphs in $\mathcal{G}_n^k$. All extremal graphs with the
largest (signless Laplacian) spectral radius and with the minimum (signless
Laplacian) spectral radius of the complements are determined, respectively. We
also solve similar problems for balanced bipartite graphs and the
quasi-complements.
