Using the self-consistent Born approximation to the Dirac fermions under
finite-range impurity scatterings, we show that the current-current correlation
function is determined by four-coupled integral equations. This is very
different from the case for impurities with short-range potentials. As a test
of the present approach, we calculate the electric conductivity in graphene for
charged impurities with screened Coulomb potentials. The obtained conductivity
at zero temperature varies linearly with the carrier concentration, and the
minimum conductivity at zero doping is larger than the existing theoretical
predictions, but still smaller than that of the experimental measurement. The
overall behavior of the conductivity obtained by the present calculation at
room temperature is similar to that at zero temperature except the minimum
conductivity is slightly larger.
