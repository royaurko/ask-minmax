A lower bound on the amount of energy needed to carry out an elementary
logical operation on a qubit system, with a given accuracy and in a given time,
has been recently postulated. This paper is an attempt to formalize this bound
and explore the conditions under which it may be expected to hold. This is a
work in progress and any contributions will be appreciated.
