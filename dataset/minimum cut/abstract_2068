For a fixed integer h>=1, let G be a tripartite graph with N vertices in each
vertex class, N divisible by 6h, such that every vertex is adjacent to at least
2N/3+h-1 vertices in each of the other classes. We show that if N is
sufficiently large, then G can be tiled perfectly by copies of K_{h,h,h}. This
extends the work in [19] and also gives a sufficient condition for tiling by
any (fixed) 3-colorable graph. Furthermore, we show that this minimum-degree
condition is best possible and provide very tight bounds when N is divisible by
h but not by 6h.
