It is shown for two electron atoms that ground-state wavefunctions of the
form \begin{equation}
  \Psi(\vec{r_{1}}, \vec{r_{2}})=\phi(\vec{r_{1}})\phi(\vec{r_{2}})(\cosh
ar_{1}+\cosh ar_{2})(1+0.5 r_{12}e^{-b r_{12}}) \end{equation} where
$\vec{r_{1}}$ and $\vec{r_{2}}$ are the coordinates of two electrons and
$r_{12}=|\vec{r_{1}}-\vec{r_{2}}|$, can be made highly accurate by optimizing
$a$, $b$ and $\phi$. This is done by solving a variationally derived equation
for $\phi$ for a given $a$ and $b$ and finding $a$ and $b$ so that the
expectation value of the Hamiltonian is minimum. For the set $\{a, b, \phi\}$
the values for various quantities obtained from the above wavefunction are
compared with those given by $204$-parameter wavefunction of Koga et al.[11]
and are found to be matching quite accurately(within ppm) with them.
