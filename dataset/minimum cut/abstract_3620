Determination of the orbital symmetry of a state in spin triplet
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ superconductor is a challenge of considerable importance. Most of
the experiments show that the chiral state of the $\hat{z} (k_x \pm ik_y)$ type
is realized and remains stable on lowering the temperature. Here we have
studied the stability of various superconducting states of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in the
presence of spin-orbit coupling.
  Numerically we found that the chiral state is never the minimum energy. Alone
among the five states studied it has $<{\bf \hat L}.{\bf \hat S} >=0$ and is
therefore not affected to linear order in the coupling parameter $\lambda$. We
found that stability of the chiral state requires spin dependent pairing
interactions. This imposes strong constraint on the pairing mechanism.
