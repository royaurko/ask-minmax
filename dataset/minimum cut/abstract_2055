The basic results of a new theory of regular functions of a quaternionic
variable have been recently stated, following an idea of Cullen. In this paper
we prove the minimum modulus principle and the open mapping theorem for regular
functions. The proofs involve some peculiar geometric properties of such
functions which are of independent interest.
