In pure N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills with gauge group SU(N), the domain
walls which separate the N vacua have been argued, on the basis of string
theory realizations, to be D-branes for the confining string. In a certain
limit, this means that a configuration of k parallel domain walls is described
by a 2+1-dimensional U(k) gauge theory. This theory has been identified by
Acharya and Vafa as the U(k) gauge theory with 4 supercharges broken by a
Chern-Simons term of level N in such a way that 2 supercharges are preserved.
We argue further that the gauge coupling of the domain wall gauge theory goes
like g^2 ~ Lambda/N, for large N. In the case of two domain walls, we show that
the U(2) world-volume theory generates a quadratic potential on the Coulomb
branch at two loops in perturbation theory which is consistent with there being
a supersymmetric bound state of the two wall system. A mass gap of order
Lambda/N is generated around the supersymmetric minimum and we estimate the
size of the bound-state to be order Lambda/ \sqrt N. At large distance the
potential reaches a constant that can qualitatively account for the binding
energy of the two walls even though stringy effects are not, strictly speaking,
decoupled.
