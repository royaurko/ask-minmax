In the minimal supersymmetric standard model, the Higgs sector has two
unknown parameters, usually taken to be $\tan \beta \equiv v_2/v_1$ and $m_A$,
the mass of its one physical pseudoscalar particle. By minimizing the minimum
of the Higgs potential along a certain direction in parameter space, it is
shown that $m_A = M_Z$ + radiative correction, and if one further plausible
assumption is made, $\tan \beta > \sqrt 3$.
