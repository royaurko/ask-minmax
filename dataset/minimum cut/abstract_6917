Nuclear modification factors of inclusive prompt photon production in d-Au
collisions at RHIC and p-Pb collisions at the LHC are provided at different
rapidities. The calculations are performed at NLO accuracy using the EPS09 NLO
nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and their error sets. The results
are compared to the ones obtained with the nDS and HKN07 NLO nPDFs, and to the
corresponding nuclear modification factors of neutral pion production in these
collisions. The sensitivity of these results to the scale choice is also
investigated. Interestingly, the predictions using the different nPDF sets
differ from each other to the extent that this observable can be expected to
become very useful for probing nPDFs over a wide range of Bjorken-x. In order
to obtain a perturbative QCD baseline in heavy-ion collisions, calculations are
carried out for minimum bias Au-Au collisions at RHIC and Pb-Pb collisions at
the LHC. We also estimate the maximal possible suppression which the produced
QCD matter can be expected to have on inclusive prompt photon production due to
the quenching of the fragmentation component. The nuclear modification factor
for prompt photon production is thus suggested to be used for gauging both the
cold and the hot nuclear matter effects on other hard processes which are
expected to be affected by quark-gluon plasma formation, such as large-pT
hadron and jet production.
