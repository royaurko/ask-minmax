One of the best known results in spectral graph theory is the following lower
bound on the chromatic number due to Alan Hoffman, where mu_1 and mu_n are
respectively the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix: chi
>= 1 + mu_1 / (- mu_n). We recently generalised this bound to include all
eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix.
  In this paper, we further generalize these results to include all eigenvalues
of the adjacency, Laplacian and signless Laplacian matrices. The various known
bounds are also unified by considering the normalized adjacency matrix, and
examples are cited for which the new bounds outperform known bounds.
