Guruswami and Indyk showed in [1] that Forney's error exponent can be
achieved with linear coding complexity over binary symmetric channels. This
paper extends this conclusion to general discrete-time memoryless channels and
shows that Forney's and Blokh-Zyablov error exponents can be arbitrarily
approached by one-level and multi-level concatenated codes with linear
encoding/decoding complexity. The key result is a revision to Forney's general
minimum distance decoding algorithm, which enables a low complexity integration
of Guruswami-Indyk's outer codes into the concatenated coding schemes.
