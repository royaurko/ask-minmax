D0 provides a wealth of measurements conceived for probing perturbative and
non-perturbative aspects of QCD, giving an accurate experimental account for
Standard Model production processes including jets, leptons and photons and
improving the sensitivity and the understanding in searches for new physics.
Among the most important subjects are inclusive jet production, vector boson
plus jet production, direct photon production and measurements in Minimum Bias
events and Double Parton Scattering which are discussed here and compared to
theory predictions.
