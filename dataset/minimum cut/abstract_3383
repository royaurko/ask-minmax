The IRS 13E complex is an unusual concentration of massive, early-type stars
at a projected distance of ~0.13 pc from the Milky Way's central supermassive
black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Because of their similar proper motion and
their common nature as massive, young stars it has recently been suggested that
IRS 13E may be the remnant of a massive stellar cluster containing an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) that binds its members gravitationally in
the tidal field of Sgr A*. Here, we present an analysis of the proper motions
in the IRS~13E environment that combines the currently best available data with
a time line of 10 years. We find that an IMBH in IRS 13E must have a minimum
mass of ~10^4 solar masses in order to bind the source complex gravitationally.
This high mass limit in combination with the absence so far of compelling
evidence for a non-thermal radio and X-ray source in IRS 13E make it appear
unlikely that an IMBH exists in IRS 13E that is sufficiently massive to bind
the system gravitationally.
