New R-band observations of 21 local field RR Lyrae variable stars are used to
explore the reliability of minimum light (V-R) colors as a tool for measuring
interstellar reddening. For each star, R-band intensity mean magnitudes and
light amplitudes are presented. Corresponding V-band light curves from the
literature are supplemented with the new photometry, and (V-R) colors at
minimum light are determined for a subset of these stars as well as for other
stars in the literature. Two different definitions of minimum light color are
examined, one which uses a Fourier decomposition to the V and R light curves to
find (V-R) at minimum V-band light, (V-R)_{min}^F, and the other which uses the
average color between the phase interval 0.5-0.8, (V-R)_{min}^{\phi(0.5-0.8)}.
  From 31 stars with a wide range of metallicities and pulsation periods, the
mean dereddened RR Lyrae color at minimum light is (V-R)_{min,0}^F = 0.28 pm
0.02 mag and (V-R)_{min,0}^{\phi(0.5-0.8)} = 0.27 pm 0.02 mag. As was found by
Guldenschuh et al. (2005) using (V-I) colors, any dependence of the star's
minimum light color on metallicity or pulsation amplitude is too weak to be
formally detected. We find that the intrinsic (V-R) of Galactic bulge RR Lyrae
stars are similar to those found by their local counterparts and hence that
Bulge RR0 Lyrae stars do not have anomalous colors as compared to the local RR
Lyrae stars.
