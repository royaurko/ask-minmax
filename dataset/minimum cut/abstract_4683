Some graphs admit drawings in the Euclidean k-space in such a (natu- ral)
way, that edges are represented as line segments of unit length. Such drawings
will be called k dimensional unit distance representations. When two
non-adjacent vertices are drawn in the same point, we say that the
representation is degenerate. The dimension (the Euclidean dimension) of a
graph is defined to be the minimum integer k needed that a given graph has
non-degenerate k dimensional unit distance representation (with the property
that non-adjacent vertices are mapped to points, that are not distance one
appart). It is proved that deciding if an input graph is homomorphic to a graph
with dimension k >= 2 (with the Euclidean dimension k >= 2) are NP-hard
problems.
