We have studied radiative pion decays Pi+ -> e+ nu gamma in three broad
kinematic regions using the PIBETA detector and a stopped pion beam. Based on
Dalitz distributions of 42,209 events we have evaluated absolute Pi -> e nu
gamma branching ratios in the three regions. Minimum chi^2 fits to the integral
and differential (E(e+),E(gamma)) distributions result in the axial-to-vector
weak form factor ratio of gamma = F_A/F_V = 0.443(15),or F_A = 0.0115(4) with
F_V = 0.0259. However, deviations from Standard Model predictions in the
high-E(gamma)/low-E(e+) kinematic region indicate the need for further
theoretical and experimental work.
