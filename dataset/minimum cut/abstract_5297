This paper investigates properties of polar codes that can be potentially
useful in real-world applications. We start with analyzing the performance of
finite-length polar codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC), while assuming
belief propagation as the decoding method. We provide a stopping set analysis
for the factor graph of polar codes, where we find the size of the minimum
stopping set. We also find the girth of the graph for polar codes. Our analysis
along with bit error rate (BER) simulations demonstrate that finite-length
polar codes show superior error floor performance compared to the conventional
capacity-approaching coding techniques. In order to take advantage from this
property while avoiding the shortcomings of polar codes, we consider the idea
of combining polar codes with other coding schemes. We propose a polar
code-based concatenated scheme to be used in Optical Transport Networks (OTNs)
as a potential real-world application. Comparing against conventional
concatenation techniques for OTNs, we show that the proposed scheme outperforms
the existing methods by closing the gap to the capacity while avoiding error
floor, and maintaining a low complexity at the same time.
