We perform a measurement of the branching fractions for tau -> l gamma nu
anti-nu (l= e, mu) decays for a minimum photon energy of 10 MeV in the tau rest
frame using 430 fb^-1 of e^+ e^- collisions collected at the center-of-mass
energy of the Upsilon(4S) resonance around 10.58GeV with the BaBar detector at
the PEP-II storage rings. We find B(tau -> mu gamma nu nu) =
(3.69pm0.03pm0.10)x10^-3 and B(tau -> e gamma nu anti-nu) =
(1.847pm0.015pm0.052)x10^-2 where the first quoted error is statistical and the
second is systematic. These results represent a substantial improvement with
respect to existing measurements for both channels.
