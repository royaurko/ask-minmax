We present an analysis of the variability of the solar oscillation spectrum
during solar cycle 23 and its extended minimum. We use simultaneous
observations of the low-degree solar p modes collected by the space-based,
Sun-as-a-star GOLF (radial velocity) and VIRGO (intensity) instruments, and by
the ground-based, multi-site network GONG. We investigate in particular the
response of the p-mode eigenfrequencies to the observed peculiar deep solar
minimum of surface activity of 2007-2009 as compared with the previous solar
cycle 23. We study the different temporal variations of the p-mode frequencies
with individual angular degrees.
