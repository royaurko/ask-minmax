We report the detection of a planetary companion around HIP 13044, a
metal-poor red horizontal branch star belonging to a stellar halo stream that
results from the disruption of an ancient Milky Way satellite galaxy. The
detection is based on radial velocity observations with FEROS at the 2.2-m
MPG/ESO telescope. The periodic radial velocity variation of P=16.2 days can be
distinguished from the periods of the stellar activity indicators. We computed
a minimum planetary mass of 1.25 Jupiter masses and an orbital semimajor axis
of 0.116 AU for the planet. This discovery is unique in three aspects: First,
it is the first planet detection around a star with a metallicity much lower
than few percent of the solar value; second, the planet host star resides in a
stellar evolutionary stage that is still unexplored in the exoplanet surveys;
third, the planetary system HIP 13044 most likely has an extragalactic origin
in a disrupted former satellite of the Milky Way.
