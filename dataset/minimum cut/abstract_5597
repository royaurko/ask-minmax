We consider $n$-component fixed-length order parameter interacting with a
weak random field in $d=1,2,3$ dimensions. Relaxation from the initially
ordered state and spin-spin correlation functions have been studied on lattices
containing hundreds of millions sites. At $n-1<d$ presence of topological
structures leads to metastability, with the final state depending on the
initial condition. At $n-1>d$, when topological objects are absent, the final,
lowest-energy, state is independent of the initial condition. It is
characterized by the exponential decay of correlations that agrees
quantitatively with the theory based upon the Imry-Ma argument. In the
borderline case of $n-1=d$, when topological structures are non-singular, the
system possesses a weak metastability with the Imry-Ma state likely to be the
global energy minimum.
