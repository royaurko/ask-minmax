We report a $^{63}$Cu nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) study of the vortex
state for an aligned polycrystalline sample of a slightly overdoped high-$T_c$
superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ ($T_{c}\sim$92 K) at a low magnetic
field of 96 mT along the c axis, near a lower critical field $H_{c1}$. We
observed the frequency distribution of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time
$^{63}T_1$ in the Zeeman-perturbed $^{63}$Cu NQR spectrum below $T_c$. The
characteristic behavior of 1/$^{63}T_1$, taking the minimum values with respect
to temperature and frequency, indicates the significant role of
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the Doppler-shifted quasiparticle energy
spectrum inside and outside vortex cores.
