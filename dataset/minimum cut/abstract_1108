Conditions in the solar wind resulting in magnetic storms on the Earth are a
subject of long and intensive investigations. Recently Zhang et al. (2006),
published a paper, where they used superposed epoch analyses method to study
solar wind features during 549 geomagnetic storms. Unfortunately, the used
methodical approach has not allowed to improve essentially understanding of
relation of magnetic storms with conditions in the solar wind, and first of all
for the following reasons: (1) they did not take into account of existance of
storms generated by different types of solar wind, and (2) they took minimum
Dst index time as epoch zero time rather than storm onset.
