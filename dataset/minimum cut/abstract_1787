Described in this paper is a new method for determining the non-diffractive
part of the inelastic proton-proton cross section, at the LHC centre of mass
energy of 14TeV. The method is based on counting the number of inelastic
proton-proton interactions in the collision regions. According to preliminary
investigation, this measurement will be best suited for the initial low
luminosity phase of the LHC. The dominant uncertainty on this measurement comes
from knowledge of the proton-proton luminosity.
