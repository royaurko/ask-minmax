The spectrum of ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pressure-driven (ballooning)
modes in strongly nonaxisymmetric toroidal systems is difficult to analyze
numerically owing to the singular nature of ideal MHD caused by lack of an
inherent scale length. In this paper, ideal MHD is regularized by using a
$k$-space cutoff, making the ray tracing for the WKB ballooning formalism a
chaotic Hamiltonian billiard problem. The minimum width of the toroidal Fourier
spectrum needed for resolving toroidally localized ballooning modes with a
global eigenvalue code is estimated from the Weyl formula. This
phase-space-volume estimation method is applied to two stellarator cases.
