In this work we deal with a following nonlinear Schrodinger equation in
dimension greater or equal to 3, with a subcritical power-type nonlinearity and
a positive potential satisfying a local condition. We prove the existence and
concentration of nodal solutions which concentrate around a k - dimensional
sphere of RN, where k is between 1 and N-1, as a parameter goes to 0. The
radius of such sphere is related with the local minimum of a function which
takes into account the potential. Variational methods are used together with
the penalization technique in order to overcome the lack of compactness.
