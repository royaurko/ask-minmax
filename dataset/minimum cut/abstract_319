Exact mathematical solution of the minimization conditions of scalar the Higgs
potential of the Finite Supersymmetric Grand Unification Theory is proposed and
extremal field configurations are found. Types of extrema are investigated and
masses of the new Higgs particles arisen after electroweak symmetry breaking
are derived analytically. The conditions for existing of physically acceptable
minimum are given. As it appears, this minimum is simple generalization of the
analogous solution in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
Phenomenological consequences are discussed briefly.
