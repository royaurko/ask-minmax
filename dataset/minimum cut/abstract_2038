This paper presents an overview of an assembler driven verification
methodology (ADVM) that was created and implemented for a chip card project at
Infineon Technologies AG. The primary advantage of this methodology is that it
enables rapid porting of directed tests to new targets and derivatives, with
only a minimum amount of code refactoring. As a consequence, considerable
verification development time and effort was saved.
