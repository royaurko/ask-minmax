We show that there is no deterministic local algorithm (constant-time
distributed graph algorithm) that finds a $(7-\epsilon)$-approximation of a
minimum dominating set on planar graphs, for any positive constant $\epsilon$.
In prior work, the best lower bound on the approximation ratio has been
$5-\epsilon$; there is also an upper bound of $52$.
