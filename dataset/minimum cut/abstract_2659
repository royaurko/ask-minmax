Betting strategies are often expressed formally as martingales. A martingale
is called integer-valued if each bet must be an integer value. Integer-valued
strategies correspond to the fact that in most betting situations, there is a
minimum amount that a player can bet. According to a well known paradigm,
algorithmic randomness can be founded on the notion of betting strategies. A
real X is called integer-valued random if no effective integer-valued
martingale succeeds on X. It turns out that this notion of randomness has
interesting interactions with genericity and the computably enumerable degrees.
We investigate the computational power of the integer-valued random reals in
terms of standard notions from computability theory.
