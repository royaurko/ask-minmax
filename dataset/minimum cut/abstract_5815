This paper proposes a new approach for approximate evaluation of #P-hard
queries with probabilistic databases. In our approach, every query is evaluated
entirely in the database engine by evaluating a fixed number of query plans,
each providing an upper bound on the true probability, then taking their
minimum. We provide an algorithm that takes into account important schema
information to enumerate only the minimal necessary plans among all possible
plans. Importantly, this algorithm is a strict generalization of all known
results of PTIME self-join-free conjunctive queries: A query is safe if and
only if our algorithm returns one single plan. We also apply three relational
query optimization techniques to evaluate all minimal safe plans very fast. We
give a detailed experimental evaluation of our approach and, in the process,
provide a new way of thinking about the value of probabilistic methods over
non-probabilistic methods for ranking query answers.
