Meta-analysis techniques have been widely developed and applied in genomic
applications, especially for combining multiple transcriptomic studies. In this
paper we propose an order statistic of $p$-values ($r$th ordered $p$-value,
rOP) across combined studies as the test statistic. We illustrate different
hypothesis settings that detect gene markers differentially expressed (DE) 'in
all studies," "in the majority of studies"' or "in one or more studies," and
specify rOP as a suitable method for detecting DE genes "in the majority of
studies." We develop methods to estimate the parameter $r$ in rOP for real
applications. Statistical properties such as its asymptotic behavior and a
one-sided testing correction for detecting markers of concordant expression
changes are explored. Power calculation and simulation show better performance
of rOP compared to classical Fisher's method, Stouffer's method, minimum
$p$-value method and maximum $p$-value method under the focused hypothesis
setting. Theoretically, rOP is found connected to the na\"{i}ve vote counting
method and can be viewed as a generalized form of vote counting with better
statistical properties. The method is applied to three microarray meta-analysis
examples including major depressive disorder, brain cancer and diabetes. The
results demonstrate rOP as a more generalizable, robust and sensitive
statistical framework to detect disease-related markers.
