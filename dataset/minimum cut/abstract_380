The Conditional Probability Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics replaces the
abstract notion of time used in standard Quantum Mechanics by the time that can
be read off from a physical clock. The use of physical clocks leads to apparent
non-unitary and decoherence. Here we show that a close approximation to
standard Quantum Mechanics can be recovered from conditional Quantum Mechanics
for semi-classical clocks, and we use these clocks to compute the minimum
decoherence predicted by the Conditional Probability Interpretation.
