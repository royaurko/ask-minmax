(Abridged) From photometric observations of $\sim$ 47,000 stars and
spectroscopy of $\sim$ 11,000 stars, we describe the first extensive study of
the stellar population of the famous Double Cluster, h and $\chi$ Persei, down
to subsolar masses. Both clusters have E(B-V) $\sim$ 0.52--0.55 and dM =
11.8--11.85; the halo population, while more poorly constrained, likely has
identical properties. As determined from the main sequence turnoff, the
luminosity of M supergiants, and pre-main sequence isochrones, ages for h
Persei, $\chi$ Persei and the halo population all converge on $\approx$ 14 Myr.
  From these data, we establish the first spectroscopic and photometric
membership lists of cluster stars down to early/mid M dwarfs. At minimum, there
are $\sim$ 5,000 members within 10' of the cluster centers, while the entire h
and $\chi$ Persei region has at least $\sim$ 13,000 and as many as 20,000
members. The Double Cluster contains $\approx$ 8,400 M$_{\odot}$ of stars
within 10' of the cluster centers. We estimate a total mass of at least 20,000
M$_{\odot}$. We conclude our study by outlining outstanding questions regarding
the properties of h and $\chi$ Persei. From comparing recent work, we compile a
list of intrinsic colors and derive a new effective temperature scale for O--M
dwarfs, giants, and supergiants.
