A Monte Carlo Renormalization Group algorithm is used on the Ising model to
derive critical exponents and the critical temperature. The algorithm is based
on a minimum relative entropy iteration developed previously to derive
potentials from equilibrium configurations. This previous algorithm is modified
to derive useful information in an RG iteration. The method is applied in
several dimensions with limited success. Required accuracy has not been
achieved, but the method is interesting.
