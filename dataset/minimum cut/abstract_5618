The NOAA listings of solar flares in cycles 21-24, including the GOES soft
X-ray magnitudes, enable a simple determination of the number of flares each
flaring active region produces over its lifetime. We have studied this measure
of flare productivity over the interval 1975-2012. The annual averages of flare
productivity remained approximately constant during cycles 21 and 22, at about
two reported M or X flares per region, but then increased significantly in the
declining phase of cycle 23 (the years 2004-2005). We have confirmed this by
using the independent RHESSI flare catalog to check the NOAA events listings
where possible. We note that this measure of solar activity does not correlate
with the solar cycle. The anomalous peak in flare productivity immediately
preceded the long solar minimum between cycles 23 and 24.
