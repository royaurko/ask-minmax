This work reports on an optical hydrophone that is insensitive to hydrostatic
pressure, yet capable of measuring acoustic pressures as low as the background
noise in the ocean in a frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 kHz. The miniature
hydrophone consists of a Fabry-Perot interferometer made of a photonic-crystal
reflector interrogated with a single-mode fiber, and is compatible with
existing fiber-optic technologies. Three sensors with different acoustic power
ranges placed within a sub-wavelength sized hydrophone head allow a high
dynamic range in the excess of 160 dB with a low harmonic distortion of better
than -30 dB. A method for suppressing cross coupling between sensors in the
same hydrophone head is also proposed. A prototype was fabricated, assembled,
and tested. The sensitivity was measured from 100 Hz to 100 kHz, demonstrating
a minimum detectable pressure down to 12 {\mu}Pa (1-Hz noise bandwidth), a
flatband wider than 10 kHz, and very low distortion.
