The observation of plasma focusing of a 28.5 GeV positron beam is reported.
The plasma was formed by ionizing a nitrogen jet only 3 mm thick. Simultaneous
focusing in both transverse dimensions was observed with effective focusing
strengths of order Tesla per micron. The minimum area of the beam spot was
reduced by a factor of 2.0 +/- 0.3 by the plasma. The longitudinal beam
envelope was measured and compared with numerical calculations.
