We enlarge the usual D=3 N=1 supergraph techniques to include the case of
(explicitly or spontaneously) broken supersymmetric gauge theories. To
illustrate the utility of these techniques, we calculate the two-loop effective
potential of the SQED3 by using the tadpole and the vacuum bubble methods. In
these methods, to investigate the possibility of supersymmetry breaking, the
superfields must be shifted by $\theta$ dependent classical superfields (vacuum
expectation values), what implies in the explicit breakdown of supersymmetry in
the intermediate steps of the calculation. Nevertheless, after studying the
minimum of the resulting effective potential, we find that supersymmetry is
conserved, while gauge symmetry is dynamically broken, with a mass generated
for the gauge superfield.
