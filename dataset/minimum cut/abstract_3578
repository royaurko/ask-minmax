A numerical scheme to study the mixed states in a mesoscopic type-II
superconducting cylinder is described. Steady-state configurations and
transient behavior of the magnetic vortices for various values of the applied
magnetic field H are presented. Transitions between different multi-vortex
states as H is changed is demonstrated by contour plots and jumps in the B vs H
plot. Evolving a uniformly-superconducting initial state using the simplest set
of relaxation equations shows that the system passes through nearly metastable
intermediate configurations, while seeking the final minimum-energy, steady
state consistent with the square symmetry of the sample. An efficient scheme to
determine the equilibrium vortex configuration in a mesoscopic system at any
given applied field, not limited to the symmetry of the system, is devised and
demonstrated.
