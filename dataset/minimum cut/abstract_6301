Grids of models of massive stars ($M \ge$ 20 $M_\odot$) with rotation are
computed for metallicities $Z$ ranging from that of the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC) to that of the Galactic Centre. The hydrostatic effects of rotation, the
rotational mixing and the enhancements of the mass loss rates by rotation are
included. The evolution of the surface rotational velocities of the most
massive O--stars mainly depends on the mass loss rates and thus on the initial
$Z$ value. The minimum initial mass for a star for entering the Wolf--Rayet
(WR) phase is lowered by rotation. For all metallicities, rotating stars enter
the WR phase at an earlier stage of evolution and the WR lifetimes are
increased, mainly as a result of the increased duration of the eWNL phase.
Models of WR stars predict in general rather low rotation velocities ($ < 50$
km s$^{-1}$) with a few possible exceptions, particularly at metallicities
lower than solar where WR star models have in general faster rotation and more
chance to reach the break--up limit.The properties of the WR populations as
predicted by the rotating models are in general in much better agreement with
the observations in nearby galaxies. The observed variation with metallicity of
the fractions of type Ib/Ic supernovae with respect to type II supernovae as
found by Prantzos & Boissier (\cite{Pr03}) is very well reproduced by the
rotating models, while non--rotating models predict much too low ratios.
