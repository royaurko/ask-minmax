We study the first-passage properties of a random walk in the unit interval
in which the length of a single step is uniformly distributed over the finite
range [-a,a]. For a of the order of one, the exit probabilities to each edge of
the interval and the exit time from the interval exhibit anomalous properties
stemming from the change in the minimum number of steps to escape the interval
as a function of the starting point. As a decreases, first-passage properties
approach those of continuum diffusion, but non-diffusive effects remain because
of residual discreteness effects
