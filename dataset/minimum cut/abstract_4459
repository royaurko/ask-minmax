A new catalog of visual double systems containing eclipsing binaries as one
component is presented. The main purpose of this catalog is to compile a
complete list of all known multiples of this variety, both for current analysis
and to highlight those in need of additional observations. All available
photometric and astrometric data were analyzed, resulting in new orbits for
eight systems and new times of minimum light for a number of the eclipsing
binaries. Some of the systems in the catalog have acceptable solutions for
their visual orbits, although in most cases their orbital periods are too long
for simultaneous analysis. Also included, however, are a number of systems
which currently lack an orbital solution but which may be suitable for
simultaneous analysis in the future.
