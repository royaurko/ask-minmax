We set out to investigate stability of the Higgs effective potential in
curved spacetime. To this end, we consider the gauge-less top-Higgs sector with
an additional scalar field. Explicit forms of the terms proportional to the
squares of the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor and the Riemann tensor that arise
at the one-loop level in the effective action has been determined. We have
investigated the influence of these terms on the stability of the scalar
effective potential. The result depends on background geometry. In general, the
potential becomes modified both in the region of the electroweak minimum and in
the region of large field strength.
