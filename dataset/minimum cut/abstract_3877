We present several solutions for the five dimensional gravity models in the
presence of bulk ghosts and tachyons to argue that these "troublesome" fields
can be a useful model-building tool. The ghost-like signature of the kinetic
term for a bulk scalar creates a minimum in the scale factor, removing the
necessity for a negative tension brane in models with the compactified fifth
dimension. It is shown that the model with the positive tension branes and a
ghost field in the bulk leads to the radion stabilization. The bulk scalar with
the variable sign kinetic term can be used to model both positive and negative
tension branes of a finite width in the compact dimension. Finally, we present
several ghost and tachyon field configurations in the bulk that lead to the
localization of gravity in four dimensions, including one solution with the
Gaussian profile for the metric, g_{\mu\nu}(y)=\eta_{\mu\nu}\exp{-\alpha y^2},
which leads to a stronger localization of gravity than the Randall-Sundrum
model.
