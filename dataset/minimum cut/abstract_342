The onset of the {\em wave resistance}, via generation of capillary gravity
waves, of a small object moving with velocity $V$, is investigated
experimentally. Due to the existence of a minimum phase velocity $V_c$ for
surface waves, the problem is similar to the generation of rotons in superfluid
helium near their minimum. In both cases waves or rotons are produced at
$V>V_c$ due to {\em Cherenkov radiation}. We find that the transition to the
wave drag state is continuous: in the vicinity of the bifurcation the wave
resistance force is proportional to $\sqrt{V-V_c}$ for various fluids.
