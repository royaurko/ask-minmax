A statistical analysis of texture on the {\it COBE}-DMR first year sky maps
based on the genus and spot number is presented. A generalized $\chi^2$
statistic is defined in terms of ``observable'' quantities: the genus and spot
density that would be measured by different cosmic observers. This strategy
together with the use of Monte Carlo simulations of the temperature
fluctuations, including all the relevant experimental parameters, represent the
main difference with previous analyses. Based on the genus analysis we find a
strong anticorrelation between the quadrupole amplitude $Q_{rms-PS}$ and the
spectral index $n$ of the density fluctuation power spectrum at recombination
of the form $Q_{rms-PS}= 22.2 \pm 1.7 - (4.7 \pm 1.3) \times n\ \mu$K for fixed
$n$, consistent with previous works. The result obtained based on the spot
density is consistent with this $Q_{rms-PS} (n)$ relation. In addition to the
previous results we have determined, using Monte Carlo simulations, the minimum
uncertainty due to cosmic variance for the determination of the spectral index
with the genus analysis. This uncertainty is $\delta n\approx 0.2$.
