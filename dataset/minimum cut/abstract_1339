We show that the default-all propagation scheme for database annotations is
dangerous. Dangerous here means that it can propagate annotations to the query
output which are semantically irrelevant to the query the user asked. This is
the result of considering all relationally equivalent queries and returning the
union of their where-provenance in an attempt to define a propagation scheme
that is insensitive to query rewriting. We propose an alternative
query-rewrite-insensitive (QRI) where-provenance called minimum propagation. It
is analogous to the minimum witness basis for why-provenance, straight-forward
to evaluate, and returns all relevant and only relevant annotations.
