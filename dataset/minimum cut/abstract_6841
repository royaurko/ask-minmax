The Gamma Cephei planetary system is one of the most interesting systems due
to several reasons: 1.) it is the first planet candidate detected by precise
radial velocity (RV) measurements that was discussed in the literature
(Campbell et al. 1988); 2.) it is a tight binary system with a ~ 20AU; and 3.)
the planet host star is an evolved K-type star. In Hatzes et al. (2003) we
confirmed the presence of the planetary companion with a minimum mass of 1.7
M_Jup at 2 AU. In this paper we present additional eight years of precise RV
data from the Harlan J. Smith 2.7 m Telescope and its Tull Coude spectrograph
at McDonald Observatory. The 900 d signal, that is interpreted as the presence
of the giant planetary companion, is strongly confirmed by adding the new data.
We present an updated orbital solution for the planet, which shows that the
planet is slightly more massive and the orbit more circular than previous
results have suggested. An intensive high-cadence week of RV observations in
2007 revealed that Gamma Cep A is a multi-periodic pulsator. We discuss this
issue within the context of searching for additional planets in this system.
