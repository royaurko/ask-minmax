We discovered major brightenings of the symbiotic variable AS 289 in 1984 and
1995. During the outburst phase in 1996, we detected a temporary drop of the
brightness. We consider that an eclipse is responsible for the fading episode
of AS 289 during outburst, as in FG Ser or V1413 Aql. The profile of light
curve suggests the eclipse may be grazing total, while the brightness at
minimum is considerably brighter than the pre-outburst level, implying that a
certain fraction of the outbursting source remain uneclipsed.
