The pressure distribution beneath a conical sandpile, created by pouring sand
from a point source onto a rough rigid support, shows a pronounced minimum
below the apex (`the dip'). Recent work of the contributors has attempted to explain
this phenomenon by invoking local rules for stress propagation that depend on
the local geometry, and hence on the construction history, of the medium. We
discuss the fundamental difference between such approaches, which lead to
hyperbolic differential equations, and elastoplastic models, for which the
equations are elliptic within any elastic zones present .... This displacement
field appears to be either ill-defined, or defined relative to a reference
state whose physical existence is in doubt. Insofar as their predictions depend
on physical factors unknown and outside experimental control, such
elastoplastic models predict that the observations should be intrinsically
irreproducible .... Our hyperbolic models are based instead on a physical
picture of the material, in which (a) the load is supported by a skeletal
network of force chains ("stress paths") whose geometry depends on construction
history; (b) this network is `fragile' or marginally stable, in a sense that we
define. .... We point out that our hyperbolic models can nonetheless be
reconciled with elastoplastic ideas by taking the limit of an extremely
anisotropic yield condition.
