The forthcoming LHC measurement of hadron multiplicity in proton-nucleus
collisions is a crucial test of the k_t factorization and gluon saturation
based models. Here, we provide quantitative predictions for the pseudorapidity
distribution of charged particles produced in minimum bias proton-nucleus
collisions at the LHC based on the idea of gluon saturation in the color-glass
condensate framework. Our formulation gives good descriptions of the LHC and
RHIC data for the charged-hadron multiplicities in both proton-proton and
nucleus-nucleus collisions, and also the deep inelastic scattering at HERA at
small Bjorken-x.
