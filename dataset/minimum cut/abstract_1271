During RHIC 2010 run, STAR has collected a large amount of minimum-bias,
central and high $p_{T}$ trigger data in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =
39$, 62.4 and 200 GeV with detector configuration for minimum photonic
conversion background. In this article we report on a new high precision
measurement of non-photonic electron mid-rapidity invariant yield, improved
nuclear modification factor and $v_{2}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =
200$ GeV. We also present measurements of mid-rapidity invariant yield at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 62.4$ and $v_{2}$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 39$ and 62.4 GeV.
