The proposed field-of-view of the Kepler mission is at an ecliptic latitude
of ~55 degrees, where the surface density of scattered Kuiper Belt Objects
(KBOs) is a few percent that in the ecliptic plane. The rate of occultations of
Kepler target stars by scattered KBOs with radii r>10km is ~10^-6 to 10^-4 per
star per year, where the uncertainty reflects the current ignorance of the
thickness of the scattered KBO disk and the faint-end slope of their magnitude
distribution. These occultation events will last only ~0.1% of the planned
t_exp=15 minute integration time, and thus will appear as single data points
that deviate by tiny amounts. However, given the target photometric accuracy of
Kepler, these deviations will nevertheless be highly significant, with typical
signal-to-noise ratios of ~10. I estimate that 1-20 of the 10^5 main-sequence
stars in Kepler's field-of-view will exhibit detectable occultations during its
four-year mission. For unresolved events, the signal-to-noise of individual
occultations scales as t_exp^{-1/2}, and the minimum detectable radius could be
decreased by an order of magnitude to ~1 km by searching the individual
3-second readouts for occultations. I propose a number of methods by which
occultation events may be differentiated from systematic effects. Kepler should
measure or significantly constrain the frequency of highly-inclined, ~10
km-sized KBOs.
