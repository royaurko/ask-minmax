In this paper, we construct stationary classical solutions of the shallow
water equation with vanishing Froude number $Fr$ in the so-called lake model.
  To this end we need to study solutions to the following semilinear elliptic
problem \[{cases} -\varepsilon^2\text{div}(\frac{\nabla
u}{b})=b(u-q\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})_+^{p},& \text{in}\; \Omega, u=0,
&\text{on}\;\partial \Omega, {cases} \] for small $\varepsilon>0$, where $p>1$,
$\text{div}(\frac{\nabla q}{b})=0$ and $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is a smooth
bounded domain,.
  We showed that if $\frac{q^2}{b}$ has $m$ strictly local minimum(maximum)
points $\bar z_i,\,i=1,...,m$, then there is a stationary classical solution
approximating stationary $m$ points vortex solution of shallow water equations
with vorticity $\sum_{i=1}^m\frac{2\pi q(\bar z_i)}{b(\bar z_i)}$. Moreover,
strictly local minimum points of $\frac{q^2}{b}$ on the boundary can also give
vortex solutions for the shallow water equation. As a further study we
construct vortex pair solutions as well.
  Existence and asymptotic behavior of single point non-vanishing vortex
solutions were studied by S. De Valeriola and J. Van Schaftingen.
