Power decoding, or "decoding by virtual interleaving", of Reed--Solomon codes
is a method for unique decoding beyond half the minimum distance. We give a new
variant of the Power decoding scheme, building upon the key equation of Gao. We
show various interesting properties such as behavioural equivalence to the
classical scheme using syndromes, as well as a new bound on the failure
probability when the powering degree is 3.
