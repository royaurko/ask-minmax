In this work, we introduce two models of the hybrid metric-Palatini theory of
gravitation. We explore their background evolution, showing explicitly that one
recovers standard General Relativity with an effective Cosmological Constant at
late times. This happens because the Palatini Ricci scalar evolves towards and
asymptotically settles at the minimum of its effective potential during
cosmological evolution. We then use a combination of cosmic microwave
background, Supernovae and baryonic accoustic oscillations background data to
constrain the models' free parameters. For one model in particular, we are able
to constrain the deviation from the gravitational constant $G$ one can have at
early times.
