The equilibrium of dense plasma in a self-gravitation is considered. The
obtained results radically distinguish from the point of view which is commonly
accepted in the astrophysical society. It is important that all these results
were obtained without any disputable speculative assumptions. They were
obtained on the standard physical base by standard formal methods. The novelty
of the obtained results is based on a rejection of the oversimplified ideal gas
approximation which is usually accepted for a star interior description and on
a taking into consideration the electron-nuclear plasma features. It was shown
that there is the minimum for plasma energy at a density and a temperature
which determines the equilibrium state of plasma in the self-gravitation at
zero gradient of the general parameters of plasma. This effect plays an
important role for astrophysics. It enables to explain the mechanism of the
star magnetic field generation and to make a prediction for the spectrum of
star masses with a quite satisfactory agreement for the observation data.
