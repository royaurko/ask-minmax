Equipped with concrete examples of Type IIB orientifolds featuring
poly-instanton corrections to the superpotential, the effects on moduli
stabilization and inflationary cosmology are analyzed. Working in the framework
of the LARGE volume scenario, the Kaehler modulus related to the size of the
four-cycle supporting the poly-instanton contributes sub-dominantly to the
scalar potential. It is shown that this Kaehler modulus gets stabilized and, by
displacing it from its minimum, can play the role of an inflaton. Subsequent
cosmological implications are discussed and compared to experimental data.
