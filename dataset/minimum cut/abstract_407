There is a positive integer $N_0$ such that the following holds. Let $N\ge
N_0$ such that $N$ is divisible by $h$. If $G$ is a tripartite graph with $N$
vertices in each vertex class such that every vertex is adjacent to at least
$2N/3+2h-1$ vertices in each of the other classes, then $G$ can be tiled
perfectly by copies of $K_{h,h,h}$. This extends work by the contributors and also
gives a sufficient condition for tiling by any fixed 3-colorable graph.
Furthermore, we show that the minimum-degree $2N/3+2h-1$ in our result can not
be replaced by $2N/3+ h-2$ and that if $N$ is divisible by $6h$, then the
required minimum degree is $2N/3+h-1$ for $N$ large enough and this is tight.
