In vector quantization the number of vectors used to construct the codebook
is always an undefined problem, there is always a compromise between the number
of vectors and the quantity of information lost during the compression. In this
text we present a minimum of Entropy principle that gives solution to this
compromise and represents an Entropy point of view of signal compression in
general. Also we present a new adaptive Object Quantization technique that is
the same for the compression and the perception.
