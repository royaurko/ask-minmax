We investigate the effect of site-disorder on the superconducting (SC) state
in the attractive Hubbard model within the framework of dynamical mean field
theory. For a fixed interaction strength ($U$), the SC order parameter (OP)
decreases monotonically with increasing disorder ($x$), while the
single-particle spectral gap (SG) decreases for small $x$, reaches a minimum
and keeps increasing for larger $x$. Thus, the system remains gapped beyond the
destruction of the superconducting state, indicating a disorder-driven
superconductor-insulator transition. We investigate this transition in depth
considering the effects of weak and strong disorder for a range of interaction
strengths. In the clean case, the order-parameter is known to increase
monotonically with increasing interaction, saturating at a finite value
asymptotically for $U\rightarrow \infty$. The presence of disorder results in
destruction of superconductivity at large $U$, thus drastically modifying the
clean case behaviour. A physical understanding of our findings is obtained by
invoking particle-hole asymmetry and the probability distributions of the order
parameter and spectral gap.
