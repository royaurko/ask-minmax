Motivated by hypergraph decomposition algorithms, we introduce the notion of
edge-induced vertex-cuts and compare it with the well-known notions of
edge-cuts and vertex-cuts. We investigate the complexity of computing minimum
edge-induced vertex-cuts and demonstrate the usefulness of our notion by
applications in network reliability and constraint satisfaction.
