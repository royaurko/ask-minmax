The efficacy of strained layer threading dislocation filter structures in
single crystal epitaxial layers is evaluated using numerical modeling for (001)
face-centred cubic materials, such as GaAs or Si(1-x)Ge(x), and (0001)
hexagonal materials such as GaN. We find that threading dislocation densities
decay exponentially as a function of the strain relieved, irrespective of the
fraction of threading dislocations that are mobile. Reactions between threading
dislocations tend to produce a population that is a balanced mixture of mobile
and sessile in (001) cubic materials. In contrast, mobile threading
dislocations tend to be lost very rapidly in (0001) GaN, often with little or
no reduction in the immobile dislocation density. The capture radius for
threading dislocation interactions is estimated to be approx. 40nm using cross
section transmission electron microscopy of dislocation filtering structures in
GaAs monolithically grown on Si. We find that the minimum threading dislocation
density that can be obtained in any given structure is likely to be limited by
kinetic effects to approx. 1.0e+04 to 1.0e+05 per square cm.
