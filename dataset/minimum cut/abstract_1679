A funnel transformation is introduced, which acts recursively from higher
towards lower temperatures. It biases the a-priori probabilities of a canonical
or generalized ensemble Metropolis simulation, so that they zoom in on the
global energy minimum, if a funnel exists indeed. A first, crude approximation
to the full transformation, called rugged Metropolis one (RM$_1$), is tested
for Met-Enkephalin. At 300$ $K the computational gain is a factor of two and,
due to its simplicity, RM$_1$ is well suited to replace the conventional
Metropolis updating for these kind of systems.
