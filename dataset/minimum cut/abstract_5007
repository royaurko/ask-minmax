\noindent Given a Riemann surface $M$, the \emph{complexity} of a branched
cover of $M$ to the Riemann sphere $S^2$, of degree $d$ and with branching set
of cardinality $n \geq 3$, is defined as $d$ times the hyperbolic area of the
complement of its branching set in $S^2$. A branched cover $p \colon M \to S^2$
of degree $d$ is \emph{simple} if the cardinality of the pre-image $p^{-1}(y)$
is at least $d-1$ for all $y \in S^2$. The \emph{(simple) complexity} of $M$ is
defined as the infimum of the complexities of all (simple) branched covers of
$M$ to $S^2$. We prove that if $M$ is a closed, connected, orientable Riemann
surface of genus $g \geq 1$, then: (1) its simple complexity equals $8\pi g$,
and (2) its complexity equals $2\pi(m_{\text{min}}+2g-2)$, where
$m_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum total length of a branch datum realizable by a
branched cover $p \colon M \to S^2$.
