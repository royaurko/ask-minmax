We calculate the potential energy surfaces for graphene adsorbed on Cu(111),
Ni(111), and Co(0001) using density functional theory and the Random Phase
Approximation (RPA). For these adsorption systems covalent and dispersive
interactions are equally important and while commonly used approximations for
exchange-correlation functionals give inadequate descriptions of either van der
Waals or chemical bonds, RPA accounts accurately for both. It is found that the
adsorption is a delicate competition between a weak chemisorption minimum close
to the surface and a physisorption minimum further from the surface.
