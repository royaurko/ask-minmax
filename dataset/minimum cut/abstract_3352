The time evolution of the spectral index and the non-thermal flux in 24
impulsive solar hard X-ray flares of GOES class M was studied in RHESSI
observations. The high spectral resolution allows for a clean separation of
thermal and non-thermal components in the 10-30 keV range, where most of the
non-thermal photons are emitted. Spectral index and flux can thus be determined
with much better accuracy than before. The spectral soft-hard-soft behavior in
rise-peak-decay phases is discovered not only in the general flare development,
but even more pronounced in subpeaks. An empirically found power-law dependence
between the spectral index and the normalization of the non-thermal flux holds
during the rise and decay phases of the emission peaks. It is still present in
the combined set of all flares. We find an asymmetry in this dependence between
rise and decay phases of the non-thermal emission. There is no delay between
flux peak and spectral index minimum. The soft-hard-soft behavior appears to be
an intrinsic signature of the elementary electron acceleration process.
