A self consistent effective field theory of modified gravity has recently
been proposed with spontaneous breaking of local Lorentz invariance. The
symmetry is broken by a vector field with the wrong-sign mass term and it has
been shown to have additional graviton modes and modified dispersion relations.
In this paper we study the evolution of a homogeneous and isotropic universe in
the presence of such a vector field with a minimum lying along the time-like
direction. A plethora of different regimes is identified, such as accelerated
expansion, loitering, collapse and tracking.
