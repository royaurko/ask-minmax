The cosmic infrared background from galaxies should have a minimum
fluctuation of the order of 10\% on angular scales probed by the DIRBE (Diffuse
Infrared Background Experiment) on board COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer). We
present the theoretical basis for the analysis and discuss the all-sky
all-wavelengths survey that we conducted. We further show that a linear
combination of maps at different wavelengths can greatly reduce the
fluctuations produced by foreground stars in the near-IR, while not eliminating
the fluctuations of the background from high redshift galaxies. The method is
potentially very powerful, especially at wavelengths in the mid- to far-IR
where the foreground is bright but smooth.
