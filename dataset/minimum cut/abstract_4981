We present first-principles calculations of the structural phase behavior of
the [1:1] \pzta\ superlattice and the \ptoa\ and \pzoa\ parent compounds as a
function of in-plane epitaxial strain. A symmetry analysis is used to identify
the phases and clarify how they arise from an interplay between different kinds
of structural distortions, including out-of-plane and in-plane polar modes,
rotation of oxygen octahedra around out-of-plane or in-plane axes, and an
anti-polar mode. Symmetry-allowed intermode couplings are identified and used
to elucidate the nature of the observed phase transitions. For the
minimum-period [1:1] \pzta\ superlattice, we identify a sequence of three
transitions that occur as the in-plane lattice constant is increased. All four
of the phases involve substantial oxygen octahedral rotations, and an antipolar
distortion is important in the high-tensile-strain phase. Inclusion of these
distortions is found to be crucial for an accurate determination of the phase
boundaries.
