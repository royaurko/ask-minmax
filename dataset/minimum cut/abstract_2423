Point vortices take a triangular lattice structure in a rotating system as a
minimum energy state. We perform a numerical simulation of point vortex systems
using initial conditions indicating that the triangular lattice is randomly
perturbed. The total energy increases with the magnitude of the perturbation.
When the energy is increased, the vortex lattice becomes irregular and a
layered structure appears. When the energy is further increased, the layered
structure disappears and a liquidlike state appears. We interpret the melting
transition with a mean-field approximation for layered structures.
