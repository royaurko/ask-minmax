A technique is presented to characterize the
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) of a representative link with a
multiantenna linear Minimum-Mean-Square-Error receiver in a wireless network
with transmitting nodes distributed according to a doubly stochastic process,
which is a generalization of the Poisson point process. The cumulative
distribution function of the SINR of the representative link is derived
assuming independent Rayleigh fading between antennas. Several representative
spatial node distributions are considered, including networks with both
deterministic and random clusters, strip networks (used to model roadways,
e.g.), hard-core networks and networks with generalized path-loss models. In
addition, it is shown that if the number of antennas at the representative
receiver is increased linearly with the nominal node density, the
signal-to-interference ratio converges in distribution to a random variable
that is non-zero in general, and a positive constant in certain cases. This
result indicates that to the extent that the system assumptions hold, it is
possible to scale such networks by increasing the number of receiver antennas
linearly with the node density. The results presented here are useful in
characterizing the performance of multiantenna wireless networks in more
general network models than what is currently available.
