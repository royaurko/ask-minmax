Recent observations suggest that neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries
rotate within a narrow range of spin frequencies clustered around 300 Hz. A
proposed explanation for this remarkable fact is that gravitational radiation
from a steady-state r-mode oscillation in the neutron star's core halts the
spin-up due to accretion. For the neutron star transients, balancing the
time-averaged accretion torque with gravitational wave emission from
steady-state, constant amplitude r-mode pulsations implies a quiescent
luminosity too bright to be consistent with observations (in particular of Aql
X-1). The viscous dissipation (roughly 10 MeV per accreted nucleon for a spin
of 300 Hz) from such an r-mode makes the core sufficiently hot to power a
thermal luminosity of order 1e34 erg/s when accretion halts. This is the
minimum quiescent luminosity that the neutron star must emit when viscous
heating in the core is balanced by radiative cooling from the surface, as is
the case when the core of the star is superfluid. We therefore conclude that
either the accretion torque is much less than (dM/dt)(GMR)^{1/2}, or that a
steady-state r-mode does not limit the spin rate of the neutron star
transients. Future observations with AXAF and XMM promise to further constrain
the amount of viscous dissipation in the neutron star core.
