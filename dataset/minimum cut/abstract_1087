The measured pseudorapidity distributions of primary charged particles are
presented for d + Au and p + p collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} =}$ 200 GeV
over a wide pseudorapidity range of ${\rm \mid \eta \mid \le}$ 5.4. The results
for d + Au collisions are presented for minimum-bias events and as a function
of collision centrality. The measurements for p + p collisions are shown for
minimum-bias events. The ratio of the charged particle multiplicity in d + Au
and p + A collisions relative to that for inelastic p + p collisions is found
to depend only on ${< N_{part} >}$, and it is remarkably independent of
collision energy and system mass. The deuteron and gold fragmentation regions
in d + Au collisions are in good agreement with proton nucleus data at lower
energies.
