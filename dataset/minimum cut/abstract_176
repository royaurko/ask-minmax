We consider a semi-classical Schr\"odinger operator, -h^2\Delta + V(x).
Assuming that the potential admits a unique global minimum and that the
eigenvalues of the Hessian are linearly independent over the rationals, we show
that the low-lying eigenvalues of the operator determine the Taylor series of
the potential at the minimum.
