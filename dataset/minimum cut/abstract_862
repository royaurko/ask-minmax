A simple lower bound to the capacity of the discrete-time Poisson channel
with average energy $\es$ is derived. The rate ${1/2}\log(1+\es)$ is shown to
be the generalized mutual information of a modified minimum-distance decoder,
when the input follows a gamma distribution of parameter 1/2 and mean $\es$.
