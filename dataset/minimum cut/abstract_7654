We perform a search for dormant comets, asteroidal objects of cometary
origin, in the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population based on dynamical and
physical considerations. Our study is based on albedos derived within the
ExploreNEOs program and is extended by adding data from NEOWISE and the Akari
asteroid catalog. We use a statistical approach to identify asteroids on orbits
that resemble those of short-period near-Earth comets using the Tisserand
parameter with respect to Jupiter, the aphelion distance, and the minimum
orbital intersection distance with respect to Jupiter. From the sample of NEAs
on comet-like orbits, we select those with a geometric albedo $p_V \leq 0.064$
as dormant comet candidates, and find that only $\sim$50% of NEAs on comet-like
orbits also have comet-like albedos. We identify a total of 23 NEAs from our
sample that are likely to be dormant short-period near-Earth comets and, based
on a de-biasing procedure applied to the cryogenic NEOWISE survey, estimate
both magnitude-limited and size-limited fractions of the NEA population that
are dormant short-period comets. We find that 0.3-3.3% of the NEA population
with $H \leq 21$, and $9^{+2}_{-5}$% of the population with diameters $d \geq
1$ km, are dormant short-period near-Earth comets.
