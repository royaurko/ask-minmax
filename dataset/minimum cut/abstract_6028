The generalized bunching (antibunching) corresponds to the maximum (minimum)
probability of detecting all identical particles in a subset of output modes of
a unitary linear network with arbitrary state of single particles at the input.
The generalized antibunching is shown to be a universal (i.e.,
network-independent) attribute of the completely indistinguishable fermions.
The generalized bunching is generally a network-dependent effect, if
quantum-correlated states of identical particles are allowed at a network
input. Using numerical simulations and an old conjecture in linear algebra, we
show that the generalized bunching is an universal attribute of the completely
indistinguishable bosons in two cases: for $\mathcal{K}\ge N$ output modes for
$N$ particles or for $\mathcal{K}\ge 1$ output modes for only
classically-correlated states of particles. The generalized bunching allows for
an efficient verification of the BosonSampling with \textit{an arbitrary
network}.
