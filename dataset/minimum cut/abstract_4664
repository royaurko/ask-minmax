We investigate the time evolution due to gravitational dynamics of a
particular spacetime commonly used in brane-cosmology and string
compactifications, namely the Klebanov-Strassler geometry, which is achieved by
adding a perturbation to the momentum of the static solution. We observe the
effects this has on the spacetime and look for evidence of black hole formation
or collapsing cycles which could lead to singular geometry. The cycles are seen
to commonly re-expand after reaching a minimum value, showing the stability of
the solution against perturbations which would change its size. However black
holes are observed to form for certain perturbations, which could impede common
uses of the throat's stable tip.
