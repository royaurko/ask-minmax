For graphs $F_n$ and $G_n$ of order $n$, if $R(F_n,
G_n)=(\chi(G_n)-1)(n-1)+\sigma(G_n)$, then $F_n$ is said to be $G_n$-good,
where $\sigma(G_n)$ is the minimum size of a color class among all proper
vertex-colorings of $G_n$ with $\chi(G_n)$ colors. Given $\Delta(G_n)\le
\Delta$, it is shown that $P_n$ is asymptotically $G_n$-good if
$\alpha(G_n)\le\frac{n}{4}$.
