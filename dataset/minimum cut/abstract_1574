We derive the observed luminosity function of virialized systems. Coupling
this statistic with the mass function predicted by CDM cosmogonies we obtain
the functional behavior of the mass-to-light ratio over a wide dyna mical range
in mass. We conclude that the mass-to-light ratio has a minimum close t o the
luminosity of an L* galaxy halo. We also show how to derive in a
self-consistent way the X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio for galaxy systems.
As a consequence, we predict a fundamental break in the auto-similar scaling
behavior of fundamental correlat ions in going from the group to the cluster
scales.
