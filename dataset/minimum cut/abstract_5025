In this paper, we consider linear MIMO transceiver design for a cellular
two-way amplify-and-forward relaying system consisting of a single
multi-antenna base station, a single multi-antenna relay station, and multiple
multi-antenna mobile stations (MSs). Due to the two-way transmission, the MSs
could suffer from tremendous multi-user interference. We apply an interference
management model exploiting signal space alignment and propose a transceiver
design algorithm, which allows for alleviating the loss in spectral efficiency
due to half-duplex operation and providing flexible performance optimization
accounting for each user's quality of service priorities. Numerical comparisons
to conventional two-way relaying schemes based on bidirectional channel
inversion and spatial division multiple access-only processing show that the
proposed scheme achieves superior error rate and average data rate performance.
