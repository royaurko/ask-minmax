We study non-supersymmetric minima in N_f=N_c SQCD conjectured by
Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih (ISS). We show that the existence of such minima
depends on the signs of three non-calculable parameters and that no evidence
can be inferred by deforming the theory. We illustrate this by demonstrating
that the conjectured minimum is destabilized in a different deformation of
N_f=N_c SQCD. We also comment briefly on the phenomenological consequences of
this instability.
