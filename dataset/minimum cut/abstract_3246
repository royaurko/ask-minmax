The application of Voronoi and Delaunay tessellation based methods for
reconstructing continuous fields from discretely sampled data sets is
discussed. The succesfull operation as ``multidimensional interpolation''
method is corroborated through their ability to reproduce even intricate
statistical aspects of the analytical predictions of perturbation theory of
cosmic velocity field evolution. The newly developed and fully self-adaptive
technique for density field estimation by means of Delaunay tessellations,
basically exploiting their ``minimum triangulation'' quality, is shown to
succesfully reproduce the morphology of the foamlike structure in N-body
simulations of cosmic structure formation. The full hierarchy of structure is
implicitly and directly reproduced at every spatial resolution scale present in
the particle distribution, at the same time automatically and sharply rendering
its characteristic anisotropic filamentary and wall-like features.
