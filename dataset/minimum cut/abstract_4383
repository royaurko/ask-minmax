The capability of the ALICE detector to reconstruct short-lived resonances
from the very beginning of the LHC p-p program start-up was investigated,
considering about 300,000 minimum bias p-p PYTHIA events at 900 GeV and 10 TeV,
fully reconstructed under the hypothesis of a still misaligned detector. Only
the information from track reconstruction was taken into account and no PID
knowledge was considered. A reliable rho(770) yield estimation was possible in
900 GeV events. Moreover, in 300,000 p-p events at 10 TeV the signal for the
phi-resonance could be extracted. A significance of 9 can be reached if only
resonances with a transverse momentum larger than 1.5 GeV/c are considered.
Moreover, even with this low statistics the phi signal is visible in events
with a multiplicity as high as 100.
