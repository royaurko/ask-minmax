We compute the approximate cross section $\sigma_n^{(0)}$ for producing $n-2$
{\it resolved} gluons in a gluon-gluon collision, using the Parke-Taylor
formula regularized in a Lorentz invariant manner. We find, in double leading
logarithm approximation, that \[ \sigma_{n}^{(0)} \approx \frac{1}{s} \left(
\frac{N_c\alpha_s}{2 \pi \sqrt{12}}
  \ \ln^{2} (s/s_{cut})\right)^{n-2}\ \ , \] where $\sqrt{s_{cut}}$ is the
minimum invariant mass for a resolved gluon pair. There is no factor of
$1/(n-2)!$ multiplying the expression. We present additional numerical results,
and comment on their implications for perturbative calculations of $n$-jet
cross sections at colliders.
