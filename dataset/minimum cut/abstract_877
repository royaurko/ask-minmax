We give classifications of integral lattices which include the Barnes-Wall
lattice $BW_{16}$ or laminated lattices of dimension $1 \leqslant d \leqslant
8$ and of minimum 4. Also, we give certain lattice neighboring from each
lattice. Furthermore, we study spherical designs and the other properties.
