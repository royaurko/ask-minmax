The critical phenomena of the liquid-gas phase transition has been
investigated in the reactions 78,86Kr+58,64Ni at beam energy of 35 MeV/nucleon
using the Landau free energy approach with isospin asymmetry as an order
parameter. Fits to the free energy of fragments showed three minima suggesting
the system to be in the regime of a first order phase transition. The relation
m =-{\partial}F/{\partial}H, which defines the order parameter and its
conjugate field H, has been experimentally verified from the linear dependence
of the mirror nuclei yield ratio data, on the isospin asymmetry of the source.
The slope parameter, which is a measure of the distance from a critical
temperature, showed a systematic decrease with increasing excitation energy of
the source. Within the framework of the Landau free energy approach, isoscaling
provided similar results as obtained from the analysis of mirror nuclei yield
ratio data. We show that the external field is primarily related to the minimum
of the free energy, which implies a modification of the source concentration
\Delta used in isospin studies.
