Using $^{63,65}$Cu nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in magnetic fields up to
30 T we study the microscopic properties of the 12-site valence-bond-solid
ground state in the "pinwheel" kagome compound Rb$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$. We find
that the ground state is characterized by a strong transverse staggered spin
polarization whose temperature and field dependence points to a mixing of the
singlet and triplet states. This is further corroborated by the field
dependence of the gap $\Delta (H)$, which has a level anticrossing with a large
minimum gap value of $\approx \Delta (0)/2$, with no evidence of a phase
transition down to 1.5\,K. By the exact diagonalization of small clusters, we
show that the observed anticrossing is mainly due to staggered tilts of the
$g$-tensors defined by the crystal structure, and reveal symmetry properties of
the low-energy excitation spectrum compatible with the absence of level
crossing.
