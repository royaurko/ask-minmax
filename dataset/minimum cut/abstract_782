A random $n$-permutation may be generated by sequentially removing random
cards $C_1,...,C_n$ from an $n$-card deck $D = \{1,...,n\}$. The permutation
$\sigma$ is simply the sequence of cards in the order they are removed. This
permutation is itself uniformly random, as long as each random card $C_t$ is
drawn uniformly from the remaining set at time $t$. We consider, here, a
variant of this simple procedure in which one is given a choice between $k$
random cards from the remaining set at each step, and selects the lowest
numbered of these for removal. This induces a bias towards selecting lower
numbered of the remaining cards at each step, and therefore leads to a final
permutation which is more "ordered" than in the uniform case (i.e. closer to
the identity permutation id $=(1,2,3,...,n)$).
  We quantify this effect in terms of two natural measures of order: The number
of inversions $I$ and the length of the longest increasing subsequence $L$. For
inversions, we establish a weak law of large numbers and central limit theorem,
both for fixed and growing $k$. For the longest increasing subsequence, we
establish the rate of scaling, in general, and existence of a weak law in the
case of growing $k$. We also show that the minimum strategy, of selecting the
minimum of the $k$ given choices at each step, is optimal for minimizing the
number of inversions in the space of all online $k$-card selection rules.
