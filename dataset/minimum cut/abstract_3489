In order to probe the influence of the surface-induced anisotropy on the
impurity spin magnetization, we measure the anomalous Hall effect in thin AuFe
films at magnetic fields up to 15 T. The observed suppression of the anomalous
Hall resistivity at low fields as well as the appearance of a minimum in the
differential Hall resistivity at higher fields can be explained by our
theoretical model which takes into account the influence of a polycrystalline
film structure on the surface-induced anisotropy. Our results imply that the
apparent discrepancy between different experimental results for the size
effects in dilute magnetic alloys can be linked to a different microstructure
of the samples.
