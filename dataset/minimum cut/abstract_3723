We have considered a cosmological model with a cosmological constant of the
form $\Lambda=3\alpha\frac{\dot R^2}{R^2}+\bt\frac{\ddot R}{R} \alpha, \bt=\rm
const.$ The cosmological constant is found to decrease as $t^{-2}$ and the rate
of particle creation is smaller than the Steady State value. We have found that
this behavior gives $\frac{\Lambda_{Pl}}{\Lambda_p}=10^{120}$ where
$\Lambda_{Pl}$ is the value of $\Lambda$ at Planck time. Solutions with
$\bt=3\alpha$ in the radiation dominated era and $\bt=6\alpha$ in the matter
dominated era are equivalent to the FRW results. We have found an inflationary
solution of the de-Sitter type with $\bt=3-3\alpha$. Some problems of the
Standard Model may be resolved with the presence of the above cosmological
constant in the Einstein's equation. Since observations suggest a contribution
of the vacuum energy density in the range $0.40<\Omega^\Lambda<0.76$, one gets
$4<\beta<12$. If $\alpha=0$ the minimum age of the universe is found to be
$H_p^{-1}$ ($H_p$ is the present Hubble constant) with $\beta=\infty$.
