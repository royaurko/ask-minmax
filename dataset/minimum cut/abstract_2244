We analyse geometric type IIA flux compactifications leading to N=4 gauged
supergravities in four dimensions. The complete landscape of isotropic vacua is
presented, which turns out to belong to a unique theory. The solutions admit an
uplift to maximal supergravity due to the vanishing of the flux-induced
tadpoles for all the supersymmetry-breaking branes. Such an uplift is sketched
out and the full N=8 mass spectra are discussed. We find the interesting
presence of a non-supersymmetric and nevertheless stable minimum.
