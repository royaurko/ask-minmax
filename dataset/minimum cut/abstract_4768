Magnetic excitations in copper pyrimidine dinitrate, a spin-1/2
antiferromagnetic chain with alternating $g$-tensor and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions that exhibits a field-induced spin gap, are probed by means of
pulsed-field electron spin resonance spectroscopy. In particular, we report on
a minimum of the gap in the vicinity of the saturation field $H_{sat}=48.5$ T
associated with a transition from the sine-Gordon region (with soliton-breather
elementary excitations) to a spin-polarized state (with magnon excitations).
This interpretation is fully confirmed by the quantitative agreement over the
entire field range of the experimental data with the DMRG investigation of the
spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with a staggered transverse field.
