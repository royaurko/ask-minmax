The drift mobility of the negative oxygen ion in dense Argon gas near the
liquid-vapor critical point has been measured as a function of the density.
Near the critical temperature the zero-field density-normalized ion mobility
shows a deep minimum at a density smaller than the critical one. This
phenomenon was previously intepreted as the result of the formation of a
correlated cluster of Argon atoms around the ion because of the strong
electrostriction exerted by the ion on the highly polarizable and compressible
gas. We now suggest that a possible alternative explanation is related to the
onset of a parametric resonance of a bubble surrounding the ion. At resonance a
large amount of energy is dissipated by sound waves in addition to viscous
dissipation processes, resulting in the large mobility drop observed.
