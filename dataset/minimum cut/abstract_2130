In this paper we investigate the possibility of finding models that, in the
global minimum, break SUSY by a combined F and D-term effect. We find that if
the superpotential is a cubic polynomial in the fields and the Kahler potential
is canonical this does not happen. We then give two examples where the previous
conditions do not apply and where the vacuum of the model breaks SUSY by
combined F and D-term vevs: SQCD+singlet with N_C=N_F+1, and a baryon deformed
ISS model. We briefly discuss the phenomenological viability of the models.
