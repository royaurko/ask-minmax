The minimum weight states of the Lipkin model consisting of n single-particle
levels and obeying the su(n)-algebra are investigated systematically. The basic
idea is to use the su(2)-algebra which is independent of the su(n)-algebra.
This idea has been already presented by the present contributors in the case of the
conventional Lipkin model consisting of two single-particle levels and obeying
the su(2)-algebra. If following this idea, the minimum weight states are
determined for any fermion number occupying appropriately n single-particle
levels. Naturally, the conventional minimum weight state is included: all
fermions occupy energetically the lowest single-particle level in the absence
of interaction.
