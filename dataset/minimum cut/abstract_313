The Minimum Rate of Dissipation Principle (MRDP) affirms that, for
time-independent boundary conditions, a thermodynamic system evolves towards a
steady-state with the least possible dissipation. In this note, examples of
diffusion processes of two solutes in an isothermal system are analyzed in
detail. In particular, we consider the relaxation of the system when the metric
tensor (i.e. the Onsager matrix) is constant and when the Onsager coefficients
weakly depend on the spatial derivatives of the concentrations. We show that,
to leading order, during the relaxation towards a steady-state, the system
traces out a geodesic in the space of thermodynamic configurations, in
accordance with the MRDP.
