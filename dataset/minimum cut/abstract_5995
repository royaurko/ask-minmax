Analyzing the available photometry from the Kepler satellite and other
databases, we performed detailed light curve modeling of 10 eclipsing binary
systems that were found to exhibit a periodic modulation of their orbital
periods. All of the selected systems are detached Algol type, with orbital
periods from 0.9 to 2.9 days. In total, 9448 times of minimum for these
binaries were analyzed in an attempt to identify the period variations caused
by the third bodies in these systems. The well-known method of the light-travel
time effect was used for the analysis. The orbital periods of the outer bodies
were found to be between 1 and 14 years. This hypothesis makes such systems
interesting for future prospective detections of these components, despite
their low predicted masses. Considering the dynamical interaction between the
orbits, the system KIC 3440230 seems to be the most interesting, in which one
would expect the detection of some effects (i.e., changing the inclination)
even after a few years or decades of observations.
