We study theoretically the capillary-gravity waves created at the water-air
interface by a small object during a sudden accelerated or decelerated
rectilinear motion. We analyze the wave resistance corresponding to the
transient wave pattern and show that it is nonzero even if the involved
velocity (the final one in the accelerated case, the initial one in the
decelerated case) is smaller than the minimum phase velocity $c_{min}=23
\mathrm{cm s^{-1}}$. These results might be important for a better
understanding of the propulsion of water-walking insects where accelerated and
decelerated motions frequently occur.
