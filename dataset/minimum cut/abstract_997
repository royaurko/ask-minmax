We report a theoretical study on the deviations of the Meissner penetration
depth $\lambda(T)$ from its London value in d-wave superconductors at low
temperatures. The difference arises from low-energy surface Andreev bound
states. The temperature dependent penetration depth is shown to go through a
minimum at the temperature $T_{m0}\sim \sqrt{\xi_0/\lambda_0}T_c$ if the
broadening of the bound states is small. The minimum will straighten out when
the broadening reaches $T_{m0}$. The impurity scattering sets up the
low-temperature anomalies of the penetration depth and destroys them when the
mean free path is not sufficiently large. A phase transition to a state with
spontaneous surface supercurrent is investigated and its critical temperature
determined in the absence of a subdominant channel activated at low
temperatures near the surface. Nonlinear corrections from Andreev low-energy
bound states to the penetration length are obtained and shown, on account of
their broadening, to be small in the Meissner state of strong type II
superconductors.
