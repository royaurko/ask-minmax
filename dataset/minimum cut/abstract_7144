We construct an L^2-model of "very small" irreducible unitary representations
of simple Lie groups G which, up to finite covering, occur as conformal groups
Co(V) of simple Jordan algebras V. If $V$ is split and G is not of type A_n,
then the representations are minimal in the sense that the annihilators are the
Joseph ideals. Our construction allows the case where G does not admit minimal
representations. In particular, applying to Jordan algebras of split rank one
we obtain the entire complementary series representations of SO(n,1)_0. A
distinguished feature of these representations in all cases is that they attain
the minimum of the Gelfand--Kirillov dimensions among irreducible unitary
representations. Our construction provides a unified way to realize the
irreducible unitary representations of the Lie groups in question as
Schroedinger models in L^2-spaces on Lagrangian submanifolds of the minimal
real nilpotent coadjoint orbits. In this realization the Lie algebra
representations are given explicitly by differential operators of order at most
two, and the key new ingredient is a systematic use of specific second-order
differential operators (Bessel operators) which are naturally defined in terms
of the Jordan structure.
