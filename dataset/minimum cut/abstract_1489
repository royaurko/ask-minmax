We report observations of a steady 20 year decline of solar photospheric
fields at latitudes $\geq$45${^{o}}$ starting from $\sim$1995. This prolonged
and continuing decline, combined with the fact that Cycle 24 is already past
its peak, implies that magnetic fields are likely to continue to decline until
$\sim$2020, the expected minimum of the ongoing solar Cycle 24. In addition,
interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations of the inner heliosphere for
the period 1983--2013 and in the distance range 0.2--0.8 AU, have also shown a
similar and steady decline in solar wind micro-turbulence levels, in sync with
the declining photospheric fields. Using the correlation between the polar
field and heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) at solar minimum, we have estimated
the value of the HMF in 2020 to be 3.9 ($\pm$0.6) and a floor value of the HMF
of $\sim$3.2 ($\pm$0.4) nT. Given this floor value for the HMF, our analysis
suggests that the estimated peak sunspot number for solar Cycle 25 is likely to
be $\sim$ 62 ($\pm$12).
