In this paper, we will study the effect of having a minimum measurable length
on inflationary cosmology. We will analyse the inflationary cosmology in the
Jacobson approach. In this approach, gravity is viewed as an emergent
thermodynamical phenomena. We will demonstrate that the existence of a minimum
measurable length will modify the Friedmann equations in the Jacobson approach.
We will use this modified Friedmann equation to analyse the effect of minimum
measurable length scale on inflationary cosmology. This analysis will be
performed using the Hamiltonian-Jacobi approach. We compare our results to
recent data, and find that our model may agree with the recent data.
