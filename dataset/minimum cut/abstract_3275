We present XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) observations of
the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15, focusing on the broad Fe K$\alpha$
line at ~6keV and the associated reflection continuum, which is believed to
originate from the inner accretion disk. We find these reflection features to
be extremely broad and red-shifted, indicating its origin from the very most
central regions of the accretion disk. It seems likely that we have caught this
source in the ``deep minimum'' state first observed by Iwasawa et al. (1996).
The implied central concentration of X-ray illumination is difficult to
understand in any pure accretion disk model. We suggest that we are witnessing
the extraction and dissipation of rotational energy from a spinning black hole
by magnetic fields connecting the black hole or plunging region to the disk.
