We discussed hierarchies and rescaling rule of the self similar
transformations in Ising models, and define a fractal dimension of an ordered
cluster, which minimum corresponds to a fixed point of the transformations. By
the fractal structures we divide the clusters into two types: irreducible and
reducible. A relationship of cluster spin with its coordination number and
fractal dimension is obtained.
