In this paper we have investigated on the reliability of streams for a VoD
system. The objective of the paper is to maximize the availability of streams
for the peers in the VoD system. We have achieved this by using data
replication technique in the peers. Hence, we proposed a new data replication
technique to optimally store the videos in the peers. The new data replication
technique generates more number of replicas than the existing techniques such
as random, minimum request and maximize hit. We have also investigated by
applying the CTMC model for the reliability of replications during the peer
failures. Our result shows that the mean lifetime of replicas are more under
various circumstances. We have addressed the practical issues of efficient
utilization of overall bandwidth and buffer in the VoD system. We achieved
greater success playback probability of videos than the existing techniques.
