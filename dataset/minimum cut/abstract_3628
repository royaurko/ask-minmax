The magnetic-field (H) dependence of the thermal conductivity \kappa of
Pr_{1.3}La_{0.7}CuO_4 is found to show a pronounced minimum for in-plane fields
at low temperature, which is best attributed to the scattering of phonons by
free spins that are seen by a Schottky-type specific heat and a Curie-Weiss
susceptibility. Besides pointing to a strong spin-phonon coupling in cuprates,
the present result demonstrates that the H-dependence of the phonon heat
transport should not be naively neglected when discussing the \kappa(H)
behavior of cuprates, since the Schottky anomaly is ubiquitously found in
cuprates at any doping.
