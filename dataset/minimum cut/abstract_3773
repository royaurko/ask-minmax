The fine-tuning principles are analyzed in search for predictions of
top-quark and Higgs-boson masses. The modification of Veltman condition based
on the compensation between fermion and boson vacuum energies within the
Standard Model multiplets is proposed. It is supplied with the stability under
rescaling and with the requirement of minimum for the physical v. e. v. for the
Higgs field (zero anomalous dimension). Their joint solution for top-quark and
Higgs-boson couplings exists for the cutoff $\Lambda \approx 2.3 \cdot
10^{13}\,GeV$ that yields the low-energy values $m_t = 151 \pm 4\,GeV;
m_H = 195 \pm 7\,GeV$.
