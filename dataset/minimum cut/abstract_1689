We propose a method for predicting helical membrane protein structures by
computer simulations. Our method consists of two parts. In the first part,
amino-acid sequences of the transmembrane helix regions are obtained from one
of existing WWW servers. In the second part, we perform a replica-exchange
simulation of these transmembrane helices with some constraints and identify
the predicted structure as the global-minimum-energy state. We have tested the
method with the dimeric transmembrane domain of glycophorin A. The structure
obtained from the prediction was in close agreement with the experimental data.
