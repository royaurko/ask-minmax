Two sets are said to be almost disjoint if their intersection is finite.
Almost disjoint subsets of [omega]^omega and omega^omega have been studied for
quite some time. In particular, the cardinal invariants a and a_e, defined to
be the minimum cardinality of a maximal infinite almost disjoint family of
[omega]^omega and omega^omega respectively, are known to be consistently less
than continuum. Here we examine analogs for functions in R^omega and
projections on l^2, showing that they too can be consistently less than
continuum.
