In this work we study configurations in one-dimensional scalar field theory,
which are time-dependent, localized in space and extremely long-lived called
oscillons. It is investigated how the action of changing the minimum value of
the field configuration representing the oscillon affects its behavior. We find
that one of the consequences of this procedure, is the appearance of a pair of
oscillon-like structures presenting different amplitudes and frequencies of
oscillation.
