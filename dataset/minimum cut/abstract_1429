Small aerosols drift down temperature or turbulence gradient since faster
particles fly longer distances before equilibration. That fundamental
phenomenon, called thermophoresis or turbophoresis, is widely encountered in
nature and used in industry. It is universally believed that particles moving
down the kinetic energy gradient must concentrate in minima (say, on walls in
turbulence). Here we show that this is incorrect: escaping minima is possible
for inertial particles whose time of equilibration is longer than the time to
reach the minimum. The best way out is always through: particles escape by
flying through minima or reflecting from walls. We solve the problem
analytically and find the phase transition as a sign change of the mean
velocity. That means separation: light particles concentrate in a minimum while
heavy particles spread away from it (gravity can reverse the effect). That
discovery changes understanding of that fundamental phenomenon and may find
numerous applications.
