Measuring yielding in cohesive suspensions is often hampered by slip at
measurement surfaces. This paper presents creep data for strongly-flocculated
suspensions obtained using vane-in-cup tools with differing cup-to-vane
diameter ratios. The three suspensions were titania and alumina aggregated at
their isoelectric points and polymer-flocculated alumina. The aim was to find
the diameter ratio where slip or premature yielding at the cup wall had no
effect on the transient behaviour. The large diameter ratio results showed
readily understandable material behaviour comprising linear viscoelasticity at
low stresses, strain-softening close to yielding, time-dependent yield across a
range of stresses and then viscous flow. Tests in small ratio geometries
however showed more complex responses. Effects attributed to the cup wall
included delayed softening, slip, multiple yielding and stick-slip events, and
unsteady flow. The conclusion was that cups have to be relatively large to
eliminate wall artefacts. A diameter ratio of three was sufficient in practice,
although the minimum ratio must be material dependent.
