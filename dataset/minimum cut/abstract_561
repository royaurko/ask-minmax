We report an unusual temperature (T) dependent electrical resistivity($\rho$)
behavior in a class of ternary intermetallic compounds of the type RCuAs$_2$
(R= Rare-earths). For some rare-earths (Sm, Gd, Tb and Dy) with negligible
4f-hybridization, there is a pronounced minimum in $\rho$(T) far above
respective N\'eel temperatures (T$_N$). However, for the rare-earths which are
more prone to exhibit such a $\rho$(T) minimum due to 4f-covalent mixing and
the Kondo effect, this minimum is depressed. These findings, difficult to
explain within the hither-to-known concepts, present an interesting scenario in
magnetism.
