The demixing of two-component fermions in optical lattices under a
spin-dependent external potential is investigated using the density-matrix
renormalization group method. The influence of on-site interactions (u) and the
ratio of the spin-dependent external potentials ($\gamma$) on the demixing is
discussed. The $\gamma-u$ state diagram is numerically mapped out, from which
we distinguish the phase-mixed region from the phase-separated one. A minimum
point appears in the phase boundary. On the right part of the point an
insulating core is formed in the spin-up densities during the demixing, while
on the left one only metallic phase exists.
