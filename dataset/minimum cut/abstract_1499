The Airy structure in $^{16}$O+$^{14}$C rainbow scattering is studied with an
extended double folding (EDF) model that describes all the diagonal and
off-diagonal coupling potentials derived from the microscopic realistic wave
functions for $^{16}$O using a density-dependent nucleon-nucleon force. The
experimental angular distributions at $E_L$=132, 281 and 382.2 MeV are well
reproduced by the calculations. By studying the energy evolution of the Airy
structure, the Airy minimum at around $\theta$=76$^\circ$ in the angular
distribution at $E_L$=132 MeV is assigned as the second order Airy minimum $A2$
in contrast to the recent literature which assigns it as the third order $A3$.
The Airy minima in the 90$^\circ$ excitation function is investigated in
comparison with well-known $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C systems.
Evolution of the Airy structure into the molecular resonances with the
$^{16}$O+$^{14}$C cluster structure in the low energy region around
$E_{c.m.}$=30 MeV is discussed. It is predicted theoretically for the first
time for a non-$4N$ $^{16}$O+$^{14}$C system that Airy elephants in the
90$^\circ$ excitation function are present.
