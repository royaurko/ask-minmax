The application of the conventional theory of macroparameter fluctuations has
been shown to go beyond the framework of the thermodynamic description in a
number of cases. The principles of the theory of quantum-thermal fluctuations
of effective macroparameters and their correlations have been formulated. The
theory satisfies the applicability conditions of equilibrium thermodynamics and
is based on effective macroparameters, which take the integral stochastic
action of the environment into account at any temperatures. The correlator of
conjugate macroparameters, namely, the effective entropy and the effective
temperature, has been calculated. The correlator was found to be proportional
to the effective action which characterizes the stochastic environment. The
pair correlators for the conjugate effective parameters entropy-temperature and
coordinate-momentum have been demonstrated to depend linearly on the effective
action, with their minimum values being determined by Planck's constant.
