We continue our investigation of the phenomenological implications of the
"deformed" commutation relations [x_i,p_j]=i hbar[(1 + beta p^2) delta_{ij} +
beta' p_i p_j]. These commutation relations are motivated by the fact that they
lead to the minimal length uncertainty relation which appears in perturbative
string theory. In this paper, we consider the effects of the deformation on the
classical orbits of particles in a central force potential. Comparison with
observation places severe constraints on the value of the minimum length.
