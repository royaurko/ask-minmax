We give a brief review of interacting NADE model in non-flat universe. we
study the effect of spatial curvature $\Omega_{k}$, interaction coefficient
$\alpha $ and the main parameter of NADE, $n$, On EoS parameter $w_{d}$ and
deceleration parameter $q$. We obtain a minimum value for $n$ in both early and
present time, in order to that our DE model crosses the phantom divide. Also in
a closed universe, changing the sign of $q$ is strongly dependent on $\alpha$.
It has been shown that the quantities $w_{d}$ and $q$ have a different
treatment for various spatial curvature. At last, we calculate the statefinder
diagnostic and $ w-w^{\prime}$ analysis in non flat universe. In non flat
universe, the statefinder trajectory is discriminated by both $n$ and $\alpha$.
