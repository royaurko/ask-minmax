Let $F_n$ be the free group of a finite rank $n$. We study orbits
$Orb_{\phi}(u)$, where $u$ is an element of the group $F_n$, under the action
of an automorphism $\phi$. If an orbit like that is finite, we determine
precisely what its cardinality can be if $u$ runs through the whole group
$F_n$, and $\phi$ runs through the whole group $Aut(F_n)$.
  Another problem that we address here is related to Whitehead's algorithm that
determines whether or not a given element of a free group of finite rank is an
automorphic image of another given element. It is known that the first part of
this algorithm (reducing a given free word to a free word of minimum possible
length by elementary Whitehead automorphisms) is fast (of quadratic time with
respect to the length of the word). On the other hand, the second part of the
algorithm (applied to two words of the same minimum length) was always
considered very slow. We give here an improved algorithm for the second part,
and we believe this algorithm always terminates in polynomial time with respect
to the length of the words. We prove that this is indeed the case if the free
group has rank 2.
