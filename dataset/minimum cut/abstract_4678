We report on the perspective measurements of inclusive particle production in
high-energy p-p collisions with data to be collected by the LHCb experiment at
CERN's LHC. These include V0 and D meson production studies, which can be based
on a minimum bias sample, as well as charmonia production studies, which need a
muon-triggered samples. Using reconstructed $J/\psi \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays,
both the prompt $J/\psi$ and $b\to J/\psi$ production cross-sections will be
determined, in the forward pseudo-rapidity range of 2-5 covered by LHCb. Due to
the large production rate, such analyses will be possible with very small
integrated luminosities of the order of a few $\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$. Other
charmonia related measurements will also be discussed, such as that of the
$J/\psi$ polarization at production or of the production of some of the new X,
Y and Z states.
