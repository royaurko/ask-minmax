Dynamically cold components are well known to destabilize hotter, even much
more massive components. In this paper we studied the dynamical influence of a
cold dust component on the gaseous phase in the central regions of galactic
disks. We performed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations for flat
multi-component disks embedded in a combined static stellar and dark matter
potential. The pressure-free dust component is coupled to the gas by a drag
force depending on their velocity difference.
  It turned out that the most unstable regions are those with either a low or
near to minimum Toomre parameter or with rigid rotation, i.e. the central area.
In that regions the dust-free disks become most unstable for high azimuthal
modes (m~8), whereas in dusty disks all modes have a similar amplitude
resulting in a patchy appearance. The structures in the dust have a larger
contrast between arm and inter-arm regions than those of the gas. The dust
peaks are frequently correlated with peaks of the gas distribution, but they do
not necessarily coincide with them. Therefore, a large scatter in the
dust-to-gas ratios is expected. The appearance of the dust is more cellular
(i.e. sometimes connecting different spiral features), whereas the gas is
organized in a multi-armed spiral structure.
  An admixture of 2% dust destabilizes gaseous disks substantially, whereas
dust-to-gas ratios below 1% have no influence on the evolution of the gaseous
disk. For a high dust-to-gas ratio of 10% the instabilities reach a saturation
level already after 30 Myr.
