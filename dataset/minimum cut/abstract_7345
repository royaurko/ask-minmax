We show that recently documented trends in galaxy sizes with mass and
redshift can be understood in terms of the influence of underlying cosmic
evolution; a holistic view which is complimentary to interpretations involving
the accumulation of discreet evolutionary processes acting on individual
objects. Using standard cosmology theory, supported with results from the
Millennium simulations, we derive expected size trends for collapsed cosmic
structures, emphasising the important distinction between these trends and the
assembly paths of individual regions. We then argue that the observed variation
in the stellar mass content of these structures can be understood to first
order in terms of natural limitations of cooling and feedback. But whilst these
relative masses vary by orders of magnitude, galaxy and host radii have been
found to correlate linearly. We explain how these two aspects will lead to
galaxy sizes that closely follow observed trends and their evolution, comparing
directly with the COSMOS and SDSS surveys. Thus we conclude that the observed
minimum radius for galaxies, the evolving trend in size as a function of mass
for intermediate systems, and the observed increase in the sizes of massive
galaxies, may all be considered an emergent consequence of the cosmic
expansion.
