We present the fourteen year-long light curve of the SW Sextantis nova-like
variable, HS 0455+8315, from 2000 November to 2015 February which reveals two
deep faint states at magnitude 19 - 20, each of which lasted about 500 and 540
days. Outside these faint states, the star spent most of the time in a normal
state at a magnitude of about 15.3. The second faint state was the better
observed of the two and was found to have a linear decline of 0.009 mag/day,
which was soon followed by a more rapid brightening at -0.020 mag/day. Time
series photometry during both the normal state and near minimum light at about
magnitude 18 showed that the eclipses had very similar profiles and that
outside the eclipse there were irregular modulations typical of the flickering
inherent to accreting CVs. Our photometry leading up to the minimum shows that
accretion was still ongoing during this time.
