We have undertaken a systematic search for candidate supernovae from
high-redshift Population III stars in a field that has been observed with
repeated imaging on a cadence of 2-3 weeks over a 2.2 year baseline, the
Spitzer/IRAC Dark Field. The individual epochs reach a typical 5-sigma depth of
1 uJy in IRAC Channel 1 (3.6 um). Requiring a minimum of four epochs coverage,
the total effective area searched is 214 sq arcminutes. The unprecedented depth
and multi-epochal nature of these data make it ideal for a first foray to
detect transient objects which may be candidate luminous Pair Instability
Supernovae from the primordial-metallicity first stars. The search was
conducted over a broad range of timescales, allowing for different durations of
the putative candidates' light curve plateau phases. All candidates were vetted
by inspection of the Spitzer imaging data, as well as deep HST/ACS F814W
imaging available over the full field. While many resolved-source objects were
found with Spitzer variability, no transient objects could plausibly be
identified as high-redshift supernovae candidates. The resulting 95% confidence
level upper limit is 23/sq deg/yr, for sources with plateau timescales under
400/(1+z) days and brightnesses above ~1 uJy.
