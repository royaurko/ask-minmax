The parameters of the supersymmetry Lagrangian are the place where experiment
and theory will meet. We show that measuring them is harder than has been
thought, particularly because of large unavoidable dependences on phases.
Measurements are only guaranteed if a lepton collider with a polarized beam and
sufficient energy to produce the relevant sparticles is available. Current
limits on superpartner masses, WIMPs, and the supersymmetric Higgs are not
general, and need re-evaluation. We also tentatively define the MRM (Minimum
Reasonable Model), whose parameters may be measurable at LEP, FNAL and LHC.
