Recent developments in the analysis of Langevin equations with multiplicative
noise (MN) are reported. In particular, we:
  (i) present numerical simulations in three dimensions showing that the MN
equation exhibits, like the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation both a weak
coupling fixed point and a strong coupling phase, supporting the proposed
relation between MN and KPZ;
  (ii) present dimensional, and mean field analysis of the MN equation to
compute critical exponents;
  (iii) show that the phenomenon of the noise induced ordering transition
associated with the MN equation appears only in the Stratonovich representation
and not in the Ito one, and
  (iv) report the presence of a new first-order like phase transition at zero
spatial coupling, supporting the fact that this is the minimum model for noise
induced ordering transitions.
