The computational Projective Dynamics method is used to analyze simulations
of magnetization reversal in nanoscale magnetic pillars. It is shown that this
method can be used to determine the magnetizations corresponding to the
metastable minimum and saddle point in the free energy, and the free-energy
barrier associated with those points. For the nanopillars studied here, entropy
is found to provide a significant contribution to the free-energy barrier which
determines the reversal time scale.
