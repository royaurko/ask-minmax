The evolution of the quintessence field during a phase of chaotic inflation
is studied. The inflaton and the quintesssence field are described in a
supergravity framework where the coupling between the inflaton and quintessence
is induced by non-renormalisable operators suppressed by the Planck mass. We
show that the resulting quintessence potential during inflation possesses a
time--dependent minimum playing the role of an attractor. The presence of this
attractor forces the quintessence field to be small during inflation. These
initial conditions are such that the quintessence field is on tracks now.
