In this paper, linear $\varepsilon$-orthogonality preserving mappings are
studied. We define $\hat{\varepsilon}\left(T\right) $ as the smallest
$\varepsilon$ for which $T$ is $\varepsilon$-orthogonality preserving, and then
derive an exact formula for $\hat{\varepsilon}\left( T\right) $ in terms of
$\left \Vert T\right \Vert $ and the minimum modulus $m\left( T\right) $ of
$T$. We see that $\varepsilon$-orthogonality preserving mappings (for some
$\varepsilon<1$) are exactly the operators that are bounded from below. We
improve an upper bounded in the stability equation given in [7, Theorem 2.3],
which was thought to be sharp.
