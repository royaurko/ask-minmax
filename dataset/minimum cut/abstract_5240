We study Faraday patterns in quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein
condensates with parametrically driven dipolar interactions. We show that in
the presence of a roton minimum in the excitation spectrum, the emergent
Faraday waves differ substantially in two- and one-dimensional geometries,
providing a clear example of the key role of confinement dimensionality in
dipolar gases. Moreover, Faraday patterns constitute an excellent tool to study
non-local effects in polar gases, as we illustrate for two parallel
quasi-one-dimensional dipolar condensates. Non-local interactions between the
condensates give rise to an excitation spectrum characterized by symmetric and
anti-symmetric modes, even in the absence of hopping. We show that this
feature, absent in non-dipolar gases, results in a critical driving frequency
at which a marked transition occurs between correlated and anti-correlated
Faraday patterns in the two condensates. Interestingly, at this critical
frequency, the emergent Faraday pattern stems from a spontaneous symmetry
breaking mechanism.
