A new ordering, extending the notion of universal cycles of Chung {\em et
al.} (1992), is proposed for the blocks of $k$-uniform set systems. Existence
of minimum coverings of pairs by triples that possess such an ordering is
established for all orders. Application to the construction of short 2-radius
sequences is given, with some new 2-radius sequences found through computer
search.
