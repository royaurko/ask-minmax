This paper uses an incremental matrix expansion approach to derive asymptotic
eigenvalue distributions (a.e.d.'s) of sums and products of large random
matrices. We show that the result can be derived directly as a consequence of
two common assumptions, and matches the results obtained from using R- and
S-transforms in free probability theory. We also give a direct derivation of
the a.e.d. of the sum of certain random matrices which are not free. This is
used to determine the asymptotic signal-to-interference-ratio of a multiuser
CDMA system with a minimum mean-square error linear receiver.
