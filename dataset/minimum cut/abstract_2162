It has been known since 1981 that if one fixes an orientable surface $S$ of
genus $g$, then there is a real number $\lambda_{min,g} > 1$ that is the
dilatation of a pA diffeomorphism of $S$, and every other pA diffeomorphism of
$S$ has dilatation $\geq \lambda_{min,g}$. We will show how a little-known
theorem about digraphs gives some insight into $\lambda_{min,g}$.
