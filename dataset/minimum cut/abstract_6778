The extraordinarily long outburst of GRS 1915+105 makes it one of the most
remarkable low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). It has been in a state of constant
outburst since its discovery in 1992, an eruption which has persisted ~100
times longer than those of more typical LXMBs. The long orbital period of GRS
1915+105 implies that it contains large and massive accretion disc which is
able to fuel its extreme outburst. In this paper, we address the longevity of
the outburst and quiescence phases of GRS 1915+105 using Smooth Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of its accretion disc through many outburst
cycles. Our model is set in the two-alpha framework and includes the effects of
the thermo-viscous instability, tidal torques, irradiation by central X-rays
and wind mass loss. We explore the model parameter space and the examine the
impact of the various ingredients. We predict that the outburst of GRS 1915+105
should last a minimum of 20 years and possibly up to ~100 years if X-ray
irradiation is very significant. The predicted recurrence times are of the
order of 10^4 years, making the X-ray duty cycle a few 0.1%. Such a low duty
cycle may mean that GRS 1915+105 is not an anomaly among the more standard
LMXBs and that many similar, but quiescent, systems could be present in the
Galaxy.
