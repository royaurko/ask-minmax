A new narrow 3-atom loss resonance associated with an Efimov trimer crossing
the 3-atom threshold has recently been discovered in a many-body system of
ultracold 6Li atoms in the three lowest hyperfine spin states at a magnetic
field near 895 G. O'Hara and coworkers have used measurements of the 3-body
recombination rate in this region to determine the complex 3-body parameter
associated with Efimov physics. Using this parameter as the input, we calculate
the universal predictions for the spectrum of Efimov states and for the 3-body
recombination rate in the universal region above 600 G where all three
scattering lengths are large. We predict an atom-dimer loss resonance at (672
+/- 2) G associated with an Efimov trimer disappearing through an atom-dimer
threshold. We also predict an interference minimum in the 3-body recombination
rate at (759 +/- 1) G where the 3-spin mixture may be sufficiently stable to
allow experimental study of the many-body system.
