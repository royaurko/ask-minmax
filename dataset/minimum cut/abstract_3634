Porous magnesium diboride samples have been prepared by the heat treatment of
a pressed mixture of Mg and MgB2 powders. It was found that linked
superconducting structure is formed down to the minimum normalized density
gamma= d/do= 0.16 (percolation threshold), where d is the density of MgB2
averaged over the sample, do= 2.62 g/cm3 is the X-ray density. Lattice
parameters and critical temperature of the porous sample decrease with
increasing porosity (decreasing gamma) and Tc2= 32K is minimal at gamma= 0.16.
The grain boundaries in the porous samples are transparent for the current and
Jc~3.105A/cm2 in self field at T= 20K in the samples with gamma~ 0.24.
