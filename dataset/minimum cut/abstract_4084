The deformation of a nucleon embedded in various finite nuclei is considered
by taking into account the distortion of the chiral profile functions under the
action of an external field representing the nuclear density. The baryon charge
distribution of the nucleon inside light, medium-heavy and heavy nuclei is
discussed. The mass of the nucleon decreases as it is placed deeper inside the
nucleus and reaches its minimum at the center of the nucleus. We discuss the
quantization of non-spherical solitons and its consequences for the mass
splitting of the delta states. We show that bound nucleons acquire an intrinsic
quadrupole moment due to the deformation effects. These effects are maximal for
densities of nuclei about \rho(R)\sim 0.3...0.35 \rho(0). We also point out
that scale changes of the electromagnetic radii can not simply be described by
an overall swelling factor.
