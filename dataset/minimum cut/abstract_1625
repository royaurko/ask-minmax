We have solved the kinetics of random sequential adsorption of linear
$k$-mers on a one-dimensional disordered substrate for the random sequential
adsorption initial condition and for the random initial condition. The jamming
limits $\theta(\infty, k', k)$ at fixed length of linear $k$-mers have a
minimum point at a particular density of the linear $k'$-mers impurity for
both cases. The coverage of the surface and the jamming limits are compared to
the results for Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo results for the jamming
limits are in good agreement with the analytical results. The continuum limits
are derived from the analytical results on lattice substrates.
