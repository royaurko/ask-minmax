During the 2003 experimental campaign, the aim of realizing reliable fully
non inductive discharges has been successfully completed in Tore Supra. One the
major difficulties in optimizing this scenario comes from MHD stability issues.
Indeed, the current profile obtained with LH antennas in these experiments is
prone to the triggering of single or double tearing modes. Under certain
conditions, the discharges enters in a regime of permanent MHD activity. The
present work investigates the MHD properties of these fully non-inductive
discharges in the operational space defined by the toroidal magnetic field B,
the total plasma current Ip, and the mean parallel index of LH waves . Linear
MHD stability properties divide the operational space in regions separated by
rational values of the minimum of the safety factor. We discuss in our work the
localisation of the transition between benign MHD activity and the MHD regime.
