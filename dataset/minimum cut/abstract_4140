Three generations of full-custom analog integrated circuits designed for
low-power, high-speed sampling of Radio-Frequency (RF) transients in excess of
the Nyquist minimum have been developed. These 0.25$\mu m$ CMOS devices are
denoted the Large Analog Bandwidth Recorder and Digitizer with Ordered Readout
(LABRADOR) ASICs and finally consist of 9 channels of 260 deep sampling.
Continuous sampling is provided with common stop capability. Input analog
bandwidth is approximately 1GHz and sampling speeds are adjustable from 0.02 to
3.7GSa/s. Completely parallel internal conversion supports 12-bit digitization
and readout of all 2340 cells in under 50$\mu s$.
