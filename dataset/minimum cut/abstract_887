Let $c, k_1,..., k_N $ be non-negative numbers, and define a measure $\mu $
in the wedge $W:= \{x\in \mathbb{R} ^N :\, x_i >0, i=1,...,N\} $ by $d\mu =
e^{c|x|^2} x_1 ^{k_1}...x_N ^{k_N} \, dx $. It is shown that among all
measurable subsets of $W$ with fixed $\mu$ -measure, the intersection of $W$
with a ball centered at the origin renders the weighted perimeter relative to
$W$ a minimum.
