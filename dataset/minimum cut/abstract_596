The perturbative QCD formula for minijet production consitutes an important
ingredient in models describing the total cross section and multiparticle
production in hadron-hadron scattering at high energies. Using arguments based
on s-channel unitarity we set bounds on the minimum value of p_T for which the
leading twist minijet formula can be used. For large impact parameters where
correlations between partons appear to be small we find that the minimum value
of p_T should be greater than 2.5 GeV for LHC energies and greater than 3.5 GeV
for cosmic ray energies of about 50 TeV. We also argue that for collisions with
values of impact parameters typical for heavy particle production the values of
minimum p_T are likely to be considerably larger. We also analyze and quantify
the potential role of saturation effects in the gluon density. We find that
although saturation effects alone are not sufficient to restore unitarity, they
are likely to play an important role at LHC energies.
