Contact resistivity rc of InP and GaAs based ohmic contacts was measured in
the 4.2/300 K temperature range. Nonmonotonic dependences rc(T), with a minimum
at temperature 50 K (150 K) for InP (GaAs) based contacts were obtained. The
results can be explained within the framework of the mechanism of current flow
through metal shunts (associated with dislocations) penetrating into the
semiconductor bulk, with allowance being made for electron freeze-out at helium
temperatures. Contact ohmicity in the 4.2/30K temperature range is due to
accumulation band bending near shunt ends at the metal/semiconductor interface.
