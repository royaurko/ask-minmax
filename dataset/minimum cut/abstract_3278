We report the detection of a extrasolar planet candidate orbiting the G1 V
star HD 39091. The orbital period is 2083 d and the eccentricity is 0.62. With
a minimum (M sin $i$) mass of 10.3 M$_{\rm JUP}$ this object falls near the
high mass end of the observed planet mass function, and may plausibly be a
brown dwarf. Other characteristics of this system, including orbital
eccentricity and metallicity, are typical of the well populated class of radial
velocity planets in eccentric orbits around metal-rich stars.
