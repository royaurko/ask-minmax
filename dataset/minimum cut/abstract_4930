Algebraic decoding algorithms are commonly applied for the decoding of
Reed-Solomon codes. Their main advantages are low computational complexity and
predictable decoding capabilities. Many algorithms can be extended for
correction of both errors and erasures. This enables the decoder to exploit
binary quantized reliability information obtained from the transmission
channel: Received symbols with high reliability are forwarded to the decoding
algorithm while symbols with low reliability are erased. In this paper we
investigate adaptive single-trial error/erasure decoding of Reed-Solomon codes,
i.e. we derive an adaptive erasing strategy which minimizes the residual
codeword error probability after decoding. Our result is applicable to any
error/erasure decoding algorithm as long as its decoding capabilities can be
expressed by a decoder capability function. Examples are Bounded Minimum
Distance decoding with the Berlekamp-Massey- or the Sugiyama algorithms and the
Guruswami-Sudan list decoder.
