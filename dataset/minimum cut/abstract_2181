Given two finite groups G(.), G(*) defined on the same set G, their distance
is the number of pairs (x,y) for which x.y and x*y differ. The Cayley stability
of a group G(.) is the minimum distance of G(.) from another group defined on
G. We show that the Cayley stability of the cyclic group of prime order p is
6p-18, for every p>7.
