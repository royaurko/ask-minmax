For the K user, single input single output (SISO), frequency selective
interference channel, a new low complexity transmit beamforming design that
improves the achievable sum rate is presented. Jointly employing the
interference alignment (IA) scheme presented by Cadambe and Jafar in [1] and
linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) decoding at the transmitters and
receivers, respectively, the new IA precoding design improves the average sum
rate while preserving the achievable degrees of freedom of the Cadambe and
Jafar scheme, K/2.
