The atomistic structure of the graphene buffer layer on Si-terminated SiC is
studied using a modified environment-dependent interatomic potential (EDIP).
The investigation of equilibrium state by conjuguate gradients suffers from a
complex multi-minima energy surface. A dedicated procedure is therefore
presented to provide a suitable initial configuration on the way to the
minimum. The result forms an hexagonal pattern with unsticked rods to release
the misfit with the surface. The structure presents an agreement with the
global pattern obtained by experiments and even with the details of an ab
initio calculation.
