Runaway electrons, which are generated in a plasma where the induced electric
field exceeds a certain critical value, can reach very high energies in the MeV
range. For such energetic electrons, radiative losses will contribute
significantly to the momentum space dynamics. Under certain conditions, due to
radiative momentum losses, a non-monotonic feature - a "bump" - can form in the
runaway electron tail, creating a potential for bump-on-tail-type instabilities
to arise. Here we study the conditions for the existence of the bump. We derive
an analytical threshold condition for bump appearance and give an approximate
expression for the minimum energy at which the bump can appear. Numerical
calculations are performed to support the analytical derivations.
