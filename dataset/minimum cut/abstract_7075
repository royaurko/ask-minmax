In search of the potential realization of novel normal-state phases on the
surface of Sr2RuO4 - those stemming from either topological bulk properties or
the interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SO) and the broken symmetry of the
surface - we revisit the electronic structure of the top-most layers by ARPES
with improved data quality as well as ab-initio LDA slab calculations. We find
that the current model of a single surface layer (\surd2x\surd2)R45{\deg}
reconstruction does not explain all detected features. The observed
depth-dependent signal degradation, together with the close quantitative
agreement with LDA+SO slab calculations based on the LEED-determined surface
crystal structure, reveal that (at a minimum) the sub-surface layer also
undergoes a similar although weaker reconstruction. This points to a
surface-to-bulk progression of the electronic states driven by structural
instabilities, with no evidence for Dirac and Rashba-type states or surface
magnetism.
