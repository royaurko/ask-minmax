The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board Fermi has detected high-energy gamma
rays from the quiet Sun produced by interactions of cosmic-ray nucleons with
the solar surface and cosmic-ray electrons with solar photons in the
heliosphere. Such observations provide a probe of the extreme conditions near
the solar atmosphere and photosphere and permit the study of the modulation of
cosmic rays over the inner heliosphere. For the first year of Fermi
observations the solar modulation was at its minimum corresponding to a maximum
cosmic-ray flux and, hence, maximum gamma-ray emission from the Sun. We discuss
the study of the quiescent solar emission, including spectral analysis of its
two components, disk and inverse Compton, using the first-year data of the
mission and models using the electron spectrum measured by Fermi.
