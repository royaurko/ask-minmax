In this paper we discuss the natural candidate for the one dimensional free
Poincar\'e inequality. Two main strong points sustain this candidacy. One is
the random matrix heuristic and the other the relations with the other free
functional inequalities, namely, the free transportation and Log-Sobolev
inequalities. As in the classical case the Poincar\'e is implied by the others.
This investigation is driven by a nice lemma of Haagerup which relates
logarithmic potentials and Chebyshev polynomials. The Poincar\'e inequality
revolves around the counting number operator for the Chebyshev polynomials of
first kind with respect to the arcsine law on $[-2,2]$. This counting number
operator appears naturally in a representation of the minimum of the
logarithmic potential with external fields as well as in the perturbation of
logarithmic energy with external fields, which is the essential connection
between all these inequalities.
