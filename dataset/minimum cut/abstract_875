The {\it crossing number} of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of pairwise
intersections of edges in a drawing of $G$. In this paper, we give the exact
values of crossing numbers for some variations of hypercube with order at most
four, including crossed cube, locally twisted cube and M\"{o}bius cube.
