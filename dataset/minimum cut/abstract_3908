We study $\l\f^4$ theory using an environmentally friendly finite-temperature
renormalization group. We derive flow equations, using a fiducial temperature
as flow parameter, develop them perturbatively in an expansion free from
ultraviolet and infrared divergences, then integrate them numerically from zero
to temperatures above the critical temperature. The critical temperature, at
which the mass vanishes, is obtained by integrating the flow equations and is
determined as a function of the zero-temperature mass and coupling. We
calculate the field expectation value and minimum of the effective potential as
functions of temperature and derive some universal amplitude ratios which
connect the broken and symmetric phases of the theory. The latter are found to
be in good agreement with those of the three-dimensional Ising model obtained
from high- and low-temperature series expansions.
