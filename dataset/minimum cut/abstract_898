In this paper we study the theory of operators on complex Hilbert spaces,
which attain their minimum in the unit sphere. We prove some important results
concerning the characterization of the N*, and also AN* operators, see
respectively Definition 1.1 and Definition 1.3. The injective property plays an
important role in these operators, and shall be established by these classes.
