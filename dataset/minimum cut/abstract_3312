Nonhelical hydromagnetic turbulence without an imposed magnetic field is
considered in the case where the magnetic Prandtl number is unity. The magnetic
field is entirely due to dynamo action. The magnetic energy spectrum peaks at a
wavenumber of about 5 times the minimum wavenumber in the domain, and not at
the resistive scale, as has previously been argued. Throughout the inertial
range the spectral magnetic energy exceeds the kinetic energy by a factor of
about 2.5, and both spectra are approximately parallel. At first glance, the
total energy spectrum seems to be close to k^{-3/2}, but there is a strong
bottleneck effect and it is suggested that the asymptotic spectrum is k^{-5/3}.
This is supported by the value of the second order structure function exponent
that is found to be \zeta_2=0.70, suggesting a k^{-1.70} spectrum.
