We study compactification of extra dimensions in a theory of
Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) type gravity. We investigate the solution for Minkowski
spacetime with an $S^2$ extra space as well as that for de Sitter spacetime
($S^4$) with an $S^2$ extra space. They are derived by the effective potential
method in the presence of the magnetic flux on the extra sphere. We also
consider the higher dimensional generalization of the solutions. We find that,
in a certain model, the radius of the extra space has a minimum value
independent of the higher-dimensional Newton constant in weak-field limit.
