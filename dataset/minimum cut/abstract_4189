We have implemented a novel double-slit "which-way" experiment which raises
interesting questions of interpretation. Coherent laser light is passed through
a converging lens and then through a dual pinhole producing two beams crossing
over at the focal point of the lens, and fully separating further downstream
providing which-way information. A thin wire is then placed at a minimum of the
interference pattern formed at the cross-over region. No significant reduction
in the total flux or resolution of the separated beams is found, providing
evidence for coexistence of perfect interference and which-way information in
the same experiment, contrary to the common readings of Bohr's principle of
complementarity. This result further supports the conclusions of the original
experiment by the contributor in which an imaging lens was employed to obtain
which-way information. Finally, a short discussion of the novel
non-perturbative measurement technique for ensemble properties is offered.
