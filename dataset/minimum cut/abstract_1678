In the striped Hall state, a magnetic translation in one direction is
spontaneously broken to the discrete translation. The spectrum of the neutral
collective excitation is obtained in the single mode approximation at
half-filled third and fourth Landau levels. The spectrum is anisotropic and has
a multiple line node structure. In one direction, the spectrum resembles the
liquid Helium spectrum with the phonon and roton minimum.
