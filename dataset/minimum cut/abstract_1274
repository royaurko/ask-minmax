The detailed interior structure models of super-Earth planets show that there
is degeneracy in the possible bulk compositions of a super-Earth at a given
mass and radius, determined via radial velocity and transit measurements,
respectively. In addition, the upper and lower envelopes in the mass--radius
relationship, corresponding to pure ice planets and pure iron planets,
respectively, are not astrophysically well motivated with regard to the
physical processes involved in planet formation. Here we apply the results of
numerical simulations of giant impacts to constrain the lower bound in the
mass--radius diagram that could arise from collisional mantle stripping of
differentiated rocky/iron planets. We provide a very conservative estimate for
the minimum radius boundary for the entire mass range of large terrestrial
planets. This envelope is a readily testable prediction for the population of
planets to be discovered by the Kepler mission.
