We study the effect of stochastic sampling on the estimation of the drift
parameter of continuous time AR(1) process. A natural distribution free moment
estimator is considered for the drift based on stochastically observed time
points. The effect of the constraint of the minimum separation between
successive samples on the estimation of the drift is studied.
