Real-time generation of natural-looking floor plans is vital in games with
dynamic environments. This paper presents an algorithm to generate suburban
house floor plans in real-time. The algorithm is based on the work presented in
[1]. However, the corridor placement is redesigned to produce floor plans
similar to real houses. Moreover, an optimization stage is added to find a
corridor placement with the minimum used space, an approach that is designed to
mimic the real-life practices to minimize the wasted spaces in the design. The
results show very similar floor plans to the ones designed by an architect.
