Several pairs of observable properties of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are known
to be correlated. Many such correlations are straightforward predictions of the
'cannonball' model of GRBs. We extend our previous discussions of the subject
to a wealth of new data, and to correlations between 'lag-time', 'variability'
and 'minimum rise-time', with other observables. Schaefer's recent systematic
analysis of the observations of many GRBs of known red-shift gives us a good
and updated data-basis for our study.
