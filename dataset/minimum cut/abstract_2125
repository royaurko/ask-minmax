We evaluate the tachyon potential in the Schnabl gauge through off-shell
computations in the sliver frame. As an application of the results of our
computations, we provide a strong evidence that Schnabl's analytic solution for
tachyon condensation in open string field theory represents a saddle point
configuration of the full tachyon potential. Additionally we verify that
Schnabl's analytic solution lies on the minimum of the effective tachyon
potential.
