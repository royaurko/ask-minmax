We give an explicit upper bound for the algebraic degree and an explicit
lower bound for the absolute value of the minimum of a polynomial function on a
compact connected component of a basic closed semialgebraic set when this
minimum is not zero. As an application, we obtain a lower bound for the
separation of two disjoint connected components of basic closed semialgebraic
sets, when at least one of them is compact.
