We evaluate the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density in a pion gas
employing the Uehling-Uehlenbeck equation and experimental phase-shifts
parameterized by means of the SU(2) Inverse Amplitude Method. We find that the
ratio for this monocomponent gas stays well above the KSS 1/(4 pi) bound. We
find similar results with other sets of phase shifts and conclude the bound is
nowhere violated.
