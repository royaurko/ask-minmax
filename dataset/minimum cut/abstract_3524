The Josephson current in S-F-S junctions is described by taking into
account different reflection (transmission) amplitudes for quasiparticles with
spin up and down. We show that the 0-$\pi$ transition in the junctions can take
place at some temperature only for sufficiently strong spin-activity of the
interface. In particular, Andreev interface bound state energies in one spin
channel have to be all negative, while in the other one positive. Only one spin
channel contributes then to the zero-temperature Josephson current. At the
temperature of the 0-$\pi$ transition two spin channels substantially
compensate each other and can result in a pronounced minimum in the critical
current in tunnel junctions. The minimal critical current is quadratic in small
transparency and contains first and second harmonics of one and the same order.
