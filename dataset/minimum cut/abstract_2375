Let K be a field of characteristic zero, alpha algebraic of degree n over K.
Given a proper parametrization psi of a rational curve C, we present a new
algorithm to compute the hypercircle associated to the parametrization psi. As
a consequence, we can decide if the curve C is defined over K and, if not, to
compute the minimum field of definition of C containing K. The algorithm
exploits the conjugate curves of C but avoids computation in the normal closure
of K(alpha) over K.
