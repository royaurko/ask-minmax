The magnetization reversal and dynamics of a spin valve pillar, whose lateral
size is 64$\times$64 nm$^2$, are studied by using micromagnetic simulation in
the presence of spin transfer torque. Spin torques display both characteristics
of magnetic damping (or anti-damping) and of an effective magnetic field. For a
steady-state current, both M-I and M-H hysteresis loops show unique features,
including multiple jumps, unusual plateaus and precessional states. These
states originate from the competition between the energy dissipation due to
Gilbert damping and the energy accumulation due to the spin torque supplied by
the spin current. The magnetic energy oscillates as a function of time even for
a steady-state current. For a pulsed current, the minimum width and amplitude
of the spin torque for achieving current-driven magnetization reversal are
quantitatively determined. The spin torque also shows very interesting thermal
activation that is fundamentally different from an ordinary damping effect.
