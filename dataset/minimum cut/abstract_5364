We report the observation of spontaneous localization of energy in two
spatial dimensions in the context of nonlinear electrical lattices. Both
stationary and traveling self-localized modes were generated experimentally and
theoretically in a family of two-dimensional square, as well as hon- eycomb
lattices composed of 6x6 elements. Specifically, we find regions in driver
voltage and frequency where stationary discrete breathers, also known as
intrinsic localized modes (ILM), exist and are stable due to the interplay of
damping and spatially homogeneous driving. By introduc- ing additional
capacitors into the unit cell, these lattices can controllably induce traveling
discrete breathers. When more than one such ILMs are experimentally generated
in the lattice, the interplay of nonlinearity, discreteness and wave
interactions generate a complex dynamics wherein the ILMs attempt to maintain a
minimum distance between one another. Numerical simulations show good agreement
with experimental results, and confirm that these phenomena qualitatively carry
over to larger lattice sizes.
