The system under study is a twin-layered square lattice gas at half-filling,
being driven to non-equilibrium steady states by a large, finite `electric'
field. By making intra-layer couplings unequal we were able to extend the phase
diagram obtained by Hill, Zia and Schmittmann (1996) and found that the
tri-critical point, which separates the phase regions of the stripped (S) phase
(stable at positive interlayer interactions J_3), the filled-empty (FE) phase
(stable at negative J_3) and disorder (D), is shifted even further into the
negative J_3 region as the coupling traverse to the driving field increases.
Many transient phases to the S phase at the S-FE boundary were found to be
long-lived. We also attempted to test whether the universality class of D-FE
transitions under a drive is still Ising. Simulation results suggest a value of
1.75 for the exponent gamma but a value close to 2.0 for the ratio gamma/nu. We
speculate that the D-FE second order transition is different from Ising near
criticality, where observed first-order-like transitions between FE and its
"local minimum" cousin occur during each simulation run.
