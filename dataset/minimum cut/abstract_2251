We consider planar solutions to certain quasilinear elliptic equations
subject to the Dirichlet boundary conditions; the boundary data is assumed to
have finite number of relative maximum and minimum values. We are interested in
certain vanishing properties of sign changing solutions to such a Dirichlet
problem. Our method is applicable in the plane.
