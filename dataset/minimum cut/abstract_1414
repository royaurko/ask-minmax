Given $k\ge 1$, a $k$-proper partition of a graph $G$ is a partition
${\mathcal P}$ of $V(G)$ such that each part $P$ of ${\mathcal P}$ induces a
$k$-connected subgraph of $G$. We prove that if $G$ is a graph of order $n$
such that $\delta(G)\ge \sqrt{n}$, then $G$ has a $2$-proper partition with at
most $n/\delta(G)$ parts. The bounds on the number of parts and the minimum
degree are both best possible. We then prove that If $G$ is a graph of order
$n$ with minimum degree $\delta(G)\ge\sqrt{c(k-1)n}$, where
$c=\frac{2123}{180}$, then $G$ has a $k$-proper partition into at most
$\frac{cn}{\delta(G)}$ parts. This improves a result of Ferrara, Magnant and
Wenger [Conditions for Families of Disjoint $k$-connected Subgraphs in a Graph,
Discrete Math. 313 (2013), 760--764] and both the degree condition and the
number of parts are best possible up to the constant $c$.
