We have calculated low-lying quasiparticle excitation spectra of rotating
three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. As opposed to the prediction of
hydrodynamic continuum theories, we find a minimum in the Tkachenko mode
spectrum at intermediate rotation frequencies of the harmonic trap. Such a
minimum can harbour a Tkachenko quasiparticle with zero excitation energy. We
discuss the experimental signatures of such a zero mode.
