It appears that there is a genuine shortage of radio pulsars with surface
magnetic fields significantly smaller than $\sim 10^8$ Gauss. We propose that
the pulsars with very low magnetic fields are actually strange stars locked in
a state of minimum free energy and therefore at a limiting value of the
magnetic field which can not be lowered by the system spontaneously.
