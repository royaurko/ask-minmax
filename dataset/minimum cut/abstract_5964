Compressed sensing has shown great potentials in accelerating magnetic
resonance imaging. Fast image reconstruction and high image quality are two
main issues faced by this new technology. It has been shown that, redundant
image representations, e.g. tight frames, can significantly improve the image
quality. But how to efficiently solve the reconstruction problem with these
redundant representation systems is still challenging. This paper attempts to
address the problem of applying fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm
(FISTA) to tight frames based magnetic resonance image reconstruction. By
introducing the canonical dual frame, we construct an orthogonal projection
operator on the range of the analysis sparsity operator and propose a new
algorithm, called the projected FISTA (pFISTA). We theoretically prove that
pFISTA converges to the minimum of a function with a balanced tight frame
sparsity. One major advantage of pFISTA is that only one extra parameter, the
step size, is introduced and the numerical solution is stable to it in terms of
image reconstruction errors, thus allowing easily setting in many fast magnetic
resonance imaging applications.
