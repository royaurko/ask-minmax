Liu et al recently proposed a minimum number of driver nodes needed to obtain
full structural controllability over a directed network. Driver nodes are
unmatched nodes, from which there are directed paths to all matched nodes.
Their most important assertion is that a system's controllability is to a great
extent encoded by the underlying network's degree distribution, $P(k_{in},
k_{out})$. Is the controllability of a network decided almost completely by the
immediate neighbourhood of a node, while, even slightly distant nodes play no
role at all? Motivated by the above question, in this communication, we argue
that an effective understanding of controllability in directed networks can be
reached using distance based measures of closeness centrality and betweenness
centrality and may not require the knowledge of local connectivity measures
like in-degree and out-degree.
