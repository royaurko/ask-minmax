Understanding the progenitors of core collapse supernovae and their
population statistics is a key ingredient for many current studies in astronomy
but as yet this remains elusive. Using the MESA stellar evolution code we study
the dependence of the lower mass limit for making core collapse supernovae
(SNe) as function of initial stellar metallicity. We find that this mass limit
is smallest at approximately [Z] = -2 with a value of ~ 8.3 Msun. At [Z] = 0
the limit is ~ 9.5 Msun and continues to rise with higher metallicity. As a
consequence, for a fixed initial mass function the supernova rate may be 20% to
25% higher at [Z] = -2. This affects the association of observed SN rates as a
probe for the cosmological star formation rate, rate predictions for supernova
surveys, and population synthesis studies.
