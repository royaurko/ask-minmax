The conductivity of graphene samples with various levels of disorder is
investigated for a set of specimens with mobility in the range of
$1-20\times10^3$ cm$^2$/V sec. Comparing the experimental data with the
theoretical transport calculations based on charged impurity scattering, we
estimate that the impurity concentration in the samples varies from $2-15\times
10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$. In the low carrier density limit, the conductivity exhibits
values in the range of $2-12e^2/h$, which can be related to the residual
density induced by the inhomogeneous charge distribution in the samples. The
shape of the conductivity curves indicates that high mobility samples contain
some short range disorder whereas low mobility samples are dominated by long
range scatterers.
