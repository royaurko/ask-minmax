An unusual atomic scale chemical fluctuation in LaSrVMoO$_6$, in terms of
narrow patches of La,V and Sr,Mo-rich phases, has been probed in detail to
understand the origin of such a chemical state. Exhaustive tuning of the
equilibrium synthesis parameters showed that the extent of phase separation can
never be melted down below an unit cell dimension making it impossible to
achieve the conventional $B$-site ordered structure, which establishes that the
observed `inhomogeneous' patch-like structure with minimum dimension of few
angstroms is a reality in LaSrVMoO$_6$. Therefore, another type of local
chemical order, hitherto unknown in double perovskites, gets introduced here.
X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy elemental mapping, magnetic, and various
spectroscopic studies have been carried out on samples, synthesized under
different conditions. These experimental results in conjunction with {\it
ab-initio} electronic structure calculation revealed that it is the energy
stability, gained by typical La-O covalency as in LaVO$_3$, that leads to the
preferential La,V and Sr,Mo ionic proximity, and the consequent patchy
structure.
