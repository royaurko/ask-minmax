The interaction energy and minimum energy structure for different geometries
of the benzene dimer has been calculated using the recently developed nonlocal
correlation energy functional for calculating dispersion interactions. The
comparison of this straightforward and relatively quick density functional
based method with recent calculations can elucidate how the former, quicker
method might be exploited in larger more complicated biological, organic,
aromatic, and even infinite systems such as molecules physisorbed on surfaces,
and van der Waals crystals.
