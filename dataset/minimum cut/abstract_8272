The energy spectra of galactic cosmic rays carry fundamental information
regarding their origin and propagation. These spectra, when measured near
Earth, are significantly affected by the solar magnetic field. A comprehensive
description of the cosmic radiation must therefore include the transport and
modulation of cosmic rays inside the heliosphere. During the end of the last
decade the Sun underwent a peculiarly long quiet phase well suited to study
modulation processes. In this paper we present proton spectra measured from
July 2006 to December 2009 by PAMELA. The large collected statistics of protons
allowed the time variation to be followed on a nearly monthly basis down to 400
MV. Data are compared with a state-of-the-art three-dimensional model of solar
modulation.
