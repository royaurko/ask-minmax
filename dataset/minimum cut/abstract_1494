Two potential sources of tuning exist in composite Higgs models: one comes
from keeping the Higgs VEV below the compositeness scale and one comes from
keeping the Higgs light after constraints on the top partner masses are
applied. We construct a measure that determines whether these tunings are
independent or not and combines them appropriately. We perform a comprehensive
scan of the parameter space for three explicit models and report the minimum
tuning values compatible with existing collider constraints. Tuning values are
given as functions of resonance masses and deviations to the Higgs couplings so
the effect of future constraints can easily be quantified. The current minimum
tuning in the minimal model is 2.5-5% and will be decreased to around 0.8-3.3%
if no top partners are observed over the lifetime of the LHC.
