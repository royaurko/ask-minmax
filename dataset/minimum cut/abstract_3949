We consider a dynamical approach to the cosmological constant.
 There is a scalar field with a potential whose minimum occurs at a generic,
but negative, value for the vacuum energy, and it has a non-standard kinetic
term whose coefficient diverges at zero curvature as well as the standard
kinetic term. Because of the divergent coefficient of the kinetic term, the
lowest energy state is never achieved. Instead, the cosmological constant
automatically stalls at or near zero. The merit of this model is that it is
stable under radiative corrections and leads to stable dynamics, despite the
singular kinetic term. The model is not complete, however, in that some
reheating is required. Nonetheless, our approach can at the very least reduce
fine-tuning by 60 orders of magnitude or provide a new mechanism for sampling
possible cosmological constants and implementing the anthropic principle.
