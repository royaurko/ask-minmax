We report detailed inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single
crystals of the frustrated two-leg ladder BiCu2PO6, whose ground state is
described as a spin liquid phase with no long-range order down to 6 K. Two
branches of steeply dispersing long-lived spin excitations are observed with
excitation gaps of \Delta_1 = 1.90(9) meV and \Delta_2 = 3.95(8) meV.
Significant frustrating next-nearest neighbour interactions along the ladder
leg drive the minimum of each excitation branch to incommensurate wavevectors
\zeta_1 = 0.574\pi and \zeta_2 = 0.553\pi for the lower and upper energy
branches respectively. The temperature dependence of the excitation spectrum
near the gap energy is consistent with thermal activation into singly and
doubly degenerate excited states. The observed magnetic excitation spectrum as
well as earlier thermodynamic data could be consistently explained by the
presence of strong anisotropic interactions in the ground state Hamiltonian.
