The Hall resistance was measured by the van der Pauw method on $YBa_2Cu_3O_x$
samples in magnetic fields up to 5 T. In region from 0 to 0.2 T the part of the
resistance due to transversal electric field, which is even in magnetic field
has been observed just below the critical temperature. This part is gradually
suppressed in higher field. Only the Hall resistance (due to odd transversal
voltage) has been observed in magnetic field 5 T. The Hall resistance has a
typical temperature dependence with negative minimum below the critical
temperature. The anisotropy of the Hall resistivity has been observed in this
region. We have also tested the reciprocity theorem which is not valid near
critical temperature.
