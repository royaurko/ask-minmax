Associated with each oriented link is the two variable Homflypt polynomial.
The Morton-Franks-Williams (MFW) inequality gives rise to an expression for the
Homflypt polynomial with MFW coefficient polynomials. These MFW coefficient
polynomials are labelled in a braid-dependent manner and may be zero, but
display a number of interesting relations. One consequence is an expression for
the first three Laurent coefficient polynomials in z as a function of the other
coefficient polynomials and three link invariants: the minimum v-degree and
v-span of the Homflypt polynomial, and the Conway polynomial.
  These expressions are used to derive additional properties of the Homflypt
polynomial for general n-braid links. One specific result is that the Jones and
Homflypt polynomials distinguish the same three-braid links.
