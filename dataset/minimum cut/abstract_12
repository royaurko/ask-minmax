Given a digraph D, the minimum semi-degree of D is the minimum of its minimum
indegree and its minimum outdegree. D is k-ordered Hamiltonian if for every
ordered sequence of k distinct vertices there is a directed Hamilton cycle
which encounters these vertices in this order. Our main result is that every
digraph D of sufficiently large order n with minimum semi-degree at least
(n+k)/2 -1 is k-ordered Hamiltonian. The bound on the minimum semi-degree is
best possible. An undirected version of this result was proved earlier by
Kierstead, S\'ark\"ozy and Selkow.
