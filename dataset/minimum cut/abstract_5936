The analysis of the observations of solar activity indexes SSN (NOAA Sunspot
Numbers), the radio flux at a wavelength of 10.7 cm (F10.7) and the solar
constant (TSI) during the cycles 22 - 24 is presented. We found a decrease of
the observed values of the SSNobs which was calculated with SSNsyn (using
regression relationships between SSN and F10.7) after 1990 year on 20 - 25%
instead of 35%, as was previously assumed. The changes in characteristics of
the most popular index, SSN, such as decrease in the number of sunspots, the
reduction of the magnetic field in small and medium-sized spots are not in full
compliance with the proposed scenario of solar activity predicted by radio flux
F10.7 in the cycles 23 and 24, and cannot be fully explained by the influence
on the SSN values of additional minimum of 50 - 70 year cycle. We have also
showed that the observed changes of SSN lead to a slight increase of the solar
constant TSI during the cycles 23 - 24 compared to the cycle 22.
