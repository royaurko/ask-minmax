We study how the entropic uncertainty relation for position and momentum
conjugate variables is minimized in the subspace of one-dimensional
antisymmetric wave functions. Based partially on numerical evidence and
partially on analytical results, a conjecture is presented for the sharp bound
and for the minimizers. Conjectures are also presented for the corresponding
sharp Hausdorff-Young inequality.
