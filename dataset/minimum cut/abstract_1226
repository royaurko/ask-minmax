We used deep wide field photometric observations to derive the fraction of
binary systems in a sample of five high-latitude Galactic open clusters. By
analysing the color distribution of Main Sequence stars we derived the minimum
fraction of binary systems required to reproduce the observed color-magnitude
diagram morphologies. We found that all the analysed clusters contain a minimum
binary fraction larger than 11% within the core radius. The estimated global
fractions of binary systems range from 35% to 70% depending on the cluster. The
comparison with homogeneous estimates performed in globular clusters indicates
that open clusters hold a significantly higher fraction of binary systems, as
predicted by theoretical models and N-body simulations. A dependence of the
relative fraction of binary systems on the cluster mass has been detected,
suggesting that the binary disruption within the cluster core is the dominant
process that drives the fraction of binaries in stellar systems.
