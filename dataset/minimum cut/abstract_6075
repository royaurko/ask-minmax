We use the standard, adiabatic shell evolution to predict the size
distribution N(R) for populations of OB superbubbles in a uniform ISM. We
derive N(R) for simple cases of superbubble creation rate and mechanical
luminosity function (MLF). For R < the characteristic radius R_e, N(R) is
dominated by stalled objects, while for R>R_e it is dominated by growing
objects. We also briefly investigate N(R) resulting from momentum-conserving
shell evolution. We predict a peak in N(R) corresponding to individual SNRs. To
estimate the MLF, we also examine evolutionary effects on the HII region
luminosity function (HII LF), finding that for nebular luminosity fading as a
power law in time, there is a minimum observed slope for the HII LFs.
Comparison with the largely complete HI hole catalog for the SMC shows
surprising agreement in the predicted and observed slope of N(R), suggesting
that no other fundamental process is needed to explain the size distribution of
shells in the SMC. Further comparison with largely incomplete HI data for M31,
M33, and Holmberg II is also encouraging. We present expressions for the ISM
porosity parameters, and estimate that they are substantially <1 for all of the
galaxies except Holmberg II. Most of these galaxies therefore may not be
strongly dominated by a hot interstellar component. However, porosity results
for the Galaxy remain inconclusive.
