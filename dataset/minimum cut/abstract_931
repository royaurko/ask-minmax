Distributed storage systems based on equidistant constant dimension codes are
presented. These equidistant codes are based on the Pl\"{u}cker embedding,
which is essential in the repair and the reconstruction algorithms. These
systems posses several useful properties such as high failure resilience,
minimum bandwidth, low storage, simple algebraic repair and reconstruction
algorithms, good locality, and compatibility with small fields.
