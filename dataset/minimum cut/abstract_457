We investigate the effect on high-order harmonic generation of the distortion
of molecular orbitals by the driving laser field. Calculations for high-order
harmonic generation including orbital distortion are performed for N2. Our
results allow us to suggest that field-distortion is the reason why the
two-center interference minimum has never been observed experimentally in N2.
We propose experimental parameters which should allow an observation of the
two-center interference minimum.
