A new approach to bound the minimum distance of $q$-ary cyclic codes is
presented. The connection to the BCH and the Hartmann--Tzeng bound is
formulated and it is shown that for several cases an improvement is achieved.
We associate a second cyclic code to the original one and bound its minimum
distance in terms of parameters of the associated code.
