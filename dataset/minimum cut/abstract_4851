We study how the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in protoplanetary disks
is affected by the electric discharge caused by the electric field in the
resistive MHD. We have performed three-dimensional shearing box simulations
with various values of plasma beta and electrical breakdown models. We find the
self-sustainment of the MRI in spite of the high resistivity. The instability
gives rise to the large electric field that causes the electrical breakdown,
and the breakdown maintains the high ionization degree required for the
instability.
  The condition for this self-sustained MRI is set by the balance between the
energy supply from the shearing motion and the energy consumed by the Ohmic
dissipation. We apply the condition to various disk models and study where the
active, self-sustained, and dead zones of MRI are. In the fiducial minimum-mass
solar nebula (MMSN) model, the newly-found sustained zone occupies only the
limited volume of the disk. In the late-phase gas-depleted disk models,
however, the sustained zone occupies larger volume of the disk.
