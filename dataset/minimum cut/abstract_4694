The seed bank dynamics of the three co-occurring obligate-seeder (i.e.
fire-sensitive) Proteaceae species, Banksia ericifolia, Banksia marginata and
Petrophile pulchella, were examined at sites of varying time since the most
recent fire (i.e. plant age) in the Sydney region. Significant variation among
species was found in the number of cones produced, the position of the cones
within the canopy, the percentage of barren cones produced (Banksia species
only), the number of follicles/bracts produced per cone, and the number of
seeds lost/released due to spontaneous fruit rupture. Thus, three different
regeneration strategies were observed, highlighting the variation in
reproductive strategies of co-occurring Proteaceae species. Ultimately, B.
marginata potentially accumulated a seed bank of c. 3000 seeds per plant after
20 years, with c. 1500 seeds per plant for P. pulchella and c. 500 for B.
ericifolia. Based on these data, B. marginata and B. ericifolia require a
minimum fire-free period of 8-10 years, with 7-8 years for P. pulchella, to
allow for an adequate seed bank to accumulate and thus ensure local persistence
of these species in fire-prone habitats.
