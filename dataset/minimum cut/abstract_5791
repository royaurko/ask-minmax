In massive MIMO systems, the matched filter (MF) beamforming is attractive
technique due to its extremely low complexity of implementation compared to
those high-complexity decomposition-based beamforming techniques such as
zero-forcing, and minimum mean square error. A specific problem in applying
these techniques is how to qualify and quantify the relationship between the
transmitted signal, channel noise and interference. This paper presents
detailed procedure of deriving an approximate formula for probability density
function (PDF) of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) at user
terminal when multiple antennas and MF beamformer are used at the base station.
It is shown how the derived density function of SINR can be used to calculate
the symbol error rate of massive MIMO downlink. It is confirmed by simulation
that the derived approximate expression for PDF is consistent with the
simulated PDF in medium-scale and large-scale MIMO systems.
