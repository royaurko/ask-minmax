In this work, using the scattering matrix method, we have investigated the
transmission coefficients and the thermal conductivity in a double-bend
waveguide structure. The transmission coefficients show strong resonances due
to the scattering in the midsection of a double-bend structure; the positions
and the widths of the resonance peaks are determined by the dimensions of the
midsection of the structure. And the scattering in the double-bend structure
makes the thermal conductivity decreases with the increasing of the temperature
first, then increases after reaches a minimum. Furthermore, the investigations
of the multiple double-bend structures indicate that the first additional
double-bend structure suppresses the transmission coefficient and the frequency
gap formed; and the additional double-bend structures determine the numbers of
the resonance peaks at the frequency just above the gap region. These results
could be useful for the design of phonon devices.
