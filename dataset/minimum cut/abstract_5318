The discovery of a 2 Msun neutron star provided a robust constraint for the
theory of exotic dense matter, bringing into question the existence of strange
baryons in the interiors of neutron stars. Although many theories fail to
reproduce this observational result, several equations of state containing
hyperons are consistent with it. We study global properties of stars using
equations of state containing hyperons, and compare them to those without
hyperons to find similarities, differences, and limits that can be compared
with the astrophysical observations. Rotating, axisymmetric, and stationary
stellar configurations in general relativity are obtained, and their global
parameters are studied. Approximate formulae describing the behavior of the
maximum and minimum stellar mass, compactness, surface redshifts, and moments
of inertia as functions of spin frequency are provided. We also study the thin
disk accretion and compare the spin-up evolution of stars with different
moments of inertia.
