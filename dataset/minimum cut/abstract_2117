In this work we investigate the presence of defect structures in models
described by two real scalar fields. The coupling between the two fields is
inspired on the equations for a multimode laser, and the minimum energy trivial
configurations are shown to be structurely dependent on the parameters of the
models. The trial orbit method is then used and several non-trivial analytical
solutions corresponding to topological solitons are obtained.
