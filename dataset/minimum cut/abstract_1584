A derivation of the \gamma\gamma --> e^+ e^- optical depth for \gamma rays
produced in a comoving spherical emitting region is presented. Employing a
simplified expression for the \gamma\gamma absorption cross section, analytic
expressions for the minimum Doppler factor implied by the requirement of
gamma-ray transparency are derived for a broken power-law spectrum of target
photons which are isotropically distributed in the comoving frame. Application
to specific systems is illustrated.
