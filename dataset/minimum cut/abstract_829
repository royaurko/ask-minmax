Efforts have been made recently to reformulate traditional Kaluza-Klein
theory by using a generalized definition of a higher-dimensional extended
space-time. Both electromagnetism and gravity have been studied in this
context. We review some of the models which have been proposed, with a special
effort to keep the mathematical formalism to a very minimum.
