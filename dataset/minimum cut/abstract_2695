The general feedback control theory for linear phase preserving and
conjugating amplification is presented. The key idea is the use of coherent
(i.e. measurement free) feedback with a passive (i.e. static) controller; this
combination realizes the minimum-noise and robust amplification even under
practical imperfections. Moreover, a non-degenerated parametric amplifier
subjected to a special detuning is proposed to demonstrate that, additionally,
it has a broadband nature.
