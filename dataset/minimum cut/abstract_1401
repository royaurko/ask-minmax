A solar-type dynamo model in a spherical shell is developed with allowance
for random dependence of the poloidal field generation mechanism on time and
latitude. The model shows repeatable epochs of strongly decreased amplitude of
magnetic cycles similar to the Maunder minimum of solar activity. Random
dependence of dynamo-parameters on latitude brakes the equatorial symmetry of
generated fields. The model shows the correlation of the occurrence of grand
minima with deviations in the dynamo-field from dipolar parity. An increased
north-south asymmetry of magnetic activity can, therefore, be an indicator of
transitions to grand minima. Qualitative interpretation of this correlation is
suggested. Statistics of grand minima in the model are close to the Poisson
random process indicating that the onset of a grand minimum is statistically
independent of preceding minima.
