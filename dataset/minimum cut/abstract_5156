We review the latest underlying event and minimum bias results and discuss
the associated problematics with the idea of establishing a solid baseline for
the LHC experiments. These measurements include study of the underlying event
in Drell-Yan and dijet events, and inclusive differential (in $p_T$) cross
sections of centrally ($\mid\eta\mid <$1) produced lambdas, cascades and
omegas. We also present recent results on diffraction obtained by the CDF
collaboration. Single-diffractive W and Z production is discussed. The first
experimental observation of exclusive dijets, exclusive $\chi_{c0}$ mesons, and
a search for exclusive diphotons are discussed. We also present results from a
study of central rapidity gap production in soft and hard diffractive events.
