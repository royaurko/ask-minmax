In this paper, we study the price of Variable Annuity Guarantees, especially
of Guaranteed Annuity Options (GAO) and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit
(GMIB), and this in the settings of a derivative pricing model where the
underlying spot (the fund) is locally governed by a geometric Brownian motion
with local volatility, while interest rates follow a Hull-White one-factor
Gaussian model. Notwithstanding the fact that in this framework, the local
volatility depends on a particularly complicated expectation where no
closed-form expression exists and it is neither directly related to European
call prices or other liquid products, we present in this contribution different
methods to calibrate the local volatility model. We further compare Variable
Annuity Guarantee prices obtained in three different settings, namely the local
volatility, the stochastic volatility and the constant volatility models all
combined with stochastic interest rates and show that an appropriate volatility
modelling is important for these long-dated derivatives. More precisely, we
compare prices of GAO, GMIB Rider and barrier types GAO obtained by using local
volatility, stochastic volatility and constant volatility models.
