Using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), we have discovered PSR
J0514-4002A, a binary millisecond pulsar in the globular cluster NGC 1851. This
pulsar has a rotational period of 4.99 ms and the most eccentric pulsar orbit
yet found: e = 0.89. The orbital period is 18.8 days, and companion has a
minimum mass of 0.9 M_sun; its nature is presently unclear. After accreting
matter from a low-mass stellar companion, this pulsar exchanged it for its more
massive present companion. This system presents the strongest evidence to date
of such a process.
