We compute the angular power spectrum C_l from the BATSE 3B catalog of 1122
gamma-ray bursts, and find no evidence for clustering on any scale. These
constraints bridge the entire range from small scales (which probe source
clustering and burst repetition) to the largest scales (which constrain
possible anisotropies from the Galactic halo or from nearby cosmological large
scale structures). We develop an analysis technique that takes the angular
position errors into account, which enables us to place tight upper limits on
the clustering down to scales l\approx 60, corresponding to a few degrees on
the sky. The minimum-variance burst weighting that we employ is graphically
visualized as an all-sky map where each burst is smeared out by an amount
corresponding to its position uncertainty. We also present separate band-pass
filtered sky maps for the quadrupole term and for the multipole-ranges l=3-10
and l=11-30, so that the fluctuations on different angular scales can be
separately inspected for visual features such as localized ``hot spots" or
structures aligned with the Galactic plane. These filtered maps reveal no
apparent deviations from isotropy.
