For the hopping dynamics in a one-dimensional model, containing energy and
barrier disorder, we determine the linear and nonlinear response to an external
field for arbitrary external frequencies. The calculation is performed in
analytical terms. We systematically analyze the parameter space and find three
different regimes, corresponding to qualitatively different frequency
dependencies of the nonlinear response. Two regimes agree with the results of
recent conductivity experiments on inorganic ion conductors and ionic liquids,
respectively. The ratio of the nonlinear and linear conductivity in the
dc-regime can be explicitly expressed in terms of the disorder parameters. As a
generic feature the nonlinear conductivity displays a minimum as a function of
frequency which can be identified with forward-backward dynamics in a
double-well potential. The magnitude and sign of the nonlinear conductivity
around the minimum is a measure of the disorder, inherent in this model.
Surprisingly, the frequency of the minimum is hardly influenced by the
disorder.
