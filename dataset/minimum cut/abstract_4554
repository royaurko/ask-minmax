If neutrino mass is a function of the Higgs potential then minimum of the
total thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ (which is the Higgs potential minus the
neutrino pressure) can shift from the standard electro-weak vev $v=246.2$ GeV
by a small amount which depends on the neutrino pressure. If the neutrino mass
is a very steep function of the Higgs field then the equilibrium thermodynamic
potential can act like the dark energy with $\omega \simeq -1$. Choosing the
neutrino mass as logarithmic function of the Higgs field and a heavy mass
scale, we find that the correct magnitude of the cosmological density of the
present universe $\rho_\lambda \simeq (0.002 eV)^4$ is obtained by choosing the
heavy mass at the GUT scale.
