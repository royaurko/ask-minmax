Given two filtrations $\mathbb F\subset \mathbb G$, the immersion property
holds for $\mathbb F$ and $\mathbb G$ if every $\mathbb F$-local martingale is
a $\mathbb G$-local martingale. Our main result characterizes the immersion
property for $\mathbb F$ and $\mathbb G$ using the class of $\mathbb
F$-pseudo-stopping times. We also show that every $\mathbb G$-stopping time can
be decomposed into the minimum of two barrier hitting times.
