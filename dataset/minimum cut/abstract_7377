We use high dynamic range, high-resolution L-band spectroscopy to measure the
radial velocity variations of the hot Jupiter in the tau Bootis planetary
system. The detection of an exoplanet by the shift in the stellar spectrum
alone provides a measure of the planet's minimum mass, with the true mass
degenerate with the unknown orbital inclination. Treating the tau Boo system as
a high flux ratio double-lined spectroscopic binary permits the direct
measurement of the planet's true mass as well as its atmospheric properties.
After removing telluric absorption and cross-correlating with a model planetary
spectrum dominated by water opacity, we measure a 6-sigma detection of the
planet at K_p = 111 +- 5 km/s, with a 1-sigma upper limit on the spectroscopic
flux ratio of 10^-4. This radial velocity leads to a planetary orbital
inclination of i = 45+3-4degrees and a mass of M_P = 5.90+0.35-0.20 M_ Jup. We
report the first detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of a non-transiting
hot Jupiter, tau Boo b.
