It is widely believed that at small x, the BFKL resummed gluon splitting
function should grow as a power of 1/x. But in several recent calculations it
has been found to decrease for moderately small-x before eventually rising. We
show that this `dip' structure is a rigorous feature of the P_gg splitting
function for sufficiently small alpha_s, the minimum occurring formally at ln
1/x of order 1/sqrt(alpha_s). We calculate the properties of the dip, including
corrections of relative order sqrt(alpha_s), and discuss how this expansion in
powers of sqrt(alpha_s), which is poorly convergent, can be qualitatively
matched to the fully resummed result of a recent calculation, for realistic
values of alpha_s. Finally, we note that the dip position, as a function of
alpha_s, provides a lower bound in x below which the NNLO fixed-order expansion
of the splitting function breaksdown and the resummation of small-x terms is
mandatory.
