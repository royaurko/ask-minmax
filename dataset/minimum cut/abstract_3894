The general features of quark and pion condensation in dense quark matter
with flavor asymmetry have been considered at finite temperature in the
presence of a chromomagnetic background field modelling the gluon condensate.
In particular, pion condensation in the case of a constant abelian
chromomagnetic field and zero temperature has been studied both analytically
and numerically. Under the influence of the chromomagnetic background field the
effective potential of the system is found to have a global minimum for a
finite pion condensate even for small values of the effective quark coupling
constant. In the strong field limit, an effective dimensional reduction has
been found to take place.
