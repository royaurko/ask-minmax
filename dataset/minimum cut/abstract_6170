In this paper we briefly review our recent results on evolution and
properties of isolated neutron stars (INSs) in the Galaxy.
  As the first step we discuss stochastic period evolution of INSs. We briefly
discuss how an INS's spin period evolves under influence of interaction with
turbulized interstellar medium. To investigate statistical properties of the
INS population we calculate a {\it census} of INSs in our Galaxy. Then we show
that for exponential field decay the range of minimum value of magnetic moment,
$\mu_b$: $\sim 10^{29.5}\ge \mu_b \ge 10^{28} {\rm G} {\rm cm}^3$, and the
characteristic decay time, $t_d$: $\sim 10^8\ge t_d \ge 10^7 {\rm yrs}$, can be
excluded assuming the standard initial magnetic momentum, $\mu_0=10^{30} {\rm
G} {\rm cm}^3$, if accreting INSs are observed.
  It is shown that old accreting INSs become more abundant than young cooling
INSs at X-ray fluxes below $\sim 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The weak
{\it ROSAT} sources, associated with INSs, can be young cooling objects, if the
NSs birth rate in the solar vicinity during the last $\sim 10^6$ yr was much
higher than inferred from radiopulsar observations.
