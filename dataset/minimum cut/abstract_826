This note describes a theoretical study of Wbb and Wjj final states at the
Tevatron using the NLO program MCFM. We extensively study the effect of NLO
corrections with respect to variations of input parameters such as the minimum
jet p_T and the choice of renormalization and factorization scales. In
particular, we examine possible implications for the Method 2 QCD background
subtraction technique for tt production.
