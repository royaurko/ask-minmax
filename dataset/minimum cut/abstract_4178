We address the evolution of cat-like states in general Gaussian noisy
channels, by considering superpositions of coherent and squeezed-coherent
states coupled to an arbitrarily squeezed bath. The phase space dynamics is
solved and decoherence is studied keeping track of the purity of the evolving
state. The influence of the choice of the state and channel parameters on
purity is discussed and optimal working regimes that minimize the decoherence
rate are determined. In particular, we show that squeezing the bath to protect
a non squeezed cat state against decoherence is equivalent to orthogonally
squeezing the initial cat state while letting the bath be phase insensitive.
