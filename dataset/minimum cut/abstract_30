Given a graph G, a real orthogonal representation of G is a function from its
set of vertices to R^d such that two vertices are mapped to orthogonal vectors
if and only if they are not neighbors. The minimum vector rank of a graph is
the smallest dimension d for which such a representation exists. This quantity
is closely related to the minimum semidefinite rank of G, which has been widely
studied. Considering the minimum vector rank as an analogue of the chromatic
number, this work defines critical graphs as those for which the removal of any
vertex decreases the minimum vector rank; and complement critical graphs as
those for which the removal of any vertex decreases the minimum vector rank of
either the graph or its complement. It establishes necessary and sufficient
conditions for certain classes of graphs to be complement critical, in the
process calculating their minimum vector rank. In addition, this work
demonstrates that complement critical graphs form a sufficient set to prove the
Graph Complement Conjecture, which remains open.
