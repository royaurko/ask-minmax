Minimum-bias fragment distributions (FDs) are calculated by folding a
power-law parton energy spectrum with parametrized fragmentation functions
(FFs) derived from $e^+$-$e^-$ and p-\=p collisions. Changes in FFs due to
parton "energy loss" or "medium modification" are modeled by altering FF
parametrizations consistent with rescaling QCD splitting functions. The common
parton spectrum is constrained by comparison with a p-p $p_t$ spectrum hard
component. In-vacuum and in-medium FDs are compared with spectrum hard
components from 200 GeV Au-Au collisions for several centralities. The
reference for all nuclear collisions is the FD derived from in-vacuum
$e^+$-$e^-$ FFs. The hard component for p-p and peripheral Au-Au collisions is
found to be {\em strongly suppressed} for smaller fragment momenta, consistent
with the FD derived from in-vacuum p-\=p FFs. At a particular centrality the
Au-Au hard component transitions to enhancement at smaller momenta and
suppression at larger momenta, consistent with FDs derived from in-medium
$e^+$-$e^-$ FFs. Fragmentation systematics suggest that QCD color connections
change dramatically in more-central A-A collisions. Spectrum systematics are
inconsistent with saturation-scale arguments and parton thermalization.
