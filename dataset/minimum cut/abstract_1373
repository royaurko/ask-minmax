Angular distributions for elastic and inelastic scattering of $^3$He from
$^{12}$C were measured at energies 50.5 and 60 MeV. The Airy minimum of the
prerainbow scattering was clearly observed in the angular distributions for the
0$_2^+$ (7.65 MeV) state of $^{12}$C (Hoyle state). The experimental results
were analyzed with a coupled channels method with double folding potentials
derived from the microscopic wave functions for the ground 0$_1^+$, 2$^+$ (4.44
MeV), 3$^-$ (9.64 MeV) and 0$_2^+$ states. The analysis supports the view that
the Hoyle state is a three alpha particle condensate with a large radius of
dilute matter distribution.
