Typically the superconducting phase weakens at several points with the
increase in disorder before it is distroyed in the 2d-thin films. This may lead
to an inhomogeneous superconducting state without a continuous phase. Here we
present scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements at 0.1 K in the disordered
polycrystalline film of TiN describing the nanoscale size features of the
superconducting state. The imaging shows imcommensurate charge density
modulations, originating at the crystalline bounadries, and intercepted on
large scale by the beat patterns in the regions of overlap. Electronic
coherence is maintained over length scale minimum of crystalline sizes, and
suffers scattering across low angle crystalline boundaries. The superconducting
state fluctuates at the positions of the charge density modulations and zones
of the weak phase appear in the vicinity of the beats. Our data shows that the
BCS-like behavior evolves into the V-shaped density of states in such
inhomogeneous regions as a result of the competition between the
superconducting correlations with that of the strong electron-electron
repulsive interactions assisted by the inelastic scattering at the crystalline
boundaries.
