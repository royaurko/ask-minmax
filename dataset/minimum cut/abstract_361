From numerical minimization of a model free energy functional for a system of
hard spheres, we show that the width of the local peaks of the time-averaged
density field at a glassy free-energy minimum exhibits large spatial variation,
similar to that of the ``local Debye-Waller factor'' in simulations of
dynamical heterogeneity. Molecular dynamics simulations starting from a
particle configuration generated from the density distribution at a glassy
free-energy minimum show similar spatial heterogeneity in the degree of
localization, implying a direct connection between dynamical heterogeneity and
the structure of glassy free energy minima.
