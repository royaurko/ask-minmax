The rich phenomena of the shear viscosity (eta) to entropy density (s) ratio,
eta/s, in weakly coupled N-component scalar field theories are studied. eta/s
can have a "double dip" behavior due to resonances and the phase transition. If
an explicit goldstone mass term is added, then eta/s can either decrease
monotonically in temperature or, as seen in many other systems, reach a minimum
at the phase transition. We also show how to go beyond the original variational
approach to make the Boltzmann equation computation of eta systematic.
