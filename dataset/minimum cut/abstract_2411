We find the minimum scale factor, for which the nonnegative B\"ottcher-Wenzel
biquadratic form becomes a sum of squares (sos). To this we give the primal and
dual solutions for the underlying semide ?nite program. Moreover, for special
matrix classes (tridiagonal, backward tridiagonal and cyclic Hankel matrices)
we show that the above form is sos. Finally, we conjecture sos representability
for Toeplitz matrices.
