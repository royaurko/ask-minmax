We present Fisher matrix projections for future cosmological parameter
measurements, including neutrino masses, dark energy, curvature, modified
gravity, the inflationary perturbation spectrum, non-Gaussianity, and dark
radiation. We focus on DESI and generally redshift surveys (BOSS, HETDEX,
eBOSS, Euclid, and WFIRST), but also include CMB (Planck) and weak
gravitational lensing (DES and LSST) constraints. The goal is to present a
consistent set of projections, for concrete experiments, which are otherwise
scattered throughout many papers and proposals. We include neutrino mass as a
free parameter in most projections, as it will inevitably be relevant -- DESI
and other experiments can measure the sum of neutrino masses to ~0.02 eV or
better, while the minimum possible sum is ~0.06 eV. We note that the BAO-only
use of galaxy clustering is substantially degraded as a dark energy probe in
the presence of neutrino mass uncertainty -- using broadband galaxy power is
critical, especially pushing it to as small a scale as possible, and big gains
are achieved by combining lensing survey constraints with redshift survey
constraints. We do not try to be especially innovative, e.g., in careful
treatments of potential systematic errors -- these projections are intended as
a straightforward baseline for comparison to more detailed analyses.
