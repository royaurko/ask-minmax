We present here a review of high energy (> 1 keV) observations of seven black
hole candidates, six of which have estimated masses. In this review we focus on
two parameters of interest: the ratio of ``non-thermal" to total luminosity as
a function of the total luminosity divided by the Eddington luminosity, and the
root mean square (rms) variability as a function of the non-thermal to total
luminosity ratio. Below $\sim 10\%$ Eddington luminosity, the sources tend to
be strictly non-thermal (the so called ``off" and ``low" states). Above this
luminosity the sources become mostly thermal (the ``high" state), with the
non-thermal component increasing with luminosity (the ``very high" and ``flare"
states). There are important exceptions to this behavior, however, and no
steady -- as opposed to transient -- source has been observed over a wide range
of parameter space. In addition, the rms variability is positively correlated
with the ratio of non-thermal to total luminosity, although there may be a
minimum level of variability associated with ``thermal'' states. We discuss
these results in light of theoretical models and find that currently no single
model describes the full range of black hole high energy behavior. In fact, the
observations are exactly opposite from what one expects based upon simple
notions of accretion disk instabilities.
