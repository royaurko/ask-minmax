The measurements of the Higgs boson and top quark masses can be used to
extrapolate the Standard Model Higgs potential at energies up to the Planck
scale. Adopting a NNLO renormalization procedure, we: i) find that electroweak
vacuum stability is at present allowed, discuss the associated theoretical and
experimental errors and the prospects for its future tests; ii) determine the
boundary conditions allowing for the existence of a shallow false minimum
slightly below the Planck scale, which is a stable configuration that might
have been relevant for primordial inflation; iii) derive a conservative upper
bound on type I seesaw right-handed neutrino masses, following from the
requirement of electroweak vacuum stability.
