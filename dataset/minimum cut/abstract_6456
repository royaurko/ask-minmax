One often-used approximation in the study of binary compact objects (i.e.,
black holes and neutron stars) in general relativity is the instantaneously
circular orbit assumption. This approximation has been used extensively, from
the calculation of innermost circular orbits to the construction of initial
data for numerical relativity calculations. While this assumption is
inconsistent with generic general relativistic astrophysical inspiral phenomena
where the dissipative effects of gravitational radiation cause the separation
of the compact objects to decrease in time, it is usually argued that the
timescale of this dissipation is much longer than the orbital timescale so that
the approximation of circular orbits is valid. Here, we quantitatively analyze
this approximation using a post-Newtonian approach that includes terms up to
order ({Gm/(rc^2)})^{9/2} for non-spinning particles. By calculating the
evolution of equal mass black hole / black hole binary systems starting with
circular orbit configurations and comparing them to the more astrophysically
relevant quasicircular solutions, we show that a minimum initial separation
corresponding to at least 6 (3.5) orbits before plunge is required in order to
bound the detection event loss rate in gravitational wave detectors to < 5%
(20%). In addition, we show that the detection event loss rate is > 95% for a
range of initial separations that include all modern calculations of the
innermost circular orbit (ICO).
