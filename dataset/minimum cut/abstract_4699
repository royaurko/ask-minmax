PHENIX has measured the e^+e^- pair continuum in sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV Au+Au
and p+p collisions over a wide range of mass and transverse momenta. While the
p+p data in the mass range below the phi meson are well described by known
contributions from light meson decays, the Au+Au minimum bias inclusive mass
spectrum shows an enhancement by a factor of 4.7 +/- 0.4(stat)} +/- 1.5(syst)
+/- 0.9(model) in the mass range 0.15<m_ee<0.75 GeV/c^2. At low mass (m_ee<0.3
GeV/c^2) and high p_T (1<p_T<5~GeV/c) an enhanced e^+e^- pair yield is observed
that is in qualitative agreement with hydrodynamical models of thermal photon
emission with initial temperatures ranging from T_init ~= 300-600 MeV at times
of 0.6-0.15 fm/c after the collision.
