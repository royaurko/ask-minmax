We calculate the Debye and Meissner masses of a gauge boson in a material
consisting of two species of massless fermions that form a condensate of Cooper
pairs. We perform the calculation as a function of temperature, for the cases
of neutral Cooper pairs and charged Cooper pairs, and for a range of parameters
including gapped quaisparticles, and ungapped quasiparticles with both
quadratic and linear dispersion relations at low energy.
  Our results are relevant to the behavior of photons and gluons in the gapless
color-flavor-locked phase of quark matter. We find that the photon's Meissner
mass vanishes, and the Debye mass shows a non-monotonic temperature dependence,
and at temperatures of order the pairing gap it drops to a minimum value of
order sqrt(alpha) times the quark chemical potential. We confirm previous
claims that at zero temperature an imaginary Meissner mass can arise from a
charged gapless condensate, and we find that at finite temperature this can
also occur for a gapped condensate.
