Precise radial-velocity measurements for data acquired with the HARPS
spectrograph infer that three planets orbit the M4 dwarf star GJ876. In
particular, we confirm the existence of planet "d", which orbits every 1.93785
days. We find that its orbit may have significant eccentricity (e=0.14), and
deduce a more accurate estimate of its minimum mass of 6.3 Earth masses.
Dynamical modeling of the HARPS measurements combined with literature
velocities from the Keck Observatory strongly constrain the orbital
inclinations of the "b" and "c" planets. We find that i_b = 48.9 degrees and
i_c = 48.1 degrees, which infers the true planet masses of M_b = 2.64 Jupiter
masses and M_c = 0.83 Jupiter masses, respectively. Radial velocities alone, in
this favorable case, can therefore fully determine the orbital architecture of
a multi-planet system, without the input from astrometry or transits.
  The orbits of the two giant planets are nearly coplanar, and their 2:1 mean
motion resonance ensures stability over at least 5 Gyr. The libration amplitude
is smaller than 2 degrees, suggesting that it was damped by some dissipative
process during planet formation. The system has space for a stable fourth
planet in a 4:1 mean motion resonance with planet "b", with a period around 15
days. The radial velocity measurements constrain the mass of this possible
additional planet to be at most that of the Earth.
