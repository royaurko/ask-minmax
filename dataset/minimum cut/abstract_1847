Unlike the extremal Reissner - Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in ordinary
spacetime, the one in anti-de Sitter spacetime is a minimum of action and has
zero entropy if quantization is carried out after extremalization. However, if
extremalization is carried out after quantization, then the entropy is a
quarter of the area as in the usual case.
