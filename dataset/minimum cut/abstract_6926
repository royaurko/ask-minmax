In this paper we expose a dynamic traffic-classification scheme to support
multimedia applications such as voice and broadband video transmissions over
IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). Obviously, over a Wi-Fi link
and to better serve these applications - which normally have strict bounded
transmission delay or minimum link rate requirement - a service differentiation
technique can be applied to the media traffic transmitted by the same mobile
node using the well-known 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA)
protocol. However, the given EDCA mode does not offer user differentiation,
which can be viewed as a deficiency in multi-access wireless networks.
Accordingly, we propose a new inter-node priority access scheme for IEEE
802.11e networks which is compatible with the EDCA scheme. The proposed scheme
joins a dynamic user-weight to each mobile station depending on its outgoing
data, and therefore deploys inter-node priority for the channel access to
complement the existing EDCA inter-frame priority. This provides efficient
quality of service control across multiple users within the same coverage area
of an access point. We provide performance evaluations to compare the proposed
access model with the basic EDCA 802.11 MAC protocol mode to elucidate the
quality improvement achieved for multimedia communication over 802.11 WLANs.
