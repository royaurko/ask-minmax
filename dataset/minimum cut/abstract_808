The simulation study on Frenkel pair creation in vanadium by L.A. Zepeda-Ruiz
et al. (Phys. Rev. B 67, 134114, 2003) is criticized for its lack of reference
to existing experimental work and for generally inadequate treatment of
literature data. Hence, the validity of the ensuing discussion of various
results (e.g. the value of the minimum TDE and the Frenkel pair stability in V)
is questioned.
