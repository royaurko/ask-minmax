Aims. We analyze observational data from 4 instruments to study the
correlations between chromospheric emission, spanning the heights from the
temperature minimum region to the middle chromosphere, and photospheric
magnetic field. Methods: The data consist of radio images at 3.5 mm from the
Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array (BIMA), UV images at 1600 A from TRACE, Ca II
K-line filtergrams from BBSO, and MDI/SOHO longitudinal photospheric
magnetograms. For the first time interferometric millimeter data with the
highest currently available resolution are included in such an analysis. We
determine various parameters of the intensity maps and correlate the
intensities with each other and with the magnetic field. Results: The
chromospheric diagnostics studied here show a pronounced similarity in their
brightness structures and map out the underlying photospheric magnetic field
relatively well. We find a power law to be a good representation of the
relationship between photospheric magnetic field and emission from
chromospheric diagnostics at all wavelengths. The dependence of chromospheric
brightness on magnetic field is found to be different for network and
internetwork regions.
