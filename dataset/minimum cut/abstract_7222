We propose a model for the gamma-ray binary LS 5039 in which the X-ray
emission is due to the inverse Compton (IC) process instead of the synchrotron
radiation. Although the synchrotron model has been discussed in previous
studies, it requires a strong magnetic field which leads to a severe
suppression of the TeV gamma-ray flux in conflict with H.E.S.S. observations.
In this paper, we calculate the IC emission by low energy electrons (\gamma_e
\lesssim 10^3) in the Thomson regime. We find that IC emission of the low
energy electrons can explain the X-ray flux and spectrum observed with Suzaku
if the minimum Lorentz factor of injected electrons \gamma_min is around 10^3.
In addition, we show that the Suzaku light curve is well reproduced if
\gamma_min varies in proportion to the Fermi flux when the distribution
function of injected electrons at higher energies is fixed. We conclude that
the emission from LS 5039 is well explained by the model with the IC emission
from electrons whose injection properties are dependent on the orbital phase.
Since the X-ray flux is primarily determined by the total number of cooling
electrons, this conclusion is rather robust, although some mismatches between
the model and observations at the GeV band remain in the present formulation.
