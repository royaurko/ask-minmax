The ground-state properties of Zr and Sn isotopes are studied within the
relativistic mean field theory. Zr and Sn isotopes have received tremendous
attention due to various reasons, including the predicted giant halos in the
neutron-rich Zr isotopes, the unique feature of being robustly spherical in the
region of $^{100}$Sn $\sim$ $^{132}$Sn and the particular interest of Sn
isotopes to nuclear astrophysics. Furthermore, four (semi-) magic neutron
numbers, 40, 50, 82 and 126, make these two isotopic chains particularly
important to test the pairing correlations and the deformations in a
microscopic model. In the present work, we carry out a systematic study of Zr
and Sn isotopes from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line with
deformation effects, pairing correlations and blocking effects for nuclei with
odd number of neutrons properly treated. A constrained calculation with
quadrupole deformations is performed to find the absolute minimum for each
nucleus on the deformation surface. All ground-state properties, including the
separation energies, the odd-even staggerings, the nuclear radii, the
deformations and the single-particle spectra are analyzed and discussed in
detail.
