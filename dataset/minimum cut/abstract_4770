We present the numerical estimation of noise parameter induced in the
dynamics of the variables by random particle interactions involved in the
stochastic chemical oscillator and use it as order parameter to detect the
transition from stochastic to deterministic regime. In stochastic regime, this
noise parameter is found to be increased as system size decreases, whereas, in
deterministic regime it remains constant to minimum value as system size
increases. This let the transition from fluctuating to fixed limit cycle
oscillation as the system goes from stochastic to deterministic transition. We
also numerically estimated the strength of the noise parameter involved both in
Chemical Langevin equation and Master equation formalisms and found that
strength of this parameter is much smaller in the former than the later.
