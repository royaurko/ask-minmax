We present Chandra X-ray (0.2-8 keV) and Very Large Array radio (15 and 5
GHz) images of the $\gamma$-ray bright, superluminal quasar 0827+243. The X-ray
jet bends sharply--by ~90 deg., presumably amplified by projection effects--5''
from the core. Only extremely weak radio emission is detected between the
nuclear region and the bend. The X-ray continuum spectrum of the combined
emission of the knots is rather flat, with a slope of $-0.4\pm 0.2$, while the
5-15 GHz spectra are steeper for knots detected in the radio. These
characteristics, as well as non-detection of the jet in the optical band by the
Hubble Space Telescope, pose challenges to models for the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of the jet features. The SEDs could arise from pure
synchrotron emission from either a single or dual population of relativistic
electrons only if the minimum electron energy per unit mass $\gamma_{\min}
\gtrsim 1000$. Alternatively, the X-ray emission could result from inverse
Compton scattering of the Cosmic Microwave Background photons by electrons with
Lorentz factors as low as $\gamma \sim 15$. In all models, the bulk Lorentz
factor of the jet flow $\Gamma\gtrsim 20$ found on parsec scales must continue
without substantial deceleration out to 800 kpc (deprojected) from the nucleus.
Deceleration does appear to occur at and beyond the sharp bend, such that the
flow could be only mildly relativistic at the end of the jet.
