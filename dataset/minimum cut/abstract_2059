We consider the one-dimensional anisotropic XY model in the continuum limit.
Stability analysis of its Bloch wall solution is hindered by the nondiagonality
of the associated linearised operator and the hessian of energy. We circumvent
this difficulty by showing that the energy admits a Bogomolnyi bound in
elliptic coordinates and that the Bloch wall saturates it -- that is, the Bloch
wall renders the energy minimum. Our analysis provides a simple but nontrivial
application of the BPS (Bogomolnyi - Prasad - Sommerfield) construction in one
dimension, where its use is often believed to be limited to reproducing results
obtainable by other means.
