In order to foster electric vehicle (EV) adoption, there is a strong need for
designing and developing charging stations that can accommodate different
customer classes, distinguished by their charging preferences, needs, and
technologies. By growing such charging station networks, the power grid becomes
more congested and, therefore, controlling of charging demands should be
carefully aligned with the available resources. This paper focuses on an EV
charging network equipped with different charging technologies and proposes two
frameworks. In the first framework, appropriate for large networks, the EV
population is expected to constitute a sizable portion of the light duty
fleets. This which necessitates controlling the EV charging operations to
prevent potential grid failures and distribute the resources efficiently. This
framework leverages pricing dynamics in order to control the EV customer
request rates and to provide a charging service with the best level of quality
of service. The second framework, on the other hand, is more appropriate for
smaller networks, in which the objective is to compute the minimum amount of
resources required to provide certain levels of quality of service to each
class. The results show that the proposed frameworks ensure grid reliability
and lead to significant savings in capacity planning.
