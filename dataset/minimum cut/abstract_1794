We perform a fit to precise electroweak data to determine the Higgs and top
masses. Penalty functions taking into account their production limits are
included. We find ${\displaystyle m_H=65^{+245}_{-4}\ GeV}$ and ${\displaystyle
m_t=122^{+25}_{-20}\ GeV}$. However whereas the top $\chi^2$ distribution
behaves properly near the minimum, the Higgs $\chi^2$ distribution does not,
indicating a statistical fluctuation or new physics. In fact no significative
bound on the Higgs mass can be given at present. However, if the LEP accuracy
is improved and the top is discovered in the preferred range of top masses, a
meaningful bound on the Higgs mass could be obtained within the standard model
framework.
