We propose a new method for clustering based on the local minimization of the
\gamma-divergence, which we call the spontaneous clustering. The greatest
advantage of the proposed method is that it automatically detects the number of
clusters that adequately reflect the data structure. In contrast, exiting
methods such as K-means, fuzzy c-means, and model based clustering need to
prescribe the number of clusters. We detect all the local minimum points of the
\gamma-divergence, which are defined as the centers of clusters. A necessary
and sufficient condition for the \gamma-divergence to have the local minimum
points is also derived in a simple setting. A simulation study and a real data
analysis are performed to compare our proposal with existing methods.
