This article provides some estimates for the relative sizes of the electric
and magnetic contributions to the energy functional for the minimum energy
configuration of an SU(2) gauge field on R^3 in the presence of an source in a
fixed ball. The surprising fact is that the contribution to both energies from
the free field region increases at worst linearly with the coupling, rather
than quadratically. Moreover, the external electric field is severly surpressed
outside the source at large coupling while the magnetic field is concentrated
in a shell surrounding the source suggesting a classical mechanism for the
formation of the 'MIT bag'.
