Bilayer graphene is a highly promising material for electronic and
optoelectronic applications since it is supporting massive Dirac fermions with
a tuneable band gap. However, no consistent picture of the gap's effect on the
optical and transport behavior has emerged so far, and it has been proposed
that the insulating nature of the gap could be compromised by unavoidable
structural defects, by topological in-gap states, or that the electronic
structure could be altogether changed by many-body effects. Here we directly
follow the excited carriers in bilayer graphene on a femtosecond time scale,
using ultrafast time- and angle-resolved photoemission. We find a behavior
consistent with a single-particle band gap. Compared to monolayer graphene, the
existence of this band gap leads to an increased carrier lifetime in the
minimum of the lowest conduction band. This is in sharp contrast to the second
sub-state of the conduction band, in which the excited electrons decay through
fast, phonon-assisted inter-band transitions.
