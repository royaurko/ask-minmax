We use a theoretical frame-work to analytically assess temporal prediction
error functions on von-Karman turbulence when a zonal representation of
wave-fronts is assumed. Linear prediction models analysed include
auto-regressive of order up to three, bilinear interpolation functions and a
minimum mean square error predictor. This is an extension of the contributors'
previously published work (see ref. 2) in which the efficacy of various
temporal prediction models was established. Here we examine the tolerance of
these algorithms to specific forms of model errors, thus defining the expected
change in behaviour of the previous results under less ideal conditions.
Results show that +/- 100pc wind-speed error and +/- 50 deg are tolerable
before the best linear predictor delivers poorer performance than the
no-prediction case.
