We investigate the superfluid properties of a dipolar Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) in a fully three-dimensional trap. Specifically, we calculate
a superfluid critical velocity for this system by applying the Landau criterion
to its discrete quasiparticle spectrum. We test this critical velocity by
direct numerical simulation of condensate depletion as a blue-detuned laser
moves through the condensate. In both cases, the presence of the roton in the
spectrum serves to lower the critical velocity beyond a critical particle
number. Since the shape of the dispersion, and hence the roton minimum, is
tunable as a function of particle number, we thereby propose an experiment that
can simultaneously measure the Landau critical velocity of a dipolar BEC and
demonstrate the presence of the roton in this system.
