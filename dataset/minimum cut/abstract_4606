The Honey-Bee game is a two-player board game that is played on a connected
hexagonal colored grid or (in a generalized setting) on a connected graph with
colored nodes. In a single move, a player calls a color and thereby conquers
all the nodes of that color that are adjacent to his own current territory.
Both players want to conquer the majority of the nodes. We show that winning
the game is PSPACE-hard in general, NP-hard on series-parallel graphs, but easy
on outerplanar graphs.
  In the solitaire version, the goal of the single player is to conquer the
entire graph with the minimum number of moves. The solitaire version is NP-hard
on trees and split graphs, but can be solved in polynomial time on
co-comparability graphs.
