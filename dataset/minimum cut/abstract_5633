We theoretically investigate the effect of the negative differential
conductance of a ferromagnetic barrier on the surface of a topological
insulator. Due to the changes of the shape and position of the Fermi surfaces
in the ferromagnetic barrier, the transport processes can be divided into three
kinds: the total, partial and blockade transmission mechanisms. The bias
voltage can give rise to the transition of the transport processes from partial
to blockade transmission mechanisms, which results in a giant effect of
negative differential conductance. With appropriate structural parameters, the
current-voltage characteristics show that the minimum value of the current can
reach to zero in a wide range of the bias voltage, and a large peak-to-valley
current ratio can be obtained.
