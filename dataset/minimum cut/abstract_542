High resolution spectroscopy with the Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph,
and Swift ultraviolet photometry are presented for the pulsating extreme helium
star V652\,Her. Swift provides the best relative ultraviolet photometry
obtained to date, but shows no direct evidence for a shock at ultraviolet or
X-ray wavelengths. Subaru has provided high spectral and high temporal
resolution spectroscopy over 6 pulsation cycles (and eight radius minima).
These data have enabled a line-by-line analysis of the entire pulsation cycle
and provided a description of the pulsating photosphere as a function of
optical depth. They show that the photosphere is compressed radially by a
factor of at least two at minimum radius, that the phase of radius minimum is a
function of optical depth and the pulse speed through the photosphere is
between 141 and 239 km/s (depending how measured) and at least ten times the
local sound speed. The strong acceleration at minimum radius is demonstrated in
individual line profiles; those formed deepest in the photosphere show a jump
discontinuity of over 70 km/s on a timescale of 150 s. The pulse speed and line
profile jumps imply a shock is present at minimum radius. These empirical
results provide input for hydrodynamical modelling of the pulsation and
hydrodynamical plus radiative transfer modelling of the dynamical spectra.
