The usual Bi-Maximal (BM) neutrino mixing faces an inherent problem in
lowering the solar mixing angle below $\tan^{2}\theta_{12}=0.50$ when charged
lepton correction is taken. This minimum $\theta_{12}$ is achievable only if CP
violation is absent. We start with a new model which incorporates a new idea of
mixing developed recently, called Bi-Large (BL) mixing, similar to BM mixing
execpt that the former chooses rather $\theta_{13}$ as Cabibbo angle
$(\theta_c)$ than zero. We apply this mixing in the neutrino sector, followed
by a charged lepton correction with the CKM type matrix $U_{l}$. This model
marks a prediction on $\theta_{23}$ to lie within the first octant. The CP
violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ dictates the prediction of all the three mixing
angles. A proper choice of $\delta_{CP}$ leads to the predictions of all the
three mixing angles including $\theta_{12}$, to align very precisely with the
experimental bestfits. This close agreement thus hoists Bi-Large mixing as an
important and promising mixing scheme, in contrast to BM or TBM mixing as a
first approximation. A formal derivation of BL mixing from discrete symmetry
will be an important investigation in neutrino physics.
