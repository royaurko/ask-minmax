We report the discovery of a substellar-mass companion to the K0-giant HD
17092 with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. In the absence of any correlation of the
observed 360-day periodicity with the standard indicators of stellar activity,
the observed radial velocity variations are most plausibly explained in terms
of a Keplerian motion of a planetary-mass body around the star. With the
estimated stellar mass of 2.3Msun, the minimum mass of the planet is 4.6MJ. The
planet's orbit is characterized by a mild eccentricity of e=0.17 and a
semi-major axis of 1.3 AU. This is the tenth published detection of a planetary
companion around a red giant star. Such discoveries add to our understanding of
planet formation around intermediate-mass stars and they provide dynamical
information on the evolution of planetary systems around post-main sequence
stars.
