We discuss four recycled pulsars found in Arecibo drift-scan searches. PSR
J1944+0907 has a spin period of 5.2 ms and is isolated. The 5.8-ms pulsar
J1453+19 may have a low-mass companion. We discuss these pulsars in the context
of isolated millisecond pulsar formation and the minimum spin period of neutron
stars. The isolated 56-ms pulsar J0609+2130 is possibly the remnant of a
disrupted double neutron star binary. The 41-ms pulsar J1829+2456 is in a
relativistic orbit. Its companion is most likely another neutron star, making
this the eighth known double neutron star binary system.
