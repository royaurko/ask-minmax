In clinical trials, minimum clinically important difference (MCID) has
attracted increasing interest as an important supportive clinical and
statistical inference tool. Many estimation methods have been developed based
on various intuitions, while little theoretical justification has been
established. This paper proposes a new estimation framework of MCID using both
diagnostic measurements and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). It first provides
a precise definition of population-based MCID so that estimating such a MCID
can be formulated as a large margin classification problem. The framework is
then extended to personalized MCID to allow individualized thresholding value
for patients whose clinical profiles may affect their PRO responses. More
importantly, we show that the proposed estimation framework is asymptotically
consistent, and a finite-sample upper bound is established for its prediction
accuracy compared against the ideal MCID. The advantage of our proposed method
is also demonstrated in a variety of simulated experiments as well as
applications to two benchmark datasets and two phase-3 clinical trials.
