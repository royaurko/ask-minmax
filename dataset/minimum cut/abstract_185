In this paper, a new voltage-mode quadrature oscillator using minimum number
of active and passive component is proposed. The proposed circuit employs
single modified DVCC, two grounded capacitor and two grounded resistors, which
is ideal for IC implementation. The active and passive sensitivity are no more
than unity. The proposed circuit is verified through PSPICE simulation results.
