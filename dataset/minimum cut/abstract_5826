We present a new high signal-to-noise (S/N) observations of the Diffuse
Interstellar Bands (DIBs) in the Local Bubble and its surroundings. We observed
432 sightlines and obtain the equivalent widths of $\lambda$5780 and
$\lambda$5797 \AA\ DIBs up to distance of $\sim$ 200 pc. All observations have
been carried out by using Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS) on 2.5 m
Isaac Newton Telescope, during three years, to reach a minimum S/N ratio of
$\sim$ 2000. All $\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$5797 absorptions are presented in
this paper and the observed values of interstellar parameter; $\lambda$5780,
$\lambda$5797, Na I D lines including the uncertainties are tabulated.
