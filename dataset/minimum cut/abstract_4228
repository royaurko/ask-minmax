We show that two graphene layers stacked directly on top of each other (AA
stacking) form strong chemical bonds when the distance between planes is 0.156
nm. Simultaneously, C-C in-plane bonds are considerably weakened from partial
double-bond (0.141 nm) to single bond (0.154 nm). This polymorphic form of
graphene bilayer is meta-stable w.r.t. the one bound by van der Waals forces at
a larger separation (0.335 nm) with an activation energy of 0.16 eV/cell.
Similarly to the structure found in hexaprismane, C forms four single bonds in
a geometry mixing 90^{0} and 120^{0} angles. Intermediate separations between
layers can be stabilized under external anisotropic stresses showing a rich
electronic structure changing from semimetal at van der Waals distance, to
metal when compressed, to wide gap semiconductor at the meta-stable minimum.
