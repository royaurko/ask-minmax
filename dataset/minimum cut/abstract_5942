Configurations of supercooled liquids residing in their local potential
minimum (i.e. in their inherent structure, IS) were found to support a non-zero
shear stress. This IS stress was attributed to the constraint to the energy
minimization imposed by boundary conditions, which keep size and shape of the
simulation cell fixed. In this paper we further investigate the influence of
these boundary conditions on the IS stress. We investigate its importance for
the computation of the low frequency shear modulus of a glass obtaining a
consistent picture for the low- and high frequency shear moduli over the full
temperature range. Hence, we find that the IS stress corresponds to a
non-thermal contribution to the fluctuation term in the Born-Green expression.
This leads to an unphysical divergence of the moduli in the low temperature
limit if no proper correction for this term is applied. Furthermore, we clarify
the IS stress dependence on the system size and put its origin on a more formal
basis.
