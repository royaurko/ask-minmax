It is well known that effective potentials can be gauge-dependent while their
values at extrema should be gauge-invariant. Unfortunately, establishing this
invariance in perturbation theory is not straightforward, since contributions
from arbitrarily high- order loops can be of the same size. We show in massless
scalar QED that an infinite class of loops can be summed (and must be summed)
to give a gauge invariant value for the potential at its minimum. In addition,
we show that the exact potential depends on both the scale at which it is
calculated and the normalization of the fields, but the vacuum energy does not.
Using these insights, we propose a method to extract some physical quantities
from effective potentials which is self-consistent order-by-order in
perturbation theory, including improvement with the renormalization group.
