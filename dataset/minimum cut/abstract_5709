We consider the two-dimensional Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice with hexagonal
honeycomb symmetry, which is a Hamiltonian system describing the evolution of a
scalar-valued quantity subject to nearest neighbour interactions. Using
multiple-scale analysis we reduce the governing lattice equations to a
nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation coupled to a second equation for an
accompanying slow mode. Two cases in which the latter equation can be solved
and so the system decoupled are considered in more detail: firstly, in the case
of a symmetric potential, we derive the form of moving breathers. We find an
ellipticity criterion for the wavenumbers of the carrier wave, together with
asymptotic estimates for the breather energy. The minimum energy threshold
depends on the wavenumber of the breather. We find that this threshold is
locally maximised by stationary breathers. Secondly, for an asymmetric
potential we find stationary breathers, which, even with a quadratic
nonlinearity generate no second harmonic component in the breather. Plots of
all our findings show clear hexagonal symmetry as we would expect from our
lattice structure. Finally, we compare the properties of stationary breathers
in the square, triangular and honeycomb lattices.
