We study the complete dynamical evolution of hot interstellar gas in massive
elliptical galaxies born into a simple flat universe beginning with an
overdense perturbation. Within the turn-around radius dark matter flows in a
self-similar fashion into a stationary Navarro-Frenk-White halo and the
baryonic gas shocks. After a few gigayears, when enough gas accumulates within
the accretion shock, the de Vaucouleurs stellar system is constructed and the
energy from Type II supernovae is released. The stars and dark halo are matched
to NGC 4472. Gas continues to enter the galaxy by secondary infall and by
stellar mass loss based on a Salpeter IMF. After about 13 Gyrs the temperature
and density distribution in the hot gas agree quite well with the hot
interstellar gas observed in NGC 4472. As a result of supernova-driven outflow,
the present day baryonic fraction has a deep minimum in the outer galactic
halo. When relatively gas-rich, X-ray luminous models are spatially truncated
at early times, simulating tidal events that may have occurred during galaxy
group dynamics, the current locus of truncated models lies just along the
$L_x$, X-ray size correlation among well-observed ellipticals, providing
another striking confirmation of our simple model of elliptical evolution.
