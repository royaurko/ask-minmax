We report the detection of eighteen Jovian planets discovered as part of our
Doppler survey of subgiant stars at Keck Observatory, with follow-up Doppler
and photometric observations made at McDonald and Fairborn Observatories,
respectively. The host stars have masses 0.927 < Mstar /Msun < 1.95, radii 2.5
< Rstar/Rsun < 8.7, and metallicities -0.46 < [Fe/H] < +0.30. The planets have
minimum masses 0.9 MJup < MP sin i <3 MJup and semima jor axes a > 0.76 AU.
These detections represent a 50% increase in the number of planets known to
orbit stars more massive than 1.5 Msun and provide valuable additional
information about the properties of planets around stars more massive
thantheSun.
