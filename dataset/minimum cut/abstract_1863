We consider a sphaleron solution in field theory that provides a toy model
for unstable D-branes of string theory. We investigate the tachyon condensation
on a Dp-brane. The localized modes, including a tachyon, arise in the spectrum
of a sphaleron solution of a \phi^4 field theory on M^{p+1}\times S^1. We use
these modes to find a multiscalar tachyon potential living on the sphaleron
world-volume. A complete cancelation between brane tension and the minimum of
the tachyon potential is found as the size of the circle becomes small.
