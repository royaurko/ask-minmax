The ratio eta/s, shear viscosity (eta) to entropy density (s), reaches its
local minimum at the (second order) phase transition temperature in a wide
class of systems. It was suspected that this behavior might be universal.
However, a counterexample is found in a system of two weakly self-interacting
real scalar fields with one of them condensing at low temperatures while the
other remains in the symmetric phase. There is no interaction between the two
fields. The resulting eta/s is monotonically decreasing in temperature despite
the phase transition.
