We report recent results from the ALICE experiment at the LHC for minimum
bias pp collisions. This overview includes results on inelastic cross section,
with analysis of single and double diffractive events; the study of hadron
production mechanisms, both for inclusive and identified particles;
Bose-Einstein correlations; and fluctuations in $<p_T>$
