A silicon pixel detector with fine pitch size of 19x19 um, developed base on
SOI (silicon on insulator) technology, was tested under the illumination of
infrared laser pulses. As an alternative way to particle beam tests, the laser
pulses were tuned to very short duration and small transverse profile to
simulate the tracks of MIPs (minimum ionization particles) in silicon. Hit
cluster sizes were measured with focused laser pulses propagating through the
SOI detector perpendicular to its surface and most of the induced charge was
found to be collected inside the seed pixel. For the first time, the signal
amplitude as a function of the applied bias voltage was measured for this SOI
detector, deepening understanding of its depletion characteristics.
