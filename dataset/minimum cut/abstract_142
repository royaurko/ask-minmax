Spectrum hard components from 200 GeV \auau collisions are accurately
described by pQCD parton fragment distributions, indicating that a substantial
population of parton fragments is present in hadron spectra at low $p_t$.
Minimum-bias angular correlations contain jet-like correlation structure with
most-probable hadron momentum 1 GeV/c. In this study we convert minimum-bias
jet-like angular correlations to single-particle yields and compare them with
spectrum hard components. We find that jet-like correlations in central 200 GeV
\auau collisions correspond quantitatively to pQCD predictions, and the
jet-correlated hadron yield comprises one third of the final state.
