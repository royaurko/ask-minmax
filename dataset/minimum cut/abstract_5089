We discuss the optimization of a neutrino factory for large \sin^2 2
\theta_{13}, where we assume minimum effort on the accelerator side. This
implies that we use low muon energies for the price of an optimized detection
system. We demonstrate that such a neutrino factory performs excellent if
combined with the electron neutrino appearance channel. Instead of the platinum
channel operated with the muon neutrinos from the muon decays, we propose to
use the initial superbeam from the decaying pions and kaons, which might be
utilized at little extra effort. Since we assume out-of-phase bunches arriving
at the same detector, we do not require electron charge identification. In
addition, we can choose the proton energy such that we obtain a synergistic
spectrum peaking at lower energies. We find that both the superbeam and the
neutrino factory beam should used at the identical baseline to reduce matter
density uncertainties, possibly with the same detector. This effectively makes
the configuration a single experiment, which we call ``neutrino factory
superbeam''. We demonstrate that this experiment outperforms a low-energy
neutrino factory or a wide band beam alone beyond a simple addition of
statistics.
