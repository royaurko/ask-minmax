Reformulating hyperdynamics without using a transition state theory (TST)
dividing surface makes it possible to accelerate conventional molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation using a broader range of bias potentials. A new scheme
to calculate the boost factor is also introduced that makes the hyperdynamics
method more accurate and efficient. Novel bias potentials using the
hyper-distance and the potential energy slope and curvature along the direction
vector from a minimum to a current position can significantly reduce the
computational overhead required. Results simulating an atomic force microscope
(AFM) system validate the new methodology.
