We investigate the statistical evolution of magnetic neutron stars recycled
in Low Mass Binary (LMB) systems, simulating synthetic populations.
Irrespective to the details of the physical models, we find to be significant
the fraction of neutron stars spinning close to their mass shedding limit
relative to the millisecond pulsar population. The simulated neutron stars show
a tail in their period distribution at periods shorter than 1.558 ms, the
minimum detected so far. Crustal magnetic field decay models predict also the
existence of massive rapidly spinning neutron stars with very low magnetic
moment.
