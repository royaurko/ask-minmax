The entanglement in a general Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain of arbitrary
spin-$s$ is investigated. The entanglement is witnessed by the thermal energy
which equals to the minimum energy of any separable state. There is a
characteristic temperature below that an entangled thermal state exists. The
characteristic temperature for thermal entanglement is increased with spin $s$.
When the total number of lattice is increased, the characteristic temperature
decreases and then approaches a constant. This effect shows that the thermal
entanglement can be detected in a real solid state system of larger number of
lattices for finite temperature. The comparison of negativity and entanglement
witness is obtained from the separability of the unentangled states. It is
found that the thermal energy provides a sufficient condition for the existence
of the thermal entanglement in a spin-$s$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain.
