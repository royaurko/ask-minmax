We study constacyclic codes, of length $np^s$ and $2np^s$, that are generated
by the polynomials $(x^n + \gamma)^{\ell}$ and $(x^n - \xi)^i(x^n + \xi)^j$\
respectively, where $x^n + \gamma$, $x^n - \xi$ and $x^n + \xi$ are irreducible
over the alphabet $\F_{p^a}$. We generalize the results of [5], [6] and [7] by
computing the minimum Hamming distance of these codes. As a particular case, we
determine the minimum Hamming distance of cyclic and negacyclic codes, of
length $2p^s$, over a finite field of characteristic $p$.
