Phase resonances in transmission compound structures with subwavelength slits
produce sharp dips in the transmission response. For all equal slits, the
wavelengths of these sharp transmission minima can be varied by changing the
width or the length of all the slits. In this paper we show that the width of
the dip, i.e., the frequency range of minimum transmittance, can be controlled
by making at least one slit different from the rest within a compound unit
cell. In particular, we investigate the effect that a change in the dielectric
filling, or in the length of a single slit produces in the transmission
response. We also analyze the scan angle behavior of these structures by means
of band diagrams, and compare them with previous results for all-equal slit
structures.
