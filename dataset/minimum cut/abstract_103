Temperature dependence of the magnetization of the Haldane spin chain at
finite magnetic field is analyzed systematically. Quantum Monte Carlo data
indicates a clear minimum of magnetization as a function of temperature in the
gapless regime. On the basis of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory, we argue
that this minimum is rather universal and can be observed for general axially
symmetric quasi-one-dimensional spin systems. Our argument is confirmed by the
magnetic-field dependence of the spin-wave velocity obtained numerically. One
can estimate a magnitude of the gap of any such systems by fitting the
experimental data with the magnetization minimum.
