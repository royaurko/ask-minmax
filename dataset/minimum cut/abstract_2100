In this paper, we show that for every constant $0 < \epsilon < 1/2$ and for
every constant $d \geq 2$, the minimum size of a depth $d$ Boolean circuit that
$\epsilon$-approximates Majority function on $n$ variables is
exp$(\Theta(n^{1/(2d-2)}))$. The lower bound for every $d \geq 2$ and the upper
bound for $d=2$ have been previously shown by O'Donnell and Wimmer [ICALP'07],
and the contribution of this paper is to give a matching upper bound for $d
\geq 3$.
