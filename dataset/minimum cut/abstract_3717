Using the ellipsoidal model for the density configuration, we calculate the
equilibrium sequence of the corotating binary stars of the polytropic equation
of state in the first post-Newtonian approximation of general relativity. After
we calibrate this model by comparing with previous numerical results, we
perform the stability analysis by calculating the energy and the angular
momentum of the system as a function of the orbital separation. We find that
the orbital angular velocity at the energy and/or momentum minimum increases
with the increase of the compactness of each star, and this fact holds
irrespective of the polytropic index. These features agree with those in
previous numerical works. We also show that due to the influence of the tidal
field from the companion star, the central density of each star slightly
decreases.
