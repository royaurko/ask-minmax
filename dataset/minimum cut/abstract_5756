We study the surface conductivity of a three dimensional topological
insulator doped with magnetic impurities. The spin-momentum locking of surface
electrons makes their scattering from magnetic impurities anisotropic and the
standard relaxation time approximation is not applicable. Using the
semiclassical Boltzmann approach together with a generalized relaxation time
scheme, we obtain closed forms for the relaxation times and analytic
expressions for the surface conductivities of the system as functions of the
bulk magnetization and the orientation of the aligned surface magnetic
impurities. We show that the surface conductivity is anisotropic, and strongly
depends both on the direction of the spins of magnetic impurities and on the
magnitude of the bulk magnetization. In particular, we find that the surface
conductivity has its minimum value when the spin of surface impurities are
aligned perpendicular to the surface of TI, and therefore the backscattering
probability is enhanced due to the magnetic torque exerted by impurities on the
surface electrons.
