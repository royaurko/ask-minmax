We explore a one-zone hadronic model that may be able to reproduce
$\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission with a minimum of free parameters.
Assuming only that GRBs are efficient high-energy proton accelerators and
without the presence of an ab initio photon field, we investigate the
conditions under which the system becomes supercritical, i.e. there is a fast,
non-linear transfer of energy from protons to secondary particles initiated by
the spontaneous quenching of proton-produced $\gamma$-rays. We first show
analytically that the transition to supercriticality occurs whenever the proton
injection compactness exceeds a critical value, which favours high proton
injection luminosities and a wide range of bulk Lorentz factors. The properties
of supercriticality are then studied with a time-dependent numerical code that
solves concurrently the coupled equations of proton, photon, electron, neutron
and neutrino distributions. For conditions that drive the system deep into the
supercriticality we find that the photon spectra obtain a Band-like shape due
to Comptonization by cooled pairs and that the energy transfer efficiency from
protons to $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos is high reaching $\sim 0.3$. Although
some questions concerning its full adaptability to the GRB prompt emission
remain open, supercriticality is found to be a promising process in that
regard.
