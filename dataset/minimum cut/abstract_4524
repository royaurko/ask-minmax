A Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillator has been implemented at 11.2 GHz using a
low-vibration design pulse-tube cryocooler. Compared with a state-of-the-art
liquid helium cooled CSO in the same laboratory, the square root Allan variance
of their combined fractional frequency instability is $\sigma_y = 1.4 \times
10^{-15}\tau^{-1/2}$ for integration times $1 < \tau < 10$ s, dominated by
white frequency noise. The minimum $\sigma_y = 5.3 \times 10^{-16}$ for the two
oscillators was reached at $\tau = 20$ s. Assuming equal contributions from
both CSOs, the single oscillator phase noise $S_{\phi} \approx -96 \; dB \;
rad^2/Hz$ at 1 Hz offset from the carrier.
