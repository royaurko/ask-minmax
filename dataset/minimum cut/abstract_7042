Two remarkable features emerge from the exact Wilsonian procedure for
integrating out the high-energy scale in the Hubbard model. At low energies,
the number of excitations that couple minimally to the electromagnetic gauge is
less than the conserved charge, thereby implying a breakdown of Fermi liquid
theory. In addition, two charge $e$ excitations emerge in the lower band, the
standard projected electron and a composite entity (comprised of a hole and a
charge $2e$ bosonic field) which give rise to poles and zeros of the
single-particle Green function, respectively. The poles generate spectral
weight along an arc centered at $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ while the zeros kill the
spectral intensity on the back-side of the arc. The result is the Fermi arc
structure intrinsic to cuprate phenomenology. The presence of composite
excitations also produces a broad incoherent pseudogap feature at the $(\pi,0)$
region of the Brillouin zone, thereby providing a mechanism for the
nodal/anti-nodal dichotomy seen in the cuprates.
