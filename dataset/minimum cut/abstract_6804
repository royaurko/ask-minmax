We report precise Doppler measurements of the nearby (d = 10.34 pc) M dwarf
Gl649 that reveal the presence of a planet with a minimum mass Msini = 0.328
Mjup in an eccentric (e = 0.30), 598.3 day orbit. Our photometric monitoring
reveals Gl649 to be a new variable star with brightness changes on both
rotational and decadal timescales. However, neither of these timescales are
consistent with the 600-day Doppler signal and so provide strong support for
planetary reflex motion as the best interpretation of the observed radial
velocity variations. Gl649b is only the seventh Doppler-detected giant planet
around an M dwarf. The properties of the planet and host-star therefore
contribute significant information to our knowledge of planet formation around
low-mass stars. We revise and refine the occurrence rate of giant planets
around M dwarfs based on the California Planet Survey sample of low-mass stars
(M* < 0.6 Msun). We find that f = 3.4^{+2.2}_{-0.9}% of stars with M* < 0.6
Msun harbor planets with Msini > 0.3$ Mjup and a < 2.5 AU. When we restrict our
analysis to metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] > +0.2 we find the occurrence rate is
10.7^{+5.9}_{-4.2}%.
