Angular correlations between produced high pT Xi baryons and unidentified
charged and neutral particles are observed in high-tower-triggered (on a large
electromagnetic energy deposit) s^(1/2)=200 GeV p+p collisions. This trigger
favors events with higher average multiplicity than those in minimum bias.
These events are likely to contain jets. The average multiplicity of a
high-tower triggered event is similar to that of a minimum bias event
containing a Xi, which implies that Xi baryons are likely to be produced in
jets. Xi mean pT is higher in the triggered data then in the minimum bias
sample.
