We present a lattice gauge-fixing action $S_{gf}$ with the following
properties: (a) $S_{gf}$ is proportional to the trace of $(\sum_\mu
\partial_\mu A_\mu)^2$, plus irrelevant terms of dimension six and higher; (b)
$S_{gf}$ has a unique absolute minimum at $U_{x,\mu}=I$. Noting that the
gauge-fixed action is not BRST invariant on the lattice, we discuss some
important aspects of the phase diagram.
