Parametrizations of fragmentation functions (FFs) from $e^+$-$e^-$ and p-\=p
collisions are combined with a parton spectrum model in a pQCD folding integral
to produce minimum-bias {\em fragment distributions}. A model of in-medium FF
modification is included. Calculated fragment distributions are compared with
{\em hard components} from p-p and Au-Au $p_t$ spectra. Data are well described
by pQCD over a large kinematic region for a range of Au-Au centralities.
