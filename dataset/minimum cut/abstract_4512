We investigate a discrimination scheme between unitary processes. By
introducing a margin for the probability of erroneous guess, this scheme
interpolates the two standard discrimination schemes: minimum-error and
unambiguous discrimination. We present solutions for two cases. One is the case
of two unitary processes with general prior probabilities. The other is the
case with a group symmetry: the processes comprise a projective representation
of a finite group. In the latter case, we found that unambiguous discrimination
is a kind of "all or nothing": the maximum success probability is either 0 or
1. We also closely analyze how entanglement with an auxiliary system improves
discrimination performance.
