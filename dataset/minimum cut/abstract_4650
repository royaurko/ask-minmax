We study the statistical properties of the SIR epidemics in heterogeneous
networks, when an epidemic is defined as only those SIR propagations that reach
or exceed a minimum size s_c. Using percolation theory to calculate the average
fractional size <M_SIR> of an epidemic, we find that the strength of the
spanning link percolation cluster $P_{\infty}$ is an upper bound to <M_SIR>.
For small values of s_c, $P_{\infty}$ is no longer a good approximation, and
the average fractional size has to be computed directly. The value of s_c for
which $P_{\infty}$ is a good approximation is found to depend on the
transmissibility T of the SIR. We also study Q, the probability that an SIR
propagation reaches the epidemic mass s_c, and find that it is well
characterized by percolation theory. We apply our results to real networks
(DIMES and Tracerouter) to measure the consequences of the choice s_c on
predictions of average outcome sizes of computer failure epidemics.
