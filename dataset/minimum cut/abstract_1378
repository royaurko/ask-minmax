Scaling structure of the growth rate distribution on the interface of a
dendritic pattern is investigated. The distribution is evaluated for an ${\rm
NH_4Cl}$ quasi-two-dimensional crystal by numerically solving the Laplace
equation with the boundary condition taking account of the surface tension
effect. It is found that the distribution has multifractality and the surface
tension effect is almost ineffective in the unscreened large growth region. The
values of the minimum singular exponent and the fractal dimension are smaller
than those for the diffusion-limited aggregation pattern. The Makarov's
theorem, the information dimension equals one, and the Turkevich-Scher
conjecture between the fractal dimension and the minimum singularity exponent
hold.
