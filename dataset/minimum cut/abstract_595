The Alday-Maldacena solution, relevant to the n=4 gluon amplitude in N=4 SYM
at strong coupling, was recently identified as a minimum of the regularized
action in the moduli space of solutions of the AdS_5 sigma-model equations of
motion. Analogous solutions of the Nambu-Goto equations for the n=4 case are
presented and shown to form (modulo the reparametrization group) an equally
large but different moduli space, with the Alday-Maldacena solution at the
intersection of the sigma-model and Nambu-Goto moduli spaces. We comment upon
the possible form of the regularized action for n=5. A function of moduli
parameters z_a is written, whose minimum reproduces the BDDK one-loop
five-gluon amplitude. This function may thus be considered as some kind of
Legendre transform of the BDDK formula and has its own value independently of
the Alday-Maldacena approach.
