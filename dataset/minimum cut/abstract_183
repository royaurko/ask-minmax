The main goal of this work is to give new and precise generalizations to
various classes of plurisubharmonic functions of the classical minimum modulus
principle for holomorphic functions of one complex variable, in the spirit of
the famous lemma of Cartan-Boutroux. As an application we obtain precise
estimates on the size of "plurisubharmonic lemniscates" in terms of appropriate
Hausdorff contents.
