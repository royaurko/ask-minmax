Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph. For an integer $k\geq 1$, a function
$f:V\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ is a Roman $k$-tuple dominating function if for any
vertex $v$ with $f(v)=0$, there exist at least $k$ vertices $w$ in its
neighborhood with $f(w)=2$, and for any vertex $v$ with $f(v)\neq 0$, there
exist at least $k-1$ vertices $w$ in its neighborhood with $f(w)=2$. The weight
of a Roman $k$-tuple dominating function $f$ of $G$ is the value
$f(V)=\sum_{v\in V}f(v)$. The minimum weight of a Roman $k$-tuple dominating
function of $G$ is its Roman $k$-tuple domination number. In this paper, we
initiate the studying of the Roman $k$-tuple domination number of a graph. Some
of our results extend these one given by Cockayne and et al. [Roman domination
in graphs, Discrete Mathematics 278 (2004) 11-22] for the Roman domination
number.
