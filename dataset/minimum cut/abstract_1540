We present high-precision radial-velocity measurements of three solar-type
stars: HD 13908, HD 159243, and HIP 91258. The observations were made with the
SOPHIE spectrograph at the 1.93-m telescope of Observatoire de Haute-Provence
(France). They show that these three bright stars host exoplanetary systems
composed of at least two companions. HD 13908 b is a planet with a minimum mass
of 0.865+-0.035 Mjup, on a circular orbit with a period of 19.382+-0.006 days.
There is an outer massive companion in the system with a period of 931+-17
days, e = 0.12+-0.02, and a minimum mass of 5.13+-0.25 Mjup. The star HD
159243, also has two detected companions with respective masses, periods, and
eccentricities of Mp = 1.13+-0.05 and 1.9+-0.13 Mjup, $P$ = 12.620+-0.004 and
248.4+-4.9 days, and e = 0.02+-0.02 and 0.075+-0.05. Finally, the star HIP
91258 has a planetary companion with a minimum mass of 1.068+-0.038 Mjup, an
orbital period of 5.0505+-0.0015 days, and a quadratic trend indicating an
outer planetary or stellar companion that is as yet uncharacterized. The
planet-hosting stars HD 13908, HD 159243, and HIP 91258 are main-sequence stars
of spectral types F8V, G0V, and G5V, respectively, with moderate activity
levels. HIP 91258 is slightly over-metallic, while the two other stars have
solar-like metallicity. The three systems are discussed in the frame of
formation and dynamical evolution models of systems composed of several giant
planets.
