An ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
was used to investigate the interactions of fast-mode shocks with
self-gravitating, isothermal cores with mass-to-flux ratios that are somewhat
below the minimum value required for gravitational collapse. We find that shock
focussing produces colliding flows along the field lines that generate very
high densities, even for relatively weak shocks. Self-gravity plays only a
minor role in determining the highest density that is reached, but it does play
a role in the subsequent evolution. The densities at comparable times differ by
a factor of a few for shocks initially propagating perpendicularly or obliquely
to the magnetic field in the ambient medium.
