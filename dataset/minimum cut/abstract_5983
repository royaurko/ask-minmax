The fitting of radial velocity curves is a frequent procedure in binary stars
and exoplanet research. In the majority of cases the fitting routines need to
be fed with a set of initial parameter values and priors from which to begin
the computations and their results can be affected by local minima. We present
a new code, the rvfit code, for fitting radial velocities of stellar binaries
and exoplanets using an Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) global minimization
method, which fastly converges to a global solution minimum without the need to
provide preliminary parameter values. We show the performance of the code using
both synthetic and real data sets: double-lined binaries, single-lined
binaries, and exoplanet systems. In all examples the keplerian orbital
parameters fitted by the rvfit code and their computed uncertainties are
compared with literature solutions. Finally, we provide the source code with a
working example and a detailed description on how to use it.
