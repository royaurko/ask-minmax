Methodology for calculating the profile and emittance of a particle beam as
it is slowed down in matter, including the effects of multiple scattering,
axial magnetic field and lithium lens. Strategies are determined for minimum
final emittance. For ionization cooling, boron carbide is superior to liquid
hydrogen while a beryllium lens has merit.
