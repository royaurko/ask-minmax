We investigate the electrical conductivity of spin-polarized graphene in the
presence of short-ranged magnetic scatterers within the relaxation time
approximation and the semi-classical Boltzmann approach. Spin-flip scattering
of the itinerant electrons from the majority spin sub-band into the minority
one results in a minimum in the electrical resistivity at a finite temperature.
While this behavior is reminiscent of the renowned Kondo effect, it has an
entirely different origin and differs from the Kondo effect in several aspects.
In particular, unlike the Kondo effect, this is a single particle phenomena,
and it does not require antiferromagnetic coupling between the magnetic moments
of impurities and spins of the itinerant electrons.
