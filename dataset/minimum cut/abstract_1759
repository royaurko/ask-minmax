Static solutions of white dwarfs with spherical symmetry and local anisotropy
are studied in the post-Newtonian approximation. It is argued that the
condition for equilibrium must be that the total energy is a minimum for given
baryon number and the question whether there is local isotropy or anisotropy
inside the star should follow from that condition, rather than be postulated "a
priori". It is shown show that, in post-Newtonian gravity, there are stable
configurations with local anisotropy for masses above the Chandrasekhar limit.
