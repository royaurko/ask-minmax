Paramagnetic Meissner effect was observed in single crystal Yb(3)Rh(4)Sn(13).
While field cooling the sample, at the onset of the superconducting transition
at 7.92 K, the DC magnetization first goes through a minimum at 7.85 K,
followed by the peak of the PME signal at 7.6 K and then crosses over to the
diamagnetic state. The magnetization vs field curves are reversible above the
minimum and imbibe a pinning characteristic below 7.85 K. The minimum can be
attributed to the opposing contribution to the dc magnetization signal from
surface superconductivity. The subsequent flux compression while cooling the
sample below 7.85 K shows the rapid increase in the dc magnetization signal.
PME signal is actually the diamagnetism opposing the flux compression.
