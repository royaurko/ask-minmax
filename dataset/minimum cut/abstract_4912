In a recent publication, we introduce the lift force as a common source to
accretion disk tilt that is likely relevant to accretion disk systems. Lift is
generated by slightly different supersonic gas stream speeds flowing over and
under the disk at the bright spot. In this conference proceeding, we focus on
whether the average white dwarf has enough mass to prevent a disk tilt in
non-magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) with accretion disks. Assuming a white
dwarf mass of 0.6M$_{\odot}$ and a disk mass of 10$^{-11}$M$_{\odot}$, we vary
the secondary mass to establish theoretical minimum mass transfer rates needed
to induce and maintain a disk tilt of four degrees around the line of nodes.
For mass ratios in the range \( (0.13 \le q=M_{2}M^{-1} \le 0.45) \), we
confirm that the secondary mass does not contribute significantly to disk tilt.
We also confirm that the average white dwarf does not have enough mass to
prevent a disk tilt. We find that disk tilt may be likely in low mass transfer
rate systems such as CV SU UMa's.
