We present an analysis of the 2-10keV XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn spectrum of the
Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC4593. Apart from the presence of two narrow emission lines
corresponding to the Kalpha lines of cold and hydrogen-like iron, this spectrum
possesses a power-law form to within 3-5%. There is a marked lack of spectral
features from the relativistic regions of the black hole accretion disk. We
show that the data are, however, consistent with the presence of a
radiatively-efficient accretion disk extending right down to the radius of
marginal stability if it possesses low iron abundance, an appropriately ionized
surface, a very high inclination, or a very centrally concentrated emission
pattern (as has been observed during the Deep Minimum State of the Seyfert
galaxy MCG-6-30-15). Deeper observations of this source are required in order
to validate or reject these models.
