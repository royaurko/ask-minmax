The B20 magnets with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (D-M) interaction exhibit spin
helix and Skyrmion spin textures unattainable in traditional Heisenberg
ferromagnets. We have determined the intrinsic resistivity of the spin helix,
which is a macroscopic Bloch domain wall, in B20 (Fe-Co)Si magnets. We found a
universal resistance ratio of gamma = 1.35 with current parallel and
perpendicular to the helix, independent of composition and temperature. This
gamma value is much smaller than 3, the well-known minimum value for domain
wall resistivity in traditional ferromagnets, due to the significant spin-orbit
coupling in the B20 magnets.
