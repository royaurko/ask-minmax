It is shown that the condition for chemical freeze-out, average energy per
hadron approximately 1 GeV, selects the softest point of the equation of state,
namely the point where the pressure divided by the energy density has a
minimum. The sensitivity to the equation of state used is discussed. The
previously proposed mixed phase model, which is consistent with lattice QCD
data naturally leads to the chemical freeze-out condition.
