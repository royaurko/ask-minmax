We calculate analytically the improvement coefficients of the static axial
and vector currents in O(a) improved lattice QCD at one-loop order of
perturbation theory. The static quark is described by the hypercubic action,
previously introduced in the literature in order to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio of static observables. Within a Schroedinger Functional setup, we derive
the Feynman rules of the hypercubic link in time-momentum representation. The
improvement coefficients are obtained from on-shell correlators of the static
axial and vector currents. As a by-product, we localise the minimum of the
static self-energy as a function of the smearing parameters of the action at
one-loop order and show that the perturbative minimum is close to its
non-perturbative counterpart.
