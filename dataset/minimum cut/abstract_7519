The expression "multiple parton interactions" (MPI) denotes a conjectured QCD
mechanism representing contributions from secondary (semi)hard parton
scattering to the transverse azimuth region (TR) of jet-triggered p-p
collisions. MPI is an object of underlying-event (UE) studies that consider
variation of TR $n_{ch}$ or $p_t$ yields relative to a trigger condition
(leading hadron or jet $p_t$). An alternative approach is 2D trigger-associated
(TA) correlations on hadron transverse momentum $p_t$ or rapidity $y_t$ in
which all hadrons from all p-p events are included. Based on a two-component
(soft+hard) model (TCM) of TA correlations a jet-related TA hard component is
isolated. Contributions to the hard component from the triggered dijet and from
secondary dijets (MPI) can be distinguished, including their azimuth dependence
relative to the trigger direction. Measured $e^+$-$e^-$ and p-\=p fragmentation
functions and a minimum-bias jet spectrum from 200 GeV p-\=p collisions are
convoluted to predict the 2D hard component of TA correlations as a function of
p-p collision multiplicity. The agreement between QCD predictions and TA
correlation data is quantitative, confirming a dijet interpretation for the TCM
hard component. The TA azimuth dependence is inconsistent with conventional UE
assumptions.
