The possibility of a modification of special relativity with an invariant
energy scale playing the role of a minimum energy is explored. Consistency with
the equivalence of different inertial frames is obtained by an appropriate
choice of a non-linear action of the Lorentz group on momentum space. Limits on
the low energy cutoff from tests of Einstein's theory and possible ways to
measure the new energy scale are discussed.
