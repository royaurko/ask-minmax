We characterize a cosmic rest frame in which the variation of the spherically
averaged Hubble expansion is most uniform, under local Lorentz boosts of the
central observer. Using the COMPOSITE sample of 4534 galaxies, we identify a
degenerate set of candidate minimum variance frames, which includes the rest
frame of the Local Group (LG) of galaxies, but excludes the standard Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) frame. Candidate rest frames defined by a boost from
the LG frame close to the plane of the galaxy have a statistical likelihood
similar to the LG frame. This may result from a lack of constraining data in
the Zone of Avoidance in the COMPOSITE sample. We extend our analysis to the
Cosmicflows-2 (CF2) sample of 8,162 galaxies. While the signature of a
systematic boost offset between the CMB and LG frames averages is still
detected, the spherically averaged expansion variance in all rest frames is
significantly larger in the CF2 sample than would be reasonably expected. We
trace this to the CF2 distances being reported without a correction for
inhomogeneous distribution Malmquist bias. Systematic differences in the
inclusion of the large SFI++ subsample into the COMPOSITE and CF2 catalogues
are analysed. Our results highlight the importance of a careful treatment of
Malmquist biases for future peculiar velocities studies, including tests of the
hypothesis of Wiltshire et al [arXiv:1201.5371] that a significant fraction of
the CMB temperature dipole may be nonkinematic in origin.
