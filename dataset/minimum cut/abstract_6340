We study degeneracies between cosmological parameters and measurement errors
from cosmic shear surveys using a principal component analysis of the Fisher
matrix. We simulate realistic survey topologies with non-uniform sky coverage,
and quantify the effect of survey geometry, depth and noise from intrinsic
galaxy ellipticities on the parameter errors. This analysis allows us to
optimise the survey geometry. Using the shear two-point correlation functions
and the aperture mass dispersion, we study various degeneracy directions in a
multi-dimensional parameter space spanned by Omega_m, Omega_Lambda, sigma_8,
the shape parameter Gamma, the spectral index n_s, along with parameters that
specify the distribution of source galaxies. If only three parameters are to be
obtained from weak lensing data, a single principal component is dominant and
contains all information about the main parameter degeneracies and their
errors. The variance of the dominant principal component of the Fisher matrix
shows a minimum for survey strategies which have small cosmic variance and
measure the shear correlation up to several degrees [abridged].
