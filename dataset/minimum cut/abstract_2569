Steganalysis means analysis of stego images. Like cryptanalysis, steganalysis
is used to detect messages often encrypted using secret key from stego images
produced by steganography techniques. Recently lots of new and improved
steganography techniques are developed and proposed by researchers which
require robust steganalysis techniques to detect the stego images having
minimum false alarm rate. This paper discusses about the different Steganalysis
techniques and help to understand how, where and when this techniques can be
used based on different situations.
