Ultrasound velocity measurements were performed on a single crystal of
spin-frustrated ferrite spinel ZnFe$_2$O$_4$ from 300 K down to 2 K. In this
cubic crystal, all the symmetrically-independent elastic moduli exhibit
softening with a characteristic minimum with decreasing temperature below
$\sim$100 K. This elastic anomaly suggests a coupling between dynamical lattice
deformations and molecular-spin excitations. In contrast, the elastic
anomalies, normally driven by the magnetostructural phase transition and its
precursor, are absent in ZnFe$_2$O$_4$, suggesting that the spin-lattice
coupling is mild to maintain the spin frustration without generating static
spin-lattice long-range order in the measured temperature range. The present
study infers that, for ZnFe$_2$O$_4$, the dynamical molecular-spin state
evolves at low temperatures without undergoing precursor spin-lattice
fluctuations and spin-lattice ordering, which is a behavior different from
another spin-frustrated molecular-spin system of chromite spinels
$A$Cr$_2$O$_4$ ($A$ = Mg and Zn). Moreover, our study also infers that, for
ZnFe$_2$O$_4$, the molecular-spin excitations consist of multiple gapped modes
and sensitively couple to the trigonal lattice deformations, which is a
behavior similar to $A$Cr$_2$O$_4$ although the details are different in
between ZnFe$_2$O$_4$ and $A$Cr$_2$O$_4$. It is expected that ZnFe$_2$O$_4$
provides the unique dynamical spin-lattice liquid-like system.
