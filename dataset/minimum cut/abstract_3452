We consider oblique incidence of (p)TM-polarized wave on the anisotropic
superconducting slab, immersed on a dielectric media, such that its uniaxial
(c) axis is perpendicular to the surfaces. The below and above plasma frequency
transmissivity patterns are studied and several of its properties determined,
within the context of the Maxwell-London theory. Below, the regime is
attenuated for any incident angle, and there is a transmissivity maximum, quite
pronounced in case of a very high external dielectric constant. Above, a
propagative regime exists where the superconductor is a natural optical
resonator, and we show here that the minimum of the transmission peaks are
modulated by an envelope function associated to the Brewster condition. We
propose this set-up to obtain light with an extremely small transverse
wavelength inside the superconductor.
