The circle compactification of the 6-dim (2,0) superconformal theory of
$A_{N-1}$ type leads the 5-dim SU(N) maximally supersymmetric gauge theory.
Instanton solitons embody Kaluza-Klein modes and are conjectured to be composed
of partonic constituents. We realize such a parton of 1/N instanton topological
charge at the intersection of magnetic flux sheets. After a further
compactification with nontrivial Wilson line expectation value, instantons or
calorons have been shown to be split into fundamental monopoles of fractional
instanton charge. In the symmetric phase with trivial Wilson line expectation
value, BPS instanton partons emerge more concretely as nonabelian BPS monopoles
of minimum charge allowed in Dirac quantization.
