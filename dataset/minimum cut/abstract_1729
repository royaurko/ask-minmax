We reformulate the strong-interaction limit of electronic density functional
theory in terms of a classical problem with a degenerate minimum. This allows
us to clarify many aspects of this limit, and to write a general solution,
which is explicitly calculated for spherical densities. We then compare our
results with previous approximate solutions and discuss the implications for
density functional theory.
