The paper aims to introduce a new symmetry principle in the space-time
geometry through the elimination of the classical idea of rest and by including
a universal minimum limit of speed in the subatomic world. Such a limit,
unattainable by particles, represents a preferred reference frame associated
with a universal background field that breaks Lorentz symmetry. Thus the
structure of space-time is extended due to the presence of a vacuum energy
density, which leads to a negative pressure at cosmological scales. The tiny
values of the cosmological constant and the vacuum energy density shall be
successfully obtained, being in good agreement with current observational
results.
