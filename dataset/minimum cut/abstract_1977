We predict theoretically the nondiffractive propagation of sonic waves in
periodic acoustic media (sonic crystals), by expansion into a set of plane
waves (Bloch mode expansion), and by finite difference time domain calculations
of finite beams. We also give analytical evaluations of the parameters for
nondiffractive propagation, as well as the minimum size of the nondiffractively
propagating acoustic beams.
