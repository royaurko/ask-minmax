We show the existence of the local dimension of an invariant probability
measure on an infinitely generated self-affine set, for almost all
translations. This implies that an ergodic probability measure is exactly
dimensional. Furthermore the local dimension equals the minimum of the local
Lyapunov dimension and the dimension of the space. We also give an estimate,
that holds for all translation vectors, with only assuming the affine maps to
be contractive.
