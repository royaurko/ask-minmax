It has been recently pointed out by Mithani-Vilenkin that certain emergent
universe scenarios which are classically stable are nevertheless unstable
semiclassically to collapse. Here, we show that there is a class of emergent
universes derived from scale invariant two measures theories with spontaneous
symmetry breaking (s.s.b) of the scale invariance, which can have both
classical stability and do not suffer the instability pointed out by
Mithani-Vilenkin towards collapse. We find that this stability is due to the
presence of a symmetry in the "emergent phase", which together with the non
linearities of the theory, does not allow that the FLRW scale factor to be
smaller that a certain minimum value $a_0$ in a certain protected region.
