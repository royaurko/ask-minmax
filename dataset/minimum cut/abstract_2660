In this paper, we construct a complete set of primitive orthogonal
idempotents for any finite Brandt semigroup algebra. As applications, we define
a new class of codes called Brandt semigroup codes and compute the Cartan
matrices of some Brandt semigroup algebras. We also study the supports, Hamming
distances, and minimum weights of Brandt semigroup codes.
