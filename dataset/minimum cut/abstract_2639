We consider the question of determining the higher weights or the generalized
Hamming weights of affine Grassmann codes and their duals. Several initial as
well as terminal higher weights of affine Grassmann codes of an arbitrary level
are determined explicitly. In the case of duals of these codes, we give a
formula for many initial as well as terminal higher weights. As a special case,
we obtain an alternative simpler proof of the formula of Beelen et al for the
minimum distance of the dual of an affine Grasmann code.
