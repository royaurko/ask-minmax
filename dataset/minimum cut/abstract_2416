Given a set P of points in the plane, an Euclidean t-spanner for P is a
geometric graph that preserves the Euclidean distances between every pair of
points in P up to a constant factor t. The weight of a geometric graph refers
to the total length of its edges. In this paper we show that the problem of
deciding whether there exists an Euclidean t-spanner, for a given set of points
in the plane, of weight at most w is NP-hard for every real constant t > 1,
both whether planarity of the t-spanner is required or not.
