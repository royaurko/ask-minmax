Activity studies of solar-type stars, especially with reference to the status
of our current Sun among them, have exposed the importance of (1) homogeneously
selecting the sample stars and (2) reliably evaluating their activities down to
a considerably low level. Motivated by these requirements, we conducted an
extensive study on the activities of 118 solar-analog stars (of sufficiently
similar properties to each other) by measuring the emission strength at the
core of Ca II 3933.663 line (K line) on the high-dispersion spectrogram
obtained by Subaru/HDS, where special attention was paid to correctly detecting
the chromospheric emission by removing the wing-fitted photospheric profile
calculated from the classical solar model atmosphere. This enabled us to detect
low-level activities down to log R' ~ -5.4 (R' is the ratio of the
chromospheric core emission flux to the total bolometric flux), by which we
could detect subtle activity differences which were indiscernible in previous
studies. Regarding the Sun, we found log R'sun = -5.33 near to the low end of
the distribution, which means that it belongs to the distinctly low activity
group among solar analogs. This excludes the once-suggested possibility for the
high frequency of Maunder-minimum stars showing appreciably lower activities
than the minimum-Sun.
