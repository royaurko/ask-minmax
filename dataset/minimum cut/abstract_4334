We study the minimum-energy configuration of a d-dimensional elastic
interface in a random potential tied to a harmonic spring. As a function of the
spring position, the center of mass of the interface changes in discrete jumps,
also called shocks or "static avalanches''. We obtain analytically the
distribution of avalanche sizes and its cumulants within an epsilon=4-d
expansion from a tree and 1-loop resummation, using functional renormalization.
This is compared with exact numerical minimizations of interface energies for
random field disorder in d=2,3. Connections to the Burgers equation and to
dynamic avalanches are discussed.
