It is shown that tunnelling splittings in ergodic double wells and resonant
widths in ergodic metastable wells can be approximated as easily-calculated
matrix elements involving the wavefunction in the neighbourhood of a certain
real orbit. This orbit is a continuation of the complex orbit which crosses the
barrier with minimum imaginary action. The matrix element is computed by
integrating across the orbit in a surface of section representation, and uses
only the wavefunction in the allowed region and the stability properties of the
orbit. When the real orbit is periodic, the matrix element is a natural measure
of the degree of scarring of the wavefunction. This scarring measure is
canonically invariant and independent of the choice of surface of section,
within semiclassical error. The result can alternatively be interpretated as
the autocorrelation function of the state with respect to a transfer operator
which quantises a certain complex surface of section mapping. The formula
provides an efficient numerical method to compute tunnelling rates while
avoiding the need for the exceedingly precise diagonalisation endemic to
numerical tunnelling calculations.
