The interferometric analysis of meson correlations provides a measure of the
average phase space density of the mesons in the final state. This quantity is
a useful indicator of the statistical properties of the system, and it can be
extracted with a minimum of model assumptions. Values obtained from recent
measurements are consistent with the thermal value, but do not rule out
superradiance effects.
