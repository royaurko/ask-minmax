We present results from our phase-resolved spectroscopy of the newly
identified cataclysmic variable Halpha0242-2802. Halpha0242-2802 was identified
from a deep UK Schmidt Halpha-R band survey as a candidate cataclysmic
variable. Although initial spectroscopy revealed an optical spectrum very
similar to that of the famous short orbital period system WZ Sge, the analysis
of our data shows that this is not the case. Halpha0242-28 differs from WZ Sge
in both the accretion disk structure and the orbital period. In particular,
Halpha0242-28 appears to be a system which has not reached the orbital period
minimum, yet.
