Considering that a position measurement can effectively involve a
momentum-dependent shift and rescaling of the "true" space-time coordinates, we
construct a set of effective space-time coordinates which are naturally
non-commutative. They lead to a minimum length and are shown to be related to
Snyder's coordinates and the five-dimensional formulation of Deformed Special
Relativity. This effective approach then provides a natural physical
interpretation for both the extra fifth dimension and the deformed momenta
appearing in this context.
