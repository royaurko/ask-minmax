We redefine the surface tension coefficient and the symmetry energy for an
asymmetric nuclear Fermi-liquid drop with a finite diffuse layer. Considering
two-component charged Fermi-liquid drop and following Gibbs-Tolman concept, we
introduce the equimolar radius $R_{e}$ of sharp surface droplet at which the
surface tension is applied and the radius of tension surface $R_{s}$ (Laplace
radius) which provides the minimum of the surface tension coefficient $\sigma$.
We have shown that the nuclear Tolman length $\xi$ is negative and the modulus
of $\xi$ growth quadratically with asymmetry parameter $X=(N-Z)/(N+Z)$.
