We investigate the properties of rigid polyelectrolyte solutions in presence
of monovalent salt. The free energy within the Debye-H\"uckel-Bjerrum (DHBj)
theory [M. E.
  Fisher and Y. Levin, {\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} 71, 3826 (1993)] is constructed.
It is found that at thermodynamic equilibrium the polyelectrolyte solution
consists of clusters composed of one polyion and various counterions. The
distribution of the cluster densities is determined by finding the minimum of
the Helmholtz free energy. The osmotic pressure and the average charge of the
cluster are found and their dependence on Manning parameter $\xi$ is
elucidated. A good agreement with the experimental results is obtained.
