We evidence a Kovacs-like memory effect in a uniformly driven granular gas. A
system of inelastic hard particles, in the low density limit, can reach a
non-equilibrium steady state when properly forced. By following a certain
protocol for the drive time dependence, we prepare the gas in a state where the
granular temperature coincides with its long time value. The temperature
subsequently does not remain constant, but exhibits a non-monotonic evolution
with either a maximum or a minimum, depending on the dissipation, and on the
protocol. We present a theoretical analysis of this memory effect, at
Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation level, and show that when dissipation exceeds
a threshold, the response can be coined anomalous. We find an excellent
agreement between the analytical predictions and direct Monte Carlo
simulations.
