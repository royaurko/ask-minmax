We extend the theory of matrix completion to the case where we make Poisson
observations for a subset of entries of a low-rank matrix. We consider the
(now) usual matrix recovery formulation through maximum likelihood with proper
constraints on the matrix $M$, and establish theoretical upper and lower bounds
on the recovery error. Our bounds are nearly optimal up to a factor on the
order of $\mathcal{O}(\log(d_1 d_2))$. These bounds are obtained by adapting
the arguments used for one-bit matrix completion \cite{davenport20121}
(although these two problems are different in nature) and the adaptation
requires new techniques exploiting properties of the Poisson likelihood
function and tackling the difficulties posed by the locally sub-Gaussian
characteristic of the Poisson distribution. Our results highlight a few
important distinctions of Poisson matrix completion compared to the prior work
in matrix completion including having to impose a minimum signal-to-noise
requirement on each observed entry. We also develop an efficient iterative
algorithm and demonstrate its good performance in recovering solar flare
images.
