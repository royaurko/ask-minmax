Transverse momentum spectra of identified $\pi^{+}$, $\pi^{-}$, $K^{+}$,
$K^{-}$, p and $\overline{p}$ were measured by the PHENIX experiment at
mid-rapidity in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=130$ GeV over a broad
momentum range. Inverse slope parameters and mean $p_{t}$ were measured in
minimum bias events and as a function of the number of participating nucleons.
The mass and centrality dependence of the inverse slope parameters and mean
$p_{t}$ is presented and discussed.
