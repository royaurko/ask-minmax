DNA-coated colloids are a popular model system for self-assembly through
tunable interactions. The DNA-encoded linkages between particles theoretically
allow for very high specificity, but generally no directionality or long-range
interactions. We introduce a two-dimensional lattice model for particles of
many different types with short-range isotropic interactions that are pairwise
specific. For this class of models, we address the fundamental question whether
it is possible to reliably design the interactions so that the ground state is
unique and corresponds to a given crystal structure. First, we determine lower
limits for the interaction range between particles, depending on the complexity
of the desired pattern and the underlying lattice. Then, we introduce a
`recipe' for determining the pairwise interactions that exactly satisfies this
minimum criterion, and we show that it is sufficient to uniquely determine the
ground state for a large class of crystal structures. Finally, we verify these
results using Monte Carlo simulations.
