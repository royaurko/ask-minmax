This paper proposes a greedy algorithm named as Big step greedy set cover
algorithm to compute approximate minimum set cover. The Big step greedy
algorithm, in each step selects p sets such that the union of selected p sets
contains greatest number of uncovered elements and adds the selected p sets to
partial set cover. The process of adding p sets is repeated until all the
elements are covered. When p=1 it behaves like the classical greedy algorithm.
