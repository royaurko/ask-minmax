The minimum Renyi and Wehrl output entropies are found for bosonic channels
in which the signal photons are either randomly displaced by a Gaussian
distribution (classical-noise channel), or in which they are coupled to a
thermal environment through lossy propagation (thermal-noise channel). It is
shown that the Renyi output entropies of integer orders z>1 and the output
Wehrl entropy are minimized when the channel input is a coherent state.
