We have investigated planar metal - insulator - metal tunnel junctions with
aluminum oxide as dielectricum. These oxide barriers were grown on an aluminum
electrode in pure oxygen at room temperature till saturation. We observed
discrete barrier widths separated by \Delta s \approx 0.38 nm, corresponding to
the addition of one layer of oxygen atoms. The minimum thickness of s_0 \approx
0.54 nm is due to a double layer of oxygen. We found a strong and systematic
dependence of the barrier height \Phi_0 on the thickness s like \Phi_0 \approx
2.5 eV / s^2(nm), which nearly coincides with the kinetic electron energy E =
h^2/2ms^2 for which the deBroglie wavelength matches the width of the barrier.
