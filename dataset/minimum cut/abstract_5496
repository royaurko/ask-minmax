We consider the collider signals of spin-one resonances present in
full-hierarchy quiver theories of electroweak symmetry breaking. These
four-dimensional theories result from the deconstruction of warped extra
dimensional models and have very distinct phenomenological features when the
number of sites is small. We study a class of generic scenarios in these
theories where the color gauge group as well as the electroweak sector,
propagate in the quiver diagram. These scenarios correspond to various specific
models of electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion masses. We focus on the
minimum resonant content and its main features: the presence of heavy and
narrow spin one resonances. We derive bounds from the LHC data on the
color-octet and color-singlet excited gauge bosons from their decays to jets
and top pairs, and show their dependence on the number of sites in the quiver.
We also compare them with the bounds derived from flavor violation.
