It is shown that the residue code of a self-dual $\mathbb{Z}_4$-code of
length $24k$ (resp.\ $24k+8$) and minimum Lee weight $8k+4 \text{ or }8k+2$
(resp.\ $8k+8 \text{ or }8k+6$) is a binary extremal doubly even self-dual code
for every positive integer $k$. A number of new self-dual $\mathbb{Z}_4$-codes
of length $24$ and minimum Lee weight $10$ are constructed using the above
characterization. These codes are Type I $\mathbb{Z}_4$-codes having the
largest minimum Lee weight and the largest Euclidean weight among all Type I
$\mathbb{Z}_4$-codes of that length. In addition, new extremal Type II
$\mathbb{Z}_4$-codes of length $56$ are found.
