A general approach for deriving the expression of reference distribution
functions by statistical thermodynamics is illustrated, and applied to the case
of a magnetically confined plasma. The local equilibrium is defined by imposing
the minimum entropy production, which applies only to the linear regime near a
stationary thermodynamically non-equilibrium state and the maximum entropy
principle under the scale invariance restrictions. This procedure may be
adopted for a system subject to an arbitrary number of thermodynamic forces,
however, for concreteness, we analyze, afterwords, a magnetically confined
plasma subject to three thermodynamic forces, and three energy sources: i) the
total Ohmic heat, supplied by the transformer coil, ii) the energy supplied by
Neutral Beam Injection (NBI), and iii) the RF energy supplied by Ion Cyclotron
Resonant Heating (ICRH) system which heats the minority population. In this
limit case, we show that the derived expression of the distribution function is
more general than that one, which is currently used for fitting the numerical
steady-state solutions obtained by simulating the plasma by gyro-kinetic codes.
An application to a simple model of fully ionized plasmas submitted to an
external source is discussed. Through kinetic theory, we fixed the values of
the free parameters linking them with the external power supplies. The
singularity at low energy in the proposed distribution function is related to
the intermittency in the turbulent plasma.
