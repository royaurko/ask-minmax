We have previously reported on the construction and successful operation of
the novel double phase Liquid Argon Large Electron Multiplier Time Projection
Chamber (LAr LEM-TPC). This detector concept provides a 3D-tracking and
calorimetric device capable of adjustable charge amplification, a promising
readout technology for next-generation neutrino detectors and direct Dark
Matter searches. In this paper, we report on the first operation of a LAr
LEM-TPC prototype - with an active area of 10$\times$10 cm$^2$ and 21 cm drift
length - equipped with a single 1 mm thick LEM amplifying stage and a two
dimensional projective readout anode. Cosmic muon events were collected, fully
reconstructed and used to characterize the performance of the chamber. The
obtained signals provide images of very high quality and the energy loss
distributions of minimum ionizing tracks give a direct estimate of the
amplification. We find that a stable gain of 27 can be achieved with this
detector configuration corresponding to a signal-over-noise ratio larger than
200 for minimum ionizing tracks. The decoupling of the amplification stage and
the use of the 2D readout anode offer several advantages which are described in
the text.
