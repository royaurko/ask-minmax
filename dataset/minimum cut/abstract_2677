According to Landauer's principle, a minimum amount of energy proportional to
temperature must be dissipated during the erasure of a classical bit of
information compensating the entropy loss, thereby linking the information and
thermodynamics. Here we show that the Landauer limit of energy dissipation is
achievable in a shape-anisotropic single-domain magnetostrictive nanomagnet
having two mutually anti-parallel degenerate magnetization states that store a
bit of information. We model the magnetization dynamics using stochastic
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the presence of thermal fluctuations and
show that on average the Landauer bound is satisfied, i.e., it accords to the
generalized Landauer's principle for small systems with stochastic
fluctuations.
