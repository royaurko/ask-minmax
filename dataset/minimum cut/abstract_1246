We study the critical temperature T_c of SFF trilayers (S is a singlet
superconductor, F is a ferromagnetic metal), where the long-range triplet
superconducting component is generated at noncollinear magnetizations of the F
layers. We demonstrate that T_c can be a nonmonotonic function of the angle
\alpha between the magnetizations of the two F layers. The minimum is achieved
at an intermediate \alpha, lying between the parallel (P, \alpha=0) and
antiparallel (AP, \alpha=\pi) cases. This implies a possibility of a "triplet"
spin-valve effect: at temperatures above the minimum T_c^{Tr} but below T_c^{P}
and T_c^{AP}, the system is superconducting only in the vicinity of the
collinear orientations. At certain parameters, we predict a reentrant
T_c(\alpha) behavior. At the same time, considering only the P and AP
orientations, we find that both the "standard" (T_c^{P} < T_c^{AP}) and
"inverse" (T_c^{P} > T_c^{AP}) switching effects are possible depending on
parameters of the system.
