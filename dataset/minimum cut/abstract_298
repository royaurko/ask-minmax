A detailed description of the activation-relaxation technique (ART) is
presented. This method defines events in the configurational energy landscape
of disordered materials, such as a-Si, glasses and polymers, in a two-step
process: first, a configuration is activated from a local minimum to a nearby
saddle-point; next, the configuration is relaxed to a new minimum; this allows
for jumps over energy barriers much higher than what can be reached with
standard techniques. Such events can serve as basic steps in equilibrium and
kinetic Monte Carlo schemes.
