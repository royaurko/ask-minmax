This study reveals that, in strong coulomb coupling regime, bending a
straight and fully overcharged DNA (up to its maximal acceptance by multivalent
counterions) to a circle releases some of the adsorbed (correlated)counterions
but still remains fully overcharged. This phenomenon seems to be inherent to
the minimum energy state of a DNA. By definition, the total electrostatic
potential energy of a macroion-counterion system reaches to its lowest point at
maximal acceptance of overcharging counterions that ensures the most stable
conformation. This intermediate phenomenon of release of cations from DNA
surface due to bending can be taken into account in theoretical modeling of
some ionic concentration dependent physico-chemical aspects of DNA solutions in
strong Coulomb coupling regimes.
