We present recent results on Minimum Bias, MPI and DPS, Diffractive and
Exclusive studies using data collected during Run 1 of the LHC. The
measurements include data collected in pp collisions at $\sqrt s = 7$, and $8$
TeV by the CMS Collaboration. Double parton scattering is investigated in
several final states including vector bosons and jets, and the effective cross
section results are compared to other experiments and to MPI models tuned to
recent underlying event measurements at CMS. Inclusive diffractive cross
sections are discussed and compared to models, while searches and measurements
of central exclusive processes are presented. The results from the first
combined measurement by the CMS+TOTEM collaborations of the pseudorapidity
distribution of charged particles at 8 TeV are also discussed, and are compared
to models and to lower energy measurements.
