We study the Casimir effect for scalar fields with general curvature coupling
subject to mixed boundary conditions $(1+\beta_{m}n^{\mu}\partial_{\mu})\phi
=0$ at $x=a_{m}$ on one ($m=1$) and two ($m=1,2$) parallel plates at a distance
$a\equiv a_{2}-a_{1}$ from each other. Making use of the generalized Abel-Plana
formula previously established by one of the contributors \cite{Sahrev}, the Casimir
energy densities are obtained as functions of $\beta_{1}$ and of
$\beta_{1}$,$\beta_{2}$,$a$, respectively. In the case of two parallel plates,
a decomposition of the total Casimir energy into volumic and superficial
contributions is provided. The possibility of finding a vanishing energy for
particular parameter choices is shown, and the existence of a minimum to the
surface part is also observed. We show that there is a region in the space of
parameters defining the boundary conditions in which the Casimir forces are
repulsive for small distances and attractive for large distances. This yields
to an interesting possibility for stabilizing the distance between the plates
by using the vacuum forces.
