After recalling the definition of codes as modules over skew polynomial
rings, whose multiplication is defined by using an automorphism and a
derivation, and some basic facts about them, in the first part of this paper we
study some of their main algebraic and geometric properties. Finally, for
module skew codes constructed only with an automorphism, we give some BCH type
lower bounds for their minimum distance.
