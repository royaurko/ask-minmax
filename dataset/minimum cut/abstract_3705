Cluster analysis often serves as the initial step in the process of data
classification. In this paper, the problem of clustering different length input
data is considered. The edit distance as the minimum number of elementary edit
operations needed to transform one vector into another is used. A heuristic for
clustering unequal length vectors, analogue to the well known k-means algorithm
is described and analyzed. This heuristic determines cluster centroids
expanding shorter vectors to the lengths of the longest ones in each cluster in
a specific way. It is shown that the time and space complexities of the
heuristic are linear in the number of input vectors. Experimental results on
real data originating from a system for classification of Web attacks are
given.
