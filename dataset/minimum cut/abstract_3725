The spin-free binary-inspiral parameter-space introduced by Tanaka and
Tagoshi to construct a uniformly-spaced lattice of templates at (and possibly
beyond) $2.5PN$ order is shown to work for all first generation interferometric
gravitational wave antennas. This allows to extend the minimum-redundant
cardinal interpolation techniques of the correlator bank developed by the
Authors to the highest available order PN templates. The total number of 2PN
templates to be computed for a minimal match $\Gamma=0.97$ is reduced by a
factor 4, as in the 1PN case.
