We study the dispersion relation for scalar excitations in supersymmetric,
non-commutative theories at finite temperature. In N=4 Yang-Mills the low
momenta modes have superluminous group velocity. In the massless Wess-Zumino
model the minimum of the dispersion relation is at non zero momentum for
temperatures above T_0 ~ (g \theta)^(-1\2). We briefly comment on N=2
Yang-Mills at finite density.
