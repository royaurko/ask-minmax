Parallel replica dynamics is a method for accelerating the computation of
processes characterized by a sequence of infrequent events. In this work, the
processes are governed by the overdamped Langevin equation. Such processes
spend much of their time about the minima of the underlying potential,
occasionally transitioning into different basins of attraction. The essential
idea of parallel replica dynamics is that the exit time distribution from a
given well for a single process can be approximated by the minimum of the exit
time distributions of $N$ independent identical processes, each run for only
1/N-th the amount of time.
  While promising, this leads to a series of numerical analysis questions about
the accuracy of the exit distributions. Building upon the recent work in Le
Bris et al., we prove a unified error estimate on the exit distributions of the
algorithm against an unaccelerated process. Furthermore, we study a dephasing
mechanism, and prove that it will successfully complete.
