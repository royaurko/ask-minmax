We report on experiments on an evanescent-wave mirror for cold $^{87}$Rb
atoms. Measurements of the bouncing fraction show the importance of the Van der
Waals attraction to the surface. We have directly observed radiation pressure
parallel to the surface, exerted on the atoms by the evanescent-wave mirror. We
analyze the radiation pressure by imaging the motion of the atom cloud after
the bounce. The number of photon recoils ranges from 2 to 31. This is
independent of laser power, inversely proportional to the detuning and
proportional to the evanescent-wave decay length. By operating the mirror on an
open transition, we have also observed atoms that bounce inelastically due to a
spontaneous Raman transition. The observed distributions consist of a dense
peak at the minimum velocity and a long tail of faster atoms, showing that the
transition is a stochastic process with a strong preference to occur near the
turning point of the bounce.
