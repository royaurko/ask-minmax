We present a procedure for computing the log-canonical threshold of an
arbitrary ideal generated by binomials and monomials.
  The computation of the log canonical threshold is reduced to the problem of
computing the minimum of a function, which is defined in terms of the
generators of the ideal. The minimum of this function is attained at some ray
of a fan which only depends on the exponents of the monomials appearing in the
generators of the ideal.
