In a hydrodynamic Taylor-Couette system a rotation law with positive shear
('super-rotation') is linearly stable for all Reynolds numbers. It is also
known that a conducting fluid under the presence of a sufficiently strong axial
electric current becomes unstable against nonaxisymmetric disturbances. It is
thus suggestive that a super-rotation law may stabilize the rotating pinch. But
for magnetic Prandtl number Pm $\neq 1$ and for small magnetic Mach numbers of
rotation also super-rotation supports the instability. For steeper and steeper
rotation profiles the critical Hartmann numbers converge to a finite minimum
value which for Pm $\gg 1$ or Pm $\ll 1$ looses its dependence on Pm. For
super-rotation and for rigid rotation the sign of the azimuthal drift of the
nonaxisymmetric hydromagnetic instability pattern strongly depends on the
magnetic Prandtl number. The pattern corotates with the flow for Pm $\geq 1$
and it counterrotates for Pm $\ll 1$ so that a critical Pm exists (between 0.1
and 1) with solutions even resting in the laboratory system. On the other hand,
for sub-rotation the instability pattern for all Pm migrates in the direction
of the basic rotation. -- An electric current of (only) 3.6 kAmp suffices to
realize the subcritical excitation for super-rotation in the laboratory using
liquid sodium as the conducting fluid between the rotating cylinders.
