We present a detailed analysis of a class of extensions to the SM Gauge
chiral symmetry $SU(3)_{C}\times SU(3)_{L}\times U(1)_{X}$ (331 model), where
the neutrino electroweak interaction with matter via charged and neutral
current is modified through new gauge bosons of the model. We found the
connections between the non-standard contributions on 331 model with
non-standard interactions. Through limits of such interactions in cross section
experiments we constrained the parameters of the model, obtaining that the new
energy scale of this theory should obey $V>1.3$ TeV and the new bosons of the
model must have masses greater than 610 GeV.
