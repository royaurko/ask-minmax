The Ulysses spacecraft, launched in October 1990, orbits the Sun on a polar
trajectory. The spacecraft is equipped with a highly sensitive impact-
ionization dust detector which can in situ measure cosmic dust grains in the
mass range 10^-9 to 10^-19 kg. With the Ulysses dust detector dust streams
originating from Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io have been discovered as
well as interstellar dust particles sweeping through the solar system. The
distribution of interplanetary dust grains has been measured at high ecliptic
latitudes with Ulysses for the first time. The Ulysses measurements of
interplanetary dust, dust grains interacting electromagnetically with the
magnetosphere of Jupiter and measurements of interstellar dust in the solar
system are reviewed.
