We solve a long-standing problem in particle physics: that of deriving the
Deep Inelastic structure functions of the proton from the fundamental theory of
strong interactions, Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD). In the Bjorken limit, the
momenta of the constituents of the proton (the partons) can be assumed to be in
a two-dimensional plane in Minkowski space: a dimensional reduction of QCD to
two space-time dimensions. Two dimensional QCD is then shown to be equivalent
for all energies and values of number of colors \m{N} to a new theory of
hadrons, Quantum HadronDynamics (QHD). The phase space of QHD is the
Grassmannian (set of subspaces) of the complex Hilbert space L^2(R). The
natural symplectic form along with a hamiltonian define a classical dynamical
system, which is equivalent to the large N limit of QCD. 't Hooft's planar
limit is the linear approximation to our theory: we recover his integral
equation for the meson spectrum but also all the interactions of the mesons.
The Grassmannian is a union of connected components labelled by an integer (the
renormalized dimension of the subspace) which has the physical meaning of
baryon number. The proton is the topological soliton: the minimum of the energy
in the sector with baryon number one gives the structure functions of the
proton. We solve the resulting integral equations numerically; the agreement
with experimental data is quite good for values of the Bjorken variable x>0.2.
