A conjecture of Carsten Thomassen states that every 4-connected line graph is
hamiltonian. It is known that the conjecture is true for 7-connected line
graphs. We improve this by showing that any 5-connected line graph of minimum
degree at least 6 is hamiltonian. The result extends to claw-free graphs and to
Hamilton-connectedness.
