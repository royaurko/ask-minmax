We explore how nuclear modifications to the nucleon parton distributions
affect production of high transverse momentum hadrons in deuteron-nucleus
collisions. We calculate the charged hadron spectra to leading order using
standard fragmentation functions and shadowing parameterizations. We obtain the
d+Au to pp ratio both in minimum bias collisions and as a function of
centrality. The minimum bias results agree reasonably well with the BRAHMS data
while the calculated centrality dependence underestimates the data and is a
stronger function of p_T than the data indicate.
