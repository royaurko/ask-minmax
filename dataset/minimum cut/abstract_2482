A finite-energy sum-rule is presented that allows for the use of combinations
of both positive- and inverse-moment integration kernels. The freedom afforded
from being able to employ this large class of integration kernels in our
sum-rule is then exploited to obtain the values of the charm and bottom masses
with minimum total uncertainty. We obtain as our final results m_c(3
GeV)=986(13) MeV and m_b(10 GeV)=3617(25) MeV, which are amongst the most
precise values of these parameters obtained by any method.
