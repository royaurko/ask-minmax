The metric dimension of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of vertices in a
subset $S$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that all other vertices are uniquely
determined by their distances to the vertices in $S$. In this paper we
investigate the metric dimension of the random graph $G(n,p)$ for a wide range
of probabilities $p=p(n)$.
