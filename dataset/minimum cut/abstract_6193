We present initial results of our analysis of line emission produced in gas
disks found at the centers of a sample of nearby, radio galaxies with radio
jets. We obtained data using STIS (The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph) at
three parallel slit positions on the nucleus of each galaxy. This allows us to
map the H$\alpha$ + [NII] flux, the gas radial velocity and the velocity
dispersion. We find evidence of rotating disks in 11 of the sample galaxies and
we can not currently rule out a rotating disk model for the remaining eight.
For rotating systems, we find that the minimum central enclosed mass is greater
than or similar to the predicted black hole mass based on ground-based stellar
velocity dispersions. By modeling the gas dynamics we will go on to constrain
the masses of the black holes. We will also investigate the properties of the
gas disks themselves, giving us an insight into fueling, ionization mechanisms
and the structure of the central regions.
