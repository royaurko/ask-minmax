The acyclic chromatic number of a directed graph $D$, denoted $\chi_A(D)$, is
the minimum positive integer $k$ such that there exists a decomposition of the
vertices of $D$ into $k$ disjoint sets, each of which induces an acyclic
subgraph. For any $m \geq 1$, we introduce a generalization of the acyclic
chromatic number, namely $\chi_m(D)$, which is the minimum number of sets into
which the vertices of a digraph can be partitioned so that each set is weakly
$m$-degenerate. We show that for all digraphs $D$ without directed 2-cycles,
$\chi_m(D) \leq \frac{4\bar{\Delta}(D)}{4m+1} + o(\bar{\Delta}(D))$. Because
$\chi_1(D) = \chi_A(D)$, we obtain as a corollary that $\chi_A(D) \leq
\frac{4}{5} \cdot \bar{\Delta}(D) + o(\bar{\Delta}(D))$, significantly
improving a bound of Harutyunyan and Mohar.
