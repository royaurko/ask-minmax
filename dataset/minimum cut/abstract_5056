For charged systems in heterogeneous dielectric media, a key obstacle for
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is the need to solve the Poisson equation
in the media. This obstacle can be bypassed using MD methods that treat the
local polarization charge density as a dynamic variable, but such approaches
require access to a true free energy functional; one that evaluates to the
equilibrium electrostatic energy at its minimum. In this letter, we derive the
needed functional. As an application, we develop a Car-Parrinello MD method for
the simulation of free charges present near a spherical emulsion droplet
separating two immiscible liquids with different dielectric constants. Our
results show the presence of non-monotonic ionic profiles in the dielectric
with lower dielectric constant.
