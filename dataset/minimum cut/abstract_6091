Models of differentially rotating protoneutron stars are calculated, using
realistic equations of state of dense hot matter. Various conditions within the
stellar interior, corresponding to different stages of protoneutron star
evolution, are considered.
  Families of differentially rotating models of a given baryon mass are
calculated, using a two-parameter formula describing the angular velocity
profile within a rotating protoneutron star. Maximum angular momentum, which
can be accommodated by a protoneutron star is calculated, for various thermal
conditions in stellar interior, for a baryon mass of $1.5 M_\odot$. In the case
of a thermally homogeneous (isentropic or isothermal) neutrino-opaque interior
this maximum angular momentum turns out to be somewhat higher than that of a
cold neutron star of the same baryon mass, rotating uniformly at the mass
shedding angular velocity. However, if the protoneutron star has a thermal
structure characteristic of initial state, with a low entropy (unshocked) core,
and a high entropy (shocked) outer half of baryon mass, the maximum angular
momentum is significantly lower. This leads to a minimum period of uniform
rotation of cold neutron stars of baryon mass $\sim 1.5~M_\odot$, formed
directly (i.e. without a subsequent significant accretion of mass) from
protoneutron stars with shocked envelope, of about 1.7 ms and strengthens the
hypothesis that millisecond pulsars are accretion accelerated neutron stars.
