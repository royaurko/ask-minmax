We study the vertical structure of the transition layer between an accretion
disc and corona in the context of the existence of two-phase medium in
thermally unstable regions. The disc is illuminated by hard X-ray radiation and
satisfies the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium. We take into account the
energy exchange between hot corona ($\sim 10^8$ K) and cool disc ($\sim 10^4$
K) through the radiative processes and due to thermal conduction. We make local
stability analysis of the case with conductivity and we conclude that thermal
conduction does not suppress thermal instability. In spite of continuous
temperature profile $T(\tau)$ there are regions with strong temperature
gradient where spontaneous perturbations can lead to cloud condensation in the
transition layer. We determine the minimum size $\lambda_{TC}$ of such a
perturbation.
