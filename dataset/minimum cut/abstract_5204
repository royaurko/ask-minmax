A new method of symbolic analysis based on finite discretization of
velocity-curvature space is proposed. A minimum alphabet is introduced in a
natural way, and a number of initial analytic measures are defined that make it
possible to study the structure of discrete mapping dynamics. The proposed
method is tested by application to a system of two unidirectionally coupled
logistic maps. It is shown that this method can be used to reveal and study
changes in the structure of attractors. In the given example, features in the
attractor structure of the driven subsystem are studied upon its escape from
the identical synchronization regime.
