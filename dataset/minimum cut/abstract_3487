We present an experimental and theoretical study of the magnetic field
dependence of the critical current of Josephson junction ladders. At variance
with the well-known case of a one-dimensional (1D) parallel array of Josephson
junctions the magnetic field patterns display a single minimum even for very
low values of the self-inductance parameter $\beta_{\rm L}$. Experiments
performed changing both the geometrical value of the inductance and the
critical current of the junctions show a good agreement with numerical
simulations. We argue that the observed magnetic field patterns are due to a
peculiar mapping between the isotropic Josephson ladder and the 1D parallel
array with the self-inductance parameter $\beta_{\rm L}^{\rm eff}=\beta_{\rm
L}+2$.
