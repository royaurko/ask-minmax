In this paper, we generalize the fundamental relation between the derivative
of the mutual information and the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) to
multiuser setups. We prove that the derivative of the mutual information with
respect to the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is equal to the MMSE plus a
covariance induced due to the interference, quantified by a term with respect
to the cross correlation of the multiuser input estimates, the channels and the
precoding matrices. We also derive new relations for the gradient of the
conditional and non-conditional mutual information with respect to the MMSE.
Capitalizing on the new fundamental relations, we derive closed form
expressions of the mutual information for the multiuser channels, particularly
the two user multiple access Gaussian channel driven by binary phase shift
keying (BPSK) to illustrate and shed light on methods to derive similar
expressions for higher level constellations. We capitalize on the new unveiled
relation to derive the multiuser MMSE and mutual information in the low-SNR
regime.
