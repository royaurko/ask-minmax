The ELVIS instrument was recently proposed by the contributors for the Indian
Chandrayaan-1 mission to the Moon and is presently under consideration by the
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The scientific objective of ELVIS is
to explore the electromagnetic environment of the moon. ELVIS samples the full
three-dimensional (3D) electric field vector, E(x,t), up to 18 MHz, with
selective Nyqvist frequency bandwidths down to 5 kHz, and one component of the
magnetic field vector, B(x,t), from a few Hz up to 100 kHz.As a transient
detector, ELVIS is capable of detecting pulses with a minimum pulse width of 5
ns. The instrument comprises three orthogonal electric dipole antennas, one
magnetic search coil antenna and a four-channel digital sampling system,
utilising flexible digital down conversion and filtering together with
state-of-the-art onboard digital signal processing.
