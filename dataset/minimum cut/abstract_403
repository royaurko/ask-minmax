We present a new positive lower bound for the minimum value taken by a
polynomial P with integer coefficients in k variables over the standard simplex
of R^k, assuming that P is positive on the simplex. This bound depends only on
the number of variables, the degree and the bitsize of the coefficients of P
and improves all previous bounds for arbitrary polynomials which are positive
over the simplex.
