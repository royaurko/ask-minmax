Potentiality of the presence of wormholes in the outer/inner regions of the
halos of galaxies, situated on the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile
and Universal Rotation Curve (URC) dark matter models are investigated
recently. Since this covers our own galaxy also as a possible home for
wormholes it prompts us to further the subject by considering alternative
density distributions. From this token herein we make use of the Einasto model
to describe the density profiles for the same purpose. Our choice for the
latter is based on the fact that theoretical dark matter halos produced in
computer simulations are described best by such a profile. For technical
reasons we trim the number of parameters in the Einasto profile to a possible
minimum. Based an such a model it is shown that wormholes in the outer regions
of spiral galaxies are possible while the central regions prohibit such
formations.
