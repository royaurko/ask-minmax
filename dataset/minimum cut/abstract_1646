We report here the results of $^1$H NMR spin-lattice relaxation time (T$_1$)
studies in Glycine phosphite which is a ferroelectric below 224 K. The
experiments have been carried out in the temperature range from 200 K to 419 K
and at two Larmour frequencies of 11.40MHz and 23.56 MHz. We have noticed a
Larmour frequency dependence on the high temperature side of the T$_1$ minimum
>. A model is proposed based on the BPP theory to explain the observation.
