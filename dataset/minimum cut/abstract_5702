Fast ignition of inertial fusion targets driven by quasi-monoenergetic ion
beams is investigated by means of numerical simulations. Light and intermediate
ions such as lithium, carbon, aluminium and vanadium have been considered.
Simulations show that the minimum ignition energies of an ideal configuration
of compressed Deuterium-Tritium are almost independent on the ion atomic
number. However, they are obtained for increasing ion energies, which scale,
approximately, as Z^2, where Z is the ion atomic number. Assuming that the ion
beam can be focused into 10 {\mu}m spots, a new irradiation scheme is proposed
to reduce the ignition energies. The combination of intermediate Z ions, such
as 5.5 GeV vanadium, and the new irradiation scheme allows a reduction of the
number of ions required for ignition by, roughly, three orders of magnitude
when compared with the standard proton fast ignition scheme.
