We prove that topologically generic orbits of C0 transitive and non-uniquely
ergodic dynamical systems, exhibit an extremely oscillating asymptotical
statistics. Precisely, the minimum weak* compact set of invariant
probabilities, that describes the asymptotical statistics of each orbit of a
residual set, contains all the ergodic probabilities. If besides f is ergodic
with respect to the Lebesgue measure, then also Lebesgue-almost all the orbits
exhibit that kind of extremely oscillating statistics.
