We have investigated how the Coulomb blockade of a mesoscopic Josephson
junction in a high-impedance environment is suppressed by shot noise from an
adjacent junction. The presented theoretical analysis is an extension of the
phase correlation theory for the case of a non-Gaussian noise. Asymmetry of the
non-Gaussian noise should result in the shift of the conductance minimum from
zero voltage and the ratchet effect (nonzero current at zero voltage), which
have been experimentally observed. The analysis demonstrates that a Coulomb
blockaded tunnel junction in a high impedance environment can be used as an
effective noise detector.
