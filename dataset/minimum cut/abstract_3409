Editing of radio interferometer data, a process commonly known as
``flagging'', can be laborious and time-consuming. One quickly tends to flag
more data than actually required, sacrificing sensitivity and image fidelity in
the process. I describe a program, Pieflag, which can analyse radio
interferometer data to filter out measurements which are likely to be affected
by interference. Pieflag uses two algorithms to allow for data sets which are
either dominated by receiver noise or by source structure. Together, the
algorithms detect essentially all affected data whilst the amount of data which
is not affected by interference but falsely marked as such is kept to a
minimum. The sections marked by Pieflag are very similar to what would be
deemed affected by the observer in a visual inspection of the data. Pieflag
displays its results concisely and allows the user to add and remove flags
interactively. It is written in Python, is easy to install and use, and has a
variety of options to adjust its algorithms to a particular observing
situation. I describe how Pieflag works and illustrate its effect using data
from typical observations.
