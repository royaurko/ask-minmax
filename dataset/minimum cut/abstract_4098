A novel scheme is presented for production of a thin ($<1$ mm) uniform vapor
layer over a large surface area ($>100$ cm$^2$) by pulsed laser ablation of a
solid surface. Instead of dispersing the laser energy uniformly over the
surface, a modified Fabry-Perot interferometer is employed to concentrate the
laser energy in very narrow closely-spaced concentric rings. This approach may
be optimized to minimum total laser energy for the desired vapor density.
Furthermore, since the vapor is produced from a small fraction of the total
surface area, the local ablation depth is large, which minimized the fraction
of surface contamination in the vapor.
  Key words: laser evaporation, thin gas layer formation.
