Surface plasmon modes supported by graphene ribbon waveguides are studied and
classified. The properties of both modes with the field concentration within
the ribbon area (waveguiding modes) and on the edges (edge modes) are
discussed. The waveguide and edge modes are shown to be separated from each
other by a gap in wavenumbers. The even-parity hybridized edge mode results to
be the fundamental electromagnetic mode of the ribbon, possessing also the
lowest losses. All the plasmonic modes in the ribbons have an optimum
frequency, at which the absorption losses are minimum, due to competition
between the plasmon confinement and the frequency dependence of absorption in
graphene.
