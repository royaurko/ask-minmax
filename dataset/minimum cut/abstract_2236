The linear complexity (LC) of a sequence has been used as a convenient
measure of the randomness of a sequence. Based on the theories of linear
complexity, $k$-error linear complexity, the minimum error and the $k$-error
linear complexity profile, the notion of $m$-tight error linear complexity is
presented. An efficient algorithm for computing $m$-tight error linear
complexity is derived from the algorithm for computing $k$-error linear
complexity of sequences over GF($p^{m}$) with period $p^n$, where $p$ is a
prime. The validity of the algorithm is shown. The algorithm is also realized
with C language, and an example is presented to illustrate the algorithm.
