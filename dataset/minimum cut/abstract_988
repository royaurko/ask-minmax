Consider the length $L_{MM}^E$ of the minimum matching of N points in
d-dimensional Euclidean space. Using numerical simulations and the finite size
scaling law $< L_{MM}^E > = \beta_{MM}^E(d) N^{1-1/d}(1+A/N+... )$, we obtain
precise estimates of $\beta_{MM}^E(d)$ for $2 \le d \le 10$. We then consider
the approximation where distance correlations are neglected. This model is
solvable and gives at $d \ge 2$ an excellent ``random link'' approximation to
$\beta_{MM}^E(d)$. Incorporation of three-link correlations further improves
the accuracy, leading to a relative error of 0.4% at d=2 and 3. Finally, the
large d behavior of this expansion in link correlations is discussed.
