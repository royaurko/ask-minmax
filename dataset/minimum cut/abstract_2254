The best finite Fourier Series for a smooth surface $h(x,y)$ closest to the
positions of heads of amphiphiles in the least-square sense, agrees fully with
the Fourier coefficients obtained by a direct summation over raw data points.
Both metods produce structure factors $S(q)$ containing all necessary features:
small-q divergence, a minimum, the raise to the ubiquitous nearest neighbor
peak near $q=2\pi/$(coll.diameter) and further peaks. The Laurent series is
also discussed.
