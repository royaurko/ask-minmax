The problem of Josephson current through Coulomb-blocked nanoscale
superconductor-normal-superconductor structure with tunnel contacts is
reconsidered. Two different contributions to the phase-biased supercurrent are
identified, which are dominant in the limits of weak and strong Coulomb
interaction. Full expression for the free energy valid at arbitrary Coulomb
strength is found. The current derived from this free energy interpolates
between known results for weak and strong Coulomb interaction as phase bias
changes from 0 to pi. In the broad range of Coulomb strength the current-phase
relation is substantially non-sinusoidal and qualitatively different from the
case of semi-ballistic SNS junctions. Coulomb interaction leads to appearance
of a local minimum in the current at some intermediate value of phase
difference applied to the junction.
