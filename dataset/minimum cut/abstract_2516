We study a one-dimensional model of interacting bosons on a lattice with two
flat bands. Regular condensation is suppressed due to the absence of a well
defined minimum in the single particle spectrum. We find that interactions
stabilize a number of non-trivial phases like a pair (quasi-) condensate, a
supersolid at incommensurable fillings and valence bond crystals at
commensurability. We support our analytical calculations with numerical
simulations using the density matrix renormalization group technique.
Implications for cold-atoms and extensions to higher dimensions are discussed.
