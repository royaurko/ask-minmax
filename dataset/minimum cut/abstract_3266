FUSE spectra were obtained of the supersoft X-ray binary RX J0019.8+2156 (QR
And) during 16 consecutive spacecraft orbits, covering the binary orbit
(P=15.85 hr) with about 0.2 phase overlap. The spectrum is dominated by strong
H2 absorption (column density ~10**20 g/cm**2), which appears at a radial
velocity different from other interstellar absorption lines and may be
partially circumbinary. This absorption makes study of spectral features from
the binary system difficult. The only well-detected emission lines are He II,
1085A, and O VI, 1032A, (the other line of the O VI doublet, 1037A, is largely
obscured by strong H2 absorption). The O VI shows a P Cygni profile that varies
in velocity and strength with binary phase. We compare this with similar
changes seen in Balmer line profiles. We extract the FUV light curve and
compare it with the optical light curve. There is an eclipse in both wavelength
regions, but the FUV minimum lasts much longer, well beyond the visible light
egress. The FUV results are discussed in connection with the binary model and
mass flows within the system.
