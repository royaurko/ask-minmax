The PAMELA apparatus has been assembled and it is ready to be launched in a
satellite mission to study mainly the antiparticle component of cosmic rays. In
this paper the performances obtained for the silicon microstrip detectors used
in the magnetic spectrometer are presented. This subdetector reconstructs the
curvature of a charged particle in the magnetic field produced by a permanent
magnet and consequently determines momentum and charge sign, thanks to a very
good accuracy in the position measurements (better than 3 um in the bending
coordinate). A complete simulation of the silicon microstrip detectors has been
developed in order to investigate in great detail the sensor's characteristics.
Simulated events have been then compared with data gathered from minimum
ionizing particle (MIP) beams during the last years in order to tune free
parameters of the simulation. Finally some either widely used or original
position finding algorithms, designed for such kind of detectors, have been
applied to events with different incidence angles. As a result of the analysis,
a method of impact point reconstruction can be chosen, depending on both the
particle's incidence angle and the cluster multiplicity, so as to maximize the
capability of the spectrometer in antiparticle tagging.
