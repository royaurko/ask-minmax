The three-dimensional space distribution of 48921 quasars and 16113 Seyfert
galaxies with redshifts z <= 6 is investigated. The global anisotropy caused by
the shift of the observer place by \simeq 50 Mpc from a center of their
symmetry (supposed center of the Metagalaxy) to the side of the vector with
equatorial coordinates \alpha \simeq 13 degrees and \delta \simeq 70 degrees
has been found in the placement of these objects. In the opposite direction
there exists the extensive region where the progressive decrease of redshifts
up to a minimum (near \alpha \simeq 193 degrees, \delta \simeq -70 degrees) is
observed. The influence of gravitational potential and possible rotation of the
Metagalaxy on the anisotropy of redshifts of the cosmological objects has been
considered.
