We present our analysis of the multiwavelength photometric & spectroscopic
observations of GRB 060210 and discuss the results in the overall context of
current GRB models. All available optical data underwent a simultaneous
temporal fit, while X-ray and gamma-ray observations were analysed temporally &
spectrally. The results were compared to each other and to possible GRB models.
The X-ray afterglow is best described by a smoothly broken power-law with a
break at 7.4 hours. The late optical afterglow has a well constrained single
power-law index which has a value between the two X-ray indices, though it does
agree with a single power-law fit to the X-ray. An evolution of the hardness of
the high-energy emission is demonstrated and we imply a minimum host extinction
from a comparison of the extrapolated X-ray flux to that measured in the
optical. We find that the flaring gamma-ray and X-ray emission is likely due to
internal shocks while the flat optical light curve at that time is due to the
external shock. The late afterglow is best explained by a cooling break between
the optical and X-rays and continued central engine activity up to the time of
the break. The required collimation corrected energy of ~ 2x10^52 erg, while at
the high end of the known energy distribution, is not unprecedented.
