We show that supersymmetric gauge theories with a product gauge group admit
quasi-instantons, which, like instantons, sit at the absolute minimum of the
action in the corresponding topological sector. However, unlike ordinary
instantons which preserve part of the supersymmetry, these break all
supersymmetries of the action. We also provide a generalization where
quasi-instantons take value in the associated Lie algebra of the recently
proposed 3-algebras. When the structure constants and the metric of the algebra
are covariantly constant, the gauge bundle admits new topological sectors with
quasi-instantons at the minimum of the action.
