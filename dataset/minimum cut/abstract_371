Arrays of parallel metallic nanowires are shown to provide a tunable, robust,
and versatile platform for plasmon interconnects, including high-curvature
turns with minimum signal loss. The proposed guiding mechanism relies on gap
plasmons existing in the region between adjacent nanowires of dimers and
multi-wire arrays. We focus on square and circular silver nanowires in silica,
for which excellent agreement between both boundary element method and multiple
multipolar expansion calculations is obtained. Our work provides the tools for
designing plasmon-based interconnects and achieving high degree of integration
with minimum cross talk between adjacent plasmon guides.
