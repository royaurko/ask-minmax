We present radial velocity measurements of two stars observed as part of the
Lick Subgiants Planet Search and the Keck N2K survey. Variations in the radial
velocities of both stars reveal the presence of Jupiter-mass exoplanets in
highly eccentric orbits. HD 16175 is a G0 subgiant from the Lick Subgiants
Planet Search, orbited by a planet having a minimum mass of 4.4 M_Jup, in an
eccentric (e = 0.59), 2.71 yr orbit. HD 96167 is a G5 subgiant from the N2K
("Next 2000") program at Keck Observatory, orbited by a planet having a minimum
mass of 0.68 M_Jup, in an eccentric (e = 0.71), 1.366 yr orbit. Both stars are
relatively massive (M_star = 1.3 M_sun) and are very metal rich ([Fe/H] >
+0.3). We describe our methods for measuring the stars' radial velocity
variations and photometric stability.
