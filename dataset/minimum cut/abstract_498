The Euler characteristic can be defined as a special kind of valuation on
finite distributive lattices. This work begins with some brief consideration on
the role of the Euler characteristic on NM algebras, the algebraic counterpart
of Nilpotent Minimum logic. Then, we introduce a new valuation, a modified
version of the Euler characteristic we call idempotent Euler characteristic. We
show that the new valuation encodes information about the formul{\ae} in NM
propositional logic.
