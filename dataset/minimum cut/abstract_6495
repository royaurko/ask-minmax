Modular cosmology is plagued by overproduction of unwanted relics, gravitinos
and especially moduli, at relatively low energy scales. Thermal inflation
provides a compelling solution to this moduli problem, but invalidates most
baryogenesis scenarios. We propose a simple model in which the MSSM plus
neutrino mass term $(LH_u)^2$ is supplemented by a minimal flaton sector to
drive the thermal inflation, and make two crucial assumptions: the flaton
vacuum expectation value generates the $\mu$-term of the MSSM and $m_L^2 +
m_{H_u}^2 < 0$. The second assumption is particularly interesting in that it
violates a well known constraint, implying that there exists a nearby deep
non-MSSM vacuum, and provides a clear signature of our model which can be
tested at future particle accelerators. We show that our model leads to thermal
inflation followed by Affleck-Dine leptogenensis along the $LH_u$ flat
direction. A key feature of our leptogenesis scenario is that the $H_uH_d$ flat
direction is also induced to temporarily acquire a large value, playing a
crucial role in the leptogenesis, as well as dynamically shielding the field
configuration from the deep non-MSSM minimum, ensuring that the fields relax
into our MSSM vacuum.
