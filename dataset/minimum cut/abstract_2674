We consider the degree-diameter problem for undirected and directed circulant
graphs. To date, attempts to generate families of large circulant graphs of
arbitrary degree for a given diameter have been concentrated mainly on the
diameter 2 case. We give new constructions which improve the current best known
asymptotic orders for every diameter, and we present a revised table of largest
known circulant graphs of small degree and diameter. As an application, we show
how our constructions in the directed case can be used to obtain upper bounds
on the minimum size of a set $A\subseteq\mathbb{Z}_n$ such that the $k$-fold
sumset $kA$ is equal to $\mathbb{Z}_n$.
