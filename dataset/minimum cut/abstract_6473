We study SU(2) lattice gauge theory with two flavors of Wilson fermion at
non-zero chemical potential mu and low temperature on a 8^3x16 system. We
identify three regimes along the mu-axis. For mu<~m_pi/2 the system remains in
the vacuum phase, and all physical observables considered remain essentially
unchanged. The intermediate regime is characterised by a non-zero diquark
condensate and an associated increase in the baryon density, consistent with
what is expected for Bose-Einstein condensation of tightly bound diquarks. We
also observe screening of the static quark potential here. In the high-density
deconfined regime we find a non-zero Polyakov loop and a strong modification of
the gluon propagator, including significant screening in the magnetic sector in
the static limit, which must have a non-perturbative origin. The behaviour of
thermodynamic observables and the superfluid order parameter are consistent
with a Fermi surface disrupted by a BCS diquark condensate. The energy per
baryon as a function of mu exhibits a minimum in the deconfined regime,
implying that macroscopic objects such as stars formed in this theory are
largely composed of quark matter.
