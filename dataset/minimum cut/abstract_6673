Sizable single crystals of $BaFe_2As_2$ have been grown with self-flux
method. The crystals are plate-like with c-axis perpendicular to the plane. The
size can be as large as 3 x 5 x 0.2 $mm^3$. The resistivity anisotropy
($\rho_c/\rho_{ab}$) is as large as about 150, and independent of temperature.
The transport in ab plane and along c-axis direction shares the same scattering
mechanism. In contrast to the magnetic behavior of polycrystalline samples, no
Curie-Weiss behavior are observed, a temperature linear dependent
susceptibility occurs above spin-density-wave (SDW) transition. The
susceptibility behavior is very similar to that of antiferromagnetic SDW
chromium. Magnetic behavior of single crystal definitely gives evidence for
existence of local moment except for the contribution to susceptibility from
itinerant electrons. A resistivity minimum strongly dependent on magnetic field
is observed. A log(1/T) divergency, similar to that of the underdoped cuprates,
happens at low temperature. Here we first present intrinsic transport and
magnetic properties, and their anisotropy from high quality single crystal.
