We present a graphene/Cu nanoparticle hybrids (G/CuNPs) system as a
surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate for adenosine detection. The
Cu nanoparticles wrapped around a monolayer graphene shell were directly
synthesized on flat quartz by chemical vapor deposition in a mixture of methane
and hydrogen. The G/CuNPs showed an excellent SERS enhancement activity for
adenosine. The minimum detected concentration of the adenosine in serum was
demonstrated as low as 5 nM, and the calibration curve showed a good linear
response from 5 to 500 nM. The capability of SERS detection of adenosine in
real normal human urine samples based on G/CuNPs was also investigated and the
characteristic peaks of adenosine were still recognizable. The reproducible and
the ultrasensitive enhanced Raman signals could be due to the presence of an
ultrathin graphene layer. The graphene shell was able to enrich and fix the
adenosine molecules, which could also efficiently maintain chemical and optical
stability of G/CuNPs. Based on G/CuNPs system, the ultrasensitive SERS
detection of adenosine in varied matrices was expected for the practical
applications of medicine and biotechnology
