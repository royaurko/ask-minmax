The minimum mass ratio for tidal stability of a contact binary containing two
unevolved main-sequence stars is calculated to be $\qmin\simeq0.09$ in the case
of a mostly radiative primary, and is higher if an appreciable fraction of the
mass lies in a convective envelope. At least one observed system, AW UMa, has a
mass ratio just below this value ($q=0.075$), implying, if the system is
stable, that the primary must be slightly evolved and must have a very shallow
convective envelope. Contact binaries with mass ratios significantly below that
of AW UMa should not be observed, since they are tidally unstable and quickly
merge into a single, rapidly rotating object, on a timescale
$\sim10^3$--$10^4\,$yr.
