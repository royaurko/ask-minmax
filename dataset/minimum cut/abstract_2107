In this note, we give a new necessary condition for the existence of
non-trivial partitions of a finite vector space. Precisely, we prove that, if V
is a finite vector space over a field of order q, then the number of the
subspaces of minimum dimension t of a non-trivial partition of V is greater
than or equal to q+t. Moreover, we give some extensions of a well known
Beutelspacher-Heden's result on existence of T-partitions.
