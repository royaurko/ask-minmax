This paper considers inference on functionals of semi/nonparametric
conditional moment restrictions with possibly nonsmooth generalized residuals,
which include all of the (nonlinear) nonparametric instrumental variables (IV)
as special cases. These models are often ill-posed and hence it is difficult to
verify whether a (possibly nonlinear) functional is root-$n$ estimable or not.
We provide computationally simple, unified inference procedures that are
asymptotically valid regardless of whether a functional is root-$n$ estimable
or not. We establish the following new useful results: (1) the asymptotic
normality of a plug-in penalized sieve minimum distance (PSMD) estimator of a
(possibly nonlinear) functional; (2) the consistency of simple sieve variance
estimators for the plug-in PSMD estimator, and hence the asymptotic chi-square
distribution of the sieve Wald statistic; (3) the asymptotic chi-square
distribution of an optimally weighted sieve quasi likelihood ratio (QLR) test
under the null hypothesis; (4) the asymptotic tight distribution of a
non-optimally weighted sieve QLR statistic under the null; (5) the consistency
of generalized residual bootstrap sieve Wald and QLR tests; (6) local power
properties of sieve Wald and QLR tests and of their bootstrap versions; (7)
asymptotic properties of sieve Wald and SQLR for functionals of increasing
dimension. Simulation studies and an empirical illustration of a nonparametric
quantile IV regression are presented.
