In this paper we present a method for designing a linear time invariant (LTI)
state-feedback controller to monotonically track a constant step reference at
any desired rate of convergence for any initial condition. Necessary and
sufficient constructive conditions are given to deliver a monotonic step
response from all initial conditions. This method is developed for multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems, and can be applied to square and non-square
systems, strictly proper and non-strictly proper systems, and, importantly,
also minimum and non-minimum phase systems. The framework proposed here shows
that for MIMO LTI systems the objectives of achieving a rapid settling time,
while at the same time avoiding overshoot and/or undershoot, are not
necessarily competing objectives.
