Let $F_g$ denote the closed oriented surface of genus $g$ and
$\text{Mod}(F_g)$ denote the mapping class group of genus $g$. The group
$\text{Mod}(F_g)$ acts on the set of fillings of $F_g$. The union of the curves
in a filling form a graph on the surface which is so called decorated fat
graph. We show that two fillings of $F_g$ are in the same
$\text{Mod}(F_g)$-orbit if and only if the corresponding fat graphs are
isomorphic. Next, we prove that any filling of $F_2$ with complement a single
disc(i.e. a so called minimal filling) has either three or four closed curves.
Moreover, we prove that there exist unique $\text{Mod}(F_2)$-orbit of minimal
filling with three curves and unique $\text{Mod}(F_2)$-orbit of minimal filling
with four curves.
  We show that the minimum number of discs in the complement of a \emph{
filling pair} of $F_2$ is two and we construct \emph{ filling pair} of $F_2$ so
that the complement is the union of two topological discs. Finally, for given
any $k\geq 2$ we construct filling pair of $F_2$ such that the complement is
the union of $k$ topological discs.
