An air-to-ground free-space optical communication system has been designed
and partially developed. The design covers both the communications between the
airborne and the ground station, and the acquisition, tracking and pointing. A
strong effort has been made in order to achieve the minimum payload power, size
and weight, for which a MEMS modulating retroreflector has been chosen. In the
ground station, a new technique for fine pointing, based on a liquid crystal
device, is proposed and will be demonstrated, as well as other improvements
with the aim of optimizing the ground station performance.
