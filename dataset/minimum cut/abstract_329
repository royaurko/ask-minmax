In the most general model with two Higgs doublets, if a minimum that
preserves the $U(1)_{em}$ symmetry exists, then charge breaking (CB) minima
cannot occur. The depth of the potential at a stationary point that breaks CB
or CP, relative to the $U(1)_{em}$ preserving minimum, is proportional to the
squared mass of the charged or pseudoscalar Higgs, respectively.
