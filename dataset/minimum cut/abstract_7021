Quasi-periodic oscillations and dwarf nova oscillations occur in dwarf novae
and nova-like variables during outburst and occasionally during quiescence, and
have analogues in high-mass X-ray binaries and black-hole candidates. The
frequent low coherence of quasi-period oscillations and dwarf nova oscillations
can make detection with standard time-series tools such as periodograms
problematic. This paper develops tools to analyse quasi-periodic brightness
oscillations. We review the use of time-frequency representations in the
astronomical literature, and show that representations such as the
Choi-Williams Distribution and Zhao-Atlas-Marks Representation, which are best
suited to high signal-to-noise data, cannot be assumed a priori to be the best
techniques for our data, which have a much higher noise level and lower
coherence. This leads us to a detailed analysis of the time-frequency
resolution and statistical properties of six time-frequency representations. We
conclude that the wavelet scalogram, with the addition of wavelet ridges and
maxima points, is the most effective time-frequency representation for
analysing quasi-periodicities in low signal-to-noise data, as it has high
time-frequency resolution, and is a minimum variance estimator.
  We use the wavelet ridges method to re-analyse archival data from VW Hyi, and
find 62 new QPOs and 7 new long-period DNOs. Relative to previous analyses, our
method substantially improves the detection rate for QPOs.
