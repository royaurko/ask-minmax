Monotone Boolean functions, and the monotone Boolean circuits that compute
them, have been intensively studied in complexity theory. In this paper we
study the structure of Boolean functions in terms of the minimum number of
negations in any circuit computing them, a complexity measure that interpolates
between monotone functions and the class of all functions. We study this
generalization of monotonicity from the vantage point of learning theory,
giving near-matching upper and lower bounds on the uniform-distribution
learnability of circuits in terms of the number of negations they contain. Our
upper bounds are based on a new structural characterization of negation-limited
circuits that extends a classical result of A. A. Markov. Our lower bounds,
which employ Fourier-analytic tools from hardness amplification, give new
results even for circuits with no negations (i.e. monotone functions).
