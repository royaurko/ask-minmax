We present radial-velocity measurements obtained with the ELODIE and AFOE
spectrographs for GJ 777 A (HD 190360), a metal-rich ([Fe/H]=0.25) nearby
(d=15.9 pc) star in a stellar binary system. A long-period low radial-velocity
amplitude variation is detected revealing the presence of a Jovian planetary
companion. Some of the orbital elements remain weakly constrained because of
the smallness of the signal compared to our instrumental precision. The
detailed orbital shape is therefore not well established. We present our best
fitted orbital solution: an eccentric (e=0.48) 10.7--year orbit. The minimum
mass of the companion is 1.33 M_Jup.
