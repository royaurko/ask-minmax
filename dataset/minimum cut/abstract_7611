The magnetorotational instability (MRI) drives vigorous turbulence in a
region of protoplanetary disks where the ionization fraction is sufficiently
high. It has recently been shown that the electric field induced by the MRI can
heat up electrons and thereby affect the ionization balance in the gas. In
particular, in a disk where abundant dust grains are present, the electron
heating causes a reduction of the electron abundance, thereby preventing
further growth of the MRI. By using the nonlinear Ohm's law that takes into
account electron heating, we investigate where in protoplanetary disks this
negative feedback between the MRI and ionization chemistry becomes important.
We find that the "e-heating zone," the region where the electron heating limits
the saturation of the MRI, extends out to 80 AU in the minimum-mass solar
nebula with abundant submicron-sized grains. This region is considerably larger
than the conventional dead zone whose radial extent is $\sim20$ AU in the same
disk model. Our simple estimate based on the scaling between the Maxwell stress
and current density shows that that the MRI turbulence in the e-heating zone
should have a significantly low saturation level, with the viscosity parameter
$\alpha$ being from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}$ at the midplane. This implies that
the MRI should be "virtually dead" deep inside the e-heating zone. We also find
that (sub)micron-sized grains in the e-heating zone are so negatively charged
that their collisional growth is unlikely to occur.
