The minimum message length principle is an information theoretic criterion
that links data compression with statistical inference. This paper studies the
strict minimum message length (SMML) estimator for $d$-dimensional exponential
families with continuous sufficient statistics, for all $d \ge 1$. The
partition of an SMML estimator is shown to consist of convex polytopes (i.e.
convex polygons when $d=2$) which can be described explicitly in terms of the
assertions and coding probabilities. While this result is known, we give a new
proof based on the calculus of variations, and this approach gives some
interesting new inequalities for SMML estimators. We also use this result to
construct an SMML estimator for a $2$-dimensional normal random variable with
known variance and a normal prior on its mean.
