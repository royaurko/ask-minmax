Kaltofen has proposed a new approach in 1992 for computing matrix
determinants without divisions. The algorithm is based on a baby steps/giant
steps construction of Krylov subspaces, and computes the determinant as the
constant term of a characteristic polynomial. For matrices over an abstract
ring, by the results of Baur and Strassen, the determinant algorithm, actually
a straight-line program, leads to an algorithm with the same complexity for
computing the adjoint of a matrix. However, the latter adjoint algorithm is
obtained by the reverse mode of automatic differentiation, hence somehow is not
"explicit". We present an alternative (still closely related) algorithm for the
adjoint thatcan be implemented directly, we mean without resorting to an
automatic transformation. The algorithm is deduced by applying program
differentiation techniques "by hand" to Kaltofen's method, and is completely
decribed. As subproblem, we study the differentiation of programs that compute
minimum polynomials of lineraly generated sequences, and we use a lazy
polynomial evaluation mechanism for reducing the cost of Strassen's avoidance
of divisions in our case.
