Consider a branching random walk on $\mathbb{R}$, with offspring distribution
Z and nonnegative displacement distribution W. We say that explosion occurs if
an infinite number of particles may be found within a finite distance of the
origin. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon when the offspring
distribution Z is heavy-tailed. Under an appropriate condition, we are able to
characterize the pairs (Z, W) for which explosion occurs, by demonstrating the
equivalence of explosion with a seemingly much weaker event: that the sum over
generations of the minimum displacement in each generation is finite.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that our condition on the tail is best possible for
this equivalence to occur. We also investigate, under additional smoothness
assumptions, the behavior of $M_n$, the position of the particle in generation
n closest to the origin, when explosion does not occur (and hence
$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}M_n=\infty$).
