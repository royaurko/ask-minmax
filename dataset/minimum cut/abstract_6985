Resistive gaseous detectors can be broadly defined as those operated in
conditions where virtually no field lines exist that connect any two metallic
electrodes sitting at different potential. This condition can be operationally
recognized as 'no gas gap being delimited by two metallic electrodes'. Since
early 70's, Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) are the most successful
implementation of this idea, that leads to fully spark-protected gaseous
detectors, with solid state-like reliability at working fields beyond 100kV/cm,
yet enjoying the general characteristics of gaseous detectors in terms of
flexibility, optimization and customization. We present a summary of the status
of the field of resistive gaseous detectors as discussed in a dedicated closing
session that took place during the XI Workshop for Resistive Plate Chambers and
Related Detectors celebrated in Frascati, and especially we review the
perspectives and ambitions towards the XII Workshop to be celebrated in Beijing
in year 2014. Due to the existence of two specific reviews ([1,2]) also at this
workshop, a minimum amount of overlap was found to be unavoidable. We have
realized, however, that the three works provide a look at the field from
different optics, so they can be largely considered to be complementary.
Contrary to the initial concerns, the overall appearance seems to be fairly
round, in our opinion.
