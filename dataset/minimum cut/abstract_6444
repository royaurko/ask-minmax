Minimum Description Length (MDL) is an important principle for induction and
prediction, with strong relations to optimal Bayesian learning. This paper
deals with learning non-i.i.d. processes by means of two-part MDL, where the
underlying model class is countable. We consider the online learning framework,
i.e. observations come in one by one, and the predictor is allowed to update
his state of mind after each time step. We identify two ways of predicting by
MDL for this setup, namely a static} and a dynamic one. (A third variant,
hybrid MDL, will turn out inferior.) We will prove that under the only
assumption that the data is generated by a distribution contained in the model
class, the MDL predictions converge to the true values almost surely. This is
accomplished by proving finite bounds on the quadratic, the Hellinger, and the
Kullback-Leibler loss of the MDL learner, which are however exponentially worse
than for Bayesian prediction. We demonstrate that these bounds are sharp, even
for model classes containing only Bernoulli distributions. We show how these
bounds imply regret bounds for arbitrary loss functions. Our results apply to a
wide range of setups, namely sequence prediction, pattern classification,
regression, and universal induction in the sense of Algorithmic Information
Theory among others.
