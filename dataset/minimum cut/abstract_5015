We follow the temporal evolution of mesoscopic intensity fluctuations and
correlation in strongly localized samples. We find an initial burst in relative
transmission fluctuations in random one dimensional (1D) samples due to
fluctuations in the arrival time of ballistic transmission. Relative
fluctuations subsequently rise, then drop to a minimum at a time t_m, after
which they increase rapidly in 1D simulations and quasi-1D (Q1D) measurements.
For t > 3t_m, results in 1D and Q1D samples converge towards predictions of a
dynamic single parameter scaling model. These results reflect the changing
number of modes participating appreciably in transmission as the impact of
longer lived modes grows with time delay.
