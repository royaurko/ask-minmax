We report on the first measurement of the charged hadron composition in
charged jets from pp collisions. The ALICE detector at the LHC was used to
study charged pion, kaon and (anti-)proton production in jets. The results were
extracted from $2 \times 10^8$ minimum bias events at a centre-of-mass energy
of $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV.
  We present the transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra and reduced
momentum spectra ($z^{\mathrm{ch}} \equiv p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track}} /
p_{\mathrm{T, jet}}^{\mathrm{ch}}$) of $\pi$, K and p in charged jets with
$p_{\mathrm{T, jet}}^{\mathrm{ch}}$ between 5 and 20 GeV/$c$. The measurements
are compared to Monte Carlo calculations.
