We present preliminary results from a lepton-tagged fully-inclusive
measurement of $B \to X_{s}\gamma$ decays, where $X_{s}$ is any strange
hadronic state. Results are based on a BaBar data set of 88.5 million
$B\bar{B}$ pairs at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance. We present a reconstructed
photon energy spectrum in the $\Upsilon(4S)$ frame, and partial branching
fractions above minimum reconstructed photon energies of 1.9, 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2
GeV. We then convert these to measurements of partial branching fractions and
truncated first and second moments of the true photon energy distribution in
the B rest frame, above the same minimum photon energy values. The full
correlation matrices between the first and second moments are included to allow
fitting to any parameterized theoretical calculation. We also measure the
direct CP asymmetry $A_{cp}(B \to X_{s+d}\gamma)$ (based on the charge of the
tagging lepton) above a reconstructed photon energy of 2.2 GeV
