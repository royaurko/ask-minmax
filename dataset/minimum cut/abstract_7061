The PDFs for energy dissipation rates created in a high resolution from
$4096^3$ DNS for fully developed turbulence are analyzed in a high precision
with the PDF derived within the formula of multifractal probability density
function theory (MPDFT). MPDFT is a statistical mechanical ensemble theory
constructed in order to analyze intermittent phenomena through the experimental
PDFs with fat-tail. By making use of the obtained w-PDFs created from the whole
of the DNS region, analyzed for the first time are the two partial PDFs, i.e.,
the max-PDF and the min-PDF which are, respectively, taken out from the partial
DNS regions of the size $512^3$ with maximum and minimum enstropy. The main
information for the partial PDFs are the following. One can find a w-PDF whose
tail part can adjust the slope of the tail-part of a max-PDF with appropriate
magnification factor. The value of the point at which the w-PDF multiplied by
the magnification factor starts to overlap the tail part of the max-PDF
coincides with the value of the connection point for the theoretical w-PDF. The
center part of the min-PDFs can be adjusted quite accurately by the scaled
w-PDFs with a common scale factor.
