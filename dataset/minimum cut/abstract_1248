We present a detailed numerical study of the electronic transport properties
of bilayer and trilayer graphene within a framework of single-electron
tight-binding model. Various types of disorder are considered, such as resonant
(hydrogen) impurities, vacancies, short- or long-range Gaussian random
potentials, and Gaussian random nearest neighbor hopping. The algorithms are
based on the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr \"{o}dinger equation
and applied to calculate the density of states and conductivities (via the Kubo
formula) of large samples containing millions of atoms. In the cases under
consideration, far enough from the neutrality point, depending on the strength
of disorders and the stacking sequence, a linear or sublinear electron-density
dependent conductivity is found. The minimum conductivity $\sigma_{\min}\approx
2e^{2}/h$ (per layer) at the charge neutrality point is the same for bilayer
and trilayer graphene, independent of the type of the impurities, but the
plateau of minimum conductivity around the neutrality point is only observed in
the presence of resonant impurities or vacancies, originating from the
formation of the impurity band.
