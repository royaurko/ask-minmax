We study a model of opinion formation where the opinions in conflict are not
equivalent. This is the case when the subject of the decision is to respect a
norm or a law. In such scenarios, one of the possible behaviors is to abide by
the norm and the other to ignore it. The evolution of the dynamics is
implemented through an imitation mechanism, in which agents can change their
opinions based on the opinions of a set of partners and their own state. We
determine, for different social situations, the minimum percentage of
supporters of the law necessary to arrive at a state of consensus of law
abiders.
