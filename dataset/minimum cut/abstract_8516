We have carried out the first very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
imaging of 44 GHz class I methanol maser (7_{0}-6_{1}A^{+}) associated with a
millimeter core MM2 in a massive star-forming region IRAS 18151-1208 with KaVA
(KVN and VERA Array), which is a newly combined array of KVN (Korean VLBI
Network) and VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry). We have succeeded in
imaging compact maser features with a synthesized beam size of 2.7
milliarcseconds x 1.5 milliarcseconds (mas). These features are detected at a
limited number of baselines within the length of shorter than approximately 650
km corresponding to 100 Mlambda in the uv-coverage. The central velocity and
the velocity width of the 44 GHz methanol maser are consistent with those of
the quiescent gas rather than the outflow traced by the SiO thermal line. The
minimum component size among the maser features is ~ 5 mas x 2 mas, which
corresponds to the linear size of ~ 15 AU x 6 AU assuming a distance of 3 kpc.
The brightness temperatures of these features range from ~ 3.5 x 10^{8} to 1.0
x 10^{10} K, which are higher than estimated lower limit from a previous Very
Large Array observation with the highest spatial resolution of ~ 50 mas. The 44
GHz class I methanol maser in IRAS 18151-1208 is found to be associated with
the MM2 core, which is thought to be less evolved than another millimeter core
MM1 associated with the 6.7 GHz class II methanol maser.
