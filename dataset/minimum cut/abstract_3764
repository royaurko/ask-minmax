We present a new method of gauge fixing to standard lattice Landau gauge, Max
Re Tr $\sum_{\mu,x}U_{\mu,x}$, in which the link configuration is recursively
smeared; these smeared links are then gauge fixed by standard extremization.
The resulting gauge transformation is simultaneously applied to the original
links. Following this preconditioning, the links are gauge fixed again as
usual. This method is free of Gribov copies, and we find that for physical
parameters ($\beta \geq 2$ in SU(2)), it generally results in the gauge fixed
configuration with the globally maximal trace. This method is a general
technique for finding a unique minimum to global optimization problems.
