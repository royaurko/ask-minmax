The AWGNC, BSC, and max-fractional pseudocodeword redundancy of a code is
defined as the smallest number of rows in a parity-check matrix such that the
corresponding minimum pseudoweight is equal to the minimum Hamming distance of
the code. This paper provides new results on the AWGNC, BSC, and max-fractional
pseudocodeword redundancies of codes. The pseudocodeword redundancies for all
codes of small length (at most 9) are computed. Also, comprehensive results are
provided on the cases of cyclic codes of length at most 250 for which the
eigenvalue bound of Vontobel and Koetter is sharp.
