We investigate the gravitational lensing effect in the strong field
background around the Schwarzschild black hole with extremely small mass and
solid deficit angle subject to the global monopole by means of the strong field
limit issue. We obtain the angular position and magnification of the
relativistic images and show that they relate to the global monopole parameter
$\eta$. We discuss that with the increase of parameter $\eta$, the minimum
impact parameter $u_{m}$ and angular separation $s$ increase and the relative
magnification $r$ decreases. We also find that $s$ grows extremely greatly as
the increasing parameter $\eta$ becomes large enough. The effect from the solid
deficit angle is the dependence of angular position, angular separation and
relative magnification on parameter $\eta$, which may offer a way to
characterize some possible distinct signatures of the Schwarzschild black hole
with a solid deficit angle associated with global monopole.
