In [Ban97] a connection among rough sets (in particular, pre-rough algebras)
and three-valued {\L}ukasiewicz logic {\L}3 is pointed out. In this paper we
present a temporal like semantics for Nilpotent Minimum logic NM ([Fod95,
EG01]), in which the logic of every instant is given by {\L}3: a completeness
theorem will be shown. This is the prosecution of the work initiated in [AGM08]
and [ABM09], in which the contributors construct a temporal semantics for the
many-valued logics of G\"odel ([G\"od32], [Dum59]) and Basic Logic ([H\'aj98]).
