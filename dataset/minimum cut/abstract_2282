Nuclear multifragmentation in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions has
long been associated with liquid-gas phase transition. We calculate the shear
viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s for an equilibrated system of nucleons
and fragments produced in multifragmentation within an extended statistical
multifragmentation model. The temperature dependence of eta/s exhibits
surprisingly similar behavior as that for water. In the coexistence phase of
fragments and light particles, the ratio eta/s reaches a minimum of comparable
depth as that for water in the vicinity of the critical temperature for
liquid-gas phase transition. The effects of freeze-out volume and surface
symmetry energy on eta/s in multifragmentation are studied.
