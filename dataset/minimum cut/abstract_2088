At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, jets have been a useful tool to probe
the properties of the hot, dense matter created. At the Large Hadron Collider,
collisions of Pb+Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV will provide a large cross
section of jets at high $E_T$ above the minimum bias heavy ion background.
Simulations of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment's capability to
measure jets in heavy ion collisions are presented. In particular, $\gamma$-jet
measurements can estimate the amount of energy lost by a jet interacting
strongly with the medium, since the tagged photon passes through unaffected.
