Millimeter wavelength observations are presented of NGC 1333 IRAS 4, a group
of highly-embedded young stellar objects in Perseus, that reveal motions of
infall, outflow, rotation, and turbulence in the dense gas around its two
brightest continuum objects, 4A and 4B. These data have finest angular
resolution of approximately 2" (0.0034 pc) and finest velocity resolution of
0.13 km/s. Infall motions are seen from inverse P-Cygni profiles observed in
H2CO 3_12-2_11 toward both objects, but also in CS 3-2 and N2H+ 1-0 toward 4A,
providing the least ambiguous evidence for such motions toward low-mass
protostellar objects. Outflow motions are probed by bright line wings of H2CO
3_12-2_11 and CS 3-2 observed at positions offset from 4A and 4B, likely
tracing dense cavity walls. Rotational motions of dense gas are traced by a
systematic variation of the N2H+ line velocities, and such variations are found
around 4A but not around 4B. Turbulent motions appear reduced with scale, given
N2H+ line widths around both 4A and 4B that are narrower by factors of 2 or 3
than those seen from single-dish observations. Minimum observed line widths of
approximately 0.2 km/s provide a new low, upper bound to the velocity
dispersion of the parent core to IRAS 4, and demonstrate that turbulence within
regions of clustered star formation can be reduced significantly. A third
continuum object in the region, 4B', shows no detectable line emission in any
of the observed molecular species.
