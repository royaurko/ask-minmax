Based on the experimental observation, that only the close vicinity of a
magnetic impurity at metal surfaces determines its Kondo behaviour, we
introduce a simple model which explains the Kondo temperatures observed for
cobalt adatoms at the (111) and (100) surfaces of Cu, Ag, and Au. Excellent
agreement between the model and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS)
experiments is demonstrated. The Kondo temperature is shown to depend on the
occupation of the d-level determined by the hybridization between adatom and
substrate with a minimum around single occupancy.
