There have been ubiquitous observations of wave-like motions in the solar
atmosphere for decades. Recent improvements to space- and ground-based
observatories have allowed the focus to shift to smaller magnetic structures on
the solar surface. In this paper, high-resolution ground-based data taken using
the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope is combined with co-spatial and co-temporal
data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) satellite to analyze running penumbral waves (RPWs). RPWs
have always been thought to be radial wave propagation that occurs within
sunspots. Recent research has suggested that they are in fact upwardly
propagating field-aligned waves (UPWs). Here, RPWs within a solar pore are
observed for the first time and are interpreted as UPWs due to the lack of a
penumbra that is required to support RPWs. These UPWs are also observed
co-spatially and co-temporally within several SDO/AIA elemental lines that
sample the transition region and low corona. The observed UPWs are traveling at
a horizontal velocity of around 17 +- 0.5 km s-1 and a minimum vertical
velocity of 42 +- 21 km s-1. The estimated energy of the waves is around 150 W
m-2, which is on the lower bound required to heat the quiet-Sun corona. This is
a new, yet unconsidered source of wave energy within the solar chromosphere and
low corona.
