We have measured the impact of calcium adsorbates on the transport property
of graphene. Although calcium renders conductivity linearly dependent on the
carrier density of graphene as predicted, our experimental results diverge from
the existing theoretical calculations. Our data expose the inadequacy of any
existing theory to describe the minimum conductivity of graphene and indicate
that a more complete testing of the impurity scattering calculations will
require improving the experimental capabilities by minimizing the contribution
from the substrate-bound charged impurities and developing an ability to count
the number of adsorbates while measuring transport.
