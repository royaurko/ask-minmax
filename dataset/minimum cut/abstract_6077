(Abridged Abstract) A favored interpretation of recent microlensing
measurements towards the Large Magellanic Cloud implies that a large fraction
(i.e. 10--50%) of the mass of the galactic halo is composed of white dwarfs. We
compare model white dwarf luminosity functions to the data from the
observational surveys in order to determine a lower bound on the age of any
substantial white dwarf halo population (and hence possibly on the age of the
Universe). We compare various theoretical white dwarf luminosity functions, in
which we vary hese three parameters, with the abovementioned survey results.
  From this comparison, we conclude that if white dwarfs do indeed constitute
more than 10% of the local halo mass density, then the Universe must be at
least 10 Gyr old for our most extreme allowed values of the parameters. When we
use cooling curves that account for chemical fractionation and more likely
values of the IMF and the bolometric correction, we find tighter limits: a
white dwarf MACHO fraction of 10% (30%) requires a minimum age of 14 Gyr (15.5
Gyr). Our analysis also indicates that the halo white dwarfs almost certainly
have helium-dominated atmospheres.
