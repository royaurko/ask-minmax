The PHENIX collaboration efforts towards constraining and understanding
quarkonia production mechanisms are outlined. J/psi measurements and feed-down
sources studies in p-p collisions at 200 GeV, together with their possible
indications on the hadro-production mechanisms, are discussed. J/psi
photo-production in ultra-peripheral collisions at 200 GeV is also examined.
Finally, a glimpse of the first bottomonia results in minimum bias Au-Au
collisions at 200 GeV and their implications are presented.
