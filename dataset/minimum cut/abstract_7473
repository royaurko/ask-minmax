We theoretically study hydrogen-bonded molecular conductors synthesized
recently, $\kappa$-H$_3$(Cat-EDT-TTF)$_2$ and its diselena analog,
$\kappa$-H$_3$(Cat-EDT-ST)$_2$, by first-principles density-functional theory
calculations. In these crystals, two H(Cat-EDT-TTF/ST) units share a hydrogen
atom with a short O--H--O hydrogen bond. The calculated band structure near the
Fermi level shows a quasi-two-dimensional character, with a rather large
interlayer dispersion due to the absence of insulating layers in contrast with
conventional molecular conductors. We discuss effective low-energy models based
on H(Cat-EDT-TTF/ST) units and its dimers, respectively, where the microscopic
character of the orbitals composing them are analyzed. Furthermore, we find a
stable structure which is different from the experimentally determined
structure, where the shared hydrogen atom becomes localized to one of the
oxygen atoms, in which charge disproportionation between the two types of
H(Cat-EDT-TTF) units is associated. The calculated potential energy surface for
the H atom is very shallow near the minimum points, therefore the probability
of the H atom can be delocalized between the two O atoms.
