The validation of modern software systems incorporates both functional and
quality requirements. This paper proposes a validation approach for software
quality requirement - its power consumption. This approach validates whether
the software produces the desired results with a minimum expenditure of energy.
We present energy requirements and an approach for their validation using a
power consumption model, test-case specification, software traces, and power
measurements. Three different approaches for power data gathering are
described. The power consumption of mobile phone applications is obtained and
matched against the power consumption model.
