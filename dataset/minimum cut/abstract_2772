Motivated by the fact that the Higgs is not seen, we have proposed a version
of the standard model where the scalar doublet is replaced by a vector doublet
and its neutral member forms a nonvanishing condensate. Gauge fields are
coupled to the new vector fields B in a gauge invariant way leading to mass
terms for the gauge fields by condensation. B-particles become massive because
of their self interactions. Fermion and gauge field couplings are standard. Low
energy charged current phenomenology fixes the condensate. Fermion masses are
coming from the condensation and B-particle-fermion couplings. The
Kobayashi-Maskawa description is unchanged. The model has a low mementum scale
of about 2 TeV. For instance, from tree-graph unitarity at a scale of 1 TeV the
minimum mass of a charged B-particle is 369 GeV. Such B-particles are shown to
copiously produced at high-energy linear $e^+e^-$ colliders. The model
survives the test of oblique radiative corrections. To each momentum scale
there exists a range of B masses where the S, T parameters are compatible with
the experiment. For instance, at a scale of 1 TeV from the S parameter the
minimum mass of a charged (neutral) B is 200-350 GeV (400-550 GeV).
