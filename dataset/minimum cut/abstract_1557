This article provides a concise overview of recent theoretical results
concerning the theory of vortons, which are defined to be (centrifugally
supported) equilibrium configurations of (current carrying) cosmic string
loops. Following a presentation of the results of work on the dynamical
evolution of small circular string loops, whose minimum energy states are the
simplest examples of vortons, recent order of magnitude estimates of the
cosmological density of vortons produced in various kinds of theoretical
scenario are briefly summarised.
