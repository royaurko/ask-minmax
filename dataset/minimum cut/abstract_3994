I construct an algebraic model for a typical fiber on a 1+1 dimensional
spacetime. The vector space comprising the fiber is composed of elements formed
from the direct product of two copies of an element x in the D2=C2xC2 finite
group algebra over the real numbers. The fiber contains subspaces whose
elements are associated with the tangent and momentum vectors of trajectories
in the manifold. The fiber also contains a subspace whose elements are
associated with the local flow of action of each trajectory. The condition of
minimum action translates into a constraint on the original vector x in the
direct product structure.
