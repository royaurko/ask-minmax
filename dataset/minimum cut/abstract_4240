To each knot $K\subset S^3$ one can associated its knot Floer homology
$\hat{HFK}(K)$, a finitely generated bigraded abelian group. In general, the
nonzero ranks of these homology groups lie on a finite number of slope one
lines with respect to the bigrading. The width of the homology is, in essence,
the largest horizontal distance between two such lines. Also, for each diagram
$D$ of $K$ there is an associated Turaev surface, and the Turaev genus is the
minimum genus of all Turaev surfaces for $K$. We show that the width of knot
Floer homology is bounded by Turaev genus plus one. Skein relations for genus
of the Turaev surface and width of a complex that generates knot Floer homology
are given.
