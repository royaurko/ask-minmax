The standard picture of CV secular evolution predicts a spike in the CV
distribution near the observed short-period cutoff P_0 ~ 78 min, which is not
observed. We show that an intrinsic spread in minimum (`bounce') periods P_b
resulting from a genuine difference in some parameter controlling the evolution
can remove the spike without smearing the sharpness of the cutoff. The most
probable second parameter is different admixtures of magnetic stellar wind
braking (at up to 5 times the GR rate) in a small tail of systems, perhaps
implying that the donor magnetic field strength at formation is a second
parameter specifying CV evolution. We suggest that magnetic braking resumes
below the gap with a wide range, being well below the GR rate in most CVs, but
significantly above it in a small tail.
