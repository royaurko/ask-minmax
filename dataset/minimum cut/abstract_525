Although there are now some tentative signs that the start of cycle 24 has
begun there is still considerable interest in the somewhat unusual behaviour of
the current solar minimum and the apparent delay in the true start of the next
cycle. While this behaviour is easily tracked by observing the change in
surface activity a question can also be asked about what is happening beneath
the surface where the magnetic activity ultimately originates? In order to try
to answer this question we can look at the behaviour of the frequencies of the
Sun's natural seismic modes of oscillation - the p modes. These seismic
frequencies also respond to changes in activity and are probes of conditions in
the solar interior. The Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) has made
measurements of low-degree (low-$\ell$) p mode frequencies over the last three
solar cycles, and so is in a unique position to explore the current unusual and
extended solar minimum. We compare the frequency shifts in the low-$\ell$
p-modes obtained from the BiSON data with the change in surface activity as
measured by different proxies and show there are significant differences
especially during the declining phase of solar cycle 23 and into the current
minimum. We also observe quasi-biennial periodic behaviour in the p mode
frequencies over the last 2 cycles that, unlike in the surface measurements,
seems to be present at mid- and low-activity levels. Additionally we look at
the frequency shifts of individual $\ell$ modes.
