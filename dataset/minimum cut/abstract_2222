Though the dependence of near-field radiative transfer on the gap between two
planar objects is well understood, that between curved objects is still
unclear. We show, based on the analysis of the surface polariton mediated
radiative transfer between two spheres of equal radii $R$ and minimum gap $d$,
that the near--field radiative transfer scales as $R/d$ as $d/R \rightarrow 0$
and as $\ln(R/d)$ for larger values of $d/R$ up to the far--field limit. We
propose a modified form of the proximity approximation to predict near--field
radiative transfer between curved objects from simulations of radiative
transfer between planar surfaces.
