We study black hole attractor equations for one-(complex structure)modulus
Calabi-Yau spaces which are the mirror dual of Fermat Calabi-Yau threefolds
(CY_{3}s).
  When exploring non-degenerate solutions near the Landau-Ginzburg point of the
moduli space of such 4-dimensional compactifications, we always find two
species of extremal black hole attractors, depending on the choice of the
Sp(4,Z) symplectic charge vector, one 1/2-BPS (which is always stable,
according to general results of special Kahler geometry) and one non-BPS. The
latter turns out to be stable (local minimum of the ``effective black hole
potential'' V_{BH}) for non-vanishing central charge, whereas it is unstable
(saddle point of V_{BH}) for the case of vanishing central charge.
  This is to be compared to the large volume limit of one-modulus
CY_{3}-compactifications (of Type II A superstrings), in which the homogeneous
symmetric special Kahler geometry based on cubic prepotential admits (beside
the 1/2-BPS ones) only non-BPS extremal black hole attractors with
non-vanishing central charge, which are always stable.
