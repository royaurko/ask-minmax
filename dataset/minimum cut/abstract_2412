We try to envision that there might be a dark-matter world and neutrinos,
especially the right-handed ones, might be coupled directly with dark-matter
particles in the dark-matter world. The candidate model would be the extended
Standard Model based on SU_c(3)\times SU_L(2)\times U(1)\times SU_f (3)\times
SU_R(2), with the search of the detailed version through the aid of the two
working rules, "Dirac similarity principle" and "minimum Higgs hypothesis".
