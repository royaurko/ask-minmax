We report specific heat and magneto-resistance studies on the compound
Ce${}_{1-x}$La${}_x$Ni${}_9$Ge${}_4$ for various concentrations over the entire
stoichiometric range. Our data reveal single-ion scaling with Ce-concentration
between $x = 0.1$ and 0.95. Furthermore, CeNi${}_9$Ge${}_4$ turns out to have
the largest ever recorded value of the electronic specific heat $\Delta c/T
\approx$ 5.5 J $\rm K^{-2}mol^{-1}$ at $T=0.08$ K which was found in Cerium
f-electron lattice systems. In the doped samples $\Delta c/T$ increases
logarithmically in the temperature range between 3 K and 50 mK typical for
non-Fermi liquid (nFl) behavior, while $\rho$ exhibits a Kondo-like minimum
around 30 K, followed by a single-ion local nFl behavior. In contrast to this,
CeNi${}_9$Ge${}_4$ flattens out in $\Delta c/T$ below 300 mK and displays a
pronounced maximum in the resistivity curve at 1.5 K indicating a coherent
heavy fermion groundstate. These properties render the compound
Ce${}_{1-x}$La${}_x$Ni${}_9$Ge${}_4$ a unique system on the borderline between
Fermi liquid and nFl physics.
