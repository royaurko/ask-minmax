A vertex-colored graph $G$ is said to be rainbow vertex-connected if every
two vertices of $G$ are connected by a path whose internal vertices have
distinct colors, such a path is called a rainbow path. The rainbow
vertex-connection number of a connected graph $G$, denoted by $rvc(G)$, is the
smallest number of colors that are needed in order to make $G$ rainbow
vertex-connected. If for every pair $u, v$ of distinct vertices, $G$ contains a
rainbow $u-v$ geodesic, then $G$ is strong rainbow vertex-connected. The
minimum number $k$ for which there exists a $k$-vertex-coloring of $G$ that
results in a strongly rainbow vertex-connected graph is called the strong
rainbow vertex-connection number of $G$, denoted by $srvc(G)$. Observe that
$rvc(G)\leq srvc(G)$ for any nontrivial connected graph $G$. In this paper,
sharp upper and lower bounds of $srvc(G)$ are given for a connected graph $G$
of order $n$, that is, $0\leq srvc(G)\leq n-2$. Graphs of order $n$ such that
$srvc(G)= 1, 2, n-2$ are characterized, respectively. It is also shown that,
for each pair $a, b$ of integers with $a\geq 5$ and $b\geq (7a-8)/5$, there
exists a connected graph $G$ such that $rvc(G)=a$ and $srvc(G)=b$.
