A pebbling step on a graph consists of removing two pebbles from one vertex
and placing one pebble on an adjacent vertex. A graph is said to be cover
pebbled if every vertex has a pebble on it after a series of pebbling steps.
The cover pebbling number of a graph is the minimum number of pebbles such that
the graph can be cover pebbled, no matter how the pebbles are initially placed
on the vertices of the graph. In this paper we determine the cover pebbling
numbers of cycles, finite products of paths and cycles, and products of a path
or a cycle with good graphs, amongst which are trees and complete graphs. In
the process we provide evidence in support of an affirmative answer to a
question posed in a paper by Cundiff, Crull, et al.
