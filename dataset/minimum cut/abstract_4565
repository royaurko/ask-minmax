We report results of a theoretical investigation of polarization of the X-ray
emissions induced in charge-exchange collisions of fully stripped solar wind
ions C$^{6+}$ and O$^{8+}$ with the heliospheric hydrogen atoms. The
polarization of X-ray emissions has been computed for line-of-sight
observations within the ecliptic plane as a function of solar wind ion
velocities, including a range of velocities corresponding to the slow and fast
solar wind, and Coronal Mass Ejections. To determine the variability of
polarization of heliospheric X-ray emissions, the polarization has been
computed for solar minimum conditions with self-consistent parameters of the
solar wind plasma and heliospheric gas and compared with the polarization
calculated for an averaged solar activity. We predict the polarization of
charge-exchange X-rays to be between 3% and 8%, depending on the line-of-sight
geometry, solar wind ion velocity, and the selected emission lines.
