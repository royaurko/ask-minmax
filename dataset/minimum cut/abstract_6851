We investigate the strong gravitational lensing in a squashed Kaluza-Klein
black hole immersed in the G\"{o}del universe with global rotation. Our result
show that the strong gravitational lensing in the squashed Kaluza-Klein
G\"{o}del black hole spacetime has some distinct behaviors from that in the
Kerr case. In the squashed Kaluza-Klein G\"{o}del black hole spacetime, the
photon sphere radius, the minimum impact parameter, the coefficient $\bar{a}$,
$\bar{b}$ and the deflection angle $\alpha(\theta)$ in the $\phi$ direction are
independent of whether the photon goes with or against the global rotation of
the G\"{o}del Universe. While in the Kerr black hole, the values of these
quantities for the prograde photons are different from those for the retrograde
photons. Moreover, the coefficient of $\bar{b}$ increases with $j$ in the
squashed Kaluza-Klein G\"{o}del black hole, but decreases with $a$ in the Kerr
case. We also probe the influence of the squashed effect on the strong
gravitational lensing in this black hole and find that in the extremely
squashed case $\rho_0=0$, the coefficient $\bar{a}$ is a constant 1 and is
independent of the global rotation of the G\"{o}del Universe. Furthermore, we
assume that the gravitational field of the supermassive central object of the
Galaxy can be described by this metric and estimate the numerical values of the
coefficients and the main observables in the strong gravitational lensing.
