There are many practical applications that require simplification of
polylines. Some of the goals are to reduce the amount of information necessary
to store, improve processing time, or simplify editing. The simplification is
usually done by removing some of the vertices, making the resultant polyline go
through a subset of the source polyline vertices. However, such approaches do
not necessarily produce a new polyline with the minimum number of vertices. The
approximate solution to find a polyline, within a specified tolerance, with the
minimum number of vertices is described in this paper.
