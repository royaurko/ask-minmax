Considering the classical two-point correlators built from (axial)-vector,
scalar \bar qq and gluonium currents, we confront results obtained using the
SVZ + 1/q^2 expansion to the ones from some QCD holographic models in the
Euclidian region and with negative dilaton \Phi_i(z)=- |c_i^2| z^2. We conclude
that the presence of the 1/q^2-term in the SVZ-expansion due to a tachyonic
gluon mass appears naturally in the Minimum Soft Wall (MSW) and the
Gauge/String Dual (GSD) models which can also reproduce semi-quantitatively
some of the higher dimension condensate contributions appearing in the OPE. The
Hard-Wall model shows a large departure from the SVZ + 1/q^2 expansion in the
vector, scalar and gluonium channels due to the absence of any power
corrections. The equivalence of the MSW and GSD models is manifest in the
vector channel through the relation of the dilaton parameter with the tachyonic
gluon mass. For approximately reproducing the phenomenological values of the
dimension d=4,6 condensates, the holographic models require a tachyonic gluon
mass (\alpha_s/\pi)\lambda^2= -(0.12- 0.14) GeV^2, which is about twice the
fitted phenomenological value from e^+e^- data. The relation of the inverse
length parameter c_i to the tachyonic gluon mass also shows that c_i is channel
dependent but not universal for a given holographic model. Using the MSW model
and M_\rho=0.78 GeV as input, we predict a scalar \bar qq mass M_S=(0.95-1.10)
GeV and a scalar gluonium mass M_G= (1.1- 1.3) GeV.
