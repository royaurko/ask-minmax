We study the stability of a non-Abelian chromomagnetic vacuum in Yang-Mills
theory in Euclidean Einstein universe $S^1\times S^3$. We assume that the gauge
group is a simple compact group $G$ containing the group SU(2) as a subgroup
and consider static covariantly constant gauge fields on $S^3$ taking values in
the adjoint representation of the group $G$ and forming a representation of the
group SU(2)$. We compute the heat kernel for the Laplacian acting on fields on
$S^3$ in an arbitrary representation of SU(2) and use this result to compute
the heat kernels for the gluon and the ghost operators and the one-loop
effective action. We show that the only configuration of the covariantly
constant Yang-Mills background that is stable is the one that contains only
spinor (fundamental) representations of the group SU(2); all other
configurations contain negative modes and are unstable. For the stable
configuration we compute the asymptotics of the effective action, the energy
density, the entropy and the heat capacity in the limits of low/high
temperature and small/large volume and show that the energy density has a
non-trivial minimum at a finite value of the radius of the sphere $S^3$.
