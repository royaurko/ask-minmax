We demonstrate cavity sideband cooling of a single collective motional mode
of an atomic ensemble down to a mean phonon occupation number of
2.0(-0.3/+0.9). Both this minimum occupation number and the observed cooling
rate are in good agreement with an optomechanical model. The cooling rate
constant is proportional to the total photon scattering rate by the ensemble,
demonstrating the cooperative character of the light-emission-induced cooling
process. We deduce fundamental limits to cavity-cooling either the collective
mode or, sympathetically, the single-atom degrees of freedom.
