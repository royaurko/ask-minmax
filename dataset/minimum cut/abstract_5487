For the case of the MSSM and the most general form of the NMSSM (GNMSSM) we
determine the reduction in the fine tuning that follows from allowing gaugino
masses to be non-degenerate at the unification scale, taking account of the
LHC8 bounds on SUSY masses, the Higgs mass bound, gauge coupling unification
and the requirement of an acceptable dark matter density. We show that low-fine
tuned points fall in the region of gaugino mass ratios predicted by specific
unified and string models. For the case of the MSSM the minimum fine tuning is
still large, approximately 1:60 allowing for a 3 GeV uncertainty in the Higgs
mass (1:500 for the central value), but for the GNMSSM it is below 1:20. We
find that the spectrum of SUSY states corresponding to the low-fine tuned
points in the GNMSSM is often compressed, weakening the LHC bounds on coloured
states. The prospect for testing the remaining low-fine-tuned regions at LHC14
is discussed.
