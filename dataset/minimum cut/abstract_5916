The online list coloring is a widely studied topic in graph theory. A graph
$G$ is 2-paintable if we always have a strategy to complete a coloring in an
online list coloring of $G$ in which each vertex has a color list of size 2. In
this paper, we focus on the online list coloring game in which the number of
colors is known in advance. We say that $G$ is $[2,t]$-paintable if we always
have a strategy to complete a coloring in an online list coloring of $G$ in
which we know that there are exactly $t$ colors in advance, and each vertex has
a color list of size 2.
  Let $M(G)$ denote the maximum $t$ in which $G$ is not $[2,t]$-paintable, and
$m(G)$ denote the minimum $t \geq 2$ in which $G$ is not $[2,t]$-paintable. We
show that if $G$ is not 2-paintable, then $2 \leq m(G) \leq 4,$ and $n \leq
M(G) \leq 2n-3.$ Furthermore, we characterize $G$ with $m(G)\in \{2,3,4\}$ and
$M(G) \in \{n, n+1, 2n-3\},$ respectively.
