We determine the growth rate of linear instabilities resulting from
long-wavelength transverse perturbations applied to periodic nonlinear wave
solutions to the Schamel-Korteweg-de Vries-Zakharov-Kuznetsov (SKdVZK) equation
which governs weakly nonlinear waves in a strongly magnetized cold-ion plasma
whose electron distribution is given by two Maxwellians at slightly different
temperatures. To obtain the growth rate it is necessary to evaluate non-trivial
integrals whose number is kept to minimum by using recursion relations. It is
shown that a key instance of one such relation cannot be used for classes of
solution whose minimum value is zero, and an additional integral must be
evaluated explicitly instead. The SKdVZK equation contains two nonlinear terms
whose ratio $b$ increases as the electron distribution becomes increasingly
flat-topped. As $b$ and hence the deviation from electron isothermality
increases, it is found that for cnoidal wave solutions that travel faster than
long-wavelength linear waves, there is a more pronounced variation of the
growth rate with the angle $\theta$ at which the perturbation is applied.
Solutions whose minimum value is zero and travel slower than long-wavelength
linear waves are found, at first order, to be stable to perpendicular
perturbations and have a relatively narrow range of $\theta$ for which the
first-order growth rate is not zero.
