In this work, we propose a novel low-complexity reduced-rank scheme and
consider its application to linear interference suppression in direct-sequence
ultra-wideband (DS-UWB) systems. Firstly, we investigate a generic reduced-rank
scheme that jointly optimizes a projection vector and a reduced-rank filter by
using the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion. Then a low-complexity
scheme, denoted switched approximation of adaptive basis functions (SAABF), is
proposed. The SAABF scheme is an extension of the generic scheme, in which the
complexity reduction is achieved by using a multi-branch framework to simplify
the structure of the projection vector. Adaptive implementations for the SAABF
scheme are developed by using least-mean squares (LMS) and recursive
least-squares (RLS) algorithms. We also develop algorithms for selecting the
branch number and the model order of the SAABF scheme. Simulations show that in
the scenarios with severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) and multiple access
interference (MAI), the proposed SAABF scheme has fast convergence and
remarkable interference suppression performance with low complexity.
