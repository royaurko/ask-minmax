We demonstrate a systematic approach to sub-wavelength resolution
lithographic image formation on films covering areas larger than a wavelength
squared. For example, it is possible to make a lithographic pattern with a
feature size resolution of $\lambda/[2(N+1)]$ by using a particular $2
M$-photon, multi-mode entangled state, where $N < M$, and banks of birefringent
plates. By preparing a statistically mixed such a state one can form any pixel
pattern on a $(N+1) 2^{M-N} \times (N+1) 2^{M-N}$ pixel grid occupying a square
with a side of $L=2^{M-N-1}$ wavelengths. Hence, there is a trade-off between
the exposed area, the minimum lithographic feature size resolution, and the
number of photons used for the exposure. We also show that the proposed method
will work even under non-ideal conditions, albeit with somewhat poorer
performance.
