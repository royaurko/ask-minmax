The magnetic field strengths of most millisecond pulsars(MSP) are about
$10^{8-9}$ Gauss. The accretion induced magnetic field evolution scenario here
concludes that the field decay is invesely related to the accreted mass and the
minimum field or bottom field stops at about $10^{8}$ Gauss if accreted with
the Eddington accretion rate, which is proportionally related with the
accretion rate as $\dot{M}^{1/2}$. The possibility of the low field $\sim
10^{7}$ Gauss MSPs has been proposed for the future radio observation.
