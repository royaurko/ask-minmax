Auns. The aim of our paper is to investigate the low-amplitude and
long-period variations in evolved stars with a precise radial velocity (RV)
survey. Methods. The high-resolution, the fiber-fed Bohyunsan Observatory
Echelle Spectrograph (BOES) was used from 2003 to 2013 for a radial velocity
survey of giant stars as part of the exoplanet search program at Bohyunsan
Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO). Results. We report the detection of three
new planetary companions orbiting the K giants beta Cnc, mu Leo, and beta UMi.
The planetary nature of the radial velocity variations is supported by analyzes
of ancillary data. The HIPPARCOS photometry shows no variations with periods
close to those in RV variations and there is no strong correlation between the
bisector velocity span (BVS) and the radial velocities for each star.
Furthermore, the stars show weak or no core reversal in Ca II H lines
indicating that they are inactive stars. The companion to beta Cnc has a
minimum mass of 7.8 M_Jup in a 605-day orbit with an eccentricity of 0.08. The
giant mu Leo is orbited by a companion of minimum mass of 2.4 M_Jup having a
period of 357 days and an eccentricity of 0.09. The giant beta UMi is a known
barium star and is suspected of harboring a white dwarf or substellar mass
companion. Its companion has a minimum mass of 6.1 M_Jup, a period of 522 days,
and an eccentricity e = 0.19.
