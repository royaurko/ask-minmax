A pseudo-Boolean function is a real-valued function
$f(x)=f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ of $n$ binary variables; that is, a mapping from
$\{0,1\}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$. For a pseudo-Boolean function $f(x)$ on
$\{0,1\}^n$, we say that $g(x,y)$ is a quadratization of $f$ if $g(x,y)$ is a
quadratic polynomial depending on $x$ and on $m$ auxiliary binary variables
$y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_m$ such that $f(x)= \min \{g(x,y) : y \in \{0,1\}^m \}$ for
all $x \in \{0,1\}^n$. By means of quadratizations, minimization of $f$ is
reduced to minimization (over its extended set of variables) of the quadratic
function $g(x,y)$. This is of some practical interest because minimization of
quadratic functions has been thoroughly studied for the last few decades, and
much progress has been made in solving such problems exactly or heuristically.
A related paper \cite{ABCG} initiated a systematic study of the minimum number
of auxiliary $y$-variables required in a quadratization of an arbitrary
function $f$ (a natural question, since the complexity of minimizing the
quadratic function $g(x,y)$ depends, among other factors, on the number of
binary variables). In this paper, we determine more precisely the number of
auxiliary variables required by quadratizations of symmetric pseudo-Boolean
functions $f(x)$, those functions whose value depends only on the Hamming
weight of the input $x$ (the number of variables equal to $1$).
