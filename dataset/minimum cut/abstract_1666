A theoretical formula for the probability density function (PDF) of velocity
derivatives in a fully developed turbulent flow is derived with the
multifractal aspect based on the generalized measures of entropy, i.e., the
extensive Renyi entropy or the non-extensive Tsallis entropy, and is used,
successfully, to analyze the PDF's observed in the direct numerical simulation
(DNS) conducted by Gotoh et al.. The minimum length scale r_d/eta in the
longitudinal (transverse) inertial range of the DNS is estimated to be
r_d^L/eta = 1.716 (r_d^T/eta = 2.180) in the unit of the Kolmogorov scale eta.
