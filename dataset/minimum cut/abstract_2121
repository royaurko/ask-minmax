By using different interface adapters for different methods, it is possible
to construct a maximally covering web of interface adapters which incurs
minimum loss during interface adaptation. We introduce a polynomial-time
algorithm that can achieve this. However, we also show that minimizing the
number of adapters included in a maximally covering web of interface adapters
is an NP-complete problem.
