We present results on lepton energy and recoil hadronic mass moments in
semileptonic B decay using a total of 9.4 fb^-1 of data taken with the CLEO
detector at the \Upsilon(4S). These results are discussed in the context of
Heavy Quark Effective Theory and compared to theory predictions as a function
of the minimum lepton energy requirement. We also measure the B semileptonic
branching fraction, B(B\to Xe^+\nu_e), as (10.91\pm0.09\pm0.24)%.
