Sixteen new linear codes are presented: three of them improve the lower
bounds on the minimum distance for a linear code and the rest are an explicit
construction of unknown codes attaining the lower bounds on the minimum
distance. They are constructed using the Plotkin sum of two linear codes, also
called $(u|u+v)$ construction. The computations have been achieved using an
exhaustiv search.
