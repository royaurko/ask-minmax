Atmospheric muon neutrino in Deep Core (whose rate and spectra might be soon
available) should exhibit a suppression (due to tens GeV up-going muon neutrino
converted into tau flavor) that must be imprinted in out-coming rate spectra.
We estimate here our independent muon neutrino spectra based on SK and its
projected record on Deep Core Channels. Our estimate (based on cosmic rays,
muon records and tested Super-Kamiokande (SK) data) differs both in shape and
in rate from other previous published spectra. The expected rate might exhibit
a minimum near channel 6 of Deep Core strings and it should manifest strong
signature for flavor mixing (mostly between channel 4--15)and a relevant
anomaly for eventual CPT violation (MINOS like) written at channel 3--6,whose
statistical weight (mainly at channel 5) might soon confirm or dismiss MINOS
CPT claim. At the flux minimum around channel 6, (a flux suppressed respect the
non oscillated case at least by an order of magnitude) the atmospheric neutrino
paucity offers a better windows to a twenty GeV Neutrino Astronomy. Therefore
by doubling the string array we may foresee a richer rate and a more complete
(zenith and azimuth) atmospheric neutrino distribution and an exciting first
twenty GeV Astronomy.
