The ground state configurations and the \lq{}\lq{}normal\rq{}\rq{} mode
spectra of a $quasi$-one-dimensional (Q1D) binary system of charged particles
interacting through a screened Coulomb potential are presented. The minimum
energy configurations were obtained analytically and independently through
molecular dynamic simulations. A rich variety of ordered structures were found
as a function of the screening parameter, the particle density, and the ratio
between the charges of the distinct types of particles. Continuous and
discontinuous structural transitions, as well as an unexpected symmetry
breaking in the charge distribution are observed when the density of the system
is changed. For near equal charges we found a disordered phase where a mixing
of the two types of particles occurs. The phonon dispersion curves were
calculated within the harmonic approximation for the one- and two-chain
structures.
