Motivated by recently derived fundamental limits on total (transmit +
decoding) power for coded communication with VLSI decoders, this paper
investigates the scaling behavior of the minimum-total-power needed to
communicate over AWGN channels as the target bit-error-probability tends to
zero, when using regular-LDPC codes and iterative message-passing decoders. We
analyze scaling behavior under two VLSI complexity models of decoding. One
model abstracts power consumed in processing elements ("node model"), and
another abstracts power consumed in wires which connect the processing elements
("wire model"). We prove that a coding strategy using regular-LDPC codes with
Gallager-B decoding achieves order-optimal scaling of total-power under the
node model. However, we also prove that regular-LDPC codes and iterative
message-passing decoders cannot meet existing fundamental limits on total-power
under the wire model. Further, total-power scales at a rate that is strictly
worse than uncoded transmission unless transmit power diverges to infinity or
the code-rate vanishes. Complementing our theoretical results, we develop
detailed physical models of decoding implementations using post-layout circuit
simulations. Our theoretical and numerical results show that approaching
fundamental limits on total-power requires increasing the complexity of both
the code design and the corresponding decoding algorithm as communication
distance is increased or error-probability is lowered.
