Let $x \in \R$ be given. As we know the, amount of bits needed to binary code
$x$ with given accuracy ($h \in \R$) is approximately $ \m_{h}(x) \approx
\log_{2}(\max {1, |\frac{x}{h}|}). $ We consider the problem where we should
translate the origin $a$ so that the mean amount of bits needed to code
randomly chosen element from a realization of a random variable $X$ is minimal.
In other words, we want to find $a \in \R$ such that $$ \R \ni a \to \mathrm{E}
(\m_{h} (X-a)) $$ attains minimum.
