The notion of symmetrization, also known as Davenport's reflection principle,
is well known in the area of the discrepancy theory and quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC)
integration. In this paper we consider applying a symmetrization technique to a
certain class of QMC point sets called digital nets. For this purpose we first
generalize the notion of symmetrization from base 2 to an arbitrary base $b\in
\mathbb{N}$, $b\ge 2$. Subsequently, we study the QMC integration error of
symmetrized digital nets over $\mathbb{Z}_b$ in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space. The result can be applied to component-by-component construction or
Korobov construction for finding good symmetrized (higher order) polynomial
lattice rules which achieve high order convergence of the integration error for
smooth integrands at the expense of an exponential growth of the number of
points with the dimension. Moreover, we consider two-dimensional symmetrized
Hammersley point sets in prime base $b$, and prove that the minimum Dick weight
is large enough to achieve the best possible order of $L_p$ discrepancy for all
$1\le p< \infty$.
