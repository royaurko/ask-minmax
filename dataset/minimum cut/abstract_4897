If $X\subset \mathbb{P}^n$ is a projective non degenerate variety, the
$X$-rank of a point $P\in \mathbb{P}^n$ is defined to be the minimum integer
$r$ such that $P$ belongs to the span of $r$ points of $X$. We describe the
complete stratification of the fourth secant variety of any Veronese variety
$X$ via the $X$-rank. This result has an equivalent translation in terms both
of symmetric tensors and homogeneous polynomials. It allows to classify all the
possible integers $r$ that can occur in the minimal decomposition of either a
symmetric tensor or a homogeneous polynomial of $X$-border rank 4 (i.e.
contained in the fourth secant variety) as a linear combination of either
completely decomposable tensors or powers of linear forms respectively.
