In the light of the new observational results we discuss the status of the
exponential potentials driving inflation. We depart form the minimal scenario
and study an inflaton kinetically coupled to the Einstein tensor. We find that
in this case the exponential potentials are well compatible with observations.
Their predictions coincide with those of the chaotic type quadratic potential
for an inflaton minimally coupled to gravity. We show that there exists a
simple mapping between the two models. Moreover, a novel aspect of our model is
that it features a natural exit from the inflationary phase even in the absence
of a minimum. We also turn to supergravity and motivate these sort of
potentials and the non-minimal kinetic coupling as possible effective dilaton
theories.
