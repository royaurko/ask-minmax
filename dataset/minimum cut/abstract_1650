We propose a minimal model for aeolian sand dunes. It combines an analytical
description of the turbulent wind velocity field above the dune with a
continuum saltation model that allows for saturation transients in the sand
flux. The model provides a qualitative understanding of important features of
real dunes, such as their longitudinal shape and aspect ratio, the formation of
a slip face, the breaking of scale invariance, and the existence of a minimum
dune size.
