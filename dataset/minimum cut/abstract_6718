The structure of DNA Binding Proteins enables a strong interaction with their
specific target site on DNA. However, recent single molecule experiment
reported that proteins can diffuse on DNA. This suggests that the interactions
between proteins and DNA play a role during the target search even far from the
specific site. It is unclear how these non-specific interactions optimize the
search process, and how the protein structure comes into play. Each nucleotide
being negatively charged, one may think that the positive surface of DNA-BPs
should electrostatically collapse onto DNA. Here we show by means of Monte
Carlo simulations and analytical calculations that a counter-intuitive
repulsion between the two oppositely charged macromolecules exists at a
nanometer range. We also show that this repulsion is due to a local increase of
the osmotic pressure exerted by the ions which are trapped at the interface.
For the concave shape of DNA-BPs, and for realistic protein charge densities,
we find that the repulsion pushes the protein in a free energy minimum at a
distance from DNA. As a consequence, a favourable path exists along which
proteins can slide without interacting with the DNA bases. When a protein
encounters its target, the osmotic barrier is completely counter-balanced by
the H-bond interaction, thus enabling the sequence recognition.
