We study numerically the structure of metastable states in the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass. We find that all non-paramagnetic
stationary points of the free energy are organized into pairs, consisting in a
minimum and a saddle of order one, which coalesce in the thermodynamic limit.
Within the annealed approximation, the entropic contribution of these states,
that is the complexity, is compatible with the supersymmetry-breaking
calculation performed in [A.J. Bray and M.A. Moore, J. Phys. C, 13 L469
(1980)]. This result indicates that the supersymmetry is spontaneously broken
in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model.
