We report a set of measurements of particle production in inelastic pbar{p}
collisions collected with a minimum-bias trigger at the Tevatron Collider with
the CDF II experiment. The inclusive charged particle transverse momentum
differential cross section is measured, with improved precision, over a range
about ten times wider than in previous measurements. The former modeling of the
spectrum appears to be incompatible with the high particle momenta observed.
The dependence of the charged particle transverse momentum on the event
particle multiplicity is analyzed to study the various components of hadron
interactions. This is one of the observable variables most poorly reproduced by
the available Monte Carlo generators. A first measurement of the event
transverse energy sum differential cross section is also reported. A comparison
with a Pythia prediction at the hadron level is performed. The inclusive
charged particle differential production cross section is fairly well
reproduced only in the transverse momentum range available from previous
measurements. At higher momentum the agreement is poor. The transverse energy
sum is poorly reproduced over the whole spectrum. The dependence of the charged
particle transverse momentum on the particle multiplicity needs the
introduction of more sophisticated particle production mechanisms, such as
multiple parton interactions, in order to be better explained.
