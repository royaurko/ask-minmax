We examine the predictions of the core accretion - gas capture model
concerning the efficiency of planet formation around stars with various masses.
First, we follow the evolution of gas and solids from the moment when all
solids are in the form of small grains to the stage when most of them are in
the form of planetesimals. We show that the surface density of the planetesimal
swarm tends to be higher around less massive stars. Then, we derive the minimum
surface density of the planetesimal swarm required for the formation of a giant
planet both in a numerical and in an approximate analytical approach. We
combine these results by calculating a set of representative disk models
characterized by different masses, sizes, and metallicities, and by estimating
their capability of forming giant planets. Our results show that the set of
protoplanetary disks capable of giant planet formation is larger for less
massive stars. Provided that the distribution of initial disk parameters does
not depend too strongly on the mass of the central star, we predict that the
percentage of stars with giant planets should increase with decreasing stellar
mass. Furthermore, we identify the radial redistribution of solids during the
formation of planetesimal swarms as the key element in explaining these
effects.
