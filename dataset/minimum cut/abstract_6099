We use numerical simulations of ray tracing through N-body simulations to
investigate weak lensing by large-scale structure. These are needed for testing
the analytic predictions of two-point correlators, to set error estimates on
them and to investigate nonlinear gravitational effects in the weak lensing
maps. On scales larger than 1 degree gaussian statistics suffice and can be
used to estimate the sampling, noise and aliasing errors on the measured power
spectrum. For this case we describe a minimum variance inversion procedure from
the 2-d to 3-d power spectrum and discuss a sparse sampling strategy which
optimizes the signal to noise on the power spectrum. On degree scales and
smaller the shear and convergence statistics lie in the nonlinear regime and
have a non-gaussian distribution. For this regime ray tracing simulations are
useful to provide reliable error estimates and calibration of the measurements.
We show how the skewness and kurtosis can in principle be used to probe the
mean density in the universe, but are sensitive to sampling errors and require
large observed areas. The probability distribution function is likely to be
more useful as a tool to investigate nonlinear effects. In particular, it shows
striking differences between models with different values of the mean density
$\Omega_m$.
