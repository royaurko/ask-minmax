We study compactification of extra dimensions in a theory of
Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) type gravity. We investigate the solution for Minkowski
spacetime with an $S^{2}$ extra space. The solution is derived by the effective
potential method in the presence of the magnetic flux on the extra sphere. We
find that, in a certain model, the radius of the extra space has a minimum
value independent of the higher-dimensional Newton constant in weak-field
limit.
