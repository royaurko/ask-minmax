Let $V_n$ be the ${\rm SL}_2$-module of binary forms of degree $n$ and let $V
= V_1 \oplus V_3 \oplus V_4$. We show that the minimum number of generators of
the algebra $R = \mathbb{C}[V]^{{\rm SL}_2}$ of polynomial functions on $V$
invariant under the action of ${\rm SL}_2$ equals 63. This settles a 143-year
old question.
