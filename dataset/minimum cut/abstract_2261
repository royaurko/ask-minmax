The phase diagrams of $^4$He adsorbed on the external surfaces of single
armchair carbon nanotubes with radii in the range 3.42 -- 10.85 \AA \ are
calculated using the diffusion Monte Carlo method. For nanotubes narrower than
a (10,10) one, the ground state is an incommensurate solid similar to the one
found for H$_2$ on the same substrates. For wider nanotubes, the phase with the
minimum energy per particle is a liquid layer. Curved $\sqrt 3 \times \sqrt 3$
registered solids similar to the ones found on graphene and graphite were
unstable for all the tubes considered.
