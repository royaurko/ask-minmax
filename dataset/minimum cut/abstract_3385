We report deep imaging observations of the young, nearby star AB Pic, a
member of the large Tucana-Horologium as sociation. We have detected a faint,
red source 5.5" South of the star with JHK colors compatible with that of a
young substellar L dwarf. Follow-up observations at two additional epochs
confirm, with a confidence level of 4.7sigma, that the faint red object is a
companion to AB Pic rather than it being a stationary background object. A low
resolution K-band spectrum indicates an early-L spectral type for the
companion. Finally, evolutionary model predictions based on the JHK photometry
of AB Pic b indicate a mass of 13 to 14 MJup if its age is ~30Myr. Is AB Pic b
a massive planet or a minimum mass brown dwarf?
