For odd n, I write down tensors in C^n\otimes C^n\otimes C^n of border rank
2n-1, showing the non-triviality of the Young-flattening equations of
Landsberg-Ottaviani. I also study the border rank of the tensors of Alexeev et.
al., showing the tensors their tensors T_{2^k}, despite having rank equal to
2^{k+1}-1, have border rank equal to 2^k, the minimum of any concise tensor. I
also study the equations of Griesser.
