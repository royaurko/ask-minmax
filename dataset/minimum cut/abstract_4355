We study 5-dimensional supergravity on S^1/Z_2 with a physical Z_2-odd vector
multiplet, which yields an additional modulus other than the radion. We derive
4-dimensional effective theory and find additional terms in the Kahler
potential that are peculiar to the multi moduli case. Such terms can avoid
tachyonic soft scalar masses at tree-level, which are problematic in the single
modulus case. We also show that the flavor structure of the soft terms are
different from that in the single modulus case when hierarchical Yukawa
couplings are generated by wavefunction localization in the fifth dimension. We
present a concrete model that stabilizes the moduli at a supersymmetry breaking
Minkowski minimum, and show the low energy sparticle spectrum.
