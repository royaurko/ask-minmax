The Ds-Ds*, D*-D*, and Ds*-Ds*, P-wave channels in the energy region of the
Y(4260) charmonium structure are studied in a coupled-channel model applied to
JPC=1-- c-cbar resonances. The three channels exhibit enhancements that peak at
4.27 GeV, 4.26 GeV, and 4.33 GeV, respectively, having widths ranging from 80
to 200 MeV. However, no S-matrix poles are found, other than those associated
with the psi(2D,4160) and psi(4S,4415). The conclusion is that the observed
Y(4260) signal(s) in pi-pi J/psi is (are) probably associated with the opening
of the aforementioned channels, resulting in a resonance-like structure caused
by the tail of the psi(3S,4040) resonance, roughly midway between the mentioned
P-wave thresholds and a sharp kinematical minimum at about 4.4 GeV present in
both the experimental and the model scattering amplitude.
