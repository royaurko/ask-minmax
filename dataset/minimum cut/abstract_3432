We have investigated the final accretion stage of terrestrial planets from
Mars-mass protoplanets that formed through oligarchic growth in a disk
comparable to the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), through N-body simulation
including random torques exerted by disk turbulence due to
Magneto-Rotational-Instability. For the torques, we used the semi-analytical
formula developed by Laughlin et al.(2004). The damping of orbital
eccentricities (in all runs) and type-I migration (in some runs) due to the
tidal interactions with disk gas are also included. We found that the orbital
eccentricities pumped up by the turbulent torques and associated random walks
in semimajor axes tend to delay isolation of planets, resulting in more
coagulation of planets than in the case without turbulence. The eccentricities
are still damped after planets become isolated. As a result, the number of
final planets decreases with increase in strength of the turbulence, while
Earth-mass planets with small eccentricities are still formed. In the case of
relatively strong turbulence, the number of final planets are 4-5 at 0.5-2AU,
which is consistent with Solar system, for relatively wide range of disk
surface density (~10^{-4}-10^{-2} times MMSN).
