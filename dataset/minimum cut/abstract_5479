The modified static exchange model (MSEM) recently introduced by Ray [1] to
study two-atomic collision processes at low and cold-energies, is used for
detailed analysis of the long-range effects due to induced dipole-dipole van
der Waals interaction between Ps and H atoms. The MSEM includes the
non-adiabatic short-range effect due to electron-exchange and the long-range
effect due to induced dynamic dipole polarisabilities of the atoms. The
effective interatomic potential is highly sensitive to the minimum distance
between the atoms ( ). The s-, p- and d- wave elastic phase shifts,
corresponding partial cross sections, the scattering length and effective
ranges are calculated and studied with the variation of the chosen least
interatomic distance between them. It is found that the scattering length is
highly sensitive to the effective interatomic potential that depends on the
least interatomic distance. In addition the studies are made in search of
Feshbach resonances. The observed interesting feature with the variation of in
the triplet channel invites more accurate investigations if new physics.
