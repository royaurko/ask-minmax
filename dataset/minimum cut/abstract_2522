A pancyclic graph is a simple graph containing a cycle of length $k$ for all
$3\leq k\leq n$. Let $m(n)$ be the minimum number of edges of all pancyclic
graphs on $n$ vertices. Exact values are given for $m(n)$ for $n\leq 37$,
combining calculations from an exhaustive search on graphs with up to 29
vertices with a construction that works for up to 37 vertices. The behavior of
$m(n)$ in general is also explored, including a proof of the conjecture that
$m(n+1)>m(n)$ for all $n$ in some special cases.
