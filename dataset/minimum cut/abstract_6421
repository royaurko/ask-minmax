The present paper reports our attempt to search for a new universal framework
in nonequilibrium physics. We propose a thermodynamic formalism that is
expected to apply to a large class of nonequilibrium steady states including a
heat conducting fluid, a sheared fluid, and an electrically conducting fluid.
We call our theory steady state thermodynamics (SST) after Oono and Paniconi's
original proposal. The construction of SST is based on a careful examination of
how the basic notions in thermodynamics should be modified in nonequilibrium
steady states. We define all thermodynamic quantities through operational
procedures which can be (in principle) realized experimentally. Based on SST
thus constructed, we make some nontrivial predictions, including an extension
of Einstein's formula on density fluctuation, an extension of the minimum work
principle, the existence of a new osmotic pressure of a purely nonequilibrium
origin, and a shift of coexistence temperature. All these predictions may be
checked experimentally to test SST for its quantitative validity.
