A numerical method to calculate equilibrium vortex-line configurations in
bulk anisotropic type-II superconductors, at zero temperature, placed in an
external magnetic field is introduced and applied to two physical problems. The
method is designed to search for the minimum of the Gibbs free-energy in the
London approximation and assumes only that the vortex lines are straight and
arranged in a periodic lattice. Based on these assumptions a simulated
annealing algorithm is developed to find the vortex-line-lattice unit cell
shape, and vortex-line positions within it. This algorithm is made fast and
accurate by the use of a rapidly converging series to calculate the lattice
sums entering the vortex-vortex interaction energy. The method's accuracy is
illustrated by calculating the magnetic induction versus applied field curve
for an isotropic superconductor. The method is applied to a superconductor with
a square lattice of columnar defects to study selected regions of the
zero-temperature-phase diagram where vortex-line-lattices commensurate with the
columnar defect lattice exist.
