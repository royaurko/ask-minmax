We present a universal and rigorous approach to study difference frequency
generation in the terahertz domain, keeping the number of degrees of freedom to
a minimum, through the definition of a suitable figure of merit. The proposed
method relies on suitably normalized charts, that enable to predict the
optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiency of any system based on wave
propagation in quadratic nonlinear materials. The predictions of our approach
are found to be in good agreement with the best experimental results reported
to date, enabling also to estimate the d22 nonlinear coefficient of high
quality GaSe.
