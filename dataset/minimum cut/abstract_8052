We present the initial results of an observational study into the variation
of the dominant length-scale of quiet solar emission: supergranulation. This
length-scale reflects the radiative energy in the plasma of the upper solar
chromosphere and transition region at the magnetic network boundaries forming
as a result of the relentless interaction of magnetic fields and convective
motions of the Sun's interior. We demonstrate that a net difference of ~0.5Mm
in the supergranular emission length-scale occurs when comparing observations
cycle 22/23 and cycle 23/24 minima. This variation in scale is reproduced in
the datasets of multiple space- and ground-based instruments and using
different diagnostic measures. By means of extension, we consider the variation
of the supergranular length-scale over multiple solar minima by analyzing a
subset of the Mt Wilson Solar Observatory (MWO) Ca II K image record. The
observations and analysis presented provide a tantalizing look at solar
activity in the absence of large-scale flux emergence, offering insight into
times of "extreme" solar minimum and general behavior such as the phasing and
cross-dependence of different components of the spectral irradiance. Given that
the modulation of the supergranular scale imprints itself in variations of the
Sun's spectral irradiance, as well as in the mass and energy transport into the
entire outer atmosphere, this preliminary investigation is an important step in
understanding the impact of the quiet sun on the heliospheric system.
