We investigate the two-loop effective potential for both minimally and
non-minimally coupled Maxwell-Chern-Simons theories. The non-minimal gauge
interaction represents the magnetic moment interaction between a charged scalar
and the electromagnetic field. In a previous paper we have shown that the two
loop effective potential for this model is renormalizable with an appropriate
choice of the non-minimal coupling constant. We carry out a detailed analysis
of the spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by radiative corrections. As long
as the renormalization point for all couplings is chosen to be the true minimum
of the effective potential, both models predict the presence of spontaneous
symmetry breaking. Two loop corrections are small compared to the one loop
result, and thus the symmetry breaking is perturbatively stable.
