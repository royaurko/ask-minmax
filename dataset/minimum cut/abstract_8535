The jet fragmentation function is measured with direct photon-hadron
correlations in p+p and Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV. The p_T of the
photon is an excellent approximation to the initial p_T of the jet and the
ratio z_T=p_T^h/p_T^\gamma is used as a proxy for the jet fragmentation
function. A statistical subtraction is used to extract the direct photon-hadron
yields in Au+Au collisions while a photon isolation cut is applied in p+p. I_
AA, the ratio of jet fragment yield in Au+Au to that in p+p, indicates
modification of the jet fragmentation function. Suppression, most likely due to
energy loss in the medium, is seen at high z_T. The fragment yield at low z_T
is enhanced at large angles. Such a trend is expected from redistribution of
the lost energy into increased production of low-momentum particles.
