The Planck scale is considered to be a natural minimum scale, made up as it
is solely of fundamental constants. However the Planck scale is well beyond the
scales encountered in real life, these latter being at least of the order of
the Compton scale. The Compton scale too is fundamental in the same sense -- it
is made up of fundamental micro physical constants, though it is $10^{20}$
orders higher than the Planck scale. We discuss here a mechanism by which the
Planck scale manifests itself at the real life Compton scale, this happening
due to processes within the Planck time. Related issues are also discussed.
