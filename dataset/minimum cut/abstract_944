This paper is concerned with some Algebraic Geometry codes on Jacobians of
genus 2 curves. We derive a lower bound for the minimum distance of these codes
from an upper "Weil type" bound for the number of rational points on
irreducible (possibly singular or non-absolutely irreducible) curves lying on
an abelian surface over a finite field.
