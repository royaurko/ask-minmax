The results of string percolation on multiplicities and elliptic flow in AA
and pp collisions are compared with LHC data showing a good agreement. We
discuss the rapidity long range correlations and its relation to the height and
longitudinal extension of the ridge structure. Finally we show that the
dependence of the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio on the
temperature, presents a minimum close to the critical temperature remaining
small in the range of the RHIC and LHC energies.
