The Unitary and analytic model of nucleon electromagnetic structure,
describing all existing nucleon form factor data, is briefly reviewed. Then in
the framework of this model the problem of inconsistency of older proton
electric form factor data in space-like region (obtained from $% e^{-}p\to
e^{-}p$ process by the Rosenbluth technique) with recent Jefferson Lab data on
the ratio $G_{Ep}(t)/G_{Mp}(t)$ (measured in precise polarization
$\overrightarrow{e}^{-}p\to e^{-}\overrightarrow{p}$ experiment) is suggested
to be solved in favour of the latter data which, however, unlike older data
cause an existence of the form factor zero, i.e. a difraction minimum in
$|G_{Ep}(t)|$ around $t=-Q^{2}=-13$GeV$^{2}$. The new behaviour of $G_{Ep}(t)$
with the zero gives modified proton charge distribution with enlarged value of
the mean square charge radius.
