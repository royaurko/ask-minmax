Threshold based models have been widely used in characterizing collective
behavior on social networks. An individual's threshold indicates the minimum
level of influence that must be exerted, by other members of the population
engaged in some activity, before the individual will join the activity. In this
work, we begin with a homogeneous version of the Linear Threshold model
proposed by Kempe et al. in the context of viral marketing, and generalize this
model to arbitrary threshold distributions. We show that the evolution can be
modeled as a discrete time Markov chain, and, by using a certain scaling, we
obtain a fluid limit that provides an ordinary differential equation model
(o.d.e.). We find that the threshold distribution appears in the o.d.e. via its
hazard rate function. We demonstrate the accuracy of the o.d.e. approximation
and derive explicit expressions for the trajectory of influence under the
uniform threshold distribution. Also, for an exponentially distributed
threshold, we show that the fluid dynamics are equivalent to the well-known SIR
model in epidemiology. We also numerically study how other hazard functions
(obtained from the Weibull and loglogistic distributions) provide qualitative
different characteristics of the influence evolution, compared to traditional
epidemic models, even in a homogeneous setting. We finally show how the model
can be extended to a setting with multiple communities and conclude with
possible future directions.
