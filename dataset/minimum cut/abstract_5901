We explore the possibility that the fast and exotic negative ions in
superfluid helium are electrons bound to quantized vortex structures, the
simplest being a ring. In the states we consider, the electron energy is only
slightly below the conduction band minimum of bulk helium. To support our
proposal we present two calculations. In the first, we show that the electron
pressure on the vortex core is insufficient to cavitate the helium and form an
electron bubble. In the second, we estimate the equilibrium radius of the
vortex ring that would bind an electron and find it is much smaller than the
electron bubble, about 0.7 nm. The many exotic ions reported in experiments
might be bound states of an electron with more complex vortex structures.
