We propose a quite general ansatz for the dynamical mass in technicolor
models. We impose on this ansatz the condition for formation of the tightest
composite boson state, or the criterion that it should lead to the deepest
minimum of energy. This criterion indicates a particular form of the
technifermion self energy.
