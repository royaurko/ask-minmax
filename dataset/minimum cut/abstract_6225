In this paper we return to the old problem of conal component-pair widths and
profile dimensions. Observationally, we consider a set of 10 pulsars with
prominent conal component pairs, for which well measured profiles exist over
the largest frequency range now possible. Apart from some tendency to narrow at
high frequency, the conal components exhibit almost constant widths. We use all
three profile measures, the component separation as well as the outside
half-power and 10% widths, to determine conal beam radii, which are the focus
of our subsequent analysis. These radii at different frequencies are well
fitted by a relationship introduced by Thorsett (1991), but the resulting
parameters are highly correlated. Three different types of behavior are found:
one group of stars exhibits a continuous variation of beam radius which can be
extrapolated down to the stellar surface along the ``last open field lines''; a
second group exhibits beam radii which asymptotically approach a minimum high
frequency value that is 3--5 times larger; and a third set shows almost no
spectral change in beam radius at all. The first two behaviors are associated
with outer-cone component pairs; whereas the constant separation appears to
reflect inner-cone emission.
