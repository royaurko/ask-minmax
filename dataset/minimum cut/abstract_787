For a directed graph $G$, a {\it $t$-identifying code} is a subset
$S\subseteq V(G)$ with the property that for each vertex $v\in V(G)$ the set of
vertices of $S$ reachable from $v$ by a directed path of length at most $t$ is
both non-empty and unique. A graph is called {\it $t$-identifiable} if there
exists a $t$-identifying code. This paper shows that the de~Bruijn graph
$\mathcal{\vec{B}}(d,n)$ is $t$-identifiable for $n \geq 2t-1$, and is not
$t$-identifiable for $n \leq 2t-2$. This paper also proves that a
$t$-identifying code for $t$-identifiable de~Bruijn graphs must contain at
least $d^{n-1}(d-1)$ vertices. Constructions are given to show that this lower
bound is achievable for $t$-identifying codes when $n \geq 2t$. Further a
(possibly) non-optimal construction is given when $n=2t-1$. Additionally, with
respect to $\vec{\mathcal{B}}(d,n)$ this paper proves upper and lower bounds on
the size of a minimum \textit{$t$-dominating set} (a subset with the property
that every vertex is at distance at most $t$ from the subset), that the minimum
size of a \textit{directed resolving set} (a subset with the property that
every vertex of the graph can be distinguished by its directed distances to
vertices of $S$) is $d^{n-1}(d-1)$, and that if $d>n$ the minimum size of a
{\it determining set} (a subset $S$ with the property that the only
automorphism that fixes $S$ pointwise is the trivial automorphism) is
$\left\lceil \frac{d-1}{n}\right\rceil$.
