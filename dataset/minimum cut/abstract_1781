The dense energy deposition from a low-energy nuclear recoil produces, via
the thermoacoustic effect, a brief yet intense pressure pulse that can be used
for WIMP or neutrino detection in some fiber-optic devices sensitive to
acoustooptic disturbances. Several possible detection schemes are described:
all of them are inspired by modern fiber-optic sensor technologies and share
common characteristics of low-cost and expected insensitivity to
minimum-ionizing backgrounds.
