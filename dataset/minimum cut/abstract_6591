To date, researchers have identified over 1000 different compounds contained
in human breath. These molecules have both endogenous and exogenous origins and
provide information about physiological processes occurring in the body as well
as environment-related ingestion or absorption of contaminants1,2. While the
presence and concentration of many of these molecules are poorly understood,
many 'biomarker' molecules have been correlated to specific diseases and
metabolic processes. Such correlations can result in non-invasive methods of
health screening for a wide variety of medical conditions. In this article we
present human breath analysis using an optical-frequency-comb-based trace
detection system with excellent performance in all criteria: detection
sensitivity, ability to identify and distinguish a large number of biomarkers,
and measurement time. We demonstrate a minimum detectable absorption of 8 x
10-10 cm-1, a spectral resolution of 800 MHz, and 200 nm of spectral coverage
from 1.5 to 1.7 micron where strong and unique molecular fingerprints exist for
many biomarkers. We present a series of breath measurements including stable
isotope ratios of CO2, breath concentrations of CO, and the presence of trace
concentrations of NH3 in high concentrations of H2O.
