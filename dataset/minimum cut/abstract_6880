We report the discovery of the first low-mass planet to emerge from the
NASA-UC Eta-Earth Program, a super-Earth orbiting the K0 dwarf HD 7924.
Keplerian modeling of precise Doppler radial velocities reveals a planet with
minimum mass M_P sin i = 9.26 M_Earth in a P = 5.398 d orbit. Based on
Keck-HIRES measurements from 2001 to 2008, the planet is robustly detected with
an estimated false alarm probability of less than 0.001. Photometric
observations using the Automated Photometric Telescopes at Fairborn Observatory
show that HD 7924 is photometrically constant over the radial velocity period
to 0.19 mmag, supporting the existence of the planetary companion. No transits
were detected down to a photometric limit of ~0.5 mmag, eliminating transiting
planets with a variety of compositions. HD 7924b is one of only eight planets
known with M_P sin i < 10 M_Earth and as such is a member of an emerging family
of low-mass planets that together constrain theories of planet formation.
