Consider the high-order heat-type equation $\partial u/\partial
t=\pm\partial^N u/\partial x^N$ for an integer $N>2$ and introduce the related
Markov pseudo-process $(X(t))_{t\ge 0}$. In this paper, we study several
functionals related to $(X(t))_{t\ge 0}$: the maximum $M(t)$ and minimum $m(t)$
up to time $t$; the hitting times $\tau_a^+$ and $\tau_a^-$ of the half lines
$(a,+\infty)$ and $(-\infty,a)$ respectively. We provide explicit expressions
for the distributions of the vectors $(X(t),M(t))$ and $(X(t),m(t))$, as well
as those of the vectors $(\tau_a^+,X(\tau_a^+))$ and $(\tau_a^-,X(\tau_a^-))$.
