(Abridged) The goal of this paper is to quantify the changes on the SF
distribution within the disc galaxies in the last ~8 Gyr. We use as a proxy for
the SF radial profile the Near-UV surface brightness distributions, allowing
suitably for extinction. We compare the effective radii (R_eff) and
concentration of the flux distribution in the rest-frame Near-UV for a sample
of 270 galaxies in the range 0<z<1. This radial distribution is compared to
that measured in the rest-frame B-band, which traces older stellar populations.
The analysis is performed using deep, high resolution, multi-band images from
GALEX, SDSS, and HST/ACS - GOODS-South. The relation R_eff(NUV)- M* suffers a
moderate change between z~1 and z~0: at a fixed stellar mass of 1E10 M_sun,
galaxies increase their effective radii by a factor 1.18+/-0.06. Median
profiles in NUV show signs of truncation at R~R_eff, and median colour profiles
(NUV-B) show a minimum (a "bluest" point) also around R~1-1.5 R_eff. The
distributions of NUV flux are more compact at z~1 than nowadays, in terms of
the fraction of flux enclosed in a specific radius (in kpc). Our results
indicate that the SF surface density has decreased dramatically in discs since
z~1, and this decline has been more intense in the central parts (<~R_eff) of
the galaxies. In addition, our data suggest that the bulges/pseudo-bulges have
grown in surface brightness with regard to the discs since z~1.
