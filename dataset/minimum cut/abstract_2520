We report on the switching of the magnetic vortex core in a Pac-man disk
using a magnetic field pulse, investigated via micromagnetic simulations. The
minimum core switching field is reduced by 72 % compared to that of a circular
disk with the same diameter and thickness. However, the core switches
irregularly with respect to both the field pulse amplitude and duration. This
irregularity is induced by magnetization oscillations which arise due to
excitation of the spin waves when the core annihilates. We show that the core
switching can be controlled with the assist magnetic field and by changing the
waveform.
