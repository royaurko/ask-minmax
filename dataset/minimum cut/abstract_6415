The magnetic and transport properties have been investigated for the
composite polycrystalline manganites,
(1-x)$La_{2/3}Ca_{1/3}MnO_3$/(x)yttria-stabilized zirconia ((1-x)LCMO/(x)YSZ),
at various YSZ fractions, x, ranging from 0 % to 15 %. The ac magnetic
susceptibility, $\chi(T)$, DC magnetization, $M(T)$, temperature dependent
resistivity, $\rho(T)$ and thermoelectric power (TEP), $S(T)$, have been
measured. It was found, surprisingly, that a TEP peak showed up in the magnetic
transition region for the sample with the x even as little as 0.75 %. The
magnetic transition temperature reaches the minimum value as x increases from 0
% to 4.5 % and goes up as x increases further. Several possible factors such as
the effect of strain, the finite size effect, and the effect of magnetic
tunnelling coupling, {\it etc.}, in affecting the above physical properties of
the composite manganites have been studied carefully. The strain induced by the
YSZ/LCMO boundary layer (BL) was identified as the leading factor to account
for the x dependence of these properties. It demonstrates that the effect of
strain could be important in the bulk manganites as in the film sample.
