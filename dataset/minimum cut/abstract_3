In this paper, an idea of the cutting plane method is employed to improve the
fractional distance of a given binary parity check matrix. The fractional
distance is the minimum weight (with respect to l1-distance) of vertices of the
fundamental polytope. The cutting polytope is defined based on redundant rows
of the parity check matrix and it plays a key role to eliminate unnecessary
fractional vertices in the fundamental polytope. We propose a greedy algorithm
and its efficient implementation for improving the fractional distance based on
the cutting plane method.
