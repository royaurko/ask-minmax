We investigate the minimum conductivity of graphene within a quasiclassical
approach taking into account electron-hole coherence effects which stem from
the chiral nature of low energy excitations. Relying on an analytical solution
of the kinetic equation in the electron-hole coherent and incoherent cases we
study both the electrical and thermal conductivity whose relation fullfills
Wiedemann-Franz law. We found that the most of the previous findings based on
the Boltzmann equation are restricted to only high mobility samples where
electron-hole coherence effects are not sufficient.
