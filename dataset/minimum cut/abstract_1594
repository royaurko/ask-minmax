We present summer site testing results based on DIMM data obtained at Dome C,
Antarctica. These data have been collected on the bright star Canopus during
two 3-months summer campaigns in 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. We performed
continuous monitoring of the seeing a nd the isoplanatic angle in the visible.
We found a median seeing of 0.54 \arcsec and a median isoplanatic angle of 6.8
\arcsec. The seeing appears to have a deep minimum around 0.4 \arcsec almost
every day in late afternoon.
