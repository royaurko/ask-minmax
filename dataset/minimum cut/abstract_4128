Landauer erasure seems to provide a powerful link between thermodynamics and
information processing (logical computation). The only logical operations that
require a generation of heat are logically irreversible ones, with the minimum
heat generation being $kT \ln 2$ per bit of information lost. Nevertheless, it
will be shown logical reversibility neither implies, nor is implied by
thermodynamic reversibility. By examining thermodynamically reversible
operations which are logically irreversible, it is possible to show that
information and entropy, while having the same form, are conceptually
different.
