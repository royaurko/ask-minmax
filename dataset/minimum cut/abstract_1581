The equilibrium of a hot dense plasma in a gravitational field is considered.
  From the standard equilibrium equations, the energy minimum at density about
$10^{25}$ particles per $cm^3$ and temperature about $10^7 K$ was found. This
effect plays an important role for astrophysics. It enables to explain the
mechanism of the star magnetic field generation and to make a prediction for
the spectrum of a star mass with a wholly satisfactory agreement for the
observation data.
