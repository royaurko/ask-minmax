We report the discovery of a massive planetary companion orbiting the young
disc star HD 81040. Based on five years of precise radial-velocity measurements
with the HIRES and ELODIE spectrographs, we derive a spectroscopic orbit with a
period $P =1001.0$ days and eccentricity $e = 0.53$. The inferred minimum mass
for the companion of $m_2\sin i = 6.86$ M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ places it in the
high-mass tail of the extrasolar planet mass distribution. The radial-velocity
residuals exhibit a scatter significantly larger than the typical internal
measurement precision of the instruments. Based on an analysis of the Ca II H
and K line cores, this is interpreted as an activity-induced phenomenon.
However, we find no evidence for the period and magnitude of the
radial-velocity variations to be caused by stellar surface activity. The
observed orbital motion of HD 81040 is thus best explained with the presence of
a massive giant planet companion.
