For a graph $G=(V,E)$, a function $f:V\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ is called Roman
dominating function (RDF) if for any vertex $v$ with $f(v)=0$, there is at
least one vertex $w$ in its neighborhood with $f(w)=2$. The weight of an RDF
$f$ of $G$ is the value $f(V)=\sum_{v\in V}f(v)$. The minimum weight of an RDF
of $G$ is its Roman domination number and denoted by $\gamma_ R(G)$. In this
paper, we first show that $\gamma_{R}(G)+1\leq \gamma_{R}(\mu (G))\leq
\gamma_{R}(G)+2$, where $\mu (G)$ is the Mycielekian graph of $G$, and then
characterize the graphs achieving equality in these bounds. Then for any
positive integer $m$, we compute the Roman domination number of the
$m$-Mycieleskian $\mu_{m}(G)$ of a special Roman graph $G$ in terms on
$\gamma_R(G)$. Finally we present several graphs to illustrate the discussed
graphs.
