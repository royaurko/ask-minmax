The satellite-borne experiment PAMELA has been used to make new measurements
of cosmic ray H and He isotopes. The isotopic composition was measured between
100 and 600 MeV/n for hydrogen and between 100 and 900 MeV/n for helium
isotopes over the 23rd solar minimum from July 2006 to December 2007. The
energy spectrum of these components carries fundamental information regarding
the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy which are competitive with those
obtained from other secondary to primary measurements such as B/C.
