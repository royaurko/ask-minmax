Perfect Space-Time Block Codes (PSTBCs) achieve full diversity, full rate,
nonvanishing constant minimum determinant, uniform average transmitted energy
per antenna, and good shaping. However, the high decoding complexity is a
critical issue for practice. When the Channel State Information (CSI) is
available at both the transmitter and the receiver, Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) is commonly applied for a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
(MIMO) system to enhance the throughput or the performance. In this paper, two
novel techniques, Perfect Coded Multiple Beamforming (PCMB) and Bit-Interleaved
Coded Multiple Beamforming with Perfect Coding (BICMB-PC), are proposed,
employing both PSTBCs and SVD with and without channel coding, respectively.
With CSI at the transmitter (CSIT), the decoding complexity of PCMB is
substantially reduced compared to a MIMO system employing PSTBC, providing a
new prospect of CSIT. Especially, because of the special property of the
generation matrices, PCMB provides much lower decoding complexity than the
state-of-the-art SVD-based uncoded technique in dimensions 2 and 4. Similarly,
the decoding complexity of BICMB-PC is much lower than the state-of-the-art
SVD-based coded technique in these two dimensions, and the complexity gain is
greater than the uncoded case. Moreover, these aforementioned complexity
reductions are achieved with only negligible or modest loss in performance.
