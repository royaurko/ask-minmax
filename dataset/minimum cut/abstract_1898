The distinguishing number of a graph G, denoted D(G), is the minimum number
of colors such that there exists a coloring of the vertices of G where no
nontrivial graph automorphism is color-preserving. In this paper, we show that
the distinguishing number of p-th graph power of the n-dimensional hypercube is
2 whenever 2 < p < n-1. This completes the study of the distinguishing number
of hypercube powers. We also compute the distinguishing number of the augmented
cube, a variant of the hypercube, answering an open question.
