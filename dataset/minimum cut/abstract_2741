Aims. The aim of this work is to identify and study spectral features in the
quasar 3C 273 usually blended by its strong jet emission. Method. A historic
minimum in the sub-millimetre emission of 3C 273 triggered coordinated
multi-wavelength observations in June 2004. X-ray observations from the
INTEGRAL, XMM-Newton and RXTE satellites are complemented by ground-based
optical, infrared, millimetre and radio observations. The overall spectrum is
used to model the infrared and X-ray spectral components. Results. Three
thermal dust emission components are identified in the infrared. The dust
emission on scales from 1 pc to several kpc is comparable to that of other
quasars, as expected by AGN unification schemes. The observed weakness of the
X-ray emission supports the hypothesis of a synchrotron self-Compton origin for
the jet component. There is a clear soft-excess and we find evidence for a very
broad iron line which could be emitted in a disk around a Kerr black hole.
Other signatures of a Seyfert-like X-ray component are not detected.
