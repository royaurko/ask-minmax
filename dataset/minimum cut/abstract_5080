Simulations of liquid-gas systems with extended interfaces are observed to
fail to give accurate results for two reasons: the interface can get ``stuck''
on the lattice or a density overshoot develops around the interface. In the
first case the bulk densities can take a range of values, dependent on the
initial conditions. In the second case inaccurate bulk densities are found. In
this communication we derive the minimum interface width required for the
accurate simulation of liquid gas systems with a diffuse interface. We
demonstrate this criterion for lattice Boltzmann simulations of a van der Waals
gas. When combining this criterion with predictions for the bulk stability we
can predict the parameter range that leads to stable and accurate simulation
results. This allows us to identify parameter ranges leading to high density
ratios of over 1000. This is despite the fact that lattice Boltzmann
simulations of liquid-gas systems were believed to be restricted to modest
density ratios of less than 20.
