An adaptive distributed space-time coding (DSTC) scheme is proposed for
two-hop cooperative MIMO networks. Linear minimum mean square error (MMSE)
receive filters and adjustable code matrices are considered subject to a power
constraint with an amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperation strategy. In the
proposed adaptive DSTC scheme, an adjustable code matrix obtained by a feedback
channel is employed to transform the space-time coded matrix at the relay node.
The effects of the limited feedback and the feedback errors are assessed.
Linear MMSE expressions are devised to compute the parameters of the adjustable
code matrix and the linear receive filters. Stochastic gradient (SG) and
least-squares (LS) algorithms are also developed with reduced computational
complexity. An upper bound on the pairwise error probability analysis is
derived and indicates the advantage of employing the adjustable code matrices
at the relay nodes. An alternative optimization algorithm for the adaptive DSTC
scheme is also derived in order to eliminate the need for the feedback. The
algorithm provides a fully distributed scheme for the adaptive DSTC at the
relay node based on the minimization of the error probability. Simulation
results show that the proposed algorithms obtain significant performance gains
as compared to existing DSTC schemes.
