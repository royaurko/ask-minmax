We use a toy model to illustrate how to build effective theories for singular
potentials. We consider a central attractive 1/r^2 potential perturbed by a
1/r^4 correction. The power-counting rule, an important ingredient of effective
theory, is established by seeking the minimum set of short-range counterterms
that renormalize the scattering amplitude. We show that leading-order
counterterms are needed in all partial waves where the potential overcomes the
centrifugal barrier, and that the additional counterterms at next-to-leading
order are the ones expected on the basis of dimensional analysis.
