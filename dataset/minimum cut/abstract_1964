Using a two-dipole model of an optical near-field of Scanning Near-field
Optical Microscope tip, i. e. taking into account contributions of magnetic and
electric dipoles, we propose and analyze a new type of 3D optical nanotrap
found for certain relations between electric and magnetic dipoles. Electric
field attains a minimum value in vacuum in the vicinity of the tip and hence
such a trap is quite suitable for manipulations with cold atoms.
