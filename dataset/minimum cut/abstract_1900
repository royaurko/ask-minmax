For a knot K, let b_n(K) be the minimum length of an n-stranded braid
representative of K. Examples of knots exist for which b_n(K) is a
non-increasing function. We investigate the behavior of b_n(K). We develop
bounds on the function in terms of the genus of K, with stronger results for
homogeneous knots and braid positive knots. For knots of nine or fewer
crossings, we show that b_n(K) is an increasing function and determine it
completely.
