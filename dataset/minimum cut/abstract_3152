The analysis of whole-sky galaxy surveys commonly suffers from the problems
of shot-noise and incomplete sky coverage (e.g. at the Zone of Avoidance). The
orthogonal set of spherical harmonics is utilized here to expand the observed
galaxy distribution. We show that in the framework of Bayesian statistics and
Gaussian random fields the $4 \pi$ harmonics can be recovered and the
shot-noise can be removed, giving the most probable picture of the underlying
density field. The correction factor from observed to reconstructed harmonics
turns out to be the well-known Wiener filter (the ratio of signal to
signal+noise), which is also derived by requiring minimum variance. We apply
the method to the projected 1.2 Jy IRAS survey. The reconstruction confirms the
connectivity of the Supergalactic Plane across the Galactic Plane (at Galactic
longitude $l \sim 135^o$ and $l \sim 315^o$) and the Puppis cluster behind the
Galactic Plane ($ l \sim 240^o$). The method can be extended to 3-D in both
real and redshift space, and applied to other cosmic phenomena such as the COBE
Microwave Background maps.
