In this paper we study the dual codes of a wide family of evaluation codes on
norm-trace curves. We explicitly find out their minimum distance and give a
lower bound for the number of their minimum-weight codewords. A general
geometric approach is performed and applied to study in particular the dual
codes of one-point and two-point codes arising from norm-trace curves through
Goppa's construction, providing in many cases their minimum distance and some
bounds on the number of their minimum-weight codewords. The results are
obtained by showing that the supports of the minimum-weight codewords of the
studied codes obey some precise geometric laws as zero-dimensional subschemes
of the projective plane. Finally, the dimension of some classical two-point
Goppa codes on norm-trace curves is explicitly computed.
