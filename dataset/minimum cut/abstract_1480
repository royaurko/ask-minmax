The global-scale dynamo action achieved in a simulation of a Sun-like star
rotating at thrice the solar rate is assessed. The 3-D MHD Anelastic Spherical
Harmonic (ASH) code, augmented with a viscosity minimization scheme, is
employed to capture convection and dynamo processes in this G-type star. The
simulation is carried out in a spherical shell that encompasses 3.8 density
scale heights of the solar convection zone. It is found that dynamo action with
a high degree of time variation occurs, with many periodic polarity reversals
occurring roughly every 6.2 years. The magnetic energy also rises and falls
with a regular period. The magnetic energy cycles arise from a Lorentz-force
feedback on the differential rotation, whereas the processes leading to
polarity reversals are more complex, appearing to arise from the interaction of
convection with the mean toroidal fields. Moreover, an equatorial migration of
toroidal field is found, which is linked to the changing differential rotation,
and potentially to a nonlinear dynamo wave. This simulation also enters a grand
minimum lasting roughly 20~years, after which the dynamo recovers its regular
polarity cycles.
