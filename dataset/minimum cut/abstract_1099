Isomeric states in the nuclei along the rapid proton capture process path are
studied by the projected shell model. Emphasis is given to two waiting point
nuclei 68Se and 72Kr that are characterized by shape coexistence. Energy
surface calculations indicate that the ground state of these nuclei corresponds
to an oblate-deformed minimum, while the lowest state at the prolate-deformed
minimum can be considered as a shape isomer. The impact of these isomer states
on isotopic abundance in x-ray bursts is studied in a multi-mass-zone x-ray
burst model by assuming an upper-lower limit approach.
