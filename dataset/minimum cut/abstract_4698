We present results from a comparative analysis of empirical and synthetic
shapes for isoseismals of low intensity (I = IV-VI on the MCS scale) for six
Italian earthquakes of ML = 4.5-6. Our modelling of isoseismals is based on a
plane stratified earth model and on the dou-ble-couple point source
approximation to calculate seismograms in the frequency range f =< 1 Hz. With a
minimum of parameter variation we demonstrate that the low intensity
isoseismals provide information on source geometry. We strive to avoid
subjectivity in isoseismal construc-tions by using the new Diffuse Boundary
method, which visualizes isoseismals with their uncer-tainty. Similar results
in this direction are known for large earthquakes (ML ~ 6 or greater) with
extended sources and for the higher isoseismals (I >= VI on the MM scale). The
latter studies disregard the earth structure, use a greater number of
parameters, and therefore have greater possibilities for fitting the data than
our approach.
