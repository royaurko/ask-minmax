Two-way relaying networks (TWRNs) allow for more bandwidth efficient use of
the available spectrum since they allow for simultaneous information exchange
between two users with the assistance of an intermediate relay node. However,
due to superposition of signals at the relay node, the received signal at the
user terminals is affected by \emph{multiple impairments}, i.e., channel gains,
timing offsets, and carrier frequency offsets, that need to be jointly
estimated and compensated. This paper presents a training-based system model
for amplify-and-forward (AF) TWRNs in the presence of multiple impairments and
proposes maximum likelihood and differential evolution based algorithms for
joint estimation of these impairments. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for
the joint estimation of multiple impairments are derived. A minimum mean-square
error based receiver is then proposed to compensate the effect of multiple
impairments and decode each user's signal. Simulation results show that the
performance of the proposed estimators is very close to the derived CRLBs at
moderate-to-high signal-to-noise-ratios. It is also shown that the bit-error
rate performance of the overall AF TWRN is close to a TWRN that is based on
assumption of perfect knowledge of the synchronization parameters.
