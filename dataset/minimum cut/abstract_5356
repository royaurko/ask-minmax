We use the axially-deformed Skyrme Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation
(QRPA) together with the SkM* energy-density functional, both as originally
presented and with the time-odd part adjusted to reproduce the Gamow-Teller
resonance energy in 208Pb, to calculate the matrix elements governing the
neutrinoless double-beta decay of 76Ge, 130Te, 136Xe, and 150Nd. Our matrix
elements in 130Te and 136Xe are significantly smaller than those of previous
QRPA calculations, primarily because of the difference in pairing or
deformation between the initial and final nuclei. In 76Ge and 150Nd our results
are similar to those of less computationally intensive QRPA calculations. We
suspect the 76Ge result, however, because we are forced to use a spherical
ground-state, even though the HFB indicates a deformed minimum.
