The chained Bell inequalities of Braunstein and Caves involving N settings
per observer have some interesting applications. Here we obtain the minimum
detection efficiency required for a loophole-free violation of the
Braunstein-Caves inequalities for any N > 2. We discuss both the case in which
both particles are detected with the same efficiency and the case in which the
particles are detected with different efficiencies.
