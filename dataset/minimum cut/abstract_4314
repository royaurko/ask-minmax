We investigate the lightlike limit of stationary spacelike string
configurations on a large class of five-dimensional asymptotically AdS
backgrounds. Specific examples include gravity duals which incorporate finite
't Hooft coupling, curvature-squared corrections, and chemical potentials. A
universal feature of these AdS/CFT models is that the string solution with
minimum action yields a lightlike Wilson loop whose leading behavior is
exponentially linear, rather than quadratic, in the width of the loop. Unless
there is a compelling reason for discarding the leading saddlepoint
contribution to the Wilson loop, following the proposal of Liu et. al. [2]
leads to zero jet-quenching parameter for all of these models.
