We present diffraction limited, 10um imaging polarimetry data for the central
regions of the archetypal Seyfert AGN, NGC1068. The position angle of
polarization is consistent with three dominant polarizing mechanisms. We
identify three distinct regions of polarization: (a) north of the nucleus,
arising from aligned dust in the NLR, (b) south, east and west of the nucleus,
consistent with dust being channeled toward the central engine and (c) a
central minimum of polarization consistent with a compact (<22pc) torus. These
observations provide continuity between the geometrically and optically thick
torus and the host galaxy's nuclear environments. These images represent the
first published mid-IR polarimetry from an 8-m class telescope and illustrate
the potential of such observations.
