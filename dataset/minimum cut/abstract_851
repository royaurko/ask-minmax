We present a scheme in which any pure qubit
$|\phi=\cos{\theta}|0+\sin{\theta}e^{i\varp hi}|1$ could be remotely prepared
by using minimum classical bits and the previously shared non-maximally
entangled states, on condition that the receiver holds the knowledge of
$\theta$. Several methods are available to check the trade-off between the
necessary entanglement resource and the achievable fidelity.
