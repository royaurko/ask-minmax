An analytic solution for Helfrich spontaneous curvature membrane model (H.
Naito, M.Okuda and Ou-Yang Zhong-Can, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 48}, 2304 (1993); {\bf
54}, 2816 (1996)), which has a conspicuous feature of representing the circular
biconcave shape, is studied. Results show that the solution in fact describes a
family of shapes, which can be classified as: i) the flat plane (trivial case),
ii) the sphere, iii) the prolate ellipsoid, iv) the capped cylinder, v) the
oblate ellipsoid, vi) the circular biconcave shape, vii) the self-intersecting
inverted circular biconcave shape, and viii) the self-intersecting nodoidlike
cylinder. Among the closed shapes (ii)-(vii), a circular biconcave shape is the
one with the minimum of local curvature energy.
