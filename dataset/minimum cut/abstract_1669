Magnetoresistance in the spin-density wave (SDW) state of (TMTSF)2PF6 is
known to exhibit a rich variety of the angular dependencies when a magnetic
field B is rotated in the b'-c*, a-b' and a-c* planes. In the presence of a
magnetic field the quasiparticle spectrum in the SDW with imperfect nesting is
quantized. In such a case the minimum quasiparticle energy depends both on the
magnetic field strength |B| and the angle \theta between the field and the
crystal direction a, b' or c*. This approach describes rather satisfactory the
magnetoresistance above T*~4K.
