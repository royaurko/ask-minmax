We report on spectroscopic and photometric observations through transits of
the exoplanets WASP-22b and WASP-26b, intended to determine the systems'
spin-orbit angles. We combine these data with existing data to refine the
system parameters. We measure a sky-projected spin-orbit angle of 22 +/- 16 deg
for WASP-22b, showing the planet's orbit to be prograde and, perhaps, slightly
misaligned. We do not detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect of WASP-26b due to
its low amplitude and observation noise. We place 3-sigma upper limits on
orbital eccentricity of 0.063 for WASP-22b and 0.050 for WASP-26b. After
refining the drift in the systemic velocity of WASP-22 found by Maxted et al.
(2010, AJ, 140, 2007) we find the third body in the system to have a
minimum-mass of 5.3 +/- 0.3 Mjup (a3/5 AU)^2, where a3 is the orbital distance
of the third body.
