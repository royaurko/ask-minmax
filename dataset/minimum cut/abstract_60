Zaslavsky conjectured the following: The minimum number of vertices to be
deleted to restore balance in a subcubic signed graph is the same as the
minimum number of edges to be deleted to restore balance. We prove this
conjecture. Also, we obtain a bound for these invariants in a special class of
signed graphs.
