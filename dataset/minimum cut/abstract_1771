We calculate QNMs of the scalar hairy black hole in the AdS background using
Horowitz-Hubeny method for the potential that is not known in analytical form.
For some black hole parameters we found pure imaginary frequencies. Increasing
of the scalar field mass does not cause the imaginary part to vanish, it
reaches some minimum and then increases, thus in the case under consideration
the infinitely long living modes (quasi-resonances) do not appear.
