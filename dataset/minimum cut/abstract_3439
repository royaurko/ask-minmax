The charged excitations in the system of the title are vortex-antivortex pairs
in the spin-texture described in the theory by Yang et al which, in the
commensurate phase, are bound together by a ``string''. It is shown that their
excitation energy drops as the string lengthens as the parallel magnetic field
approaches the critical value, then goes up again in the incommensurate phase.
This produces a sharp downward cusp at the critical point. An alternative
description based on the role of disorder in the tunnelling and which appears
not to produce a minimum in the excitation energy is also discussed. It is
suggested that a similar transition could also occur in compressible
Fermi-liquid-like states.
