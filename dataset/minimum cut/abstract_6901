Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the anisotropic charge transport
properties of both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric matter fields on
(2+1)-dimensional defects coupled to a (3+1)-dimensional N=4 SYM "heat bath".
  We focus on the cases of a finite external background magnetic field, finite
net charge density and finite mass and their combinations. In this context, we
also discuss the limitations due to operator mixing that appears in a few
situations and that we ignore in our analysis.
  At high frequencies, we discover a spectrum of quasi-particle resonances due
to the magnetic field and finite density and at small frequencies, we perform a
Drude-like expansion around the DC limit. Both of these regimes display many
generic features and some features that we attribute to strong coupling, such
as a minimum DC conductivity and an unusual behavior of the "cyclotron" and
plasmon frequencies, which become related to the resonances found in the
conformal case in an earlier paper. We further study the hydrodynamic regime
and the relaxation properties, from which the system displays a set of
different possible transitions to the collisionless regime. The mass dependence
can be cast in two regimes: a generic relativistic behavior dominated by the UV
and a non-linear hydrodynamic behavior dominated by the IR. In the massless
case, we furthermore extend earlier results from the literature to find an
interesting self-duality under a transformation of the conductivity and the
exchange of density and magnetic field.
