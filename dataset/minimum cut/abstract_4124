We numerically evaluate the expected performances of an optical frequency
standard at 729 nm based on a single calcium ion. The frequency stability is
studied through the Allan deviation and its dependence on the excitation method
(single Rabi pulse or two Ramsey pulses schemes) and the laser linewidth are
discussed. The minimum Allan deviation that can be expected is estimated to
$\sigma_y(\tau) \approx 2.5\times 10^{-15}/\sqrt{\tau}$ with $\tau$ the
integration time. The frequency shifts induced by the environmental conditions
are evaluated to minimize the uncertainty of the proposed standard by chosing
the most suited environment for the ion. If using the odd isotope
$^{43}$Ca$^{+}$ and a vessel cooled to 77 K, the expected relative shift is $-2
\times 10^{-16}$ with an uncertainty of $\pm 4\times10^{-16}$, mainly due to
the quadrupole shift induced by the unknown static electric field gradient .
