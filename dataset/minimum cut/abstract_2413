We calculate the inclusive spectra of secondaries produced in soft (minimum
bias) p+Pb collisions in the framework of Quark-Gluon String Model at LHC
energy, and by taking into account the inelastic screening corrections
(percolation effects). The role of these effects is expected to be very large
at very high energies, and they should decrease the spectra about 3 times in
the midrapidity region and increase them about 2 times in the fragmentation
region at the energy of LHC.
