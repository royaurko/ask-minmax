The local electronic structure of N atoms in a diluted GaAs1-xNx (x=3%)
alloy, in view of applications in optoelectronics, is determined for the first
time using soft-X-ray absorption (SXA) and emission (SXE). Deviations from
crystalline GaN, in particular in the conduction band, are dramatic. Employing
the orbital character and elemental specificity of the SXE/SXA spectroscopies,
we identify a charge transfer from the N atoms at the valence band maximum,
reducing the overlap with the wavefunction in conduction band minimum, as the
main factor limiting the optical efficiency of GaAs1-xNx alloys. Moreover, a
k-conserving process of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering involving the L1
derived valence and conduction states is discovered.
