We discuss minimal non-supersymmetric models of resonant leptogenesis, based
on an approximate flavour symmetries. As an illustrative example, we consider a
resonant tau-leptogenesis model, compatible with universal right-handed
neutrino masses at the GUT scale, where the required heavy-neutrino mass
splittings are generated radiatively. In particular, we explicitly demonstrate,
how a minimum number of three heavy Majorana neutrinos is needed, in order to
obtain successful leptogenesis and experimentally testable rates for processes
of lepton flavour violation, such as mu --> e gamma and mu --> e conversion in
nuclei.
