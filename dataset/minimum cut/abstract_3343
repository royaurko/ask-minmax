Since the beginning of precise Doppler surveys, which have had stunning
success in detecting extrasolar planetary companions, one surprising enigma has
emerged: the relative paucity of spectroscopic binaries where the secondary
mass lies in between the stellar and planetary mass regime. This gap in the
mass function for close-in (a < 3 - 4 AU) companions to solar-type stars is
generally referred to as the ``Brown Dwarf Desert''. Here we report the
detection of a companion to HD 137510 (G0IV), with a minimum mass of 26
M_Jupiter, moving in an eccentric orbit (e=0.4) with a period of 798 days and
an orbital semimajor axis of 1.85 AU. The detection is based on precise
differential radial velocity (RV) data obtained by the McDonald Observatory and
Thueringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg planet search programs.
