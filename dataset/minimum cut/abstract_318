We study the possibility of canceling the cosmological constant in supergravity
string models. We show that with a suitable choice of superpotential the vacuum
energy may vanish with the dilaton field at its minimum and supersymmetry
broken with a large hierarchy. We derive the condition for which the
introduction of a chiral potential, e.g. the inflaton potential, does not
destabilize the dilaton field even in the region where the scalar potential
takes positive values. This allows for an inflationary potential with the
dilaton frozen at its minimum.
