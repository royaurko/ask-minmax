The jets are the final state manifestation of the hard parton scattering.
Since at LHC energies the production of hard processes in proton-proton
collisions will be copious and varied, it is important to develop methods to
identify them through the study of their final states. In the present work we
describe a method based on the use of some shape variables to discriminate
events according their topologies. A very attractive feature of this analysis
is the possibility of using the tracking information of the TPC+ITS in order to
identify specific events like jets. Through the correlation between the
quantities: thrust and recoil, calculated in minimum bias simulations of
proton-proton collisions at 10 TeV, we show the sensitivity of the method to
select specific topologies and high multiplicity. The presented results were
obtained both at level generator and after reconstruction. It remains that with
any kind of jet reconstruction algorithm one will confronted in general with
overlapping jets. The present method determines areas where one does encounter
special topologies of jets in an event. The aim is not to supplant the usual
jet reconstruction algorithms, but rather to allow an easy selection of events
allowing then the application of algorithms.
