Assuming the Minimal Flavour Violation hypothesis, we derive the general
scalar potential for fields whose background values are the Yukawa couplings.
We analyze the minimum of the potential and discuss the fine-tuning required to
dynamically generate the mass hierarchies and the mixings between different
quark generations. Two main cases are considered, corresponding to Yukawa
interactions being effective operators of dimension five or six (or,
equivalently, resulting from bi-fundamental and fundamental scalar fields,
respectively). At the renormalizable and classical level, no mixing is
naturally induced from dimension five Yukawa operators. On the contrary, from
dimension six Yukawa operators one mixing angle and a strong mass hierarchy
among the generations result.
