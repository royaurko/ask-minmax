Angular momentum transport must have occurred in the Sun's radiative zone to
explain its current solid body rotation. We survey the stability of the early
Sun's radiative zone with respect to diffusive rotational instabilities, for a
variety of plausible past configurations. We find that the (faster rotating)
early Sun was prone to rotational instabilities even if only weak levels of
radial differential rotation were present, while the current Sun is not.
Stability domains are determined by approximate balance between dynamical and
diffusive timescales, allowing generalizations to other stellar contexts.
Depending on the strength and geometry of the weak magnetic field present, the
fastest growing unstable mode can be hydrodynamic or magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
in nature. Our results suggest that diffusive MHD modes may be more efficient
at transporting angular momentum than their hydrodynamic
(``Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke'') counterparts because the minimum spatial scale
required for magnetic tension to be destabilizing limits the otherwise very
small scales favored by double-diffusive instabilities. Diffusive
magneto-rotational instabilities are thus attractive candidates for angular
momentum transport in the early Sun's radiative zone.
