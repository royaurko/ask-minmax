Jet systems with two unequal components interact with their parent accretion
disks through the asymmetric removal of linear momentum from the star-disk
system. We show that as a result of this interaction, the disk's state of least
energy is not made up of orbits that lie in a plane containing the star's
equator as in a disk without a jet. The disk's profile has the shape of a
sombrero curved in the direction of acceleration. For this novel state of
minimum energy, we derive the temperature profile of thin disks. The flaring
geometry caused by the sombrero profile increases the disk temperature
especially in its outer regions. The jet-induced acceleration disturbs the
vertical equilibrium of the disk leading to mass loss in the form of a
secondary wind emanating from the upper face of the disk. Jet time variability
causes the disk to radially expand or contract depending on whether the induced
acceleration increases or decreases. Jet time variability also excites vertical
motion and eccentric distortions in the disk and affects the sombrero profile's
curvature. These perturbations lead to the heating of the disk through its
viscous stresses as it tries to settle into the varying state of minimum
energy. The jet-disk interaction studied here will help estimate the duration
of the jet episode in star-disk systems and may explain the origin of the
recently observed one-sided molecular outflow of the HH 30 disk-jet system.
