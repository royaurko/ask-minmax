Transport property is investigated in
[Ca$_{2}$CoO$_{3-\delta}$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_{2}$] single crystals obtained by
varying annealing conditions. The $\rho_{ab}(T)$ exhibits a resistivity
minimum, and the temperature corresponding to this minimum increases with the
loss of oxygen content, indicative of the enhancement of spin density wave
(SDW). Large negative magnetoresistance (MR) was observed in all single
crystals [Ca$_{2}$CoO$_{3-\delta}$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_{2}$], while a
magnetic-field-driven insulator-to-metal (IM) transition in oxygen annealed
samples. These results suggest a ferromagnetic correlation in system enhanced
by oxygen content. In addition, a low temperature thermal activation
resistivity induced by fields was observed in single crystals annealed in
oxygen atmosphere.
