To elucidate the origin of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnetic
transition metals, we study the intrinsic AHE based on a multi-orbital
(xz,yz)-tight-binding model. We find that a large anomalous velocity comes from
the off-diagonal (inter-orbital) hopping. By this reason, the present model
shows a large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) which is compatible
with typical experimental values in ferromagnets [100-1000 [1/\Omega cm]],
without necessity to assume a special band structure at the Fermi level. In
good metals where resistivity \rho is small, the intrinsic AHC is constant
(dissipation-less) as found by Karplus and Luttinger. In bad metals, however,
we find that the AHC is proportional to \rho^{-2} when \hbar/2\tau is larger
than the minimum band-splitting measured from the Fermi level. This crossover
behavior of the intrinsic AHE, which was first derived in J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 63
(1994) 2627, is recently observed in various ferromagnetic metals universally
by A. Asamitsu et al. We also stress that the present (xz,yz)-tight binding
model shows a huge spin Hall effect in a paramagnetic state.
