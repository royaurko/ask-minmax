A new optical design concept of telescopes to provide an aberration-free,
wide field, unvignetted flat focal plane is described. The system employs three
aspheric mirrors to remove aberrations, and provides a semi-circular field of
view with minimum vignetting. The third mirror reimages the intermediate image
made by the first two-mirror system with a magnification factor on the order of
unity. The present system contrasts with the Korsch system where the
magnification factor of the third mirror is usually much larger than unity. Two
separate optical trains can be deployed to cover the entire circular field, if
necessary.
