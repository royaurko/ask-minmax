A 5-MeV RFQ designed for a proton current up to 100-mA CW is now under
construction as part of the High Intensity Proton Injector project (IPHI). Its
computed transmission is greater than 99 %. The main goals of the project are
to verify the accuracy of the design codes, to gain the know-how on
fabrication, tuning procedures and operations, to measure the output beam
characteristics in order to optimise the higher energy part of the linac, and
to reach a high availability with minimum beam trips. A cold model has been
built to develop the tuning procedure. The present status of the IPHI RFQ is
presented.
