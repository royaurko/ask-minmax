The Wilson loop in the non-commutative dipole field theory is re-examined
within the framework of dual gravity description. In contrast to the previous
investigations, we let the dual string be moving along the deformed $S^5$ and
find the exact expression of the interquark potential. The potential shows a
Coulomb behavior at all distance and does not have a minimum distance between
quarks, which exhibits in the static configuration. After comparing the
potential of the static and moving configurations we find that while the dual
string is static at long distance it will transit to a moving configuration at
short distance. We also analyze an electric dipole system and find that it
shows a similar transition property. Finally, we mention the unsuitable
approximation made in the previous paper [hep-th/0701069] and find that the
interquark potential in a gauge theory with a non-constant non-commutativity
has a Coulomb behavior at all distance.
