We have performed accurate \emph{ab--initio} pseudopotential calculations for
the structural and electronic properties of ZnSe/GaAs(001) heterostructures
with interface configurations accounting for charge neutrality prescriptions.
Beside the simplest configurations with atomic interdiffusion we consider also
some configurations characterized by As depletion and cation vacancies,
motivated by the recent successfull growth of ZnSe/GaAs pseudomorphic
structures with minimum stacking fault density characterized by the presence of
a defected (Zn,Ga)Se alloy in the interface region. We find that--under
particular thermodynamic conditions--some defected configurations are favoured
with respect to undefected ones with simple anion or cation mixing, and that
the calculated band offsets for some defected structures are compatible with
those measured. Although it is not possible to extract indications about the
precise interface composition and vacancy concentration, our results support
the experimental indication of (Zn,Ga)Se defected compounds in high-quality
ZnSe/GaAs(001) heterojunctions with low native stacking fault density. The
range of measured band offset suggests that different atoms at interfaces
rearrange, with possible presence of vacancies, in such a way that not only
local charges but also ionic dipoles are vanishing.
