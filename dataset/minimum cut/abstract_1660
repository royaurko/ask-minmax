The visible band (band A) of Photoluminescence spectra of high-purity
synthesized diamond is analyzed by deconvolution technique. A set of eight
lines with distinct peak energy are found. The peak energy and the width of
these lines were either constant or varies very slightly with temperature. The
amplitude of the lines are significantly temperature. The closeness of the
temperature that the amplitudes of these lines reach their minimum and the
temperature which the Free-exiton emission is maximum at, is an indication of
the competition between these too effects.
