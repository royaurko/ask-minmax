Crowd management is a complex, challenging and crucial task. Lack of
appropriate management of crowd has, in past, led to many unfortunate stampedes
with significant loss of life. To increase the crowd management efficiency, we
deploy automated real time detection of stampede prone areas. Then, we use
robotic agents to aid the crowd management police in controlling the crowd in
these stampede prone areas. While doing so, we aim for minimum interference by
robotic agents in our environment. Thereby not disturbing the ambiance and
aesthetics of the place. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model in dealing
with difficult scenarios like emergency evacuation and presence of localized
congestion. Lastly, we simulate a multi agent system based on our model and use
it to illustrate the utility of robotic agents for detecting and reducing
congestion.
