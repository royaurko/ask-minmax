We study the probability of arbitrary density profiles in conserving
diffusive fields which are driven by the boundaries. We demonstrate the
existence of singularities in the large-deviation functional, the direct analog
of the free-energy in non-equilibrium systems. These singularities are unique
to non-equilibrium systems and are a direct consequence of the breaking of
time-reversal symmetry. This is demonstrated in an exactly-solvable model and
also in numerical simulations on a boundary-driven Ising model. We argue that
this singular behavior is expected to occur in models where the compressibility
has a deep enough minimum. The mechanism is explained using a simple model.
