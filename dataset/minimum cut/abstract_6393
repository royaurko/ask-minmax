The experimental time scale dependence of thermodynamic relations in
out-of-equilibrium systems with aging phenomena is investigated theoretically
by using only aging properties of the two-time correlation functions and the
generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). We show that there are two
experimental time regimes characterized by different thermal properties. In the
first regime where the waiting time is much longer than the measurement time,
the principle of minimum work holds even though a system is out of equilibrium.
In the second regime where both the measurement time and the waiting time are
long, the thermal properties are completely different from properties in
equilibrium. For the single-correlation-scale systems such as $p$-spin
spherical spin-glasses, contrary to a fundamental assumption of thermodynamics,
the work done in an infinitely slow operation depends on the path of change of
the external field even when the waiting time is infinite. On the other hand,
for the multi-correlation-scale systems such as Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model,
the work done in an infinitely slow operation is independent of the path. Our
results imply that in order to describe thermodynamic properties of systems
with aging it is essential to consider the experimental time scales and history
of a system as a state variable is necessary.
