Tunnel amplitudes of molecular configurations (like neuronal channel pores)
may be very sensitive to thermal vibrations of the barrier width
(vibration-assisted tunneling) resulting in pseudo-random spikes of widely
varying sizes. An observer who ``lives'' behind the barrier would experience as
an ``event'' an accidental minimum of the barrier width, the timing being
determined by the microstate of the neuron's heat bath. In two neurons, set to
detect a ``left'' or ``right'' state of an object, firing amplitudes typically
differ so much as to produce a quasi-selection of one option.
