In a previous paper we examined a geometric measure of entanglement based on
the minimum distance between the entangled target state of interest and the
space of unnormalized product states. Here we present a detailed study of this
entanglement measure for target states with a large degree of symmetry. We
obtain analytic solutions for the extrema of the distance function and solve
for the Hessian to show that, up to the action of trivial symmetries, the
solutions correspond to local minima of the distance function. In addition, we
show that the conditions that determine the extremal solutions for general
target states can be obtained directly by parametrizing the product states via
their Schmidt decomposition.
