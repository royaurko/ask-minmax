We study the kinematically narrow, low-ionization line emission from a
bright, starburst galaxy at z = 0.69 using slit spectroscopy obtained with
Keck/LRIS. The spectrum reveals strong absorption in MgII and FeII resonance
transitions with Doppler shifts of -200 to -300 km/s, indicating a cool gas
outflow. Emission in MgII near and redward of systemic velocity, in concert
with the observed absorption, yields a P Cygni-like line profile similar to
those observed in the Ly alpha transition in Lyman Break Galaxies. Further, the
MgII emission is spatially resolved, and extends significantly beyond the
emission from stars and HII regions within the galaxy. Assuming the emission
has a simple, symmetric surface brightness profile, we find that the gas
extends to distances > ~7 kpc. We also detect several narrow FeII*
fine-structure lines in emission near the systemic velocity, arising from
energy levels which are radiatively excited directly from the ground state. We
suggest that the MgII and FeII* emission is generated by photon scattering in
the observed outflow, and emphasize that this emission is a generic prediction
of outflows. These observations provide the first direct constraints on the
minimum spatial extent and morphology of the wind from a distant galaxy.
Estimates of these parameters are crucial for understanding the impact of
outflows in driving galaxy evolution.
