Now a days, the text document is spontaneously increasing over the internet,
e-mail and web pages and they are stored in the electronic database format. To
arrange and browse the document it becomes difficult. To overcome such problem
the document preprocessing, term selection, attribute reduction and maintaining
the relationship between the important terms using background knowledge,
WordNet, becomes an important parameters in data mining. In these paper the
different stages are formed, firstly the document preprocessing is done by
removing stop words, stemming is performed using porter stemmer algorithm, word
net thesaurus is applied for maintaining relationship between the important
terms, global unique words, and frequent word sets get generated, Secondly,
data matrix is formed, and thirdly terms are extracted from the documents by
using term selection approaches tf-idf, tf-df, and tf2 based on their minimum
threshold value. Further each and every document terms gets preprocessed, where
the frequency of each term within the document is counted for representation.
The purpose of this approach is to reduce the attributes and find the effective
term selection method using WordNet for better clustering accuracy. Experiments
are evaluated on Reuters Transcription Subsets, wheat, trade, money grain, and
ship, Reuters 21578, Classic 30, 20 News group (atheism), 20 News group
(Hardware), 20 News group (Computer Graphics) etc.
