New general spherically symmetric solutions have been derived with a
cosmological "constant" \Lambda as a source. This \Lambda field is not constant
but it satisfies the properties of the asymptotically safe gravity at the
ultraviolet fixed point. The importance of these solutions comes from the fact
that they describe the near to the centre region of black hole spacetimes as
this is modified by the Renormalization Group scaling behaviour of the fields.
The consistent set of field equations which respect the Bianchi identities is
derived and solved. One of the solutions (with conventional sign of
temporal-radial metric components) is timelike geodesically complete, and
although there is still a curvature divergent origin, this is never
approachable by an infalling massive particle which is reflected at a finite
distance due to the repulsive origin. Another family of solutions (of both
signatures) range from a finite radius outwards, they cannot be extended to the
centre of spherical symmetry, and the curvature invariants are finite at the
minimum radius.
