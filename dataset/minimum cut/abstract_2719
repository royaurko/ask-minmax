1RXS J232953.9+062814 was identified as a cataclysmic variable by Wei et al.
(1999). Four low-resolution spectra of 1RXS J232953.9+062814 were obtained by
using the 2.16-m telescope of the National Astronomical Observatories, in which
two of them were at outburst, and the other two were at quiescence. The system
is about 16.8 B and 16.5 V at quiescence, and 12.6 B and 12.6 V at outburst.
The quiescent spectra were dominated by double-peaked Balmer emissions, which
indicates a hydrogen-rich system with a high-inclination accretion disc. MgH
and TiO absorption bands appeared in the quiescent spectrum imply a companion
with a spectral type of early M dwarf. If we take it as a M0 dwarf, the system
is located at a distance of 350 pc with a proper motion velocity 150 km
s$^{-1}$. The superhump period of 0.046311 days (Uemura et al. 2001) was
confirmed by our V photometry. The short period and the hydrogen-rich nature
reveal that this system is another SU Ursae Majoris-type dwarf nova below the
period minimum after V485 Centauri. 1RXS J232953.9+062814 is one of the most
important systems for studying the evolutionary scenario of cataclysmic
variables since it is much brighter than V485 Cen.
