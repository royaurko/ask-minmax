Can we determine a spin parameter of a black hole by observation of a black
hole shadow in an accretion disk? In order to answer this question, we make a
qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis of a shape and a position of a
black hole shadow casted by a rotating black hole on an optically thick
accretion disk and its dependence on an angular momentum of a black hole. We
have found black hole shadows with a quite similar size and a shape for largely
different black hole spin parameters and a same black hole mass. Thus, it is
practically difficult to determine a spin parameter of a black hole from a size
and a shape of a black hole shadow in an accretion disk. We newly introduce a
bisector axis of a black hole shadow named a shadow axis. For a rotating black
hole a shape and a position of a black hole shadow are not symmetric with
respect to a rotation axis of a black hole shadow. So, in this case the minimum
interval between a mass center of a black hole and a shadow axis is finite. An
extent of this minimum interval is roughly proportional to a spin parameter of
a black hole for a fixed inclination angle between a rotation axis of a black
hole and a direction of an observer. In order to measure a spin parameter of a
black hole, if a shadow axis is determined observationally, it is crucially
important to determine a position of a mass center of a black hole in a region
of a black hole shadow.
