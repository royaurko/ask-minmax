This work develops a cross correlation maximization technique, based on
statistical concepts, for pattern matching purposes in time series. The
technique analytically quantifies the extent of similitude between a known
signal within a group of data, by means of a single parameter. Specifically,
the method was applied to voice recognition problem, by selecting samples from
a given individual recordings of the 5 vowels, in Spanish. The frequency of
acquisition of the data was 11.250 Hz. A certain distinctive interval was
established from each vowel time series as a representative test function and
it was compared both to itself and to the rest of the vowels by means of an
algorithm, for a subsequent graphic illustration of the results.
  We conclude that for a minimum distinctive length, the method meets
resemblance between every vowel with itself, and also an irrefutable difference
with the rest of the vowels for an estimate length of 30 points (~2 10-3 s).
