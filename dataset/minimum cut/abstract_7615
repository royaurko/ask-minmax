We consider broadcasting a block of packets to multiple wireless receivers
under random packet erasures using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC).
The sender first broadcasts each packet uncoded once, then generates coded
packets according to receivers' feedback about their missing packets. We focus
on strict IDNC (S-IDNC), where each coded packet includes at most one missing
packet of every receiver. But we will also compare it with general IDNC
(G-IDNC), where this condition is relaxed. We characterize two fundamental
performance limits of S-IDNC: 1) the number of transmissions to complete the
broadcast, and 2) the average delay for a receiver to decode a packet. We
derive a closed-form expression for the expected minimum number of
transmissions in terms of the number of packets and receivers and the erasure
probability. We prove that it is NP-hard to minimize the decoding delay of
S-IDNC. We also derive achievable upper bounds on the above two performance
limits. We show that G-IDNC can outperform S-IDNC %in terms of the number of
transmissions without packet erasures, but not necessarily with packet
erasures. Next, we design optimal and heuristic S-IDNC transmission schemes and
coding algorithms with full/intermittent receiver feedback. We present
simulation results to corroborate the developed theory and compare with
existing schemes.
