We use 429 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data collected at the
$\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the BABAR detector to measure the radiative
transition rate of $b\rightarrow s\gamma$ with a sum of 38 exclusive final
states. The inclusive branching fraction with a minimum photon energy of 1.9
GeV is found to be $\mathcal{B}(\bar B \rightarrow X_{s}\gamma)=(3.29\pm
0.19\pm 0.48)\times 10^{-4}$ where the first uncertainty is statistical and the
second is systematic. We also measure the first and second moments of the
photon energy spectrum and extract the best fit values for the heavy-quark
parameters, $m_{b}$ and $\mu_{\pi}^{2}$, in the kinetic and shape function
models.
