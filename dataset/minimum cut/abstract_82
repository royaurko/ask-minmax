We present lower bounds on the minimum pseudocodeword effective Euclidean
distance (or minimum "pseudodistance") for coded modulation systems using
linear codes with $q$-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation over the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. These bounds apply to both binary and
nonbinary coded modulation systems which use direct modulation mapping of coded
symbols. The minimum pseudodistance may serve as a first-order measure of
error-correcting performance for both linear-programming and message-passing
based receivers. In the case of a linear-programming based receiver, the
minimum pseudodistance may be used to form an exact bound on the codeword error
rate of the system.
