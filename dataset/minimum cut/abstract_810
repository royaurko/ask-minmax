We consider the tunneling Density of States (DoS) of superconducting films
driven to the paramagnetic phase by the Zeeman splitting. We show that there is
minimum in the DoS whose position depends on the orientation of the applied
field. This dependence, not predicted by previous theoretical calculations, is
in agreement with a recent experiment.
