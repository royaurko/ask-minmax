We study how coupling to supergravity affects the phase structure of a system
exhibiting dynamical supersymmetry breaking in a metastable vacuum. More
precisely, we consider the Seiberg dual of SQCD coupled to supergravity at
finite temperature. We show that the gravitational interactions decrease the
critical temperature for the second order phase transition in the quark
direction, that is also present in the global case. Furthermore, we find that,
due to supergravity, a new second order phase transition occurs in the meson
direction, whenever there is a nonvanishing constant term in the
superpotential. Notably, this phase transition is a necessary condition for the
fields to roll, as the system cools down, towards the metastable susy breaking
vacuum, because of the supergravity-induced shift of the metastable minimum
away from zero meson vevs. Finally, we comment on the phase structure of the
KKLT model with uplifting sector given by the Seiberg dual of SQCD.
