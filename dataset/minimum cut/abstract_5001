A propagation model of galactic cosmic protons through the Heliosphere was
implemented using a 2-D Monte Carlo approach to determine the differential
intensities of protons during the solar cycle 23. The model includes the
effects due to the variation of solar activity during the propagation of cosmic
rays from the boundary of the heliopause down to Earth's position. Drift
effects are also accounted for. The simulated spectra were found in agreement
with those obtained with experimental observations carried out by BESS, AMS and
PAMELA collaborations. In addition, the modulated spectrum determined with the
present code for the year 1995 exhibits the latitudinal gradient and equatorial
southward offset minimum found by Ulysses fast scan in 1995.
