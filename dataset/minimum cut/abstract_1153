We study the effect of thermal corrections on the evolution of moduli in
effective Supergravity models. This is motivated by previous results in the
literature suggesting that these corrections could alter and, even, erase the
presence of a minimum in the zero temperature potential, something that would
have disastrous consequences in these particular models. We show that, in a
representative sample of flux compactification constructions, this need not be
the case, although we find that the inclusion of thermal corrections can
dramatically decrease the region of initial conditions for which the moduli are
stabilised. Moreover, the bounds on the reheating temperature coming from
demanding that the full, finite temperature potential, has a minimum can be
considerably relaxed given the slow pace at which the evolution proceeds.
