In this paper we analyze the behavior of Galactic, LMC and SMC Cepheids in
terms of period-color (PC) and amplitude-color (AC) diagrams at the phases of
maximum, mean and minimum light. We find very different behavior between
Galactic and Magellanic Cloud Cepheids. Motivated by the recent report of a
break in LMC PC relations at 10 days (Tammann et al. 2002), we use the
F-statistical test to examine the PC relations at mean light in these three
galaxies. The results of the F-test support the existence of the a break in the
LMC PC(mean) relation, but not in the Galactic or SMC PC(mean) relations.
Furthermore, the LMC Cepheids also show a break at minimum light, which is not
seen in the Galactic and SMC Cepheids. We further discuss the effect on the
period-luminosity relations in the LMC due to the break in the PC(mean)
relation.
