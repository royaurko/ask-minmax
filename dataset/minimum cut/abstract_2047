Motivated by the description of the graphene electronic structure in terms of
the relativistic Dirac equation, a generalization to four dimensions yields a
strictly local fermion action describing two species and possessing an exact
chiral symmetry. This is the minimum number of species required by the well
known ``no-go'' theorems.
