In this paper, we present our HARPS radial-velocity data for eight
low-activity solar-type stars belonging to the HARPS volume-limited sample:
HD6718, HD8535, HD28254, HD290327, HD43197, HD44219, HD148156, and HD156411.
Keplerian fits to these data reveal the presence of low-mass companions around
these targets. With minimum masses ranging from 0.58 to 2.54 MJup, these
companions are in the planetary mass domain. The orbital periods of these
planets range from slightly less than one to almost seven years. The eight
orbits presented in this paper exhibit a wide variety of eccentricities: from
0.08 to above 0.8.
