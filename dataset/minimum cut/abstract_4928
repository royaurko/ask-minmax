A maximum entropy-based framework is presented for the synthesis of
projections from multiple Earth climate models. This identifies the most
representative (most probable) model from a set of climate models -- as defined
by specified constraints -- eliminating the need to calculate the entire set.
Two approaches are developed, based on individual climate models or ensembles
of models, subject to a single cost (energy) constraint or competing
cost-benefit constraints. A finite-time limit on the minimum cost of modifying
a model synthesis framework, at finite rates of change, is also reported.
