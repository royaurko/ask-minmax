In this paper, an over-sampled periodogram higher criticism (OPHC) test is
proposed for the global detection of sparse periodic effects in a
complex-valued time series. An explicit minimax detection boundary is
established between the number and magnitude of the complex sinusoids hidden in
the series. The OPHC test is shown to be asymptotically powerful in the
detectable region. Numerical simulations illustrate and verify the
effectiveness of the proposed test. Furthermore, the periodogram over-sampled
by O(log N) is proven universally optimal in global testing for periodicities
under a mild minimum separation condition. Connections to the problem of
detecting a stream of pulses from frequency measurements in signal processing
is also discussed.
