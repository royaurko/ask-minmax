We show that stable localized topological soliton textures (skyrmions) with
$\pi_2$ topological charge $\nu \geq 1$ exist in a classical 2D Heisenberg
model of a ferromagnet with uniaxial anisotropy. For this model the soliton
exist only if the number of bound magnons exceeds some threshold value $N_{\rm
cr}$ depending on $\nu $ and the effective anisotropy constant $K_{\rm eff}$.
We define soliton phase diagram as the dependence of threshold energies and
bound magnons number on anisotropy constant. The phase boundary lines are
monotonous for both $\nu=1$ and $\nu >2$, while the solitons with $\nu=2$
reveal peculiar nonmonotonous behavior, determining the transition regime from
low to high topological charges. In particular, the soliton energy per
topological charge (topological energy density) achieves a minimum neither for
$\nu=1$ nor high charges, but rather for intermediate values $\nu=2$ or
$\nu=3$.
