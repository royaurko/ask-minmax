We investigate if consequential angular momentum losses (CAML) or an
intrinsic deformation of the donor star in CVs could increase the CV bounce
period from the canonical theoretical value ~65 min to the observed value
$P_{min} \approx77$ min, and if a variation of these effects in a CV population
could wash out the theoretically predicted accumulation of systems near the
minimum period (the period spike). We are able to construct suitably mixed CV
model populations that a statisticial test cannot rule out as the parent
population of the observed CV sample. However, the goodness of fit is never
convincing, and always slightly worse than for a simple, flat period
distribution. Generally, the goodness of fit is much improved if all CVs are
assumed to form at long orbital periods. The weighting suggested by King,
Schenker & Hameury (2002) does not constitute an improvment if a realistically
shaped input period distribution is used. Put your abstract here.
