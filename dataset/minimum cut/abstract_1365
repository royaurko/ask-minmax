The interplay between global constraints and local material properties of
chain molecules is a subject of emerging interest. Studies of molecules that
are intrinsically chiral, such as double-stranded DNA, is one example. Their
properties generally depend on the local geometry, i.e. on curvature and
torsion, yet the paths of closed molecules are globally restricted by topology.
Molecules that fulfill a twist neutrality condition, a zero sum rule for the
incremental change in the rate of winding along the curve, will behave
neutrally to strain. This has implications for plasmids. For small circular
microDNAs it follows that there must exist a minimum length for these to be
double-stranded. It also follows that all microDNAs longer than the minimum
length must be concave. This counterintuitive result is consistent with the
kink-like appearance which has been observed for circular DNA. A prediction for
the total negative curvature of a circular microDNA is given as a function of
its length.
