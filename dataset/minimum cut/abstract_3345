The X-ray spectrum of 1H 0707-495 obtained with XMM-Newton showing a deep
flux drop at ~7 keV (Boller et al. 2002) is studied based on the partial
covering concept. The previously inferred extreme iron overabundance can be
reduced down to ~3x solar if the hard component gradually steepens at high
energies. The spectral shape supports that 1H 0707-495 is an AGN analogue of
the galactic black-hole binaries in the soft state. Interpreting the soft
excess as the emission from an optically-thick disk, the minimum black hole
mass M is estimated to be 2 x 10^6 solar masses from the intrinsic luminosity
corrected for partial covering. Based on the slim disk model, the observed disk
temperature implies that the luminosity is close to the Eddington limit. The
rapid and large flux variations with little change in the spectral shape can
also be explained, if not all, as due to changes in the partial covering
fraction. Partial covering may account for the large variability
characteristics of NLS1.
