We are concerned with the acoustic scattering problem by many small rigid
obstacles of arbitrary shapes.
  We give a sufficient condition on the number $M$ and the diameter $a$ of the
obstacles as well as the minimum distance $d$ between them under which the
Foldy-Lax approximation is valid.
  Precisely, if we use single layer potentials for the representation of the
scattered fields, as it is done sometimes in the literature, then this
condition is $(M-1)\frac{a}{d^2} <c$, with an appropriate constant $c$, while
if we use double layer potentials then a weaker condition of the form
$\sqrt{M-1}\frac{a}{d} <c$ is enough.
  In addition, we derive the error in this approximation explicitly in terms of
the parameters $M, a$ and $d$. The analysis is based, in particular, on the
precise scalings of the boundary integral operators between the corresponding
  Sobolev spaces. As an application, we study the inverse scattering by the
small obstacles in the presence of multiple scattering.
