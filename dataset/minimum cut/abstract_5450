A two-component model (TCM) for single-particle $p_t$ spectra describes 200
GeV p-p data accurately. Based on that TCM a spectrum hard component was
isolated that is related quantitatively to pQCD predictions for jet
fragmentation down to low jet energies ($\approx 3$ GeV). We here address
jet-related structure in 2D trigger-associated (TA) correlations as a
more-detailed method to explore the kinematic limits of low-energy jet
production and low-momentum jet fragment structure in p-p collisions. We derive
a TCM for p-p TA correlations that can be used to isolate 2D jet-related
structure. Inferred minimum-bias (mainly low-energy) jet-related TA
correlations may challenge several major assumptions about jet production in
p-p (and A-A) collisions. These results should be relevant to p-p
underlying-event studies and Monte Carlo predictions of multiple parton
interactions.
