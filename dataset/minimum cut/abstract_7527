Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powered by ultra-relativistic jets. Usually a
minimum value of the Lorentz factor of the relativistic bulk motion is obtained
based on the argument that the observed high energy photons ($\gg {\rm MeV}$)
can escape without suffering from absorption due to pair production. The exact
value, rather than a lower limit, of the Lorentz factor can be obtained if the
spectral cutoff due to such absorption is detected. With the good spectral
coverage of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on \textsl{Fermi}, measurements of
such cutoff become possible, and two cases (GRB~090926A and GRB~100724B) have
been reported to have high-energy cutoffs or breaks. We systematically search
for such high energy spectral cutoffs/breaks from the LAT and the Gamma-ray
burst monitor (GBM) observations of the prompt emission of GRBs detected since
August 2011. Six more GRBs are found to have cutoff-like spectral feature at
energies of $\sim10-500$~MeV. Assuming that these cutoffs are caused by
pair-production absorption within the source, the bulk Lorentz factors of these
GRBs are obtained. We further find that the Lorentz factors are correlated with
the isotropic gamma-ray luminosity of the bursts, indicating that more powerful
GRB jets move faster.
