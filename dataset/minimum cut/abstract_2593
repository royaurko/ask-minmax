This paper presents two new algorithms for fast calculating the Tukey depth
of dimensions $p \ge 3$. The first algorithm is naive, and can compute
\emph{exactly} the Tukey depth of a single point with complexity
$O\left(n^{p-1}\log(n)\right)$. Compared to the first, the second algorithm
further utilizes the \emph{quasiconcave} of the Tukey depth function, and hence
can be implemented with complexity less than $O\left(\frac{1}{2^{p-2}}
n^{p-1}\log(n)\right)$. Both of them are of \emph{combinatorial} properties.
Experiments show that the proposed algorithms require quite minimum memory and
run much faster than the existing procedures.
