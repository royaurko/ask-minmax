Response of pure Ising systems to time-dependent external magnetic fields,
like pulsed and oscillating fields, are discussed and compared here. Because of
the two time scales involved, namely the thermodynamic relaxation time of the
system and the pulse width or the time period of the external field,
dynamically broken symmetric phases appear spontaneously when both become
comparable. A particularly simple case is that of an Ising ferromagnet below
its static critical temperature, when it is perturbed for a short duration by a
pulsed magnetic field competing with the existing order in the system. If the
field strength and duration is more than the threshold (dependent on the
temperature), the system, and consequently the magnetization, switches from one
minimum to the other of the static free energy. This magnetization reversal
transition here shows intriguing dynamic transition behaviour, similar to those
for oscillating fields. Monte Carlo studies for such dynamic transitions are
discussed and compared with the mean field results for the same and the Monte
Carlo results for the oscillating field case. In particular, we discuss about
the Monte Carlo results for the fluctuations and their growth behaviour near
this magnetization reversal (dynamic) transition point.
