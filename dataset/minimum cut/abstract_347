We consider hadron production in deuteron gold collisions at RHIC in the
forward rapidity region. Treating the target nucleus as a Color Glass
Condensate and the projectile deuteron as a dilute system of valence quarks, we
obtain good agreement with the BRAHMS minimum bias data on charged hadron
production in the forward rapidity ($y=3.2$) and low $p_t$ region. We provide
predictions for neutral pion production in minimum bias deuteron gold
collisions in the forward rapidity region, $y=3.8$, measured by the STAR
collaboration at RHIC.
