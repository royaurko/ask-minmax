We consider the problem of partitioning the edge set of a graph $G$ into the
minimum number $\tau(G)$ of edge-disjoint complete bipartite subgraphs. We show
that for a random graph $G$ in $G(n,p)$, for $p$ is a constant no greater than
$1/2$, almost surely $\tau(G)$ is between $n- c(\ln_{1/p} n)^{3+\epsilon}$ and
$n - 2\ln_{1/(1-p)} n$ for any positive constants $c$ and $\epsilon$.
