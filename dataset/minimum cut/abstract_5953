This paper proposes a control theoretic framework to model and analyze the
self-organized pattern formation of molecular concentrations in biomolecular
communication networks, where bio-nanomachines, or biological cells,
communicate each other using cell-to-cell communication mechanism mediated by a
diffusible signaling molecule. We first introduce a feedback model
representation of the reaction-diffusion dynamics of biomolecular communication
networks. A systematic local stability/instability analysis tool is then
provided based on the root locus of the feedback system. Using the instability
analysis, we analytically derive the conditions for the self-organized spatial
pattern formation, or Turing pattern formation, of the bio-nanomachines. The
theoretical results are demonstrated on a novel biochemical circuit called
activator-repressor-diffuser system, and the Turing pattern formation is
numerically confirmed. Finally, we show that the activator-repressor-diffuser
system is a minimum biochemical circuit that admits self-organized patterns in
biomolecular communication networks.
