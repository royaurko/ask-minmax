This article concerns exact results on the minimum number of colors of a Fox
coloring over the integers modulo r, of a link with non-null determinant.
Specifically, we prove that whenever the least prime divisor of the determinant
of such a link and the modulus r is 2, 3, 5, or 7, then the minimum number of
colors is 2, 3, 4, or 4 (respectively) and conversely. We are thus led to
conjecture that for each prime p there exists a unique positive integer, m,
with the following property. For any link L of non-null determinant and any
modulus r such that p is the least prime divisor of the determinant of L and
the modulus r, the minimum number of colors of L modulo r is m.
