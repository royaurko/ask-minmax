Let $\hat H$ be an h-admissible pseudodifferential operator whose principal
symbol, $H$, has a unique non-degenerate global minimum. We give a simple proof
that the semi-classical asymptotics of the eigenvalues of $\hat H$
corresponding to the "bottom of the well" determine the Birkhoff normal form of
$H$ at the minimum. We treat both the resonant and the non-resonant cases.
