The resistance $r(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of edges that have
to be removed from $G$ to obtain a graph which is $\Delta(G)$-edge-colorable.
The paper relates the resistance to other parameters that measure how far is a
graph from being $\Delta$-edge-colorable. The first part considers regular
graphs and the relation of the resistance to structural properties in terms of
2-factors. The second part studies general (multi-) graphs $G$. Let $r_v(G)$ be
the minimum number of vertices that have to be removed from $G$ to obtain a
class 1 graph. We show that $\frac{r(G)}{r_v(G)} \leq \lfloor
\frac{\Delta(G)}{2} \rfloor$, and that this bound is best possible.
