The usual theory of plasma relaxation, based on the selective decay of
magnetic energy over the (global) magnetic helicity, predicts a force-free
state for a plasma. Such a force-free state is inadequate to describe most
realistic plasma systems occurring in laboratory and space plasmas as it
produces a zero pressure gradient and cannot couple magnetic fields with flow.
A different theory of relaxation has been proposed by many contributors, based on a
well-known principle of irreversible thermodynamics, the principle of minimum
entropy production rate which is equivalent to the minimum dissipation rate
(MDR) of energy. We demonstrate the applicability of minimum dissipative
relaxed states to various self-organized systems of magnetically confined
plasma in the laboratory and in the astrophysical context. Such relaxed states
are shown to produce a number of basic characteristics of laboratory plasma
confinement systems and solar arcade structure.
