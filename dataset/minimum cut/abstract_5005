In a very short time the experiments at the LHC have collected a large amount
of data that can be used to study minimum bias (MB) collisions and the
underlying event (UE) in great detail. The CDF PYTHIA 6.2 Tune DW predictions
for the LHC UE data at 900 GeV and 7 TeV are examined in detail. The behavior
of the UE at the LHC is roughly what we expected. The LHC PYTHIA 6.4 Tune Z1
does an excellent job describing the LHC UE data. The modeling of MB (i.e. the
overall inelastic cross section) is more complicated because one must include a
model of diffraction. The ability of PYTHIA Tune DW and Tune Z1 to
simultaneously describe both the UE in a hard scattering process and MB
collisions are studied. No model describes perfectly all the features of MB
collisions at the LHC.
