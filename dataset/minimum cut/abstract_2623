The effective potential in thermal gluodynamics has stable minima in
perturbation theory. There the Wilson line is center group valued and
eigenvalues of the Wilson line stay clustered. Calorons with non-trivial
holonomy contribute to one loop order a linear term in the holonomy. The sign
is such that the center group minimum stays stable.
