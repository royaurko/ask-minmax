There has been long-standing debate about the physical state and possible
phase transformations of confined liquids. In this report we show that a model
confined liquid can behave both as a Newtonian liquid with very little change
in its dynamics or as a pseudo-solid depending solely on the {\it rate} of
approach of the confining surfaces. Thus, the confined liquid does {\it not}
exhibit any confinement induced solidification in thermodynamic equilibrium.
Instead, solidification is induced kinetically, when the two confining surfaces
are approached with a minimum critical rate. This critical rate is surprisingly
slow, of the order of 6 \AA /s, explaining the frequent observation of
confinement induced solidification.
