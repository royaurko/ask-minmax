We present a general methodology for determining the gamma-ray flux from
annihilation of dark matter particles in Milky Way satellite galaxies, focusing
on two promising satellites as examples: Segue 1 and Draco. We use the
SuperBayeS code to explore the best-fitting regions of the Constrained Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) parameter space, and an independent MCMC
analysis of the dark matter halo properties of the satellites using published
radial velocities. We present a formalism for determining the boost from halo
substructure in these galaxies and show that its value depends strongly on the
extrapolation of the concentration-mass (c(M)) relation for CDM subhalos down
to the minimum possible mass. We show that the preferred region for this
minimum halo mass within the CMSSM with neutralino dark matter is ~10^-9-10^-6
solar masses. For the boost model where the observed power-law c(M) relation is
extrapolated down to the minimum halo mass we find average boosts of about 20,
while the Bullock et al (2001) c(M) model results in boosts of order unity. We
estimate that for the power-law c(M) boost model and photon energies greater
than a GeV, the Fermi space-telescope has about 20% chance of detecting a dark
matter annihilation signal from Draco with signal-to-noise greater than 3 after
about 5 years of observation.
