A measurement is presented of the charged hadron multiplicity in hadronic
PbPb collisions, as a function of pseudorapidity and centrality, at a collision
energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair. The data sample is collected using the CMS
detector and a minimum-bias trigger, with the CMS solenoid off. The number of
charged hadrons is measured both by counting the number of reconstructed
particle hits and by forming hit doublets of pairs of layers in the pixel
detector. The two methods give consistent results. The charged hadron
multiplicity density dN(ch)/d eta, evaluated at eta=0 for head-on collisions,
is found to be 1612 +/- 55, where the uncertainty is dominated by systematic
effects. Comparisons of these results to previous measurements and to various
models are also presented.
