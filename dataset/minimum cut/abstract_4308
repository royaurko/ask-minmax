We study the effect of tachyon condensation on a brane antibrane pair in
superstring theory separated in the transverse direction. The static properties
of the tachyon potential analyzed using level truncated string field theory
reproduces the desired property that the dependence of the minimum value of the
potential on the initial distance of separation between the branes decreases as
we include higher level terms. The rolling tachyon solution constructed using
the conformal field theory methods shows that if the initial separation between
the branes is less than a critical distance then the solution is described by
an exactly marginal deformation of the original conformal field theory where
the correlation functions of the deformed theory are determined completely in
terms of the correlation functions of the undeformed theory without any need to
regularize the theory. Using this we give an expression for the pressure on the
brane-antibrane system as a power series expansion in \exp(C x^0) for an
appropriate constant C.
