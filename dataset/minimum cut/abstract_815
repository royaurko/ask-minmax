In a previous preprint we defined an energy associated to every embedding of
a surface into $R^n$ or $S^n$. This energy is invariant under Moebius
tranformations and the "round" sphere is its only absolute minimum. Here we
sketch a proof of the compactness property for a variant of it. The details
will appear elsewhere.
