We consider the following singularly perturbed Neumann problem
\begin{eqnarray*} \ve^2 \Delta u -u +u^p = 0 \, \quad u>0 \quad {\mbox {in}}
\quad \Omega, \quad {\partial u \over \partial \nu}=0 \quad {\mbox {on}} \quad
\partial \Omega, \end{eqnarray*} where $p>2$ and $\Omega$ is a smooth and
bounded domain in $\R^2$. We construct a new class of solutions which consist
of large number of spikes concentrating on a {\bf segment} of the boundary
which contains a local minimum point of the mean curvature function and has the
same mean curvature at the end points. We find a continuum limit of ODE systems
governing the interactions of spikes and show that the mean curvature function
acts as {\em friction force}.
