We study variations of the lifetimes of high-degree solar p-modes in the
quiet and active Sun with the solar activity cycle. The lifetimes in the degree
range 300 - 600 and frequency 2.5 - 4.5 mHz were computed from SOHO/MDI data in
an area including active regions and quiet Sun using the time-distance
technique. We applied our analysis to the data in four different phases of
solar activity: in 1996 (at minimum), 1998 (rising phase), 2000 (at maximum)
and 2003 (declining phase). The results from the area with active regions show
that the lifetime decreases as activity increases. The maximal lifetime
variations are between solar minimum in 1996 and maximum in 2000; the relative
variation averaged over all mode degree values and frequencies is a decrease of
about 13%. The lifetime reductions relative to 1996 are about 7% in 1998 and
about 10% in 2003. The lifetime computed in the quiet region still decreases
with solar activity although the decrease is smaller. On average, relative to
1996, the lifetime decrease is about 4% in 1998, 10% in 2000 and 8% in 2003.
Thus, measured lifetime increases when regions of high magnetic activity are
avoided. Moreover, the lifetime computed in quiet regions also shows variations
with activity cycle.
