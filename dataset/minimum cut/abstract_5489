This seminal work aims to develop a fundamental approach in order to get a
consistent coupling constant between electromagnetic and gravitational fields
by using an electron that couples with a gravitational potential by means of
its electromagnetic fields. We get a tiny value for such coupling, giving a
possible explanation for the hierarchical problem. This coupling constant
depends on the speed of light and also an invariant minimum speed which
represents the lowest limit of speed for any particle with lower energy, thus
leading to a doubly (symmetrical) special relativity with two invariant speeds
given for higher and lower energies.
