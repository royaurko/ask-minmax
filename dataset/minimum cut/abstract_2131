In this report we present the first test run results from Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 9.2 GeV at RHIC. The large acceptance STAR detector has
collected ~3k minimum bias collisions during this test run. The azimuthal
anisotropy, identified particle spectra, particle ratios and HBT radii are
observed to be consistent with the previous measurements from CERN SPS at
similar center of mass energies. These results from the lowest collision energy
at RHIC demonstrate the STAR detector's readiness to collect high quality data
for the proposed Critical Point Search Program which allows us to explore the
QCD phase diagram.
