The solar cycle and its associated magnetic activity are the main drivers
behind changes in the interplanetary environment and Earth's upper atmosphere
(commonly referred to as space weather and climate). In recent years there has
been an effort to develop accurate solar cycle predictions, leading to nearly a
hundred widely spread predictions for the amplitude of solar cycle 24. Here we
show that cycle predictions can be made more accurate if performed separately
for each hemisphere, taking advantage of information about both the dipolar and
quadrupolar moments of the solar magnetic field during minimum.
