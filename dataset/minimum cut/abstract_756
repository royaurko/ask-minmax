In this paper, we present two control laws that are tailored for control
applications in which computational and/or communication resources are scarce.
Namely, we consider minimum attention control, where the `attention' that a
control task requires is minimised given certain performance requirements, and
anytime attention control, where the performance under the `attention' given by
a scheduler is maximised. Here, we interpret `attention' as the inverse of the
time elapsed between two consecutive executions of a control task. By focussing
on linear plants, by allowing for only a finite number of possible intervals
between two subsequent executions of the control task, by making a novel
extension to the notion of control Lyapunov functions and taking these novel
extended control Lyapunov function to be infinity-norm-based, we can formulate
the aforementioned control problems as online linear programs, which can be
solved efficiently. Furthermore, we provide techniques to construct suitable
infinity-norm-based extended control Lyapunov functions for our purposes.
Finally, we illustrate the resulting control laws using numerical examples. In
particular, we show that minimum attention control outperforms an alternative
implementation-aware control law available in the literature.
