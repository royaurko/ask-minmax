In the first phase of LHC data-taking ATLAS will measure the charged-particle
density at the initial center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV and then at 14 TeV. This
will allow us improve our knowledge of soft QCD models and pin-down
cross-sections of different classes of inelastic collisions at LHC energies. In
particular, the dominant non-diffractive interaction is a key process to
understanding QCD backgrounds when we reach higher luminosities. We highlight
two minimum-bias triggers, sensitive to particles in complementary ranges in
pseudo-rapidity, one based on signals from the Inner Detector, the other
explicitly designed to trigger on inelastic processes. Studies of their trigger
efficiencies as well as possible trigger biases are presented.
