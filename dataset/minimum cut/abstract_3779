A previous analysis of two-body Cabibbo allowed nonleptonic decays of $D^0$
mesons and of Cabibbo allowed and first-forbidden decays of $D^+$ and $D_s^+$
has been adjourned using more recent experimental data and extended to the
Cabibbo forbidden decays of $D^0$. Annihilation and W-exchange contributions as
well as final state interaction effects (assumed to be dominated by nearby
resonances) have been included and are in fact crucial to obtain a reasonable
agreement with the experimental data, which show large flavour SU(3)
violations. New fitting parameters are necessary to describe rescattering
effects for Cabibbo forbidden $D^0$ decays, given the lack of experimental
informations on isoscalar resonances. We keep their number to a minimum - three
- using phenomenologically based considerations. We also discuss CP violating
asymmetries.
