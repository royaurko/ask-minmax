We consider Kallenberg's hypothesis on the characteristic function of a
L\'{e}vy process and show that it allows the construction of weakly continuous
bridges of the L\'{e}vy process conditioned to stay positive. We therefore
provide a notion of normalized excursions L\'{e}vy processes above their
cumulative minimum. Our main contribution is the construction of a continuous
version of the transition density of the L\'{e}vy process conditioned to stay
positive by using the weakly continuous bridges of the L\'{e}vy process itself.
For this, we rely on a method due to Hunt which had only been shown to provide
upper semi-continuous versions. Using the bridges of the conditioned L\'{e}vy
process, the Durrett-Iglehart theorem stating that the Brownian bridge from $0$
to $0$ conditioned to remain above $-\varepsilon$ converges weakly to the
Brownian excursion as $\varepsilon \to0$, is extended to L\'{e}vy processes. We
also extend the Denisov decomposition of Brownian motion to L\'{e}vy processes
and their bridges, as well as Vervaat's classical result stating the
equivalence in law of the Vervaat transform of a Brownian bridge and the
normalized Brownian excursion.
