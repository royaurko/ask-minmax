Using the DensePak fiber optic array on the KPNO WIYN telescope, we have
obtained high S/N echelle spectra of the Na I D wavelength region toward the
central 27" x 43" of the globular cluster M15 at a spatial resolution of 4".
The spectra exhibit significant interstellar Na I absorption at LSR velocities
of +3 km/s (LISM component) and +68 km/s (IVC component). Both components vary
appreciably in strength on these scales. The derived Na I column densities
differ by a factor of 4 across the LISM absorption map and by a factor of 16
across the IVC map. Assuming distances of 500 pc and 1500 pc for the LISM and
IVC clouds, these maps show evidence of significant ISM structure down to the
minimum scales of 2000 AU and 6000 AU probed in these absorbers. The
smallest-scale N(Na I) variations observed in the M15 LISM and IVC maps are
typically comparable to or higher than the values found at similar scales in
previous studies of interstellar Na I structure toward binary stars. The
physical implications of the small and larger-scale Na I features observed in
the M15 maps are discussed in terms of variations in the H I column density as
well as in the Na ionization equilibrium.
