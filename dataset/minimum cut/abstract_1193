We present results for the moments of observed spectra in inclusive
semileptonic B-meson decays to charm hadrons Bbar --> X_c l- nubar. Moments of
the hadronic-mass and the combined mass-and-energy spectra for different
minimum electron or muon momenta between 0.8 and 1.9 GeV/c are obtained from a
sample of 232x10^{6} Y(4S) --> B Bbar events, collected with the BABAR detector
at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy B-meson factory at SLAC. We also present a
re-evaluation of the moments of electron-energy spectra and partial decay
fractions BR(Bbar --> X_c e- nubar for minimum electron momenta between 0.6 and
1.5 GeV/c based on a sample of 51x10^{6} Y(4S) --> B Bbar events. The
measurements are used for the extraction of the total decay fraction, the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element |V_cb|, the quark masses m_b and
m_c, and four heavy-quark QCD parameters in the framework of a Heavy Quark
Expansion (HQE). We find BR(Bbar --> X_c l- nubar) = (10.64 +/- 0.17 +/- 0.06)%
and |V_cb| = (42.05 +/- 0.45 +/- 0.70) x 10^{-3}.
