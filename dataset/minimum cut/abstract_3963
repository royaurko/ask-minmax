We study the motion of a BPS D3-brane in the NS5-brane ring background. The
radion field becomes tachyonic in this geometrical set up. We investigate the
potential of this geometrical tachyon in the cosmological scenario for
inflation as well as dark energy. We evaluate the spectra of scalar and tensor
perturbations generated during tachyon inflation and show that this model is
compatible with recent observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to
an extra freedom of the number of NS5-branes. It is not possible to explain the
origin of both inflation and dark energy by using a single tachyon field, since
the energy density at the potential minimum is not negligibly small because of
the amplitude of scalar perturbations set by CMB anisotropies. However
geometrical tachyon can account for dark energy when the number of NS5-branes
is large, provided that inflation is realized by another scalar field.
