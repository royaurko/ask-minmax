We present time-series observations, spectra and archival outburst data of a
newly-discovered variable star in Hercules, Var Her 04. Its orbital period,
mass ratio, and outburst amplitude resemble those of the UGWZ-type subclass of
UGSU dwarf novae. However, its supercycle and outburst light curve defy
classification as a clear UGWZ. Var Her 04 is most similar to the small group
of possible hydrogen-burning ``period bouncers'', dwarf novae that have passed
beyond the period minimum and returned.
