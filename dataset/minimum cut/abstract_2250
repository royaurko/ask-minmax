We describe the implementation details of the colour reconnection model in
the event generator Herwig++. We study the impact on final-state observables in
detail and confirm the model idea from colour preconfinement on the basis of
studies within the cluster hadronization model. Moreover, we show that the
description of minimum bias and underlying event data at the LHC is improved
with this model and present results of a tune to available data.
