The motion of a projectile with horizontal initial velocity V0, moving under
the action of the gravitational field and a drag force is studied analytically.
As it is well known, the projectile reaches a terminal velocity Vterm. There is
a curious result concerning the minimum speed Vmin; it turns out that the
minimum velocity is lower than the terminal one if V0 > Vterm and is lower than
the initial one if V0 < Vterm. These results show that the velocity is not a
monotonous function. If the initial speed is not horizontal, there is an angle
range where the velocity shows the same behavior mentioned previously. Out of
that range, the volocity is a monotonous function. These results come out from
numerical simulations.
