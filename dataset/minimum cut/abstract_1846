A coincident D-brane - anti-D-brane pair has a tachyonic mode. We present an
argument showing that at the classical minimum of the tachyonic potential the
negative energy density associated with the potential exactly cancels the sum
of the tension of the brane and the anti-brane, thereby giving a configuration
of zero energy density and restoring space-time supersymmetry.
