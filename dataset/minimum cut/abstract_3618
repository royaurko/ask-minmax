A theory is constructed to describe the zero-temperature jamming transition
as the density of repulsive soft spheres is increased. Local mechanical
stability imposes a constraint on the minimum number of bonds per particle; we
argue that this constraint suggests an analogy to $k$-core percolation. The
latter model can be solved exactly on the Bethe lattice, and the resulting
transition has a mixed first-order/continuous character. The exponents
characterizing the continuous part appear to be the same as for the jamming
transition. Finally, numerical simulations suggest that in finite dimensions
the $k$-core transition can be discontinuous with a nontrivial diverging
correlation length.
