In recent work, J. Hansen uses cohomological methods to find a lower bound
for the minimum distance of an evaluation code determined by a reduced complete
intersection in the projective plane. In this paper, we generalize Hansen's
results from P^2 to P^m; we also show that the hypotheses in Hansen's work may
be weakened. The proof is succinct and follows by combining the
Cayley-Bacharach theorem and bounds on evaluation codes obtained from reduced
zero-schemes.
