We investigate the out of equilibrium dynamics of global chiral supersymmetry
at finite energy density. We concentrate on two specific models. The first is
the massive Wess-Zumino model which we study in a selfconsistent one-loop
approximation. We find that for energy densities above a certain threshold, the
fields are driven dynamically to a point in field space at which the fermionic
component of the superfield is massless. The state, however is found to be
unstable, indicating a breakdown of the one-loop approximation. To investigate
further, we consider an O(N) massive chiral model which is solved exactly in
the large $N$ limit. For sufficiently high energy densities, we find that for
late times the fields reach a nonperturbative minimum of the effective
potential degenerate with the perturbative minimum. This minimum is a true
attractor for O(N) invariant states at high energy densities, and this provides
a mechanism for determining which of the otherwise degenerate vacua is chosen
by the dynamics. The final state for large energy density is a cloud of
massless particles (both bosons and fermions) around this new nonperturbative
supersymmetric minimum. By introducing boson masses which softly break the
supersymmetry, we demonstrate a see-saw mechanism for generating small fermion
masses. We discuss some of the cosmological implications of our results.
