We investigate whether a baryonic dark galaxy or `galaxy without stars' could
persist indefinitely in the local universe, while remaining stable against star
formation. To this end, a simple model has been constructed to determine the
equilibrium distribution and composition of a gaseous protogalactic disk.
Specifically, we determine the amount of gas that will transit to a Toomre
unstable cold phase via the H2 cooling channel in the presence of a UV--X-ray
cosmic background radiation field.
  All but one of the models are predicted to become unstable to star formation.
Moreover, we find that all our model objects would be detectable via HI line
emission, even in the case that star formation is potentially avoided. These
results are consistent with the non-detection of isolated extragalactic HI
clouds with no optical counterpart (galaxies without stars) by HIPASS.
  Additionally, where star formation is predicted to occur, we determine the
minimum interstellar radiation field required to restore gravothermal
stability, which we then relate to a minimum global star formation rate. This
leads to the prediction of a previously undocumented relation between HI mass
and star formation rate that is observed for a wide variety of dwarf galaxies
in the HI mass range 10^8--10^10 M_sun. The existence of such a relation
strongly supports the notion that the well observed population of dwarf
galaxies represent the minimum rates of self-regulating star formation in the
universe. (Barely abridged)
