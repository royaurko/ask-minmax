Single crystals of ZrAs1.4Se0.5 (PbFCl type structure) were grown by chemical
vapour transport. While their thermodynamic and transport properties are
typical for ordinary metals, the electrical resistivity exhibits a shallow
minimum at low temperatures. Application of strong magnetic fields does not
influence this anomaly. The minimum of the resistivity in ZrAs1.4Se0.5
apparently originates from interaction between the conduction electrons and
structural two-level systems. Significant disorder in the As-Se substructure is
inferred from X-ray diffraction and electron microprobe studies.
