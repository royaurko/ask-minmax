Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph with edge-density $p$. Following Erd\H{o}s, \L
uczak and Spencer, an $m$-vertex subgraph H of G is called full if it has
minimum degree at least $p(m - 1)$. Let $f(G)$ denote the order of a largest
full subgraph of $G$, and let $f_p(n)$ denote the minimum of $f(G)$ over all
$n$-vertex graphs $G$ with edge-density $p$.
  In this paper we show that for $p$: $n^{-2/3} <p< 1-n^{-1/5}$, the function
$f_p(n)$ is of order at least $(1-p)^{1/3} n^{2/3}$, improving on an earlier
lower bound of Erd\H{o}s, \L uczak and Spencer in the case $p=1/2$. Moreover we
show that this bound is tight: for infinitely many $p$ near the elements of
$\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \ldots \}$ we have $f_p(n)= \Theta
(n^{2/3})$
  As an ingredient of the proof, we show that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices
has a subgraph $H$ on $m$ vertices with $\frac{n}{r}-1< m <\frac{n}{r}+2$ such
that for every every vertex $v$ in $V(H)$ the degree of $v$ in $H$ is at least
$\frac{1}{r}$ times its degree in $G$. Finally, we discuss full subgraphs of
random and pseudorandom graphs, and introduce several open problems.
