Product LDPC codes take advantage of LDPC decoding algorithms and the high
minimum distance of product codes. We propose to add suitable interleavers to
improve the waterfall performance of LDPC decoding. Interleaving also reduces
the number of low weight codewords, that gives a further advantage in the error
floor region.
