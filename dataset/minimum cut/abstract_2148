Solar supergranulation plays an important role in generating and structuring
the solar magnetic field and as a mechanism responsible for the 11-year solar
cycle. It is clearly detected within SOHO/MDI Dopplergrams, from which a
variety of properties may be derived. Techniques that extract spatial, temporal
and kinematic characteristics and provide comparisons for the two most recent
solar minima are described. Although supergranule lifetimes are comparable
between these minima, their sizes maybe slightly smaller during the recent
minimum.
