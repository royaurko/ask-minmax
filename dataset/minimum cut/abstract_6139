The Galactic supernova remnant W49B has one of the most impressive X-ray
emission line spectra obtained with the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and
Astronomy (ASCA). We use both plasma line diagnostics and broadband model fits
to show that the Si and S emission lines require multiple spectral components.
The spectral data do not necessarily require individual elements to be
spatially stratified, as suggested by earlier work, although when ASCA line
images are considered, it is possible that Fe is stratified with respect to Si
and S. Most of the X-ray emitting gas is from ejecta, based on the element
abundances required, but is surprisingly close to being in collisional
ionization equilibrium. A high ionization age implies a high internal density
in a young remnant. The fitted emission measure for W49B indicates a minimum
density of 2 cm^-3, with the true density likely to be significantly higher.
W49B probably had a Type Ia progenitor, based on the relative element
abundances, although a low-mass Type II progenitor is still possible. We find
persuasive evidence for Cr and possibly Mn emission in the ASCA spectrum--the
first detection of these elements in X-rays from a cosmic source.
