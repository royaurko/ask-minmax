We study multidimensional gravitational models with scalar curvature
nonlinearity of the type 1/R and with form-fields (fluxes) as a matter source.
It is assumed that the higher dimensional space-time undergoes
Freund-Rubin-like spontaneous compactification to a warped product manifold. It
is shown that for certain parameter regions the model allows for a freezing
stabilization of the internal space near the positive minimum of the effective
potential which plays the role of the positive cosmological constant. This
cosmological constant provides the observable late-time accelerating expansion
of the Universe if parameters of the model is fine tuned. Additionally, the
effective potential has the saddle point. It results in domain walls in the
Universe. We show that these domain walls do not undergo inflation.
