The Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP) is one of the first light instruments
for the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST). It is an echelle
spectrograph designed to measure three different regions of the solar spectrum
in three separate focal planes simultaneously between 380 and 900 nm. It will
use the polarimetric capabilities of the ATST to measure the full Stokes
parameters across the line profiles. By measuring the polarization in
magnetically sensitive spectral lines the magnetic field vector as a function
of height in the solar atmosphere can be obtained, along with the associated
variation of the thermodynamic properties. The ViSP will have a spatial
resolution of 0.04 arcsec over a 2 arcmin field of view (at 600 nm). The
minimum spectral resolving power for all the focal planes is 180,000. The
spectrograph supports up to 4 diffraction gratings and is fully automated to
allow for rapid reconfiguration.
