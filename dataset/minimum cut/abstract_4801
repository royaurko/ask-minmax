Web emerged as an antidote to the rapidly increasing quantity of accumulated
knowledge and become successful because it facilitates massive participation
and communication with minimum costs. Today, its enormous impact, scale and
dynamism in time and space make very difficult (and sometimes impossible) to
measure and anticipate the effects in human society. In addition to that, we
demand from the Web to be fast, secure, reliable, all-inclusive and trustworthy
in any transaction. The scope of the present article is to review a part of the
Web economy literature that will help us to identify its major participants and
their functions. The goal is to understand how the Web economy differs from the
traditional setting and what implications have these differences. Secondarily,
we attempt to establish a minimal common understanding about the incentives and
properties of the Web economy. In this direction the concept of Web Goods and a
new classification of Web Users are introduced and analyzed This article, is
not, by any means, a thorough review of the economic literature related to the
Web. We focus only on its relevant part that models the Web as a standalone
economic artifact with native functionality and processes.
