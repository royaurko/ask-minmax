We study the spin dependent tunneling of electrons through a zinc-blende
semiconductor with the indirect X (or D) minimum serving as the tunneling
barrier. The basic difference between tunneling through the G vs. the X barrier
is the linear-k spin-orbit splitting of the two spin bands at the X point, as
opposed to the k3 Dresselhaus splitting at the G point. The linear coefficient
of the spin splitting b at the X point is computed for several semiconductors
using density-functional theory and the transport characteristics are
calculated using the barrier tunneling model. We show that both the
transmission coefficient as well as the spin polarization can be large,
suggesting the potential application of these materials as spin filters.
