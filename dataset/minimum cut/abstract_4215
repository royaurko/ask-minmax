Given a graph G and an integer k, two players take turns coloring the
vertices of G one by one using k colors so that neighboring vertices get
different colors. The first player wins iff at the end of the game all the
vertices of G are colored. The game chromatic number \chi_g(G) is the minimum k
for which the first player has a winning strategy. In this paper we analyze the
asymptotic behavior of this parameter for a random graph G_{n,p}. We show that
with high probability the game chromatic number of G_{n,p} is at least twice
its chromatic number but, up to a multiplicative constant, has the same order
of magnitude. We also study the game chromatic number of random bipartite
graphs.
