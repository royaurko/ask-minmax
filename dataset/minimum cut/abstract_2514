In this paper, we propose a modified Density Matrix Renormalization Group
(DMRG) algorithm to preferentially select minimum entropy states (minimally
entangled states) in finite systems with asymptotic ground state degeneracy.
The algorithm adds a "quench" process to the conventional DMRG method, which
mimics the decoherence of physical systems, and collapses non-locally entangled
states such as Schr\"odinger cats. We show that the method works for
representative models with ground state degeneracy arising from either
topological order or spontaneous discrete symmetry breaking. In the minimal
entropy states thus obtained, properties associated with thermodynamic limit,
such as topological entanglement entropy and magnetic order parameters, can be
obtained directly and efficiently.
