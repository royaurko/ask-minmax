Many systems where interactions compete with each other or with constraints
are well described by a model first introduced by Brazovskii. Such systems
include block copolymers, alloys with modulated phases, Rayleigh-Benard Cells
and type-I superconductors. The hallmark of this model is that the fluctuation
spectrum is isotropic and has a minimum at a nonzero wave vector represented by
the surface of a d-dimensional hyper-sphere. It was shown by Brazovskii that
the fluctuations change the free energy structure from a $ \phi ^{4}$ to a
$\phi ^{6}$ form with the disordered state metastable for all quench depths.
The transition from the disordered to the periodic, lamellar structure changes
from second order to first order and suggests that the dynamics is governed by
nucleation. Using numerical simulations we have confirmed that the equilibrium
free energy function is indeed of a $ \phi ^{6}$ form. A study of the dynamics,
however, shows that, following a deep quench, the dynamics is described by
unstable growth rather than nucleation. A dynamical calculation, based on a
generalization of the Brazovskii calculations shows that the disordered state
can remain unstable for a long time following the quench.
