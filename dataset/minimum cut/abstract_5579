In $N$-band superconductors, the $U(1)^N$ phase invariance is spontaneously
broken. We propose a model for $N$-band superconductors where the phase
differences between gaps are represented by abelian gauge fields. This model
corresponds to an $SU(N)$ gauge theory with the abelian projection. We show
that there are massless modes as well as massive modes when the number of gaps
$N$ is greater than 3. There are $N-3$ massless modes and two massive modes
near a minimum of the Josephson potential when $N$ bands are equivalent and
Josephson couplings are frustrated. The global symmetry $U(1)^{N-1}$ is broken
down by the Josephson term to $U(1)^{N-3}$. A non-trivial configuration of the
gauge field, that is, a monopole singularity of the gauge field results in a
fractional quantum-flux vortex. The fractional quantum-flux vortex corresponds
to a monopole in superconductors.
