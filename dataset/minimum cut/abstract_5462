The anharmonicity of the potential well confining the position of the
magnetic vortex core is measured dynamically with a Magnetic Resonance Force
Microscope (MRFM). The stray field of the MRFM tip is used to displace the core
position away from the well minimum. Anharmonicity is then inferred from the
relative frequency shift induced on the eigen-frequency of the vortex core
translational mode. Traces of these shifts are recorded while scanning the tip
above an isolated nanodot, patterned out of a single crystal FeV film. An
analytical framework is proposed to analyze the data. It results in a
quantitative measurement of the anharmonic coefficient found to be positive and
50% of the parabolic contribution. This calibrates the tunability of the
gyrotropic mode by external magnetic fields. In our sample, we observe a
variation of the eigen-frequency as high as +10% for a displacement of the
vortex core to about one third of the nanodot radius.
