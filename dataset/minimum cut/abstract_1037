The minimum supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) without R-parity through
various lepton-number violations is investigated systematically. All kinds of
possible mixing in the model are formulated precisely. The remarkable issue
that the lightest `Higgs' $H_1^0$ may be heavier than the weak-boson $Z$ at
tree level is kept, as the special R-parity violation MSSM where only bilinear
violation of the lepton numbers is allowed. It is also shown explicitly that
there is a freedom $U(n+1)$ ($n$ is the number of the broken lepton-numbers) in
re-defining the lepton and Higgs superfields. Feynman rules relevant to the
R-parity violations are given precisely in $'$t Hooft-Feynman gauge. With
further assumptions and concerning all available experimental constraints,
spectrum for interest sectors is computed numerically.
