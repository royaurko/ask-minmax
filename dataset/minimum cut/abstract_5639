Magnetic trapping of bromine atoms at temperatures in the milliKelvin regime
is demonstrated for the first time. The atoms are produced by photodissociation
of Br$_2$ molecules in a molecular beam. The lab-frame velocity of Br atoms is
controlled by the wavelength and polarization of the photodissociation laser.
Careful selection of the wavelength results in one of the pair of atoms having
sufficient velocity to exactly cancel that of the parent molecule, and it
remains stationary in the lab frame. A trap is formed at the null point between
two opposing neodymium permanent magnets. Dissociation of molecules at the
field minimum results in the slowest fraction of photofragments remaining
trapped. After the ballistic escape of the fastest atoms, the trapped slow
atoms are only lost by elastic collisions with the chamber background gas. The
measured loss rate is consistent with estimates of the total cross section for
only those collisions transferring sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the
trapping potential.
