Differential operators can detect significant changes in signals. This has
been utilized to enhance the contrast of the seizure signatures in depth EEG or
ECoG. We have actually taken normalized exponential of absolute value of single
or double derivative of epileptic ECoG. Variance operation has been performed
to automatically detect seizures. A novel method for determining the duration
of seizure has also been proposed. Since all operations take only linear time,
the whole method is extremely fast. Seven novel parameters have been introduced
whose patient specific thresholding brings down the rate of false detection to
a bare minimum. Results of implementation on the ECoG data of four epileptic
patients have been reported with an ROC curve analysis. High value of the area
under the ROC curve indicates excellent detection performance.
