We numerically investigate dynamic critical behaviors of two-dimensional (2D)
Josephson-junction arrays with positional disorder in the scheme of the
resistively shunted junction dynamics. Large-scale computation of the current
voltage characteristics reveals an evidence supporting that a phase transition
occurs at a nonzero critical temperature in the strong disorder regime, as well
as in the weak disorder regime. The phase transition at weak disorder appears
to belong to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. In contrast,
evidence for a non-BKT transition is found in the strong disorder regime. These
results are consistent with the recent experiment %by Yun {\it et al.} in
cond-mat/0509151 on positionally disordered Josephson-junction arrays; in
particular, the critical temperature of the non-BKT transition (ranging from
0.265 down to the minimum 0.22 in units of $E_J/k_B$ with the Josephson
coupling strength $E_J$), the correlation length critical exponent $\nu=1.2$,
and the dynamic critical exponent $z=2.0$ in the strong disorder regime agree
with the existing studies of the 2D gauge-glass model.
