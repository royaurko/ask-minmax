The final stages of the evolution of electron--degenerate ONe cores,
resulting from carbon burning in ``heavy weight'' intermediate--mass stars ($8
M_{\sun}\la M \la 11 M_{\sun}$) and growing in mass, either from carbon burning
in a shell or from accretion of matter in a close binary system, are examined
in the light of their detailed chemical composition. In particular, we have
modelled the evolution taking into account the abundances of the following
minor nuclear species, which result from the previous evolutionary history:
$^{12}$C, $^{23}$Na, $^{24}$Mg, and $^{25}$Mg. Both $^{23}$Na and $^{25}$Mg
give rise to Urca processes, which are found to be unimportant for the final
outcome of the evolution. $^{24}$Mg was formerly considered a major component
of ONe cores (hence called ONeMg cores), but updated evolutionary calculations
in this mass range have severely reduced its abundance. Nevertheless, we have
parameterized it and we have found that the minimum amount of $^{24}$Mg
required to produce NeO burning at moderate densities is $\sim 23%$, a value
exceedingly high in the light of recent evolutionary models. Finally, we have
determined that models with relatively small abundances of unburnt carbon
($X(^{12}$C)$\sim 0.015$) could be a channel to explosion at low to moderate
density ($\sim 1\times 10^9$ g cm$^{-3}$). This is clearly below the current
estimate for the explosion/collapse threshold and would have interesting
consequences.
