We study the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations in the presence of a background
metric ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2 + e^{-2gx}(dy^2 + dz^2) in a semi-infinite lab
(x>0). This metric has a constant scalar curvature R=6g^2 and is produced by a
perfect fluid with equation of state p=-\rho /3. The eigenfunctions of spin-0
and spin-1/2 particles are obtained exactly, and the quantized energy
eigenvalues are compared. It is shown that both of these particles must have
nonzero transverse momentum in this background. We show that there is a minimum
energy E^2_{min}=m^2c^4 + g^2c^2\hbar^2$ for bosons E_{KG} > E_{min}, while the
fermions have no specific ground state E_{Dirac}>mc^2.
