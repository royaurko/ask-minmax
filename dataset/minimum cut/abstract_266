A triangle decomposition of a graph is a partition of its edges into
triangles. A fractional triangle decomposition of a graph is an assignment of a
non-negative weight to each of its triangles such that the sum of the weights
of the triangles containing any given edge is one. We prove that for all
$\epsilon > 0$, every large enough graph graph on $n$ vertices with minimum
degree at least $(0.9 + \epsilon)n$ has a fractional triangle decomposition.
This improves a result of Garaschuk that the same result holds for graphs with
minimum degree at least $0.956n$. Together with a recent result of Barber,
K\"{u}hn, Lo and Osthus, this implies that for all $\epsilon > 0$, every large
enough triangle divisible graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least
$(0.9 + \epsilon)n$ admits a triangle decomposition.
