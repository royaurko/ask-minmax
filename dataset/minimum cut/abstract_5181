We prove a disc formula for the largest plurisubharmonic subextension of an
upper semicontinuous function on a domain $W$ in a Stein manifold to a larger
domain $X$ under suitable conditions on $W$ and $X$. We introduce a related
equivalence relation on the space of analytic discs in $X$ with boundary in
$W$. The quotient, if it is Hausdorff, is a complex manifold with a local
biholomorphism to $X$. We use our disc formula to generalise Kiselman's minimum
principle. We show that his infimum function is an example of a
plurisubharmonic subextension.
