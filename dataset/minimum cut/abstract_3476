The sound velocities dependencies on temperature V(T) were measured by means
of resonance method have on the thin plates of quasimonocrystalline manganites
La(1-x)Sr(x)MnO3. Results are presented for x=0.1, 0.125, 0.15, 0.175 and 0.2
in the temperature range from 70 to 350K. The V(T) behavior correlates with
those of susceptibilities and magnetic moment M(T). For x=0.175 and 0.2 the
transition to ferromagnetic state is accompanied by appearance of large but
smooth rise in V(T) whereas structural phase transition between the rhomboedral
(R) and orthorhombic (O) structures is accompanied by sharp increase up to
15-20% in V(T). For x=0.1, 0.125 and 0.15 the structural phase transition
between Jahn-Teller distorted orthorhombic structure (O') and pseudocubic one
(O'') is accompanied by deep minimum (~20-30%) in V(T).
