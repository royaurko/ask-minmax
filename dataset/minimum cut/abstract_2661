Let N((r,w;d),t) denote the minimum number of points in a (r,w;d)-cover-free
family having t blocks. Hajiabolhassan and Moazami (2012)[6] showed that the
Hadamard conjecture is equivalent to confirm N((1,1;d)4d-1)=4d-1. Hence, it is
a challenging and interesting problem to determine the exact value of
N((r,w;d),t). In this paper, we determine the exact value of N((r,w;d),t) for
every r, w, where r+w<t+1 and some d.
