Laboratory searches for the detection of gravitational waves have focused on
the detection of burst signals emitted during a supernova explosion, but have
not resulted in any confirmed detections. An alternative approach has been to
search for continuous wave (CW) gravitational radiation from the Crab pulsar.
In this paper, we examine the possibility of detecting CW gravitational
radiation from pulsars and show that nearby millisecond pulsars are generally
much better candidates. We show that the minimum strain h_c ~ 10E-26 that can
be detected by tuning an antenna to the frequency of the milli- second pulsar
PSR 1957+20, with presently available detector technology, is orders of
magnitude better than what has been accomplished so far by observing the Crab
pulsar, and within an order of magnitude of the maximum strain that may be
produced by it. In addition, we point out that there is likely to be a
population of rapidly rotating neutron stars (not necessarily radio pulsars) in
the solar neighborhood whose spindown evolution is driven by gravitational
radiation. We argue that the projected sensitivity of modern resonant detectors
is sufficient to detect the subset of this population that lies within 0.1 kpc
of the sun.
