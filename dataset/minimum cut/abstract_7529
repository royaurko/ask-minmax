The aim of this paper is to study asymptotic geometric properties almost
surely or/and in probability of extreme order statistics of an i.i.d. random
field (potential) indexed by sites of multidimensional lattice cube, the volume
of which unboundedly increases. We discuss the following topics: (I) high level
exceedances, in particular, clustering of exceedances; (II) decay rate of
spacings in comparison with increasing rate of extreme order statistics; (III)
minimum of spacings of successive order statistics; (IV) asymptotic behavior of
values neighboring to extremes and so on. The conditions of the results are
formulated in terms of regular variation (RV) of the cumulative hazard function
and its inverse. A relationship between RV classes of the present paper as well
as their links to the well-known RV classes (including domains of attraction of
max-stable distributions) are discussed.
  The asymptotic behavior of functionals (I)--(IV) determines the asymptotic
structure of the top eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the
large-volume discrete Schr\" odinger operators with an i.i.d. potential
(Anderson Hamiltonian). Thus, another aim of the present paper is to review and
comment a recent progress on extreme value theory for eigenvalues of random
Schr\"odinger operators as well as to provide a clear and rigorous
understanding of the relationship between the top eigenvalues and extreme
values of i.i.d. potentials.
