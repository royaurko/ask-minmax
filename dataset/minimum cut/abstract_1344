We present a mechanism of resistivity minimum in conduction electron systems
coupled with localized moments, which is distinguished from the Kondo effect.
Instead of the spin-flip process in the Kondo effect, electrons are elastically
scattered by local spin correlations which evolve in a particular way under
geometrical frustration as decreasing temperature. This is demonstrated by the
cellular dynamical mean-field theory for a spin-ice type Kondo lattice model on
a pyrochlore lattice. Peculiar temperature dependences of the resistivity,
specific heat, and magnetic susceptibility in the non-Kondo mechanism are
compared with the experimental data in metallic Ir pyrochlore oxides.
