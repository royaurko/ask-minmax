Pair production itself prevents the development of dyadospheres, hypothetical
macroscopic regions where the electric field exceeds the critical Schwinger
value. Pair production is a self-regulating process that would discharge a
growing electric field, in the example of a hypothetical collapsing charged
stellar core, before it reached 6% of the minimum dyadosphere value, keeping
the pair production rate more than 26 orders of magnitude below the dyadosphere
value.
