We study the flow close to an advancing contact line in the limit of small
capillary number. To take into account wetting effects, both long and
short-ranged contributions to the disjoining pressure are taken into account.
In front of the contact line, there is a microscopic film corresponding to a
minimum of the interaction potential. We compute the parameters of the contact
line solution relevant to the matching to a macroscopic problem, for example a
spreading droplet. The result closely resembles previous results obtained with
a slip model.
