During last 20 years there was revealed and published the phenomenon of the
appearing of the time advance instead of the time delay at the region of a
compound-nucleus resonance, distorted by the non-resonant background (in the
center-of-mass (C-) system). This phenomenon is usually accompanied by a
minimum in the cross section near the same energy. Here we analyze the cross
section and the time delay of the nucleon-nucleus scattering in the laboratory
(L-) system. In the L-system the delay-advance phenomenon does not appear. We
use and concretize the non-standard analytical transformations of the cross
section from the C-system to the L-system, obtained in our previous papers.
They are illustrated by the calculations of energy dependences of cross
sections in the L-system for several cases of nucleon elastic scattering by
nuclei 12C, 16O, 28Si, 52Cr, 56Fe and 64Ni at the range of distorted resonances
in comparison with the experimental data.
