A semi-empirical, axisymmetric model of the solar minimum corona is developed
by solving the equations for conservation of mass and momentum with prescribed
anisotropic temperature distributions. In the high-latitude regions, the proton
temperature anisotropy is strong and the associated mirror force plays an
important role in driving the fast solar wind; the critical point where the
outflow velocity equals the parallel sound speed is reached already at 1.5 Rsun
from Sun center. The slow wind arises from a region with open field lines and
weak anisotropy surrounding the equatorial streamer belt. The model parameters
were chosen to reproduce the observed latitudinal extent of the equatorial
streamer in the corona and at large distance from the Sun. We find that the
magnetic cusp of the closed-field streamer core lies at about 1.95 Rsun. The
transition from fast to slow wind is due to a decrease in temperature
anisotropy combined with the non-monotonic behavior of the non-radial expansion
factor in flow tubes that pass near the streamer cusp. In the slow wind, the
plasma beta is of order unity and the critical point lies at about 5 Rsun, well
beyond the magnetic cusp. The predicted outflow velocities are consistent with
OVI Doppler dimming measurements from UVCS/SOHO. We also find good agreement
with polarized brightness (pB) measurements from LASCO/SOHO and HI Ly-alpha
images from UVCS/SOHO.
