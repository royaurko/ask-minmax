A model is presented for the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood
which takes into account three families of galactic objects, according to their
condensation states: stars, refuses and gas. Stars are defined as every
condensed objects with masses greater than or equal to the minimum mass which
ignites hydrogen and which will give rise to an evolutionary track on the HR
diagram to the left of Hayashi's limit; refuses include the remnants, which are
compact objects resulting from stellar deaths, and the residues, which have
masses not large enough to ignite hydrogen; gas is defined as the mass which
can be condensed to form stars and/or residues. We have developed equations for
the mass evolution of each family, and have studied the gas metallicity
distribution within the framework of the instantaneous recycling approximation,
adopting different initial conditions. In order to constrain the model
parameters we have also used preliminary evaluations of comet cloud masses to
investigate the role of the residues as sinks of heavy elements in the Galaxy.
