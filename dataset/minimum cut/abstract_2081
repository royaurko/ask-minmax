We give a brief review of our previous works: [1,2]. We discuss two sets of
issues. The first has to do with the possibility of getting a
non-supersymmetric dS minimum without the addition of anti-D3 branes as in
KKLT, and axionic slow-roll inflation, in type II flux compactifications. The
second has to do with the "Inverse Problem" [3] and "Fake Superpotentials" [4]
for extremal (non)supersymmetric black holes in type II compactifications. We
use (orientifold of) a "Swiss Cheese" Calabi-Yau [5] expressed as a degree-18
hypersurface in WCP^4[1,1,1,6,9] in the "large-volume-scenario" limit [6] for
the former.
