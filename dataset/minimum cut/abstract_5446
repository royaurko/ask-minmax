We propose a new approach to create Majorana fermions at the edge of a
periodically driven semiconductor-superconductor Heterostructure. We calculate
the quasi-energy spectrum of the periodically driven Heterostructure by using
the Floquet's theory. When the interaction between different Brillouin zones of
quasi-energy is neglected, one Majorana fermion can be created at each edge of
the Heterostructure when the ratio of driven amplitude and driven frequency is
larger than a minimum. Furthermore, when the interaction between the nearest
Brillouin zones of quasi-energy is considered, we restrict the condition of
creating Majorana fermions above with a lower limit of the driven frequency. We
also discuss the experimental protocol of creating Majorana fermions in the
periodically driven Heterostructure.
