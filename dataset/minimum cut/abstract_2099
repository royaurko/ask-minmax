Any 8-qubit graph state belongs to one of the 101 equivalence classes under
local unitary operations within the Clifford group. For each of these classes
we obtain a representative which requires the minimum number of controlled-Z
gates for its preparation, and calculate the Schmidt measure for the 8-partite
split, and the Schmidt ranks for all bipartite splits. This results into an
extension to 8 qubits of the classification of graph states proposed by Hein,
Eisert, and Briegel [Phys. Rev. A 69, 062311 (2004)].
