We have investigated the drag on a sphere falling through a clay suspension
that has a yield stress and exhibits rheological aging. The drag force
increases with both speed and the rest time between preparation of the system
and the start of the experiment, but there exists a nonzero minimum speed below
which steady motion is not possible. We find that only a very thin layer of
material around the sphere is fluidized when it moves, while the rest of
suspension is deformed elastically. This is in marked contrast to what is found
for yield-stress fluids that do not age.
