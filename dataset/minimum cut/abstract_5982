This paper constructs an ensemble-based sampling smoother for
four-dimensional data assimilation using a Hybrid/Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo
approach. The smoother samples efficiently from the posterior probability
density of the solution at the initial time. Unlike the well-known ensemble
Kalman smoother, which is optimal only in the linear Gaussian case, the
proposed methodology naturally accommodates non-Gaussian errors and non-linear
model dynamics and observation operators. Unlike the four-dimensional
variational met\-hod, which only finds a mode of the posterior distribution,
the smoother provides an estimate of the posterior uncertainty. One can use the
ensemble mean as the minimum variance estimate of the state, or can use the
ensemble in conjunction with the variational approach to estimate the
background errors for subsequent assimilation windows. Numerical results
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method compared to the traditional
variational and ensemble-based smoothing methods.
