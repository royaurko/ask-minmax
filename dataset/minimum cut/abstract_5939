A new dispersion matrix that can be interpreted as the geometric median
covariation matrix is defined. It is a robust multivariate indicator of
dispersion which can be extended without any difficulty to functional data.
Estimators can be simply built, and updated at each new observation, with fast
online algorithms even when both the sample size and the dimension are large.
Asymptotic convergence properties are given for the recursive online algorithm.
A simulation study clearly shows that this robust indicator is a competitive
alternative to minimum covariance determinant when the dimension of the data is
small and robust principal components analysis based on projection pursuit and
spherical projections for functional data. A simulation study as well as an
illustration on two datasets confirm the interest of considering robust PCA
based on the median covariation matrix.
