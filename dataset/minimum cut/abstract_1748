Toric codes are obtained by evaluating rational functions of a nonsingular
toric variety at the algebraic torus. One can extend toric codes to the so
called generalized toric codes. This extension consists on evaluating elements
of an arbitrary polynomial algebra at the algebraic torus instead of a linear
combination of monomials whose exponents are rational points of a convex
polytope. We study their multicyclic and metric structure, and we use them to
express their dual and to estimate their minimum distance.
