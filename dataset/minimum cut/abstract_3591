Strain in sheared dense granular material is often localized in a narrow
region called shear band. Recent experiments in a modified Couette cell
provided localized shear flow in the bulk away from the confining walls. The
non-trivial shape of the shear band was measured as the function of the cell
geometry. First we present a geometric argument for narrow shear bands which
connects the function of their surface position with the shape in the bulk.
Assuming a simple dissipation mechanism we show that the principle of minimum
dissipation of energy provides a good description of the shape function.
Furthermore, we discuss the possibility and behavior of shear bands which are
detached from the free surface and are entirely covered in the bulk.
