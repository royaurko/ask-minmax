We report unfiltered photometry during superoutbursts of PU UMa in 2009 and
2012. The amplitude was 4.5 magnitudes above mean quiescence and lasted at
least 9 to 10 days. Superhumps were present with a peak-to-peak amplitude of up
to ~0.3 mag, thereby confirming it to be a member of the SU UMa family of dwarf
novae. The mean superhump period during the later part of the 2012 outburst was
Psh = 0.08076(40) d. Analysis of the eclipse times of minimum, supplemented
with data from other researchers, revealed an orbital period of Porb =
0.077880551(17) d. The superhump period excess was epsilon = 0.037(5). During
the 2012 outburst, which was the better observed of the two, the FWHM eclipse
duration gradually declined from 9.5 to 5 min. The eclipse depth was up to 1.7
magnitudes.
