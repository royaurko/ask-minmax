While the connection between high-redshift star formation and the local
universe has recently been used to understand the observed population of faint
dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way (MW) halo, we explore how well these nearby
objects can probe the epoch of first light. We construct a detailed, physically
motivated model for the MW satellites based on the state-of-the-art Via Lactea
II dark-matter simulations. Our model incorporates molecular hydrogen (H_2)
cooling in low-mass systems and inhomogeneous photo-heating feedback during the
internal reionization of our own galaxy. We find that the existence of MW
satellites fainter than M_V ~ -5 is strong evidence for H_2 cooling in low-mass
halos, while satellites with -5 > M_V > -9 were affected by hydrogen cooling
and photoheating feedback. The age of stars in very low-luminosity systems and
the minimum luminosity of these satellites are key predictions of our model.
Most of the stars populating the brightest MW satellites could have formed
after the epoch of reionization. Our models also predict a significantly larger
dispersion in M_300 values than observed and a number of luminous satellites
with M_300 as low as 10^6 solar masses.
