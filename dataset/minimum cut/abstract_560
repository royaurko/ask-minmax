The adiabatic, Holstein-Hubbard model describes electrons on a chain with
step $a$ interacting with themselves (with coupling $U$) and with a classical
phonon field $\f_x$ (with coupling $\l$). There is Peierls instability if the
electronic ground state energy $F(\f)$ as a functional of $\f_x$ has a minimum
which corresponds to a periodic function with period ${\pi\over p_F}$, where
$p_F$ is the Fermi momentum. We consider ${p_F\over\pi a}$ irrational so that
the CDW is {\it incommensurate} with the chain. We prove in a rigorous way in
the spinless case, when $\l,U$ are small and ${U\over\l}$ large, that a)when
the electronic interaction is attractive $U<0$ there is no Peierls instability
b)when the interaction is repulsive $U>0$ there is Peierls instability in the
sense that our convergent expansion for $F(\f)$, truncated at the second order,
has a minimum which corresponds to an analytical and ${\pi\over p_F}$ periodic
$\f_x$. Such a minimum is found solving an infinite set of coupled
self-consistent equations, one for each of the infinite Fourier modes of
$\f_x$.
