Using predictive adaptive arithmetic coding and the Minimum Description
Length principle, we derive an efficient tool for model selection problems :
the RIC information criterion. We then present an extension of these coding
techniques to non-parametrical estimation of a distribution and illustrate it
on the gray scales histogram of an image.
  Key-words : Information criteria, MDL, model selection, non-parametrical
estimation, histograms.
