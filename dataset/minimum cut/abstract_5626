Analyses of recent observations of the sole classical Cepheid in the Kepler
field, V1154 Cygni, found random changes of about 30 minutes in the pulsation
period. These period changes challenge standard theories of pulsation and
evolution because the period change is non-secular, and explaining this period
jitter is necessary for understanding stellar evolution and the role of
Cepheids as precise standard candles. We suggest that convection and convective
hot spots can explain the observed period jitter. Convective hot spots alter
the timing of flux maximum and minimum in the Cepheid light curve, hence change
the measured pulsation period. We present a model of random hot spots that
generate a localized flux excess that perturbs the Cepheid light curve and
consequently the pulsation period which is consistent with the observed jitter.
This result demonstrates how important understanding convection is for modeling
Cepheid stellar structure and evolution, how convection determines the red edge
of the instability strip, and just how sensitive Cepheid light curves are to
atmospheric physics.
