Arrays of gold split-rings with 50-nm minimum feature size and with an LC
resonance at 200-THz frequency (1500-nm wavelength) are fabricated. For normal
incidence conditions, they exhibit a pronounced fundamental magnetic mode,
arising from a coupling via the electric component of the incident light. For
oblique incidence, a coupling via the magnetic component is demonstrated as
well. Moreover, we identify a novel higher-order magnetic resonance at around
370 THz (800-nm wavelength) that evolves out of the Mie resonance for oblique
incidence. Comparison with theory delivers good agreement and also shows that
the structures allow for a negative magnetic permeability.
