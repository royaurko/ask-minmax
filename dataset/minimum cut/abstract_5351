In this paper we show that combination of the minimum description length
principle and a exchange-ability condition leads directly to the use of
Jeffreys prior. This approach works in most cases even when Jeffreys prior
cannot be normalized. Kraft's inequality links codes and distributions but a
closer look at this inequality demonstrates that this link only makes sense
when sequences are considered as prefixes of potential longer sequences. For
technical reasons only results for exponential families are stated. Results on
when Jeffreys prior can be normalized after conditioning on a initializing
string are given. An exotic case where no initial string allow Jeffreys prior
to be normalized is given and some way of handling such exotic cases are
discussed.
