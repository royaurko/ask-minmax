We study the effect of an external field on (1+1) and (2+1) dimensional
elastic manifolds, at zero temperature and with random bond disorder. Due to
the glassy energy landscape the configuration of a manifold changes often in
abrupt, ``first order'' -type of large jumps when the field is applied. First
the scaling behavior of the energy gap between the global energy minimum and
the next lowest minimum of the manifold is considered, by employing exact
ground state calculations and an extreme statistics argument. The scaling has a
logarithmic prefactor originating from the number of the minima in the
landscape, and reads $\Delta E_1 \sim L^\theta [\ln(L_z L^{-\zeta})]^{-1/2}$,
where $\zeta$ is the roughness exponent and $\theta$ is the energy fluctuation
exponent of the manifold, $L$ is the linear size of the manifold, and $L_z$ is
the system height. The gap scaling is extended to the case of a finite external
field and yields for the susceptibility of the manifolds $\chi_{tot} \sim
L^{2D+1-\theta} [(1-\zeta)\ln(L)]^{1/2}$. We also present a mean field argument
for the finite size scaling of the first jump field, $h_1 \sim L^{d-\theta}$.
The implications to wetting in random systems, to finite-temperature behavior
and the relation to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang non-equilibrium surface growth are
discussed.
