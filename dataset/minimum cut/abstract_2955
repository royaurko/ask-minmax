We searched for circumbinary planets orbiting NY Vir in historical eclipse
times including our long-term CCD data. Sixty-eight times of minimum light with
accuracies better than 10 s were used for the ephemeris computations. The best
fit to those timings indicated that the orbital period of NY Vir has varied due
to a combination of two sinusoids with periods of $P_3$=8.2 yr and $P_4$=27.0
yr and semi-amplitudes of $K_3$=6.9 s and $K_4$=27.3 s, respectively. The
periodic variations most likely arise from a pair of light-time effects due to
the presence of third and fourth bodies that are gravitationally bound to the
eclipsing pair. We have derived the orbital parameters and the minimum masses,
$M_3 \sin i_3$ = 2.8 M$\rm_{Jup}$ and $M_4 \sin i_4$ = 4.5 M$\rm_{Jup}$, of
both objects. A dynamical analysis suggests that the outer companion is less
likely to orbit the binary on a circular orbit. Instead we show that future
timing data might push its eccentricity to moderate values for which the system
exhibits long-term stability. The results demonstrate that NY Vir is probably a
star-planet system, which consists of a very close binary star and two giant
planets. The period ratio $P_{3}/P_{4}$ suggests that a long-term gravitational
interaction between them would result in capture into a nearly 3:10 mean motion
resonance. When the presence of the circumbinary planets is verified and
understood more comprehensively, the formation and evolution of this planetary
system should be advanced greatly.
