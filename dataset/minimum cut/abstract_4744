L3 preliminary data of two-particle Bose-Einstein correlations are reported
for hadronic Z^0 decays in e+e- annihilation at LEP. The invariant relative
momentum Q is identified as the eigenvariable of the measured correlation
function. Significant anti-correlations are observed in the Bose-Einstein
correlation function in a broad region of 0.5 - 1.6 GeV with a minimum at Q
close to 0.8 GeV. Absence of Bose-Einstein correlations is demonstrated in the
region above Q >= 1.6 GeV. The effective source size is found to decrease with
increasing value of the transverse mass of the pair, similarly to hadron-hadron
and heavy ion reactions. These feautes and our data are described well by the
non-thermal tau-model, which is based on strong space-time
momentum-correlations.
