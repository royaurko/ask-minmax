During the synthesis of integral membrane proteins (IMPs), the hydrophobic
amino acids of the polypeptide sequence are partitioned mostly into the
membrane interior and hydrophilic amino acids mostly into the aqueous exterior.
We analyze the minimum free energy state of polypeptide sequences partitioned
into alpha-helical transmembrane (TM) segments and the role of thermal
fluctuations using a many-body statistical mechanics model. Results suggest
that IMP TM segment partitioning shares important features with general
theories of protein folding. For random polypeptide sequences, the minimum free
energy state at room temperature is characterized by fluctuations in the number
of TM segments with very long relaxation times. Simple assembly scenarios do
not produce a unique number of TM segments and jamming phenomena interfere with
segment placement. For sequences corresponding to IMPs, the minimum free energy
structure with the wildtype number of segments is free of number fluctuations
due to an anomalous gap in the energy spectrum, and simple assembly scenarios
produce this structure. There is a threshold number of random point mutations
beyond which the size of this gap is reduced so that the wildtype groundstate
is destabilized and number fluctuations reappear.
