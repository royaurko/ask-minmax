The thermoelectric power, $S(T)$, of the heavy fermions YbT$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$
($T$ = Fe, Ru, Os, Ir, Rh, and Co) has been measured to characterize their
strong electronic correlations. A large, negative, local minimum in $S(T)$ with
approximately -70 $\mu$V/K is found for all compounds. From the observed local
minimum, the energy scales associated with both the Kondo temperature and the
crystalline electric field splitting are deduced and compared to previous
specific heat measurements. At low temperatures, $S(T)$ follows a linear
temperature dependence, $S(T)$ = $\alpha T$, with an enhanced value of $\alpha$
which is characteristic for a heavy fermion state. In the zero temperature
limit, the enhanced $\alpha$ value strongly correlates with the electronic
specific heat coefficient, $C(T)/T$, due to the large density of states at the
Fermi level.
