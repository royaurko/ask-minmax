Observations of cosmic ray arrival directions made with the Pierre Auger
Observatory have previously provided evidence of anisotropy at the 99% CL using
the correlation of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with objects drawn
from the Veron-Cetty Veron catalog. In this paper we report on the use of three
catalog independent methods to search for anisotropy. The 2pt-L, 2pt+ and 3pt
methods, each giving a different measure of self-clustering in arrival
directions, were tested on mock cosmic ray data sets to study the impacts of
sample size and magnetic smearing on their results, accounting for both angular
and energy resolutions. If the sources of UHECRs follow the same large scale
structure as ordinary galaxies in the local Universe and if UHECRs are
deflected no more than a few degrees, a study of mock maps suggests that these
three methods can efficiently respond to the resulting anisotropy with a
P-value = 1.0% or smaller with data sets as few as 100 events. Using data taken
from January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2010 we examined the 20, 30,..., 110 highest
energy events with a corresponding minimum energy threshold of about 49.3 EeV.
The minimum P-values found were 13.5% using the 2pt-L method, 1.0% using the
2pt+ method and 1.1% using the 3pt method for the highest 100 energy events. In
view of the multiple (correlated) scans performed on the data set, these
catalog-independent methods do not yield strong evidence of anisotropy in the
highest energy cosmic rays.
