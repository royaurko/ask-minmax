A sequence $s_1,s_2,...,s_k,s_1,s_2,...,s_k$ is a repetition. A sequence $S$
is nonrepetitive, if no subsequence of consecutive terms of $S$ form a
repetition. Let $G$ be a vertex colored graph. A path of $G$ is nonrepetitive,
if the sequence of colors on its vertices is nonrepetitive. If $G$ is a plane
graph, then a facial nonrepetitive vertex coloring of $G$ is a vertex coloring
such that any facial path is nonrepetitive. Let $\pi_f(G)$ denote the minimum
number of colors of a facial nonrepetitive vertex coloring of $G$. Jendro\vl
and Harant posed a conjecture that $\pi_f(G)$ can be bounded from above by a
constant. We prove that $\pi_f(G)\le 24$ for any plane graph $G$.
