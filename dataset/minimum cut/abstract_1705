Stationary solutions to a Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to a noisy
logistic equation with correlated Gaussian white noises are constructed.
Stationary distributions exist even if the corresponding deterministic system
displays an unlimited growth. Positive correlations between the noises can lead
to a minimum of the variance of the process and to the stochastic resonance if
the system is additionally driven by a periodic signal.
