In a 4D chiral Thirring model we analyse the possibility that radiative
corrections may produce spontaneous breaking of Lorentz and CPT symmetry. By
studying the effective potential, we verified that the chiral current
$\bar\psi\gamma^{\mu} \gamma_5 \psi$ may assume a nonzero vacuum expectation
value which triggers the Lorentz and CPT violations. Furthermore, by making
fluctuations on the minimum of the potential we dynamically induce a bumblebee
like model containing a Chern-Simons term.
