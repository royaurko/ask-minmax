We present an analysis of cool outflowing gas around galaxies, traced by MgII
absorption lines in the co-added spectra of a sample of 486 zCOSMOS galaxies at
1 < z < 1.5. These galaxies span a range of stellar masses (9.45<
log[M*/Msun]<10.7) and star formation rates (0.14 < log [SFR/Msun/yr] < 2.35).
We identify the cool outflowing component in the MgII absorption and find that
the equivalent width of the outflowing component increases with stellar mass.
The outflow equivalent width also increases steadily with the increasing star
formation rate of the galaxies. At similar stellar masses the blue galaxies
exhibit a significantly higher outflow equivalent width as compared to red
galaxies. The outflow equivalent width shows strong effect with star formation
surface density ({\Sigma}SFR) of the sample. For the disk galaxies, the outflow
equivalent width is higher for the face-on systems as compared to the edge-on
ones, indicating that for the disk galaxies, the outflowing gas is primarily
bipolar in geometry. Galaxies typically exhibit outflow velocities ranging from
-200 km/s to -300 km/s and on average the face-on galaxies exhibit higher
outflow velocity as compared to the edge-on ones. Galaxies with irregular
morphologies exhibit outflow equivalent width as well as outflow velocities
comparable to face on disk galaxies. These galaxies exhibit minimum mass
outflow rates > 5-7 Msun/yr and a mass loading factor ({\eta} = dMout/dt /SFR)
comparable to the star formation rates of the galaxies.
