The extinction law and the variation of colour excess with position,
luminosity as well as spectral class in young open star clusters NGC 663,
NGC869, NGC 884, NGC 1502, NGC 1893, NGC 2244, NGC 2264, NGC 6611, Tr 14, Tr
15,Tr 16, Coll 228, Tr 37 and Be 86 have been studied. The difference in the
minimum and maximum values of E(B-V) of cluster members has been considered as
a measure of the presence of non-uniform gas and dust inside the clusters. Its
value ranges from 0.22 to 1.03 mag in clusters under study, which indicates
that non-uniform extinction is present in all the clusters. It has been noticed
for the first time in NGC 1502 and Tr 37. It is also found that the
differential colour excess in open clusters, which may be due to the presence
of gas and dust, decreases systematically with the age of clusters indicating
that matter is used either in star formation or blown away by hot stars or
both. There is no uniformity in the variation of E(B-V) with either position or
spectral class or luminosity.
