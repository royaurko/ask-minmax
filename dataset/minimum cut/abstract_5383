We have demonstrated that it is possible to access a crossover scenario
starting with a weak coupling (BCS) d-wave superconductor to a strongly coupled
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) phase as the exchange interaction is tuned in a
two dimensional system described by a t-J-U model via numerically solving the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations. While in the extreme dilute limit, the
electronic pairing phenomena is independent of the Coulomb repulsion, U, the
superconductivity depends on U, and so does the crossover. Further, the effect
of variation in the carrier density on the BCS-BEC crossover has also been
investigated. The crossover picture is illustrated by computing the chemical
potential, which when falls below the noninteracting band minimum, signals the
onset of a phase with tightly bound, shorter pairs. As an evidence of the above
feature, the Cooper pair radius is calculated which shows a significant
shortening at the emergence of a BEC-like phase. Besides, in contrast to the
previous work where a crossover was claimed only in the dilute limit, we have
demonstrated it at large densities near half filling.
