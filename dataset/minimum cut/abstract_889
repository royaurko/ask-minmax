In a macroscopic (quantum or classical) Hamiltonian system, we prove the
second law of thermodynamics in the forms of the minimum work principle and the
law of entropy increase, under the assumption that the initial state is
described by a general equilibrium distribution. Therefore the second law is a
logical necessity once we accept equilibrium statistical mechanics.
