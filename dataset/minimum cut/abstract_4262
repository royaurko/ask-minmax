We consider the damped wave equation \alpha u_tt + u_t = u_xx - V'(u) on the
whole real line, where V is a bistable potential. This equation has travelling
front solutions of the form u(x,t) = h(x-st) which describe a moving interface
between two different steady states of the system, one of which being the
global minimum of V. We show that, if the initial data are sufficiently close
to the profile of a front for large |x|, the solution of the damped wave
equation converges uniformly on R to a travelling front as t goes to plus
infinity. The proof of this global stability result is inspired by a recent
work of E. Risler and relies on the fact that our system has a Lyapunov
function in any Galilean frame.
