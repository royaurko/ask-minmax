The formation and rupture of atomic-sized contacts is modelled by means of
molecular dynamics simulations. Such nano-contacts are realized in scanning
tunnelling microscope and mechanically controlled break junction experiments.
These instruments routinely measure the conductance across the nano-sized
electrodes as they are brought into contact and separated, permitting
conductance traces to be recorded that are plots of conductance versus the
distance between the electrodes. One interesting feature of the conductance
traces is that for some metals and geometric configurations a jump in the value
of the conductance is observed right before contact between the electrodes, a
phenomenon known as jump-to-contact. This paper considers, from a computational
point of view, the dynamics of contact between two gold nano-electrodes.
Repeated indentation of the two surfaces on each other is performed in two
crystallographic orientations of face-centred cubic gold, namely (001) and
(111). Ultimately, the intention is to identify the structures at the atomic
level at the moment of first contact between the surfaces, since the value of
the conductance is related to the minimum cross-section in the contact region.
Conductance values obtained in this way are determined using first principles
electronic transport calculations, with atomic configurations taken from the
molecular dynamics simulations serving as input structures.
