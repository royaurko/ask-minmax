We consider the number and distribution of minima in random landscapes
defined on non-Euclidean lattices. Using an ensemble where random landscapes
are reweighted by a fugacity factor $z$ for each minimum they contain, we
construct first a `two-box' mean field theory. This exhibits an ordering phase
transition at $z\c=2$ above which one box contains an extensive number of
minima. The onset of order is governed by an unusual order parameter exponent
$\beta=1$, motivating us to study the same model on the Bethe lattice. Here we
find from an exact solution that for any connectivity $\mu+1>2$ there is an
ordering transition with a conventional mean field order parameter exponent
$\beta=1/2$, but with the region where this behaviour is observable shrinking
in size as $1/\mu$ in the mean field limit of large $\mu$. We show that the
behaviour in the transition region can also be understood directly within a
mean field approach, by making the assignment of minima `soft'. Finally we
demonstrate, in the simplest mean field case, how the analysis can be
generalized to include both maxima and minima. In this case an additional first
order phase transition appears, to a landscape in which essentially all sites
are either minima or maxima.
