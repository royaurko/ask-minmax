We consider electrophoresis of a single charged colloidal particle in a
finite box with periodic boundary conditions, where added counterions and salt
ions ensure charge neutrality. A systematic rescaling of the electrokinetic
equations allows us to identify a minimum set of suitable dimensionless
parameters, which, within this theoretical framework, determine the reduced
electrophoretic mobility. It turns out that the salt-free case can, on the Mean
Field level, be described in terms of just three parameters. A fourth
parameter, which had previously been identified on the basis of straightforward
dimensional analysis, can only be important beyond Mean Field. More complicated
behavior is expected to arise when further ionic species are added. However,
for a certain parameter regime, we can demonstrate that the salt-free case can
be mapped onto a corresponding system containing additional salt. The
Green-Kubo formula for the electrophoretic mobility is derived, and its
usefulness demonstrated by simulation data. Finally, we report on
finite-element solutions of the electrokinetic equations, using the commercial
software package COMSOL.
