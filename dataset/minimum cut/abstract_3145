We observed NGC 1624-2, the O-type star with the largest known magnetic field
Bp~20 kG), in X-rays with the ACIS-S camera onboard the Chandra X-ray
Observatory. Our two observations were obtained at the minimum and maximum of
the periodic Halpha emission cycle, corresponding to the rotational phases
where the magnetic field is the closest to equator-on and pole-on,
respectively. With these observations, we aim to characterise the star's
magnetosphere via the X-ray emission produced by magnetically confined wind
shocks. Our main findings are:
  (i) The observed spectrum of NGC 1624-2 is hard, similar to the magnetic
O-type star Theta 1 Ori C, with only a few photons detected below 0.8 keV. The
emergent X-ray flux is 30% lower at the Halpha minimum phase.
  (ii) Our modelling indicated that this seemingly hard spectrum is in fact a
consequence of relatively soft intrinsic emission, similar to other magnetic
Of?p stars, combined with a large amount of local absorption (~1-3 x 10^22
cm^-2). This combination is necessary to reproduce both the prominent Mg and Si
spectral features, and the lack of flux at low energies. NGC 1624-2 is
intrinsically luminous in X-rays (log LX emission ~ 33.4) but 70-95% of the
X-ray emission produced by magnetically confined wind shocks is absorbed before
it escapes the magnetosphere (log LX ISM corrected ~ 32.5).
  (iii) The high X-ray luminosity, its variation with stellar rotation, and its
large attenuation are all consistent with a large dynamical magnetosphere with
magnetically confined wind shocks.
