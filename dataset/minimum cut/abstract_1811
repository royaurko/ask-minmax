We present the dispersion relations for quasiparticle excitations about the
color-flavor locked ground state of QCD at high baryon density. In the presence
of condensates which pair light and strange quarks there need not be an energy
gap in the quasiparticle spectrum. This raises the possibility of gapless color
superconductivity, with a Meissner effect but no minimum excitation energy.
Analysis within a toy model suggests that gapless color superconductivity may
occur only as a metastable phase.
