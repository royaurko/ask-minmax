Using molecular dynamics simulations of many junction stretching processes we
analyze the thermopower of silver (Ag), gold (Au), and platinum (Pt) atomic
contacts. In all cases we observe that the thermopower vanishes on average
within the standard deviation and that its fluctuations increase for decreasing
minimum cross-section of the junctions. However, we find a suppression of the
fluctuations of the thermopower for the s-valent metals Ag and Au, when the
conductance originates from a single, perfectly transmitting channel. Essential
features of the experimental results for Au, Ag, and copper (Cu) of Ludoph and
van Ruitenbeek [Phys. Rev. B 59, 12290 (1999)], as yet unaddressed by atomistic
studies, can hence be explained by considering the atomic and electronic
structure at the disordered narrowest constriction of the contacts. For the
multivalent metal Pt our calculations predict the fluctuations of the
thermopower to be larger by one order of magnitude as compared to Ag and Au,
and suppressions of the fluctuations as a function of the conductance are
absent.
