The Minimum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN) is a protoplanetary disk that contains
the minimum amount of solids necessary to build the planets of the Solar
System. Assuming that the giant planets formed in the compact configuration
they have at the beginning of the "Nice model", Desch (2007) built a new MMSN.
He finds a decretion disk, about ten times denser than the well-known Hayashi
MMSN. The disk profile is almost stationary for about ten million years.
However, a planet in a protoplanetary disk migrates. In a massive, long-lived
disk, this question has to be addressed. With numerical simulations, we show
that the four giant planets of the Solar System could not survive in this disk.
In particular, Jupiter enters the type III, runaway regime, and falls into the
Sun like a stone. Known planet-planet interaction mechanisms to prevent
migration, fail in this nebula, in contrast to the Hayashi MMSN. Planetary
migration constrains the construction of a MMSN. We show how this should be
done self-consistently.
