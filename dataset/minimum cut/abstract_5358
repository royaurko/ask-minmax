We investigate the Wyner-Ziv coding in which the statistics of the principal
source is known but the statistics of the channel generating the
side-information is unknown except that it is in a certain class. The class
consists of channels such that the distortion between the principal source and
the side-information is smaller than a threshold, but channels may be neither
stationary nor ergodic. In this situation, we define a new rate-distortion
function as the minimum rate such that there exists a Wyner-Ziv code that is
universal for every channel in the class. Then, we show an upper bound and a
lower bound on the rate-distortion function, and derive a matching condition
such that the upper and lower bounds coincide. The relation between the new
rate-distortion function and the rate-distortion function of the Heegard-Berger
problem is also discussed.
