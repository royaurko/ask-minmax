A drawing of a graph is {\em pseudolinear} if there is a pseudoline
arrangement such that each pseudoline contains exactly one edge of the drawing.
The {\em pseudolinear crossing number} of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of
pairwise crossings of edges in a pseudolinear drawing of $G$. We establish
several facts on the pseudolinear crossing number, including its computational
complexity and its relationship to the usual crossing number and to the
rectilinear crossing number. This investigation was motivated by open questions
and issues raised by Marcus Schaefer in his comprehensive survey of the many
variants of the crossing number of a graph.
