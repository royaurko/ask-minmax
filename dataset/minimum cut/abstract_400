We define a function by means of the minimum weight flow on a planar graph
and prove that this function solves the ultradiscrete Toda molecule equation,
its B\"acklund transformation and the two dimensional Toda molecule equation.
The method we employ in the proof can be considered as fundamental to the
integrability of ultradiscrete soliton equations.
