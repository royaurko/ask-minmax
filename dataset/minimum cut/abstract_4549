We analyze the general structure of four-fermion operators capable of
introducing CP-violation preferentially in Bs mixing within the framework of
Minimal Flavor Violation. The effect requires a minimum of O(Yu^4 Yd^4) Yukawa
insertions, and at this order we find a total of six operators with different
Lorentz, color, and flavor contractions that lead to enhanced Bs mixing. We
then estimate the impact of these operators and of their close relatives on the
possible sizes of electric dipole moments (EDMs) of neutrons and heavy atoms.
We identify two broad classes of such operators: those that give EDMs in the
limit of vanishing CKM angles, and those that require quark mixing for the
existence of non-zero EDMs. The natural value for EDMs from the operators in
the first category is up to an order of magnitude above the experimental upper
bounds, while the second group predicts EDMs well below the current sensitivity
level. Finally, we discuss plausible UV-completions for each type of operator.
