We present the discovery of planet-mass companions to two giant stars by the
ongoing Penn State- Toru\'n Planet Search (PTPS) conducted with the 9.2 m
Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The less massive of these stars, K5-giant BD+20 274,
has a 4.2 MJ minimum mass planet orbiting the star at a 578-day period and a
more distant, likely stellar-mass companion. The best currently available model
of the planet orbiting the K0-giant HD 219415 points to a Jupiter-mass
companion in a 5.7-year, eccentric orbit around the star, making it the longest
period planet yet detected by our survey. This planet has an amplitude of
\sim18 m/s, comparable to the median radial velocity (RV) "jitter", typical of
giant stars.
