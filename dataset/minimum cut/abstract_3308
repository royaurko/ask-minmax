We made a large (approximately 1degr x 1degr) r'-band imaging survey of the
central regions of the two nearby clusters of galaxies, Abell1367 and Coma. The
data, presented as a catalog, are used to construct the r'-band luminosity
function (LF) of galaxies in these two clusters, by subtracting the Yasuda et
al. (2001) galaxy counts from our cluster counts. Our Coma luminosity function
is consistent with previous determinations, i.e. providing a faint end slope
alpha = -1.47_-0.09^+0.08, significantly steeper than the one we find for
Abell1367 (alpha = -1.07_-0.16^+0.20). The counts in Abell1367 show a relative
minimum at r' ~ 19, followed by a steep increase faintward. The difference
between the two clusters appears significant, given the consistency of the
experimental conditions in the two clusters. Whereas for Coma we find a
significant increase of the slope of the LF outwards, no such effect is found
for Abell1367.
