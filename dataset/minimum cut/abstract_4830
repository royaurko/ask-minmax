We generalize the Clausius (in)equality to overdamped mesoscopic and
macroscopic diffusions in the presence of nonconservative forces. In contrast
to previous frameworks, we use a decomposition scheme for heat which is based
on an exact variant of the Minimum Entropy Production Principle as obtained
from dynamical fluctuation theory. This new extended heat theorem holds true
for arbitrary driving and does not require assumptions of local or close to
equilibrium. The argument remains exactly intact for diffusing fields where the
fields correspond to macroscopic profiles of interacting particles under
hydrodynamic fluctuations. We also show that the change of Shannon entropy is
related to the antisymmetric part under a modified time-reversal of the
time-integrated entropy flux.
