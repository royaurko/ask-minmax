This paper is devoted to the asymptotics of eigenvalues for a Schr\"o-dinger
operator in the case when the potential V does not tend to infinity at
infinity. Such a potential is called degenerate. The point is that the set in
the phase space where the associated hamiltonian is smaller than a fixed energy
E may have an infinite volume, so that the Weyl formula which gives the
behaviour of the counting function has to be revisited. We recall various
results in this area, in the classical context as well as in the semi-classical
one and comment the different methods. In sections 3, 4 we present our joint
works with A Morame, (Universit\'e de Nantes),concerning a degenerate potential
V(x) =f(y) g(z), where g is assumed to be a homogeneous positive function of m
variables, and f is a smooth and strictly positive function of n variables,
with a minimum in 0. In the case where f tends to infinity at infinity, we give
the semi-classical asymptotic behaviour of the number of eigenvalues less than
a fixed energy . Then we give a sharp estimate of the low eigenvalues, using a
Born Oppenheimer approximation. With a refined approach we localize also higher
energies . Finally we apply the previous methods to a class of potentials which
vanish on a regular hypersurface.
