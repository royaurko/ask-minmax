A mixed supersymmetric-algebraic approach to construction of the minimum
uncertainty coherent states of anharmonic oscillators is presented. It permits
generating not only the well-known coherent states of the harmonic and Morse
oscillators but also the so far unknown coherent states of the Wei Hua,
Kratzer-Fues and generalized Morse and Kratzer-Fues oscillators. The method can
be applied also to generate superpotentials indispensable for deriving the
Schr\"odinger equation in the supersymmetric form amenable to direct solution
in the SUSYQM scheme.
