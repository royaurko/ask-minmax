We introduce forest diagrams to represent elements of Thompson's group F.
These diagrams relate to a certain action of F on the real line in the same way
that tree diagrams relate to the standard action of F on the unit interval.
Using forest diagrams, we give a conceptually simple length formula for
elements of F with respect to the {x_0,x_1} generating set, and we discuss the
construction of minimum-length words for positive elements. Finally, we use
forest diagrams and the length formula to examine the structure of the Cayley
graph of F.
