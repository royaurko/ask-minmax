In this work, we present a new fitting of the Na+HF potential energy surface
(PES) utilizing a new optmization method based in Genetic Algorithm. Topology
studies, such as isoenergetic contours and Minimum Energy Path(MEP), show that
the quality of this new PES is comparable to the best PES of literature. These
facts, suggests that this new approach can be utilized as new tool to fit PES
of reactive systems.
