We compare string percolation phenomenology to Glasma results on particle
rapidity densities, effective string or flux tube intrinsic correlations, the
ridge phenomena and long range forward-backward correlations. Effective strings
may be a tool to extend the Glasma to the low density QCD regime. A good
example is given by the minimum of the negative binomial distribution parameter
k expected to occur at low energy/centrality.
