We study the newly discovered variable star GSC 4560--02157. CCD photometry
was performed in 2013--2014, and a spectrum was obtained with the 6-m telescope
in June, 2014. GSC 4560--02157 is demonstrated to be a short-period
(P=0.265359d) eclipsing variable star. All its flat-bottom primary minima are
approximately at the same brightness level, while the star's out-of-eclipse
brightness and brightness at secondary minimum varies considerably (by up to
0.6m) from cycle to cycle. Besides, there are short-term (time scale of
0.03-0.04 days) small-amplitude brightness variations out of eclipse. This
behavior suggests cataclysmic nature of the star, confirmed with a spectrum
taken on June 5, 2014. The spectrum shows numerous emissions of the hydrogen
Balmer series, HeI, HeII.
