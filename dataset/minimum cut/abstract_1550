The andante regime of scalar field dynamics in the chaotic inflationary
Universe is defined as the epoch when the field is rolling moderately slowly
down its interaction potential, but at such a rate that first-order corrections
to the slow-roll approximation become important. These conditions should apply
towards the end of inflation as the field approaches the global minimum of the
potential. Solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations for the class of
power law potentials $V(\phi) \propto \phi^{2n}$ are found in this regime in
terms of the inverse error function.
