A sharp asymptotic formula for the number of strongly connected digraphs on
$n$ labelled vertices with $m$ arcs, under a condition $m-n\to\infty$,
$m=O(n)$, is obtained; this solves a problem posed by Wright back in $1977$.
Our formula is a counterpart of a classic asymptotic formula, due to Bender,
Canfield and McKay, for the total number of connected undirected graphs on $n$
vertices with $m$ edges. A key ingredient of their proof was a recurrence
equation for the connected graphs count due to Wright. No analogue of Wright's
recurrence seems to exist for digraphs. In a previous paper with Nick Wormald
we rederived the BCM formula via counting two-connected graphs among the graphs
of minimum degree $2$, at least. In this paper, using a similar embedding for
directed graphs, we find an asymptotic formula, which includes an explicit
error term, for the fraction of strongly-connected digraphs with parameters $m$
and $n$ among all such digraphs with positive in/out-degrees.
