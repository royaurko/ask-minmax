The measurement of the Higgs mass at the LHC has confirmed that the Standard
Model electroweak vacuum is a shallow local minimum and is not absolutely
stable. In addition to a probable unacceptably fast tunneling to the deep true
minimum, it is not clear how the observable present-day vacuum could be reached
from the early Universe particularly following inflation. In this note it is
shown that these problems can be alleviated if the Higgs field is non-minimally
coupled to a higher-curvature theory of gravity which is effective in deriving
inflation a la Starobinsky. Moreover, it implies that the Higgs self-coupling
could be enhanced and have an observable effect at the next generation of
particle colliders.
