This paper presents a convexity analysis for the dynamic snake model based on
the Potential Energy functional and the Hamiltonian formulation of the
classical mechanics. First we see the snake model as a dynamical system whose
singular points are the borders we seek. Next we show that a necessary
condition for a singular point to be an attractor is that the energy functional
is strictly convex in a neighborhood of it, that means, if the singular point
is a local minimum of the potential energy. As a consequence of this analysis,
a local expression relating the dynamic parameters and the rate of convergence
arises. Such results link the convexity analysis of the potential energy and
the dynamic snake model and point forward to the necessity of a physical
quantity whose convexity analysis is related to the dynamic and which
incorporate the velocity space. Such a quantity is exactly the (conservative)
Hamiltonian of the system.
