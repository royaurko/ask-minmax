The feasibility of sparse signal reconstruction depends heavily on the
inter-atom interference of redundant dictionary. In this paper, a semi-blindly
weighted minimum variance distortionless response (SBWMVDR) is proposed to
mitigate the inter-atom interference. Examples of direction of arrival
estimation are presented to show that the orthogonal match pursuit (OMP) based
on SBWMVDR performs better than the ordinary OMP algorithm.
