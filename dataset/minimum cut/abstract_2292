The goal of the LHCb experiment is the indirect search for New Physics
through precision measurements of B-decays. A short description of the detector
and its performance after the first data taking in 2009 and 2010 will be
presented. In addition first preliminary results of a $\rm K_{s}$ differential
cross section measurement at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 900\; \rm
GeV$ and a measurement of the $\frac{\bar{\lambda}}{\lambda}$ production ratio
at $\sqrt{s} = 900\; \rm GeV$ and $\sqrt{s} = 7\; \rm TeV$ will be discussed.
