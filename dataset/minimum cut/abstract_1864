We present a simple method to calculate the one-loop effective action of QCD
which reduces the calculation to that of SU(2) QCD. For the chromomagnetic
background we show that the effective potential has an absolute minimum only
when two color magnetic fields $H_{\mu\nu}^3$ and $H_{\mu\nu}^8$ are orthogonal
to each other. For the chromoelectric background we find that the imaginary
part of the effective action has a negative signature, which implies the gluon
pair-annihilation. We discuss the physical implications of our result.
