In order to test the performance of detector/prototype in environment of
laboratory, we design and build a larger area ($90\times52$ $cm^2$) test
platform of cosmic ray based on well-designed Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber
(MRPC) with an excellent time resolution and a high detection efficiency for
the minimum ionizing particles (MIPs). The time resolution of the MRPC module
used is tested to be ~80 ps, and the position resolution along the strip is ~5
mm, while the position resolution perpendicular to the strip is ~12.7 mm. The
platform constructed by four MRPC modules can be functional for tracking the
cosmic rays with a spatial resolution ~6.3 mm, and provide a reference time ~40
ps.
