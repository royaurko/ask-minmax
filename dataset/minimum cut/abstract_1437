In this paper, we will first clarify the physical meaning of having a minimum
measurable time. Then we will combine the deformation of the Dirac equation due
to the existence of minimum measurable length and time scales with its
deformation due to the doubly special relativity. We will also analyse this
deformed Dirac equation in curved spacetime, and observe that this deformation
of the Dirac equation also leads to a non-trivial modification of general
relativity. Finally, we will analyse the stochastic quantization of this
deformed Dirac equation on curved spacetime.
