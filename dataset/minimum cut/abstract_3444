The time decay of the thermoremanent magnetization(TRM) of the
$\mbox{Fe}_{80-\mbox{x}}\mbox{Ni}_{\mbox{x}}\mbox{Cr}_{20}$ ($14\leq \mbox{x}
\leq 30$) alloys has been measured for four different magnetic phases within
the fcc $\mbox{$\gamma$}$-phase using a SQUID magnetometer. In the spin-glass
phase(SG)(X=19) very distinct ageing effects are observed where M(t) can be
described as $M(t)=M_0(t/t_{w})^{-\gamma}\exp[-(t/\tau)^{1-n}]$ for the entire
time domain. In the reentrant spin-glass(RSG)(X= 23 and 26), M(t) can be better
represented by the stretched exponential with an addition of a constant term
which can be well explained by the Gabay-Toulouse(GT) model. We have also
measured the linear and non-linear ac susceptibilities for the sample X=23 and
confirmed the presence of the ferromagnetic(FM) ordering down to the lowest
temperature. In the RSG(X=23), the TRM shows a minimum near T$_{\mbox{c}}$ and
a local maximum just above T$_{\mbox{c}}$. In the FM phase (X=30) the popular
prediction of the power law decay of the TRM is observed. The latter is
indistinguishable from the stretched exponential in the antiferromagnetic(AF)
phase (X=14).
