We apply the Skyrme model to dense hadronic matter, which provides a unified
approach to high density, valid in the large Nc limit. In our picture, dense
hadronic matter is described by the classical soliton configuration with
minimum energy for the given baryon number density. By incorporating the meson
fluctuations on such ground state we obtain an effective Lagrangian for meson
dynamics in a dense medium. Our starting point has been the Skyrme model
defined in terms of pions, thereafter we have extended and improved the model
by incorporating other degrees of freedom such as dilaton, kaons and vector
mesons.
