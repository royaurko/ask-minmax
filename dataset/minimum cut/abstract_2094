We review the features of the bound state equation in large N scalar QCD in
two dimensions, the 't Hooft model, and compute the discrete hadron mass
spectrum in this theory. We make the Ansatz that the scalar fields of this
model represent spin zero diquarks and we estimate the minimum allowed mass for
the first radial excitation of the lowest diquark-antidiquark scalar meson. The
discussion is extended to the case of spin one diquarks.
