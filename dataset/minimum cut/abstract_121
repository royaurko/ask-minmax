An overview of minimum bias and underlying event studies at the LHC with the
ATLAS and CMS detectors is presented. Current uncertainties in the modeling of
soft pp inelastic interactions at the LHC energy scale are discussed. Triggers
used to select inelastic interactions at ATLAS and CMS are described and
compared. A summary of some of the ongoing minimum bias and underlying event
analyses by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations is given.
