In reality, many real-world networks interact with and depend on other
networks. We develop an analytical framework for studying interacting networks
and present an exact percolation law for a network of $n$ interdependent
networks (NON). We present a general framework to study the dynamics of the
cascading failures process at each step caused by an initial failure occurring
in the NON system. We study and compare both $n$ coupled Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
(ER) graphs and $n$ coupled random regular (RR) graphs. We found recently [Gao
et. al. arXive:1010.5829] that for an NON composed of $n$ ER networks each of
average degree $k$, the giant component, $P_{\infty}$, is given by
$P_{\infty}=p[1-\exp(-kP_{\infty})]^n$ where $1-p$ is the initial fraction of
removed nodes. Our general result coincides for $n=1$ with the known
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi second-order phase transition at a threshold, $p=p_c$, for
a single network. For $n=2$ the general result for $P_{\infty}$ corresponds to
the $n=2$ result [Buldyrev et. al., Nature, 464, (2010)]. Similar to the ER
NON, for $n=1$ the percolation transition at $p_c$, is of second order while
for any $n>1$ it is of first order. The first order percolation transition in
both ER and RR (for $n>1$) is accompanied by cascading failures between the
networks due to their interdependencies. However, we find that the robustness
of $n$ coupled RR networks of degree $k$ is dramatically higher compared to the
$n$ coupled ER networks of average degree $k$. While for ER NON there exists a
critical minimum average degree $k=k_{\min}$, that increases with $n$, below
which the system collapses, there is no such analogous $k_{\min}$ for RR NON
system.
