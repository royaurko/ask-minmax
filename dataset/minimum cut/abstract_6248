We present the results of a spatially-resolved spectroscopic analysis of the
galaxy cluster Abell 496 with the S3 chip on-board the Chandra satellite. We
confirm the presence of a central positive temperature gradient consistent with
a cooling flow, but with a minimum gas temperature of ~0.5-0.9 keV. The cluster
also exhibits sharp edges in gas density and temperature which are consistent
with "cold front" substructures. The iron abundance profile is not radially
symmetric relative to the cluster center. Towards the direction of the most
prominent (northerly) cold front, the iron abundance is roughly flat, with
nearly solar values. In the opposite (southerly) direction from the center, the
iron abundance distribution shows an "off-center" peak. Various abundance
ratios suggest that the heavy elements in the central regions of the cluster
are dominated by SN Ia ejecta. However, for radii greater than 100 kpc, the
abundance ratios vary in such a way that different abundance ratios provide
very different estimates of the proportion of SN Ia/II ejecta. Nonetheless,
observed abundances and abundance ratios are continuous across the cold fronts,
which suggests that the cold fronts are not likely to be the result of a
subcluster merger. We suggest instead that the cold fronts in A496 are caused
by "sloshing" of the central cooling flow gas, induced by the motion of the cD
about the cluster center.
