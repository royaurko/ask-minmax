In the usual parameter regime of accelerator physics, particle ensembles can
be treated as classical. If we approach a regime where
$\epsilon_x\epsilon_y\epsilon_s \approx N_{particles}\lambda_{Compton}^3\$,
however, the granular structure of quantum-mechanical phase space becomes a
concern. In particular, we have to consider the Pauli exclusion principle,
which will limit the minimum achievable emittance for a beam of fermions. We
calculate these lowest emittances for the cases of bunched and coasting beams
at zero temperature and their first-order change rate at finite temperature.
