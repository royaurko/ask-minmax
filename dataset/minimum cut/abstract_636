For a narrow band of values of the top quark and Higgs boson masses, the
Standard Model Higgs potential develops a false minimum at energies of about
$10^{16}$ GeV, where primordial Inflation could have started in a cold
metastable state. A graceful exit to a radiation-dominated era is provided,
e.g., by scalar-tensor gravity models. We pointed out that if Inflation
happened in this false minimum, the Higgs boson mass has to be in the range
$126.0 \pm 3.5$ GeV, where ATLAS and CMS subsequently reported excesses of
events. Here we show that for these values of the Higgs boson mass, the
inflationary gravitational wave background has be discovered with a
tensor-to-scalar ratio at hand of future experiments. We suggest that combining
cosmological observations with measurements of the top quark and Higgs boson
masses represents a further test of the hypothesis that the Standard Model
false minimum was the source of Inflation in the Universe.
