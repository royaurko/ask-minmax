The production of Kshort and Lambda hadrons is studied in inelastic pp
collisions at sqrt(s) = 0.9 and 7 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the
LHC using a minimum-bias trigger. The observed distributions of transverse
momentum, rapidity, and multiplicity are corrected to hadron level in a
model-independent way within well defined phase-space regions. The distribution
of the production ratio of Lambdabar to Lambda baryons is also measured. The
results are compared with various Monte Carlo simulation models. Although most
of these models agree with data to within 15% in the Kshort distributions,
substantial disagreements with data are found in the Lambda distributions of
transverse momentum.
