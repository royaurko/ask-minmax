The effects of an externally applied one-dimensional periodic potential on
the freezing/melting behaviour of two-dimensional systems of colloidal
particles with a short-range attractive interaction are studied using Monte
Carlo simulations. In such systems, incommensuration results when the
periodicity of the external potential does not match the length-scale at which
the minimum of the attractive potential occurs. To study the effects of this
incommensuration, we consider two different models for the system. Our
simulations for both these models show the phenomenon of reentrant freezing as
the strength of the periodic potential is varied. Our simulations also show
that different exotic phases can form when the strength of the periodic
potential is high, depending on the length-scale at which the minimum of the
attractive pair-potential occurs.
