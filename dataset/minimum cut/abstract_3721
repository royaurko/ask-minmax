We have considered a cosmological model with a phenomenological model for the
cosmological constant of the form $\Lambda=\bt\fr{\ddot R}{R}$, $ \bt$ is a
constant. For age parameter consistent with observational data the Universe
must be accelerating in the presence of a positive cosmological constant. The
minimum age of the Universe is $H_0^{-1}$, where $H_0$ is the present Hubble
constant. The cosmological constant is found to decrease as $t^{-2}$. Allowing
the gravitational constant to change with time leads to an ever increasing
gravitational constant at the present epoch. In the presence of a viscous fluid
this decay law for $\Lambda$ is equivalent to the one with $\Lambda=3\alpha
H^2$ ($\alpha=\rm const.$) provided $\alpha=\fr{\bt}{3(\bt-2)}$. The
inflationary solution obtained from this model is that of the de-Sitter type.
