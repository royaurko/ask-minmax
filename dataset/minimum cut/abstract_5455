We extract from data the parameters of the Higgs potential, the top Yukawa
coupling and the electroweak gauge couplings with full 2-loop NNLO precision,
and we extrapolate the SM parameters up to large energies with full 3-loop NNLO
RGE precision. Then we study the phase diagram of the Standard Model in terms
of high-energy parameters, finding that the measured Higgs mass roughly
corresponds to the minimum values of the Higgs quartic and top Yukawa and the
maximum value of the gauge couplings allowed by vacuum metastability. We
discuss various theoretical interpretations of the near-criticality of the
Higgs mass.
