Time scales associated with activated transitions between glassy metastable
states of a free energy functional appropriate for a dense hard sphere system
are calculated by using a new Monte Carlo method for the local density
variables. We calculate the time the system,initially placed in a shallow
glassy minimum of the free energy, spends in the neighborhood of this minimum
before making a transition to the basin of attarction of another free energy
minimum. This time scale is found to increase with the average density. We find
a crossover density near which this time scale increases very sharply and
becomes longer than the longest times accessible in our simulation. This scale
shows no evidence of dependence on sample size.
