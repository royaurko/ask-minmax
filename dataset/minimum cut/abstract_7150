A relation giving a minimum for the irreversible work in quasi-equilibrium
processes was derived by Sekimoto et al. (K. Sekimoto and S. Sasa, J. Phys.
Soc. Jpn. {\bf 66} (1997), 3326) in the framework of stochastic energetics.
This relation can also be written as a type of "uncertainty principle" in such
a way that the precise determination of the Helmholtz free energy through the
observation of the work $<W>$ requires an indefinitely large experimental time
$\Delta t$. In the present article, we extend this relation to the case of
quasi-steady processes by using the concept of non-equilibrium Helmholtz free
energy. We give a formulation of the second law for these processes that
extends that presented by Sekimoto (K. Sekimoto, Prog. Theo. Phys. Suppl. No.
{\bf 130} (1998), 17) by a term of the first order in the inverse of the
experimental time. As application of our results, two possible experimental
situations are considered: stretching of a RNA molecule and the drag of a
dipolar particle in the presence of a gradient of electric force.
