Several charmonium-like states above $D\bar{D}$ threshold have been
discovered at the Belle and BABAR B-factories. Some of these states are
produced via Initial State Radiation (e.g. Y(4260) and Y(4350)), and some are
observed in B-meson decays (e.g. X(3872), and Y(3940)). The Belle observations
of the enhancements in the $\psi(2S)\pi^-$ and $\chi_{c1}\pi^-$, i.e. the
Z(4430)-, Z_1(4050)-, and Z_2(4250)-, have generated a great deal of interest,
because such states must have minimum quark content $(c\bar{c}d\bar{u})$, i.e.
these are candidate four-quark state. The BABAR Collaboration does not confirm
the existinence of the $Z(4430)^-$.
