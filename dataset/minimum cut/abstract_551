Precise Doppler measurements from the AAT/UCLES spectrometer reveal two
companions to both HD 154857 and HD 160691. The inner companion to HD 154857
has a period of 398 d, an eccentricity of 0.51, and a minimum mass of 1.8
M_Jupiter An outer companion has a period much longer than 2 years and is
currently detected only as a linear trend of 14 m/s per year. The inner
companion to HD 160691, previously announced from AAT data, has a period of 645
d, an eccentricity of 0.20, and a minimum mass of 1.7 M_Jupiter. For the outer
planet, whose orbit is less well constrained, a two Keplerian fit yields a
period of 8.2 yr, an eccentricity of 0.57, and a minimum mass of 3.1 M_Jupiter.
With these orbital parameters, its maximum separation from the star of 0.4
arcsec makes it a viable target for direct imaging.
