The S$_2$ site of the KcsA K$^+$ channel has eight carbonyl ligands in the
ion-binding site. A recent study suggests that the K$^+$-over-Na$^+$
selectivity of the S$_2$ site can be understood by noting the larger free
energy change involved in enforcing an eight water coordination state around
Na$^+$ relative to K$^+$. The free energies were obtained from the
probabilities of observing eight water molecules within a coordination sphere
whose radius ($\lambda_{\rm Na^+} \approx 3.1$ {\AA} and $\lambda_{\rm K^+}
\approx 3.5$ {\AA}) extends to the first minimum of the ion-water oxygen pair
correlation function. Curiously, using the same coordination radius led to
results that question the very idea of using coordination states in water to
understand selectivity in the channel. We show that density fluctuations in
neat water at the length scale of the coordination volume enter the description
of the hydration thermodynamics of the ion expressed in terms of its
coordination states. Density fluctuations explain the sensitivity to the choice
of radius. After accounting for this effect, the results lead to the conclusion
that free energy changes involved in the transition between coordination states
in water are inadequate to explain selectivity in the ion-channel.
