We report the detections of two substellar companions orbiting around evolved
intermediate-mass stars from precise Doppler measurements at Subaru Telescope
and Okayama Astrophysical Observatory. HD 145457 is a K0 giant with a mass of
1.9 M_sun and has a planet of minimum mass m_2sini=2.9 M_J orbiting with period
of P=176 d and eccentricity of e=0.11. HD 180314 is also a K0 giant with 2.6
M_sun and hosts a substellar companion of m_2sin i=22 M_J, which falls in
brown-dwarf mass regime, in an orbit with P=396 d and e=0.26. HD 145457 b is
one of the innermost planets and HD 180314 b is the seventh candidate of
brown-dwarf-mass companion found around intermediate-mass evolved stars.
