We discuss new methods of measuring and interpreting the
forbidden-to-intercombination line ratios of helium-like triplets in the X-ray
spectra of O-type stars, including accounting for the spatial distribution of
the X-ray emitting plasma and using the detailed photospheric UV spectrum.
Measurements are made for four O stars using archival Chandra HETGS data. We
assume an X-ray emitting plasma spatially distributed in the wind above some
minimum radius R_0. We find minimum radii of formation typically in the range
of 1.25 < R_0 / R_* < 1.67, which is consistent with results obtained
independently from line profile fits. We find no evidence for anomalously low
f/i ratios and we do not require the existence of X-ray emitting plasmas at
radii that are too small to generate sufficiently strong shocks.
