The roughness of crack interfaces is reported in quasistatic fracture, using
an elastic network of beams with random breaking thresholds. For strong
disorders we obtain 0.86(3) for the roughness exponent, a result which is very
different from the minimum energy surface exponent, i.e., the value 2/3. A
cross-over to lower values is observed as the disorder is reduced, the exponent
in these cases being strongly dependent on the disorder.
