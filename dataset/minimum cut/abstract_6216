We discuss the morphology and spectrophotometry of 5 comets visible in
August, 2001. We decompose comae into coma profiles and azimuthally
renormalized images, in which general and local features are quantitatively
comparable. Comet 19P/Borrelly showed a strong gas fan toward the solar
direction, but no detectable gas in the tail. Dust in its inner coma was
collimated toward the antisolar direction and the tail, with no dust in the
outer coma. The contribution of spatial variations structure was moderate,
about 35%. Comet 29P Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 was observed in outburst: we
detected ``spinning'' jet structures. A high level of dust production resulted
in an unusually high Af\rho=16600 cm. The spatial variations reached -77%, at
the minimum, due in part to a jet and a ring-like structure in 1 arcminute
distance from the nucleus. In comet C/2001 A2, we detected a strong
post-perihelion increase of dust and gas activity, in which the C_2 profile
became one magnitude brighter over a 3-day period. For comets C/2000 SV74 and
C/2000 WM1, we present detailed pre-perihelion spectrophotometry and
morphological information. Comet C/2000 SV74 showed high dust production
(Af\rho=1479 cm). Its coma suggests a steady-state outflow of material, while
the low contribution of spatial variations support high level activity. The
coma of C/2000 WM1 is dominated by solar effects, and CO+ forms the bulk of its
gas activity. Despite its large heliocentric distance, we observed a nice tail.
