We experimentally demonstrate a sigmoidal variation of the composition
profile across semiconductor heterointerfaces. The wide range of material
systems (III-arsenides, III-antimonides, III-V quaternary compounds,
III-nitrides) exhibiting such a profile suggests a universal behavior. We show
that sigmoidal profiles emerge from a simple model of cooperative growth
mediated by two-dimensional island formation, wherein cooperative effects are
described by a specific functional dependence of the sticking coefficient on
the surface coverage. Experimental results confirm that, except in the very
early stages, island growth prevails over nucleation as the mechanism governing
the interface development and ultimately determines the sigmoidal shape of the
chemical profile in these two-dimensional grown layers. In agreement with our
experimental findings, the model also predicts a minimum value of the
interfacial width, with the minimum attainable value depending on the chemical
identity of the species.
