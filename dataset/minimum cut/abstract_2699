In this paper we present a model for dark energy in minimal supergravity with
flat K\"ahler metric and a power-law superpotential. These choices of $K$ and
$W$ can lead to a spontaneous supersymmetry breaking, with the minimum of the
potential at $V(\varphi_0)=0$. We assume that the massive gravitino can decay
into a scalar field with same potential than before, but expanded around
$\Phi\equiv\varphi-\varphi_0=0$. This expanded potential $V(\Phi)$ leads to an
accelerated expansion of the universe with density parameter equals
$\Omega_\Phi=0.7$ today.
