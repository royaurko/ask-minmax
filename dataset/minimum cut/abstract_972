A cosmological scenario is proposed where the dark matter (DM) and dark
energy (DE) of the universe are two simultaneous manifestations of an
inhomogenous dilaton. The equation of state of the field is scale-dependent and
pressureless at galactic and larger scales and it has negative pressure as a DE
at very large scales. The dilaton drives an inflationary phase followed by a
kinetic energy-dominated one, as in the "quintessential inflation" model
introduced by Peebles & Vilenkin, and soon after the end of inflation particle
production seeds the first inhomogeneities that lead to galaxy formation. The
dilaton is trapped near the minimum of the potential where it oscillates like a
massive field, and the excess of kinetic energy is dissipated via the mechanism
of "gravitational cooling" first introduced by Seidel & Suen. The
inhomogeneities therefore behave like solitonic oscillations around the minimum
of the potential, known as "oscillatons", that we propose account for most DM
in galaxies. Those regions where the dilaton does not transform enough kinetic
energy into reheating or carry an excess of it from regions that have cooled,
evolve to the tail of the potential as DE, driving the acceleration of the
universe.
