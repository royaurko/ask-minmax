PHENIX has measured the dielectron continuum in sqrt(s_(NN))=200 GeV Au+Au
and p+p collisions. In minimum bias Au+Au collisions the dielectron yield in
the mass range between 150 and 750 MeV/c^2 is enhanced by a factor of 3.4 +/-
0.2(stat.) +/- 1.3(syst.) +/- 0.7(model) compared to the expectation from our
model of hadron decays that well reproduces the mass spectrum in p+p
collisions. The integrated yield increases faster with the centrality of the
collisions than the number of participating nucleons, suggesting emission from
scattering processes in the dense medium. The continuum yield between the
masses of the phi and the J/psi meson is consistent with expectations from
correlated ccbar production, though other mechanisms are not ruled out.
