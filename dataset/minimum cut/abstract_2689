This paper is concerned with the investigation of the regional
controllability of the time fractional diffusion equations. First, some
preliminaries and definitions of regional controllability of the system under
consideration are introduced, which promote the existence contributions on
controllability analysis. Then we analyze the regional controllability with
minimum energy of the time fractional diffusion equations on two cases: $B\in
\mathbf{L}\left(\mathbf{R}^m, L^2(\Omega) \right)$ and $B\notin
\mathbf{L}\left(\mathbf{R}^m, L^2(\Omega) \right)$. In the end, two
applications are given to illustrate our obtained results.
