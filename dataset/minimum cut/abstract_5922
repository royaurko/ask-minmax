A new approach, which is based on the new canonical equations of Hamilton
found by us recently, is presented to analytically obtain the approximate
solution of the nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NNLSE). The
approximate analytical soliton solution of the NNLSE can be obtained, and the
stability of the soliton can be analytically analysed in the simple way as
well, all of which are consistent with the results published earlier. For the
single light-envelope propagated in nonlocal nonlinear media modeled by the
NNLSE, the Hamiltonian of the system can be constructed, which is the sum of
the generalized kinetic energy and the generalized potential. The extreme point
of the generalized potential corresponds to the soliton solution of the NNLSE.
The soliton is stable when the generalized potential has the minimum, and
unstable otherwise. In addition, the rigorous proof of the equivalency between
the NNLSE and the Euler-Lagrange equation is given on the premise of the
response function with even symmetry.
