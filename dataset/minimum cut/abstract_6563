The mutation and selection of regulatory DNA sequences is presented as an
ideal model system of molecular evolution where genotype, phenotype, and
fitness can be explicitly and independently characterized. In this theoretical
study, we construct an explicit model for the evolution of regulatory
sequences, making use of the known biophysics of the binding of regulatory
proteins to DNA sequences, under the assumption that fitness of a sequence
depends only on its binding affinity to the regulatory protein. The model is
confined to the mean field (i.e., infinite population size) limit. Using
realistic values for all parameters, we determine the minimum fitness advantage
needed to maintain a binding sequence, demonstrating explicitly the ``error
threshold'' below which a binding sequence cannot survive the accumulated
effect of mutation over long time. The commonly observed ``fuzziness'' in
binding motifs arises naturally as a consequence of the balance between
selection and mutation in our model. In addition, we devise a simple model for
the evolution of multiple binding sequences in a given regulatory region. We
find the number of evolutionarily stable binding sequences to increase in a
step-like fashion with increasing fitness advantage, if multiple regulatory
proteins can synergistically enhance gene transcription. We discuss possible
experimental approaches to resolve open questions raised by our study.
