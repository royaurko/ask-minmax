We consider a dynamical system with small noise where the drift is
parametrized by a finite dimensional parameter. For this model we consider
minimum distance estimation from continuous time observations under some
penalty imposed on the parameters in the spirit of the Lasso approach. This
approach allows for simultaneous estimation and model selection for this model.
