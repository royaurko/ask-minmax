We calculate numerically the R\'enyi bipartite entanglement entropy of the
ground state of Klein-Gordon field theory (coupled harmonic oscillators) after
fixing the position (partial measurement) of some of the oscillators in $d=1,2$
and $3$ dimensions. We show that after partial measurement as far as the two
parts are connected the area-law is valid in generic dimensions except in $d=1$
conformal field theories. When due to the measured region the two parts are
disconnected, the entanglement entropy decreases exponentially with respect to
the minimum distance between the regions. In the massless case the decay is
power-law with a universal dimension-dependent exponent.
