In this work we present a numerical study, based on molecular dynamics
simulations, to estimate the freezing point of hard spheres and hypersphere
systems in dimension D = 4, 5, 6 and 7. We have studied the changes of the
Radial Distribution Function (RDF) as a function of density in the coexistence
region. We started our simulations from crystalline states with densities above
the melting point, and moved down to densities in the liquid state below the
freezing point. For all the examined dimensions (including D = 3) it was
observed that the height of the first minimum of the RDF changes in an almost
continuous way around the freezing density and resembles a second order phase
transition. With these results we propose a numerical method to estimate the
freezing point as a function of the dimension D using numerical fits and
semiempirical approaches. We find that the estimated values of the freezing
point are very close to previously reported values from simulations and
theoretical approaches up to D = 6 reinforcing the validity of the proposed
method. This was also applied to numerical simulations for D = 7 giving new
estimations of the freezing point for this dimensionality.
