In this paper, an expression for the asymptotic growth rate of the number of
small linear-weight codewords of irregular doubly-generalized LDPC (D-GLDPC)
codes is derived. The expression is compact and generalizes existing results
for LDPC and generalized LDPC (GLDPC) codes. Assuming that there exist check
and variable nodes with minimum distance 2, it is shown that the growth rate
depends only on these nodes. An important connection between this new result
and the stability condition of D-GLDPC codes over the BEC is highlighted. Such
a connection, previously observed for LDPC and GLDPC codes, is now extended to
the case of D-GLDPC codes.
