The condition of t-resilience stipulates that an n-process program is only
obliged to make progress when at least n-t processes are correct. Put another
way, the live sets, the collection of process sets such that progress is
required if all the processes in one of these sets are correct, are all sets
with at least n-t processes.
  We show that the ability of arbitrary collection of live sets L to solve
distributed tasks is tightly related to the minimum hitting set of L, a minimum
cardinality subset of processes that has a non-empty intersection with every
live set. Thus, finding the computing power of L is NP-complete.
  For the special case of colorless tasks that allow participating processes to
adopt input or output values of each other, we use a simple simulation to show
that a task can be solved L-resiliently if and only if it can be solved
(h-1)-resiliently, where h is the size of the minimum hitting set of L.
  For general tasks, we characterize L-resilient solvability of tasks with
respect to a limited notion of weak solvability: in every execution where all
processes in some set in L are correct, outputs must be produced for every
process in some (possibly different) participating set in L. Given a task T, we
construct another task T_L such that T is solvable weakly L-resiliently if and
only if T_L is solvable weakly wait-free.
