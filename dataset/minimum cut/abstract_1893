In this article we study the problem of minimizing $a\chi+b\sigma$ on the
class of all symplectic 4--manifolds with prescribed fundamental group $G$
($\chi$ is the Euler characteristic, $\sigma$ is the signature, and $a,b\in
\BR$), focusing on the important cases $\chi$, $\chi+\sigma$ and
$2\chi+3\sigma$. In certain situations we can derive lower bounds for these
functions and describe symplectic 4-manifolds which are minimizers. We derive
an upper bound for the minimum of $\chi$ and $\chi+\sigma$ in terms of the
presentation of $G$.
