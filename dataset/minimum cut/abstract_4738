During winter and springtime, the flow above Antarctica at high altitude
(upper troposphere and stratosphere) is dominated by the presence of a vortex
centered above the continent. It lasts typically from August to November. This
vortex is characterized by a strong cyclonic jet centered above the polar high.
In a recent study of our group (Hagelin et al., 2008) of four different sites
in the Antarctic internal plateau (South Pole, Dome C, Dome A and Dome F), it
was made the hypothesis that the wind speed strength in the upper atmosphere
should be related to the distance of the site to the center of the Antarctic
polar vortex. This high altitude wind is very important from an astronomical
point of view since it might trigger the onset of the optical turbulence and
strongly affect other optical turbulence parameters. What we are interested in
here is to localize the position of the minimum value of the wind speed at high
altitude in order to confirm the hypothesis of Hagelin et al. (2008).
