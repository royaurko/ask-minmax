A new lower bound on the minimum Hamming distance of linear quasi-cyclic
codes over finite fields is proposed. It is based on spectral analysis and
generalizes the Semenov- Trifonov bound in a similar way as the Hartmann-Tzeng
bound extends the BCH approach for cyclic codes. Furthermore, a syndrome-based
algebraic decoding algorithm is given.
