Usually, hearing impaired people use hearing aids which are implemented with
speech enhancement algorithms. Estimation of speech and estimation of nose are
the components in single channel speech enhancement system. The main objective
of any speech enhancement algorithm is estimation of noise power spectrum for
non stationary environment. VAD (Voice Activity Detector) is used to identify
speech pauses and during these pauses only estimation of noise. MMSE (Minimum
Mean Square Error) speech enhancement algorithm did not enhance the
intelligibility, quality and listener fatigues are the perceptual aspects of
speech. Novel evaluation approach SR (Signal to Residual spectrum ratio) based
on uncertainty parameter introduced for the benefits of hearing impaired people
in non stationary environments to control distortions. By estimation and
updating of noise based on division of original pure signal into three parts
such as pure speech, quasi speech and non speech frames based on multiple
threshold conditions. Different values of SR and LLR demonstrate the amount of
attenuation and amplification distortions. The proposed method will compared
with any one method WAT(Weighted Average Technique) Hence by using parameters
SR (signal to residual spectrum ratio) and LLR (log like hood ratio), MMSE
(Minim Mean Square Error) in terms of segmented SNR and LLR.
