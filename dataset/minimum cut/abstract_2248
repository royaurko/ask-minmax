Recently it was shown (by the contributor) that every graph of size $q$ (the
number of edges) and minimum degree $\delta$ is hamiltonian if
$q\le\delta^2+\delta-1$ (arXiv:1107.2201v1). In this paper we present the exact
analog of this result for dominating cycles: if $G$ is a 2-connected graph with
$q\le8$ if $\delta=2$ and $q\le (3(\delta-1)(\delta+2)-1)/2$ if $\delta\ge3$,
then each longest cycle in $G$ is a dominating cycle. The result is sharp in
all respects.
