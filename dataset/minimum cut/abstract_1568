The idea that the TeV air showers, thought to be produced by >10 TeV gamma
rays from Mrk 501, can be mimicked by coherent bunches of sub-TeV photons is
reexamined, focusing on fundamental considerations. In particular, it is shown
that the minimum spot size of the beam of pulsed TeV photons arriving at Earth
is on the order of a few kilometers, unless a lens with certain characteristics
is placed between the TeV laser and Earth. The viability of the laser
production mechanism proposed by Harwit et al. (2000) is also reassessed.
