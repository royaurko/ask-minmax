Here is proposed a general subgraph-based method for efficiently sampling
certain graphical models, typically using subgraphs of a fixed treewidth, and
also a related method for finding minimum energy (ground) states. In the case
of models with frustration, such as the spin glass, evidence is presented that
this method can be more efficient than traditional single-site update methods.
