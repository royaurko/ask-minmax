We report the results of magnetic measurements on a powder sample of
NiCu(pba)(D_2O)_3 \cdot 2D_2O$ (pba=1,3-propylenebis(oxamato)) which
is one of the prototypical examples of an $S$=1/2 and 1 ferrimagnetic chain.
Susceptibility($\chi$) shows a monotonous increase with decreasing temperature
(T) and reaches a maximum at about 7 K. In the plot of $\chi T$ versus
$T$, the experimental data exhibit a broad minimum and are fit to the
$\chi T$ curve calculated for the ferrimagnetic Heisenberg chain composed of
S=1/2 and 1. From this fit, we have evaluated the nearest-neighbor exchange
constant $J/k_B=121 K$, the g-values of Ni$^{2+}$ and Cu$^{2+}$,
$g_{Ni}$=2.22 and $g_{Cu}$=2.09, respectively. Applied external field
dependence of $\chi T$ at low temperatures is reproduced fairly well by the
calculation for the same ferrimagnetic model.
