We address the problem of determining whether or not a harmonic oscillator
has been perturbed by an external force. Quantum detection and estimation
theory has been used in devising optimum measurement schemes. Detection
probability has been evaluated for different initial state preparations of
oscillator. The corresponding lower bounds on minimum detectable perturbation
intensity has been evaluated and a general bound for random phase perturbation
has been also induced.
