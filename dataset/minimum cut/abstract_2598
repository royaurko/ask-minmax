We prove some results concerning Alcuin number of graphs. First, we classify
graphs which have unique minimum vertex cover. Then we present two necessary
conditions for a graph to be of class two and show why one of them (condition
on common neighbors) is sufficient as well. By using this classification
theorem, we prove some results about class one and class two graphs such as
cartesian product of graphs and classification of regular graphs.
