Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are extremely energetic events and produce highly
diverse light curves. Light curves are believed to be resulting from internal
shocks reflecting the activities of the GRB central engine. Hence their
temporal studies can potentially lead to an understanding of the GRB central
engine and its evolution. The light curve variability time scale is an
interesting parameter which most models attribute to a physical origin e.g.,
central engine activity, clumpy circum-burst medium, or relativistic
turbulence. We develop a statistical method to estimate the GRB minimum
variability time scale (MVT) for long and short GRBs detected by GBM. We find
that the MVT of short bursts is distinctly shorter than that of long GRBs
supporting the possibility of a more compact central engine of the former. We
also find that MVT estimated by this method is consistent with the shortest
rise time of the fitted pulses. Hence we use the fitted pulse rise times to
study the evolution of burst variability time scale. Variability time coupled
with the highest energy photon detected in turn related to the minimum bulk
Lorentz factor of the relativistic shell emitted by the inner engine. %Using
this we relate the GRB spectral evolution to the evolution of the variability
time scale.
