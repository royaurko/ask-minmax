In this paper, we develop a general theory on the coverage probability of
random intervals defined in terms of discrete random variables with continuous
parameter spaces. The theory shows that the minimum coverage probabilities of
random intervals with respect to corresponding parameters are achieved at
discrete finite sets and that the coverage probabilities are continuous and
unimodal when parameters are varying in between interval endpoints. The theory
applies to common important discrete random variables including binomial
variable, Poisson variable, negative binomial variable and hypergeometrical
random variable. The theory can be used to make relevant statistical inference
more rigorous and less conservative.
