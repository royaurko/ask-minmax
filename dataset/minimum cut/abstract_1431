This paper provides new constructions and lower bounds for subspace codes,
using Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes from matchings of the complete graph
and pending blocks. We present different constructions for constant dimension
codes with minimum injection distance $2$ or $k-1$, where $k$ is the constant
dimension. Furthermore, we present a construction of new codes from old codes
for any minimum distance. Then we construct non-constant dimension codes from
these codes. The examples of codes obtained by these constructions are the
largest known codes for the given parameters.
