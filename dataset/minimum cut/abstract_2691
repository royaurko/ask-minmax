We define a family of binary outcome $n$-party $m\leq n$ settings per party
Bell inequalities whose members require the least detection efficiency for
their violation among all known inequalities of the same type. This gives upper
bounds for the minimum value of the critical efficiency --- below which no
violation is possible --- achievable for such inequalities. For $m=2$, our
family reduces to the one given by Larsson and Semitecolos in 2001. For $m>2$,
a gap remains between these bounds and the best lower bounds. The violating
state near the threshold efficiency always approaches a product state of $n$
qubits.
