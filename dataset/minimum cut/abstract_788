We describe radial-velocity time series obtained by HARPS on the 3.60 m
telescope in La Silla (ESO, Chile) over ten years and report the discovery of
five new giant exoplanets in distant orbits; these new planets orbit the stars
HD 564, HD 30669, HD 108341, and BD-114672. Their periods range from 492 to
1684 days, semi-major axes range from 1.2 to 2.69 AU, and eccentricities range
from 0 to 0.85. Their minimum mass ranges from 0.33 to 3.5 Mjup. We also refine
the parameters of two planets announced previously around HD 113538, based on a
longer series of measurements. The planets have a period of 663+-8 and 1818+-25
days, orbital eccentricities of 0.14+-0.08 and 0.20+-0.04, and minimum masses
of 0.36+-0.04 and 0.93+-0.06 Mjup. Finally, we report the discovery of a new
hot-Jupiter planet around an active star, HD 103720; the planet has a period of
4.5557+-0.0001 days and a minimum mass of 0.62+-0.025 Mjup. We discuss the
fundamental parameters of these systems and limitations due to stellar activity
in quiet stars with typical 2m/s radial velocity precision.
