We study numerically the existence and character of bound states for positive
and negative point charges shielded by the response of a two-dimensional
homogeneous electron gas. The problem is related to many physical situations
and has recently arisen in experiments for impurities on metal surfaces with
Schockley surface states. Mathematical theorems ascertain a bound state for
two-dimensional circularly symmetric potentials $V(r)$ with
$\int_{0}^{\infty}{dr r V(r)} \leq 0$. We find that a shielded potential with
$\int_{0}^{\infty}{dr r V(r)} > 0$ may also sustain a bound state. Moreover, on
the same footing we study the electron-electron interactions in the
two-dimensional electron gas finding a bound state with an energy minimum for a
certain electron gas density.
