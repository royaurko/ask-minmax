We find tight estimates for the minimum number of proper subspaces needed to
cover all lattice points in an n-dimensional convex body symmetric about the
origin. We also find the order of magnitude of the number of (n-1)-dimensional
subspaces induced by the lattice points in a large n-dimensional ball centered
at the origin.
