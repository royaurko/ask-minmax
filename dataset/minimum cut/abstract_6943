We report the detection of three new extrasolar planets orbiting the solar
type stars HD 85390, HD 90156 and HD 103197 with the HARPS spectrograph mounted
on the ESO 3.6-m telescope at La Silla observatory. HD 85390 has a planetary
companion with a projected intermediate mass (42.0 Earth masses) on a 788-day
orbit (a=1.52 AU) with an eccentricity of 0.41, for which there is no analogue
in the solar system. A drift in the data indicates the presence of another
companion on a long period orbit, which is however not covered by our
measurements. HD 90156 is orbited by a warm Neptune analogue with a minimum
mass of 17.98 Earth masses (1.05 Neptune masses), a period of 49.8 days (a=0.25
AU) and an eccentricity of 0.31. HD 103197 has an intermediate mass planet on a
circular orbit (P=47.8 d, Msini=31.2 Earth masses). We discuss the formation of
planets of intermediate mass (about 30-100 Earth masses) which should be rare
inside a few AU according to core accretion formation models.
