Investigation of the structure of the Standard Model effective potential at
very large field strengths opens a window towards new phenomena and can reveal
properties of the UV completion of the SM. The map of the lifetimes of the
vacua of the SM enhanced by nonrenormalizable scalar couplings has been
compiled to show how new interactions modify stability of the electroweak
vacuum. Whereas it is possible to stabilize the SM by adding Planck scale
suppressed interactions and taking into account running of the new couplings,
the generic effect is shortening the lifetime and hence further destabilisation
of the SM electroweak vacuum. These findings have been illustrated with phase
diagrams of modified SM-like models. It has been demonstrated that
stabilisation can be achieved by lowering the suppression scale of higher order
operators while picking up such combinations of new couplings, which do not
deepen the new minima of the potential. Our results show the dependence of the
lifetime of the electroweak minimum on the magnitude of the new couplings,
including cases with very small couplings (which means very large effective
suppression scale) and couplings vastly different in magnitude (which
corresponds to two different suppression scales).
