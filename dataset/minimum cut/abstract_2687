Heat produced during a reset operation is meant to show a fundamental bound
known as Landauer limit, while simple switch operations have an expected
minimum amount of produced heat equal to zero. However, in both cases,
present-day technology realizations dissipate far beyond these theoretical
limits. In this paper we present a study based on molecular dynamics
simulations, where reset and switch protocols are applied on a graphene buckled
ribbon, employed here as a nano electromechanical switch working at the
thermodynamic limit.
