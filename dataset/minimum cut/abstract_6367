We study the acceleration of the star HE0437-5439, to hypervelocity and
discuss its possible origin in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The star has a
radial velocity of 723 km/s and is located at a distance of 61 kpc from the
Sun. With a mass of about 8 Msun, the travel time from the Galactic centre is
of about 100 Myr, much longer than its main sequence lifetime. Given the
relatively small distance to the LMC (18 kpc), we consider it likely that
HE0437-5439 originated in the cloud rather than in the Galactic centre, like
the other hypervelocity stars. The minimum ejection velocity required to travel
from the LMC to its current location within its lifetime is of about 500 km/s.
Such a high velocity can only be obtained in a dynamical encounter with a
massive black hole. We perform 3-body scattering simulations in which a stellar
binary encounters a massive black hole and find that a black hole more massive
than 1000 Msun is necessary to explain the high velocity of HE0437-5439. We
look for possible parent clusters for HE0437-5439 and find that NGC 2100 and
NGC 2004 are young enough to host stars coeval to HE0437-5439 and dense enough
to produce an intermediate mass black hole able to eject an 8 Msun star with
hypervelocity.
