A brief review is given of some of the recent developments in the theoretical
analyses of supersymmetric dark matter. These include the effects of
uncertainties in the wimp velocity and wimp density and of the effects of
uncertainties in the quark densities of the proton. Also analyzed are the
effects of non-universalities in the gaugino sector and their effects on
determining the nature of cold dark matter, i.e., if the neutralino is bino
like, higgsino like, or wino like. The maximum and the minimum elastic
neutralino proton cross sections are discussed and a comparison of the direct
and the indirect detection arising from the capture and annihilation of
neutralinos in the core of the earth and the sun is given. Some of the other
recent developments are summarized.
