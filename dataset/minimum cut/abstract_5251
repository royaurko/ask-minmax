The Newton iteration is a popular method for minimising a cost function on
Euclidean space. Various generalisations to cost functions defined on manifolds
appear in the literature. In each case, the convergence rate of the generalised
Newton iteration needed establishing from first principles. The present paper
presents a framework for generalising iterative methods from Euclidean space to
manifolds that ensures local convergence rates are preserved. It applies to any
(memoryless) iterative method computing a coordinate independent property of a
function (such as a zero or a local minimum). All possible Newton methods on
manifolds are believed to come under this framework. Changes of coordinates,
and not any Riemannian structure, are shown to play a natural role in lifting
the Newton method to a manifold. The framework also gives new insight into the
design of Newton methods in general.
