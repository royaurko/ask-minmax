A classical theorem of Ghouila-Houri from 1960 asserts that every directed
graph on $n$ vertices with minimum out-degree and in-degree at least $n/2$
contains a directed Hamilton cycle. In this paper we extend this theorem to a
random directed graph ${\mathcal D}(n,p)$, that is, a directed graph in which
every ordered pair $(u,v)$ becomes an arc with probability $p$ independently of
all other pairs. Motivated by the study of resilience of properties of random
graphs, we prove that if $p \gg \log n/\sqrt{n}$, then a.a.s. every subdigraph
of ${\mathcal D}(n,p)$ with minimum out-degree and in-degree at least $(1/2 +
o(1)) n p$ contains a directed Hamilton cycle. The constant $1/2$ is
asymptotically best possible. Our result also strengthens classical results
about the existence of directed Hamilton cycles in random directed graphs.
