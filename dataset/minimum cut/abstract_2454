Modelling of inspection data for large scale physical systems is critical to
assessment of their integrity. We present a general method for inference about
system state and associated model variance structure from spatially distributed
time series which are typically short, irregular, incomplete and not directly
observable. Bayes linear analysis simplifies parameter estimation and avoids
often-unrealistic distributional assumptions. Second-order exchangeability
judgements facilitate variance learning for sparse inspection time-series. The
model is applied to inspection data for minimum wall thickness from corroding
pipe-work networks on a full-scale offshore platform, and shown to give
materially different forecasts of remnant life compared to an equivalent model
neglecting variance learning.
