A construction is presented that allows to produce subspace codes of long
length using subspace codes of shorter length in combination with a rank metric
code. The subspace distance of the resulting code, called linkage code, is as
good as the minimum subspace distance of the constituent codes. As a special
application, the construction of the best known partial spreads is reproduced.
Finally, for a special case of linkage, a decoding algorithm is presented which
amounts to decoding with respect to the smaller constituent codes and which can
be parallelized.
