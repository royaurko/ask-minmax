Isoscalar Cooper pairing in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter occurs between
states populating two distinct Fermi surfaces, each for neutrons and protons.
The transition from a BCS-like to the normal (unpaired) state, as the isospin
asymmetry is increased, is intervened by superconducting phases which
spontaneously break translational and rotational symmetries. One possibility is
the formation of a condensate with a periodic crystallinelike structure where
Cooper pairs carry net momentum (the nuclear
Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell-phase). Alternatively, perturbations of the
Fermi surfaces away from spherical symmetry allow for minima in the condensate
free energy which correspond to a states with quadrupole deformations of Fermi
surfaces and zero momentum of the Cooper pairs. In a combined treatment of
these phases we show that, although the Cooper pairing with finite momentum
might arise as a local minimum, the lowest energy state features are deformed
Fermi surfaces and Cooper pairs with vanishing total momentum.
