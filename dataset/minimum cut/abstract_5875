A complete set for pseudoscalar-meson photoproduction is a minimum set of
observables from which one can determine the underlying reaction amplitudes
unambiguously. The complete sets considered in this work involve single- and
double-polarization observables. It is argued that for extracting amplitudes
from data, the transversity representation of the reaction amplitudes offers
advantages over alternate representations. It is shown that with the available
single-polarization data for the p({\gamma},K^+)\Lambda reaction, the energy
and angular dependence of the moduli of the normalized transversity amplitudes
in the resonance region can be determined to a fair accuracy. Determining the
relative phases of the amplitudes from double-polarization observables is far
less evident.
