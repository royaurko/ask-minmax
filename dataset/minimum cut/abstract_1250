It is well known that minimum received energy per bit in the interference
channel is -1.59dB as if there were no interference. Thus, the best way to
mitigate interference is to operate the interference channel in the low-SNR
regime. However, when the SNR is small but non-zero, minimum energy per bit
alone does not characterize performance. Verdu introduced the wideband slope
S_0 to characterize the performance in this regime. We show that a wideband
slope of S_0/S_{0,no interference}=1/2 is achievable. This result is similar to
recent results on degrees of freedom in the high SNR regime, and we use a type
of interference alignment using delays to obtain the result. We also show that
in many cases the wideband slope is upper bounded by S_0/S_{0,no
interference}<=1/2 for large number of users K .
