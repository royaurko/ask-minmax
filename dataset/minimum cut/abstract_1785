We report measurements of the first and second moments of the hadronic
invariant mass squared distribution, <M^2_X> and <(M^2_X-<M^2_X>)^2>, in B ->
X_c l nu decays for minimum lepton momenta ranging from 0.7 to 1.5 GeV/c in the
B meson rest frame. The measurement uses BBbar events in which the hadronic
decay of one B meson is fully reconstructed and the semileptonic decay of the
other B is inferred from the presence of an identified lepton. These results
are obtained from a 140 fb^-1 data sample collected near the Y(4S) resonance
with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e^+e^- collider.
