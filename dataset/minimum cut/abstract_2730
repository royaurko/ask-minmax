The database of Prof. Rogers (1887), which includes wheat prices in England
in the Middle Ages, was used to search for a possible influence of solar
activity on the wheat market. We present a conceptual model of possible modes
for sensitivity of wheat prices to weather conditions, caused by solar cycle
variations, and compare expected price fluctuations with price variations
recorded in medieval England.
  We compared statistical properties of the intervals between wheat price
bursts during years 1249-1703 with statistical properties of the intervals
between minimums of solar cycles during years 1700-2000. We show that
statistical properties of these two samples are similar, both for
characteristics of the distributions and for histograms of the distributions.
We analyze a direct link between wheat prices and solar activity in the 17th
Century, for which wheat prices and solar activity data (derived from 10Be
isotope) are available. We show that for all 10 time moments of the solar
activity minimums the observed prices were higher than prices for the
correspondent time moments of maximal solar activity (100% sign correlation, on
a significance level < 0.2%). We consider these results as a direct evidence of
the causal connection between wheat prices bursts and solar activity.
