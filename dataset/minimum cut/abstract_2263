By a length scale analysis, we study the equilibrium interactions between two
like-charge planes confining neutralising counter-ions. At large Coulombic
couplings, approaching the two charged bodies leads to an unbinding of
counter-ions, a situation that is amenable to an exact treatment. This
phenomenon is the key to attractive effective interactions. A particular effort
is made for pedagogy, keeping equations and formalism to a minimum.
