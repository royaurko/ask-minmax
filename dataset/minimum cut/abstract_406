The sphericity distribution in minimum bias events obtained with PYTHIA event
generator, incorporating different parton distribution functions is presented.
The results show that for minimum bias pp collisions the sphericity
distribution for different parameters like the mean transverse momentum and
multiplicity exhibit strong sensitivity on the parton distribution function
used. The results indicate that early data at the LHC could be used in this
type of analysis to fix the gluon distribution function in the proton.
