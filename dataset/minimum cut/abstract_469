The scale of an endomorphism, $\alpha$, of a totally disconnected, locally
compact group $G$ is the minimum index $[\alpha(U) : \alpha(U)\cap U]$, for $U$
a compact, open subgroup of $G$. A structural characterization of subgroups at
which the minimum is attained is established. This characterization extends the
notion of subgroup tidy for $\alpha$ from previously understood case when
$\alpha$ is an automorphism to the case when $\alpha$ is merely an
endomorphism.
