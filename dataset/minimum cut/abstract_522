Quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are an important
instance of proto-graph-based LDPC codes. In this paper we present upper bounds
on the minimum Hamming distance of QC LDPC codes and study how these upper
bounds depend on graph structure parameters (like variable degrees, check node
degrees, girth) of the Tanner graph and of the underlying proto-graph.
Moreover, for several classes of proto-graphs we present explicit QC LDPC code
constructions that achieve (or come close to) the respective minimum Hamming
distance upper bounds. Because of the tight algebraic connection between QC
codes and convolutional codes, we can state similar results for the free
Hamming distance of convolutional codes. In fact, some QC code statements are
established by first proving the corresponding convolutional code statements
and then using a result by Tanner that says that the minimum Hamming distance
of a QC code is upper bounded by the free Hamming distance of the convolutional
code that is obtained by "unwrapping" the QC code.
