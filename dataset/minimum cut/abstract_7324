In simulating charged systems, it is often useful to treat some ionic
components of the system at the mean-field level and solve the
Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation to get their respective density profiles. The
numerically intensive task of solving the PB equation at each step of the
simulation can be bypassed using variational methods that treat the
electrostatic potential as a dynamic variable. But such approaches require the
access to a true free-energy functional; a functional that not only provides
the correct solution of the PB equation upon extremization, it also evaluates
to the true free energy of the system at its minimum. Moreover, the numerical
efficiency of such procedures is further enhanced if the free-energy functional
is local and is expressed in terms of the electrostatic potential. Existing PB
functionals of the electrostatic potential, while possessing the local
structure, are not free-energy functionals. We present a variational
formulation with a local free-energy functional of the potential. In addition,
we also construct a nonlocal free-energy functional of the electrostatic
potential. These functionals are suited for employment in simulation schemes
based on the ideas of dynamical optimization.
