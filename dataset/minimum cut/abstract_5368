We study the analogue of Poisson ensembles of Markov loops ("loop soups") in
the setting of one-dimensional diffusions. We give a detailed description of
the corresponding intensity measure. The properties of this measure on loops
lead us to an extension of Vervaat's bridge-to-excursion transformation that
relates the bridges conditioned by their minimum and the excursions of all the
diffusion we consider and not just the Brownian motion. Further we describe the
Poisson point process of loops, their occupation fields and explain how to
sample these Poisson ensembles of loops using two-dimensional Markov processes.
Finally we introduce a couple of interwoven determinantal point processes on
the line which is a dual through Wilson's algorithm of Poisson ensembles of
loops and study the properties of these determinantal point processes.
