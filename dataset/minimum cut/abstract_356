In this paper, we develop an exact method for the determination of the
minimum sample size for estimating the proportion of a finite population with
prescribed margin of error and confidence level. By characterizing the behavior
of the coverage probability with respect to the proportion, we show that the
computational complexity can be significantly reduced and bounded regardless
population size.
