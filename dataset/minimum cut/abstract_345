Theoretical predictions for the deuteron and the isoscalar trinucleon charge
form factors are compared. Correlations between them are found. Linear
relations hold for the position of the diffraction minimum and for the position
and height of the secondary maximum. The linear relation for the diffraction
minimum misses the experimental data.
