We predict a strikingly different $A$ and $Q^{2}$ dependence of quasielastic
leptoproduction of the $\rho^{0}(1S)$-meson and its radial excitation $\rho
'(2S)$ on nuclei. Whereas for the $\rho^{0}$ production nuclear transparency
$T_{A}$ decreases monotonically with $A$, for the $\rho'$ nuclear transparency
$T_{A}$ can have the counterintuitive nonmonotonic $A$-dependence, having the
minimum for light nuclei, and increasing with $A$ for medium and heavy nuclei.
Strong enhancement of the $\rho ' /\rho^{0}$ cross section ratio makes nuclear
targets the $\rho '$-factory. The origin of the anomalous $A$-dependence is in
the interplay of color transparency effects with the nodal structure of the
$\rho '$ wave function. The predicted effects take place at moderate
$Q^{2}\lsim (2-3)$GeV$^{2}$, which can be explored in high statistics
experiments at CEBAF.
