The bit-error threshold of the standard ensemble of Low Density Parity Check
(LDPC) codes is known to be close to capacity, if there is a non-zero fraction
of degree-two bit nodes. However, the degree-two bit nodes preclude the
possibility of a block-error threshold. Interestingly, LDPC codes constructed
using protographs allow the possibility of having both degree-two bit nodes and
a block-error threshold. In this paper, we analyze density evolution for
protograph LDPC codes over the binary erasure channel and show that their
bit-error probability decreases double exponentially with the number of
iterations when the erasure probability is below the bit-error threshold and
long chain of degree-two variable nodes are avoided in the protograph. We
present deterministic constructions of such protograph LDPC codes with girth
logarithmic in blocklength, resulting in an exponential fall in bit-error
probability below the threshold. We provide optimized protographs, whose
block-error thresholds are better than that of the standard ensemble with
minimum bit-node degree three. These protograph LDPC codes are theoretically of
great interest, and have applications, for instance, in coding with strong
secrecy over wiretap channels.
