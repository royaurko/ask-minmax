We consider the process of spin relaxation in the oscillating
cantilever-driven adiabatic reversals technique in magnetic resonance force
microscopy. We simulated the spin relaxation caused by thermal excitations of
the high frequency cantilever modes in the region of the Rabi frequency of the
spin sub-system. The minimum relaxation time obtained in our simulations is
greater but of the same order of magnitude as one measured in recent
experiments. We demonstrated that using a cantilever with nonuniform
cross-sectional area may significantly increase spin relaxation time.
