Begin with a set of four points in the real plane in general position. Add to
this collection the intersection of all lines through pairs of these points.
Iterate. Ismailescu and Radoi\v{c}i\'{c} (2003) showed that the limiting set is
dense in the plane. We give doubly exponential upper and lower bounds on the
number of points at each stage. The proof employs a variant of the
Szemer\'edi-Trotter Theorem and an analysis of the ``minimum degree'' of the
growing configuration.
