Upon improving and extending the concept of redundancy of frames, we
introduce the notion of redundancy of fusion frames, which is concerned with
the properties of lower and upper redundancies. These properties are achieved
by considering the minimum and maximum values of the redundancy function which
is defined from the unit sphere of the Hilbert space into the positive real
numbers. In addition, we study the relationship between redundancy of frames
(fusion frames) and dual frames (dual fusion frames). Moreover, we indicate
some results about excess of fusion frames. We state the relationship between
redundancy of local frames and fusion frames in a particular case. Furthermore,
some examples are also given.
