In this article we consider the frog model with drift on $\mathbb{Z}$ and
investigate the behaviour of the cloud of the frogs. In particular, we show
that the speed of the minimum equals the speed of a single frog and prove some
properties of the speed of the maximum. In addition, we show a limit theorem
for the empirical distribution.
