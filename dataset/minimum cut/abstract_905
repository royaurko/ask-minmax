Holomorphy of the superpotential promotes any continuous symmetry group G to
a complexified symmetry group G_C of the superpotential. For U(1) symmetry this
means that the superpotential is not only invariant under U(1) phase rotation
but also under some scaling. We use complexified R-symmetry to study the
connection between choices of U(1) R-charges and existence of runaway
directions as well as supersymmetry breaking global minimum in generic and
calculable models.
