We test the stability of the mean-field solution in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
model. For stable solutions with respect to both the \sigma and \pi directions,
we investigate effects of the mesonic loop corrections of 1/N_c, which
correspond to the next-to-leading order in the 1/N_c expansion, on the high
density chiral phase transition. The corrections weaken the first order phase
transition and shift the critical chemical potential to a lower value. At
N_c=3, however, instability of the mean field effective potential prevents us
from determining the minimum of the corrected one.
