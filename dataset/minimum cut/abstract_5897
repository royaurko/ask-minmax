The simple security property in an information flow policy can be enforced by
encrypting data objects and distributing an appropriate secret to each user. A
user derives a suitable decryption key from the secret and publicly available
information. A chain-based enforcement scheme provides an alternative method of
cryptographic enforcement that does not require any public information, the
trade-off being that a user may require more than one secret. For a given
information flow policy, there will be many different possible chain-based
enforcement schemes. In this paper, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for
selecting a chain-based scheme which uses the minimum possible number of keys.
We also compute the number of secrets that will be required and establish an
upper bound on the number of secrets required by any user.
