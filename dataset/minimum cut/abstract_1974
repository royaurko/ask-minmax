The parity of atomic wave functions prevents neutral atoms from having
permanent electric-dipole moment. Electric-dipole moment is induced in an atom
when exposed to strong light, the electric field of the light. Hence the
optical trapping of neutral atoms relies on the induced dipole moment. Here we
present the calculated numerical values of the detuning, potential depth,
minimum laser power required to trap $^{87}$Rb ($D_2$ line) atoms using lasers
of wavelength 1064 nm, 850 nm, 820 nm and 800 nm and beam waists 50$\mu$m,
100$\mu$m and 200$\mu$m.
