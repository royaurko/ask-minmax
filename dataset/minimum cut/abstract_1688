The electric resistance of ferromagnet/normal-metal/ferromagnet perpendicular
spin valves depends on the relative angle between the magnetization directions.
In contrast to common wisdom, this angular magnetoresistance is found to be not
necessarily a monotone function of the angle. The parameter dependence of the
global resistance minimum at finite angles is studied and the conditions for
experimental observation are specified.
