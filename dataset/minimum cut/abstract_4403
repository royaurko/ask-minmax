Using an approximate time-dependent density functional theory method, we
calculate the absorption and luminescence spectra for hydrogen passivated
silicon nanoscale structures with large aspect ratio. The effect of electron
confinement in axial and radial directions is systematically investigated.
Excited state relaxation leads to significant Stokes shifts for short nanorods
with lengths less than 2 nm, but has little effect on the luminescence
intensity. The formation of self-trapped excitons is likewise observed for
short nanostructures only; longer wires exhibit fully delocalized excitons with
neglible geometrical distortion at the excited state minimum.
