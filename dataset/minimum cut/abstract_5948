Considerations of local atomic level stresses associated with each atom
represent a particular approach to address structures of disordered materials
at the atomic level. We studied structural correlations in a two-dimensional
model liquid using molecular dynamics simulations in the following way. We
diagonalized the atomic level stress tensors of every atom and investigated
correlations between the eigenvalues and orientations of the eigenvectors of
different atoms as a function of distance between them. It is demonstrated that
the suggested approach can be used to characterize structural correlations in
disordered materials. In particular, we found that changes in the stress
correlation functions on decrease of temperature are the most pronounced for
the pairs of atoms with separation distance that corresponds to the first
minimum in the pair density function. We also show that the angular
dependencies of the stress correlation functions previously reported in [Phys.
Rev. E v.91, 032301 (2015)] related not to the alleged anisotropies of the
Eshelby's stress fields, but to the rotational properties of the stress
tensors.
