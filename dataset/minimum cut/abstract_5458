One of the main bottlenecks in practical full-duplex systems is the
oscillator phase noise, which bounds the possible cancellable self-interference
power. In this paper, a digitaldomain self-interference cancellation scheme for
full-duplex orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems is proposed. The
proposed scheme increases the amount of cancellable selfinterference power by
suppressing the effect of both transmitter and receiver oscillator phase noise.
The proposed scheme consists of two main phases, an estimation phase and a
cancellation phase. In the estimation phase, the minimum mean square error
estimator is used to jointly estimate the transmitter and receiver phase noise
associated with the incoming self-interference signal. In the cancellation
phase, the estimated phase noise is used to suppress the intercarrier
interference caused by the phase noise associated with the incoming
self-interference signal. The performance of the proposed scheme is numerically
investigated under different operating conditions. It is demonstrated that the
proposed scheme could achieve up to 9dB more self-interference cancellation
than the existing digital-domain cancellation schemes that ignore the
intercarrier interference suppression.
