Keck/HIRES precision radial velocities of HD 207832 indicate the presence of
two Jovian-type planetary companions in Keplerian orbits around this G star.
The planets have minimum masses of 0.56 and 0.73 Jupiter-masses with orbital
periods of ~162 and ~1156 days, and eccentricities of 0.13 and 0.27,
respectively. Stromgren b and y photometry reveals a clear stellar rotation
signature of the host star with a period of 17.8 days, well separated from the
period of the radial velocity variations, reinforcing their Keplerian origin.
The values of the semimajor axes of the planets suggest that these objects have
migrated from the region of giant planet formation to closer orbits. In order
to examine the possibility of the existence of additional (small) planets in
the system, we studied the orbital stability of hypothetical terrestrial-sized
objects in the region between the two planets and interior to the orbit of the
inner body. Results indicated that stable orbits exist only in a small region
interior to planet b. However, the current observational data offer no evidence
for the existence of additional objects in this system.
