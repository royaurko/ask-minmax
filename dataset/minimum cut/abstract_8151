We have obtained precision astrometry of the planet hosting M dwarf GJ 317 in
the framework of the Carnegie Astrometric Planet Search project. The new
astrometric measurements give a distance determination of 15.3 pc, 65% further
than previous estimates. The resulting absolute magnitudes suggest it is metal
rich and more massive than previously assumed. This result strengthens the
correlation between high metallicity and the presence of gas giants around low
mass stars. At 15.3 pc, the minimal astrometric amplitude for planet candidate
GJ 317b is 0.3 milliarcseconds (edge-on orbit), just below our astrometric
sensitivity. However, given the relatively large number of observations and
good astrometric precision, a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis
indicates that the mass of planet b has to be smaller than twice the minimum
mass with a 99% confidence level, with a most likely value of 2.5 Mjup.
Additional RV measurements obtained with Keck by the Lick-Carnegie Planet
search program confirm the presence of an additional very long period planet
candidate, with a period of 20 years or more. Even though such an object will
imprint a large astrometric wobble on the star, its curvature is yet not
evident in the astrometry. Given high metallicity, and the trend indicating
that multiple systems are rich in low mass companions, this system is likely to
host additional low mass planets in its habitable zone that can be readily
detected with state-of-the-art optical and near infrared RV measurements.
