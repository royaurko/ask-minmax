Given a finite set S of points in the plane and a real value d > 0, the
d-radius disk graph G^d contains all edges connecting pairs of points in S that
are within distance d of each other. For a given graph G with vertex set S, the
Yao subgraph Y_k[G] with integer parameter k > 0 contains, for each point p in
S, a shortest edge pq from G (if any) in each of the k sectors defined by k
equally-spaced rays with origin p. Motivated by communication issues in mobile
networks with directional antennas, we study the connectivity properties of
Y_k[G^d], for small values of k and d. In particular, we derive lower and upper
bounds on the minimum radius d that renders Y_k[G^d] connected, relative to the
unit radius assumed to render G^d connected. We show that d=sqrt(2) is
necessary and sufficient for the connectivity of Y_4[G^d]. We also show that,
for d <= ~1.056, the graph Y_3[G^d] can be disconnected, but for d >=
2/sqrt(3), Y_3[G^d] is always connected. Finally, we show that Y_2[G^d] can be
disconnected, for any d >= 1.
