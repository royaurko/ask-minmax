We consider the problem of factoring permutations as a product of special
types of transpositions, namely, those transpositions involving two positions
with bounded distances. In particular, we investigate the minimum number,
$\delta$, such that every permutation can be factored into no more than
$\delta$ special transpositions. This study is related to sorting algorithms,
Cayley graphs, and genomics.
