By performing fully 3D symmetry-unrestricted Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
calculations, we discuss shape coexistence and possibility of exotic
deformations simultaneously breaking the reflection and axial symmetries in
proton-rich N=Z nuclei: 64Ge, 68Se, 72Kr, 76Sr, 80Zr and 84Mo. Results of
calculation indicate that the oblate ground state of 68Se is extremely soft
against the Y33 triangular deformation, and that the low-lying spherical
minimum coexisting with the prolate ground state in 80Zr may be unstable
against the Y32 tetrahedral deformation.
