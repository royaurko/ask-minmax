Using data collected during the 1992-1993 collider run at Fermilab, CDF has
made measurements of correlated $b$ quark cross sections where one $b$ is
detected from the lepton from semileptonic decay and the second $b$ is detected
with secondary vertex techniques. We report on measurements of the cross
section as a function of the momentum of the second $b$ and as a function of
the azimuthal separation of the two $b$ quarks, for transverse momentum of the
initial $b$ quark greater than 15 GeV. The vertex reconstruction techniques are
valid over a large range in transverse momentum, starting at a minimum of 10
GeV. Results are compared to QCD predictions.
