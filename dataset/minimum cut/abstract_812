We show how to construct an algorithm to search for binary idempotents which
may be used to construct binary LDPC codes. The algorithm, which allows control
of the key properties of sparseness, code rate and minimum distance, is
constructed in the Mattson-Solomon domain. Some of the new codes, found by
using this technique, are displayed.
