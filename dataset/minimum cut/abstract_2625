Let $R=\mathbb{Z}_q+u\mathbb{Z}_q$, where $q=p^s$ and $u^2=0$. In this paper,
some structural properties of cyclic codes over the ring $R$ are considered. A
necessary and sufficient condition for cyclic codes over the ring $R$ to be
free is obtained and a BCH-type bound on the minimum Hamming distance for them
is also given.
