The current-voltage characteristics of the alpha-Hemolysin protein pore
during the passage of single-stranded DNA under varying ionic strength, C, are
studied experimentally. We observe strong blockage of the current, weak
super-linear growth of the current as a function of voltage, and a minimum of
the current as a function of C. These observations are interpreted as the
result of the ion electrostatic self-energy barrier originating from the large
difference in the dielectric constants of water and the lipid bilayer. The
dependence of DNA capture rate on C also agrees with our model.
