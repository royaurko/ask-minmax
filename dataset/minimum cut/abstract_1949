Starting from the knowledge of the four fundamental quantities length L, mass
M, time T, absolute temperature $\theta$ and accepting the validity of Gauss's
law in all dimensions, we generalize, by the theory of physical dimensions, the
expression of the Stephan-Boltzmann law and of the Planck's formula for the
black-body radiation to a spacetime with one time and n spatial coordinates. In
the particular case n=3 we shall recover the known results.
