We calculate the self-energies and the spectral densities of longitudinal and
transverse gluons at zero temperature in color-superconducting quark matter in
the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase. We find a collective excitation, a
plasmon, at energies smaller than two times the gap parameter and momenta
smaller than about eight times the gap. The dispersion relation of this mode
exhibits a minimum at some nonzero value of momentum, indicating a van Hove
singularity.
