We obtain an analytic expression for the highly damped asymptotic quasinormal
mode frequencies of the $d\geq 5$-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole modified
by the Gauss-Bonnet term, which appears in string derived models of gravity.
The analytic expression is obtained under the string inspired assumption that
there exists a minimum length scale in the system and in the limit when the
coupling in front of the Gauss-Bonnet term in the action is small. Although
there are several similarities of this geometry with that of the Schwarzschild
black hole, the asymptotic quasinormal mode frequencies are quite different. In
particular, the real part of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies for this
class of single horizon black holes in not proportional to log(3).
