The explosion energy and the ejecta mass of a type IIP supernova make up the
basis for the theory of explosion mechanism. So far, these parameters have only
been determined for seven events. Type IIP supernova 2008in is another
well-observed event for which a detailed hydrodynamic modeling can be used to
derive the supernova parameters. Hydrodynamic modeling was employed to describe
the bolometric light curve and the expansion velocities at the photosphere
level. A time-dependent model for hydrogen ionization and excitation was
applied to model the Halpha and Hbeta line profiles. We found an ejecta mass of
13.6 Msun, an explosion energy of 5.05x10^50 erg, a presupernova radius of 570
Rsun, and a radioactive Ni-56 mass of 0.015 Msun. The estimated progenitor mass
is 15.5 Msun. We uncovered a problem of the Halpha and Hbeta description at the
early phase, which cannot be resolved within a spherically symmetric model. The
presupernova of SN 2008in was a normal red supergiant with the minimum mass of
the progenitor among eight type IIP supernovae explored by means of the
hydrodynamic modeling. The problem of the absence of type IIP supernovae with
the progenitor masses <15 Msun in this sample remains open.
