We study the problem of a single impurity of mass $M$ immersed in a Fermi sea
of particles of mass $m$. The impurity and the fermions interact through a
s-wave narrow Feshbach resonance, so that the Feshbach length $R_*$ naturally
appears in the system. We use simple variational ansatz, limited to at most one
pair of particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea and we determine for the
polaronic and dimeronic branches the phase diagram between absolute ground
state, local minimum, thermodynamically unstable regions (with negative
effective mass), and regions of complex energies (with negative imaginary
part). We also determine the closed channel population which is experimentally
accessible. Finally we identify a non-trivial weakly attractive limit where
analytical results can be obtained, in particular for the crossing point
between the polaronic and dimeronic energy branches.
