A competitive (2+1)-dimensional model of deposit formation, based on the
combination of random sequential absorption deposition (RSAD), ballistic
deposition (BD) and random deposition (RD) models, is proposed. This model was
named as RSAD$_{1-s}$(RD$_f$BD$_{1-f}$)$_s$. It allows to consider different
cases of interparticle interactions from complete repulsion between
near-neighbors in the RSAD model ($s=0$) to sticking interactions in the BD
model ($s=1, f=0$) or absence of interactions in the RD model ($s=1$, $f=0$).
The ideal checkerboard ordered structure was observed for the pure RSAD model
($s=0$) in the limit of $h \to \infty$. Defects in the ordered structure were
observed at small $h$. The density of deposit $p$ versus system size $L$
dependencies were investigated and the scaling parameters and values of
$p_\infty=p(L=\infty)$ were determined. Dependencies of $p$ versus parameters
of the competitive model $s$ and $f$ were studied. We observed the anomalous
behaviour of the eposit density $p_\infty$ with change of the inter-particle
repulsion, which goes through minimum on change of the parameter $s$. For pure
RSAD model, the concentration of defects decreases with $h$ increase in
accordance with the critical law $\rho\propto h^{-\chi_{RSAD}}$, where
$\chi_{RSAD} \approx 0.119 \pm 0.04$.
