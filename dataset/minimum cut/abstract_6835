We extend the models presented in Mordasini et al. (2009) to the formation of
planets orbiting stars of different masses. We discuss the properties of the
resulting synthetic planet population in terms of mass, orbit, and metallicity
distributions. The population synthesis calculations we use are based on the
planet formation model developed in Alibert et al. (2005a), which
self-consistently takes into account planetary growth and migration in an
evolving proto-planetary disk. Using this model, we generate synthetic
populations of planets by following their growth in a large number of
proto-planetary disks, whose properties (mass and lifetime) are selected in a
Monte Carlo fashion using probability distributions derived from observations.
We show that the scaling of the proto-planetary disk mass with the mass of the
central star has a direct and large influence on the properties of the
resulting planet population. In particular, the observed paucity of large mass
planets orbiting 0.5 Msun stars can directly be explained as resulting from a
only slightly steeper than linear scaling. The observed lack of short period
planet orbiting 2.0 Msun stars can also be attributed to this scaling but only
if associated with a decrease of the mean disk lifetime for stars more massive
than 1.5 Msun. Finally, we show that the distribution of minimum mass and
semi-major axis of our synthetic planets are statistically comparable with
observations.
