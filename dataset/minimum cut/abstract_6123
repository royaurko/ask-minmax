We discuss the properties and implications of a 3.7x0.9 kpc region of
spatially-coincident X-ray and H-alpha emission about 11.6 kpc to the north of
the galaxy M82 previously discussed by Devine and Bally (1999). The PSPC X-ray
spectrum is fit by thermal plasma (kT=0.80+-0.17 keV) absorbed by only the
Galactic foreground column density. We evaluate the relationship of the
X-ray/H-alpha ridge to the M82 superwind. The main properties of the X-ray
emission can all be explained as being due to shock-heating driven as the
superwind encounters a massive ionized cloud in the halo of M82. This encounter
drives a slow shock into the cloud, which contributes to the excitation of the
observed H-alpha emission. At the same time, a fast bow-shock develops in the
superwind just upstream of the cloud, and this produces the observed X-ray
emission. This interpretation would imply that the superwind has an outflow
speed of roughly 800 km/s, consistent with indirect estimates based on its
general X-ray properties and the kinematics of the inner kpc-scale region of
H-alpha filaments. The gas in the M82 ridge is roughly two orders-of-magnitude
hotter than the minimum "escape temperature" at this radius, so this gas will
not be retained by M82.
