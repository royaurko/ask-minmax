A new diagnostic scheme is presented for ball bearing localized faults, which
utilizes preprocessed time domain features based pattern recognition (PR).
Vibration data is acquired from faulty bearings using a test rig, and the
features are extracted from the data segments that are preprocessed prior to
use in the fault classification process. The preprocessing involves smoothing
of the features, which reduces the undesired impact of noise and vibration
randomness on the PR process, and thus enhances the diagnostic accuracy. The
results are compared with a similar scheme in terms of minimum features
requirement to achieve an optimum classification accuracy, and the feature
processing based proposed scheme provides better results.
