In the present paper it is shown that the interaction between oscillations of
a double-well trappedcondensate and excited Josephson states corresponding to a
large enough initial disbalance of the particle number generates their bound
state. The bound state can realize an absolute minimum of the thermodynamic
energy. The existence of the equilibrium bound state implies that the Josephson
states can be detected by observing thechange in the condensate shape.
