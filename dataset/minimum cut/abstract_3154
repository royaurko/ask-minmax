Numerical simulations of the evolution of a global topological defect field
have two characteristic length scales --- one macrophysical, of order the field
correlation length, and the other microphysical, of order the field width. The
situation currently of most interest to particle cosmologists involves the
behaviour of a GUT-scale defect field at the epoch of decoupling, where the
ratio of these scales is typically of order $10^{50}$. Such a ratio is
unrealisable in numerical work, and we consider the approximations which may be
employed to deal with this. Focusing on the case of global texture we outline
the implementation of the associated algorithms, and in particular note the
subtleties involved in handling texture unwinding events. Comparing the results
in each approach then establishes that, subject to certain constraints on the
minimum grid resolution, the methods described are both robust and consistent
with one another.
