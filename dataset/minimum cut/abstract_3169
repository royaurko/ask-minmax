We investigate the linear stability of a hydrodynamic relativistic flow of
magnetized plasma in the force--free approximation. We considered the case of
light cylindrical jet in cold and dense environment, so the jet boundary
remains at rest. Continuous and discrete spectra of frequencies are
investigated analytically. An infinite sequence of eigenfrequencies is found
near the edge of Alfv\'en continuum. Numerical calculations showed that modes
are stable and have attenuation increment $\gamma$ small. The dispersion curves
$\omega =\omega (k_\parallel )$ have a minimum for $k_{{\parallel}_0}\simeq
1/R$ ($R$ is the jet radius ). This results in accumulation of perturbations
inside the jet with wavelength of the order of the jet radius. The wave crests
of the perturbation pattern formed in such a way move along the jet with the
velocity exceeding light speed. If one has relativistic electrons emitting
synchrotron radiation inside the jet, than this pattern will be visible. This
provide us with the new type of superluminal source. If the jet is oriented
close to the line of sight, than the observer will see knots moving backward to
the core.
