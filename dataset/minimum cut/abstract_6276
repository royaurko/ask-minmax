Deep VLT optical spectroscopy, HST+ACS (GOODS) imaging and VLA observations
are used to unveil the nature of a complete sample of 47 EROs with R-Ks>5 and
Ks<20. The spectroscopic redshift completeness is 62%. Morphological
classification was derived for each ERO through visual inspection and surface
brightness profile fitting. Three main ERO morphological types are found: E/S0
galaxies (30-37%), spiral-like (24-46%) and irregular systems (17-39%). The
only ERO detected in the radio is likely to host an obscured AGN. The average
radio luminosity of the star-forming EROs undetected in the radio implies star
formation rates of the order of 33 Msun yr^-1. The colors, redshifts and masses
of the E/S0 galaxy subsample imply a minimum formation redshift z_f \sim 2.
With this z_f there is enough time to have old and massive stellar spheroids
already assembled at z \sim 1. We verify that the R-Ks vs. J-Ks color diagram
is efficient in segregating old and dusty-star-forming EROs.
