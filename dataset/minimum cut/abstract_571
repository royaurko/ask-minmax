We discuss the properties of strange matter, in particular the minimum of the
energy per baryon number as a function of the strangeness fraction. We utilize
both the MIT bag model and the Color Dielectric Model and compare the energy
per baryon with the masses of hyperons having the corresponding strangeness
fraction, which are coherently calculated within both models. We also take into
account the perturbative exchange of gluons. The results obtained in the two
approaches allow to discuss the stability of strangelets. While the MIT bag
model and the double minimum version of the Color Dielectric Model allow the
existence of strangelets, the single minimum version of the Color Dielectric
Model excludes this possibility.
