We review the modelling of multiple interactions in the event generator
Herwig++ and study implications of recent tuning efforts to LHC data. A crucial
ingredient to a successful description of minimum-bias and underlying-event
observables is a model for colour reconnection. Improvements to this model,
inspired by statistical physics, are presented.
