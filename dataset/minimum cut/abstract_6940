We present high resolution J-band spectroscopy of V 393 Sco obtained with the
CRIRES at the ESO Paranal Observatory along with a discussion of archival IUE
spectra and published broad band magnitudes. The best fit to the spectral
energy distribution outside eclipse gives $T_{1}$= 19000 $\pm$ 500 $K$ for the
gainer, $T_{2}$= 7250 $\pm$ 300 $K$ for the donor, $E(B-V)$= 0.13 $\pm$ 0.02
mag. and a distance of $d$= 523 $\pm$ 60 pc, although circumstellar material
was not considered in the fit. We argue that V 393 Sco is not a member of the
open cluster M7. The shape of the He I 1083 nm line shows orbital modulations
that can be interpreted in terms of an optically thick pseudo-photosphere
mimicking a hot B-type star and relatively large equatorial mass loss through
the Lagrangian L3 point during long cycle minimum. IUE spectra show several
(usually asymmetric) absorption lines from highly ionized metals and a narrow
L$\alpha$ emission core on a broad absorption profile. The overall behavior of
these lines suggests the existence of a wind at intermediate latitudes. From
the analysis of the radial velocities we find $M_{2}/M_{1}$= 0.24 $\pm$ 0.02
and a mass function of $f$= 4.76 $\pm$ 0.24 M$\odot$. Our observations favor
equatorial mass loss rather than high latitude outflows as the cause for the
long variability.
