Existence of a new type of oscillating synchronization that oscillates
between three different types of synchronizations (anticipatory, complete and
lag synchronizations) is identified in unidirectionally coupled nonlinear
time-delay systems having two different time-delays, that is feedback delay
with a periodic delay time modulation and a constant coupling delay.
Intermittent anticipatory, intermittent lag and complete synchronizations are
shown to exist in the same system with identical delay time modulations in both
the delays. The transition from anticipatory to complete synchronization and
from complete to lag synchronization as a function of coupling delay with
suitable stability condition is discussed. The intermittent anticipatory and
lag synchronizations are characterized by the minimum of similarity functions
and the intermittent behavior is characterized by a universal asymptotic
$-{3/2}$ power law distribution. It is also shown that the delay time carved
out of the trajectories of the time-delay system with periodic delay time
modulation cannot be estimated using conventional methods, thereby reducing the
possibility of decoding the message by phase space reconstruction.
