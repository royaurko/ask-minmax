Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold. A {\em self-interacting diffusion}
on $M$ is a stochastic process solution to $$dX_t = dW_t(X_t) -
\frac{1}{t}(\int_0^t \nabla V_{X_s}(X_t)ds)dt$$ where $\{W_t\}$ is a Brownian
vector field on $M$ and $V_x(y) = V(x,y)$ a smooth function. Let $\mu_t =
\frac{1}{t} \int_0^t \delta_{X_s} ds$ denote the normalized occupation measure
of $X_t$. We prove that, when $V$ is symmetric, $\mu_t$ converges almost surely
to the critical set of a certain nonlinear free energy functional $J$.
Furthermore, $J$ has generically finitely many critical points and $\mu_t$
converges almost surely toward a local minimum of $J.$ Each local minimum
having a positive probability to be selected.
