The existence of the molecular ion $H_3^{++}$ in a magnetic field in a
triangular configuration is revised. Variational method with an optimization of
the form of the vector potential (gauge fixing) is used. It is shown that in
the range of magnetic fields $10^8 < B < 10^{11} G$ the system $(pppe)$, with
protons forming an equilateral triangle perpendicular to magnetic line, has a
well-pronounced minimum in the total energy. This configuration is unstable
towards decays $H{-atom} + p + p$ and $H_2^+ + p$. Triangular configuration of
$H_3^{++}$ complements $H_3^{++}$ in the linear configuration which exists for
$B \gtrsim 10^{10} G$.
