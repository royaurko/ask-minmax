We discuss an optimisation criterion for the exact renormalisation group
based on the inverse effective propagator, which displays a gap. We show that a
simple extremisation of the gap stabilises the flow, leading to better
convergence of approximate solutions towards the physical theory. This improves
the reliability of truncations, most relevant for any high precision
computation. These ideas are closely linked to the removal of a spurious scheme
dependence and a minimum sensitivity condition. The issue of predictive power
and a link to the Polchinski RG are discussed as well. We illustrate our
findings by computing critical exponents for the Ising universality class.
