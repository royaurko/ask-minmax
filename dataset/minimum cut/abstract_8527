Continuing the project described by Kato et al. (2009, arXiv:0905.1757), we
studied 86 SU UMa-type dwarf novae. We confirmed the general trends such as the
relation between period derivatives and orbital periods. There are some systems
showing positive period derivatives despite the long orbital periods. We
observed the 2011 outburst of the WZ Sge-type dwarf nova BW Scl, and recorded
an O-C diagram similar to those of previously known WZ Sge-type dwarf novae.
The WZ Sge-type dwarf nova OT J184228.1+483742 showed an unusual pattern of
double outbursts composed of an outburst with early superhumps and one with
ordinary superhumps. We propose an interpretation that a very small growth rate
of the 3:1 resonance due to an extremely low mass-ratio led to a quenching of
the superoutburst before the ordinary superhumps appeared. We studied ER
UMa-type dwarf novae and found that V1159 Ori showed positive superhumps
similar to ER UMa in the 1990s. The recently recognized ER UMa-type object BK
Lyn dominantly showed negative superhumps, and its behavior was very similar to
the present-day state of ER UMa. The pattern of period variations in AM
CVn-type objects were very similar to short-period hydrogen-rich SU UMa-type
dwarf novae, making them helium analogue of hydrogen-rich SU UMa-type dwarf
novae. SBS 1108+574, a peculiar hydrogen-rich dwarf nova below the period
minimum, showed a very similar pattern of period variations to those of
short-period SU UMa-type dwarf novae. The mass-ratio derived from the detected
orbital period suggests that this secondary is a somewhat evolved star whose
hydrogen envelope was mostly stripped during the mass-exchange. CC Scl, MASTER
OT J072948.66+593824.4 and OT J173516.9+154708 showed only low-amplitude
superhumps with complex profiles. These superhumps are likely a combination of
closely separated two periods.
