We report on the electric-field-induced reversible metal-insulator transition
(MIT) of the insulating LaAlO3 thin films observed in metal/LaAlO3/Nb-SrTiO3
heterostructures. The switching voltage depends strongly on the thickness of
the LaAlO3 thin film which indicates that a minimum thickness is required for
the MIT. A constant opposing voltage is required to deplete the charges from
the defect states. Our experimental results exclude the possibility of
diffusion of the metal electrodes or oxygen vacancies into the LaAlO3 layer.
Instead, the phenomenon is attributed to the formation of a quasi-conduction
band (QCB) in the defect states of LaAlO3 that forms a continuum state with the
conduction band of the Nb-SrTiO3. Once this continuum (metallic) state is
formed, the state remains stable even when the voltage bias is turned off. The
thickness dependent reverse switch-on voltage and the constant forward
switch-off voltage are consistent with our model. The viewpoint proposed here
can provide an alternative mechanism for resistive switching in complex oxides.
