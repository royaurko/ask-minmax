The public data from the EGRET space telescope on diffuse galactic gamma rays
in the energy range from 0.1 to 10 GeV show an excess for energies above 1 GeV
in comparison with the expectations from conventional galactic models. This
excess shows all the key features of Dark Matter Annihilation (DMA), like being
observable in al sky directions with a shape corresponding to a WIMP mass
between 50 and 100 GeV. The intensity of the excess in various directions can
be used to reconstruct the DM profile, which - combined with the distribution
of visible matter - allows to calculate the rotation curve of our Galaxy. Its
peculiar shape, which is not flat, but shows a minimum and maximum, is indeed
reconstructed from the gamma rays, thus proving that the EGRET excess traces
the DM. Furthermore, the spectral shape of the excess is consistent with mSUGRA
and the WMAP relic density for rather heavy squarks and sleptons - O(1 TeV) -
and light charginos, neutralinos and gluinos (below 500 GeV).
