In this short note we present results of background measurements carried out
with a polystyrene based cast plastic 12.0x12.0x3.0 cm^3 size scintillator
counter with a wavelength shifting fibre and a multi-pixel Geiger mode
avalanche photodiode readout in the Baksan underground laboratory at a depth of
200 meters of water equivalent. The total counting rate of the scintillator
counter measured at this depth and at a threshold corresponding to ~0.37 of a
minimum ionizing particle is approximately 1.3 Hz.
