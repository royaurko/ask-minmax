Thin Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 (BST) films on p-type Si (100) using The Chemical
Solution Deposition (CSD) method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), C-V meter analysis measurement were employed to characterise
the films. The growth condition to obtain enough quality epitaxial of
Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 carried out by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds, and then
annealing at 900oC for 15 hours. The structure and crystallinity of thin films
were investigated by XRD preffered orientation (100), (010); (110), (111),
(200), surface analysis by SEM magnification x10000 thin films were heterogen
and thickness film 1100 nm; electrical characterization Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 at MFS
(Metal Ferroelectric Semiconductor) structure in room temperature (300 K) by
carried out capacitance flat band (CFB) for frequency 10 KHz and 100 KHz were
206 pF and 187 pF, dielectric constant for frequency 10 KHz and 100 KHz were
132.67 and 117.22, dielectric loss minimum for frequency 10 KHz and 100 KHz
were 5.37 % and 6.43 % respectively.
