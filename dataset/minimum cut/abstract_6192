We present results for the first three low-power radio galaxies from the B2
bright sample to have been observed with Chandra. Two have kpc-scale radio
jets, and in both Chandra resolves jet X-ray emission, and detects soft X-ray
core emission and an X-ray emitting galaxy-scale atmosphere of luminosity a few
10^41 ergs s^-1. These are the first detections of X-ray jets in low-power
radio galaxies more distant than Cen A and M 87. The cooling time of the
galaxy-scale gas implies mass infall rates of order one solar mass per year.
The gas pressure near the jets is comparable to the minimum pressure in the
jets, implying that the X-ray emitting gas may play an important role in jet
dynamics. The third B2 radio galaxy has no kpc-scale radio jet, and here only
soft X-ray emission from the core is detected. The ratio of X-ray to radio flux
is similar for the jets and cores, and the results favour a synchrotron origin
for the emission. kpc-scale radio jets are detected in the X-ray in ~7 ks
exposures with Chandra more readily than in the optical via HST snapshot
surveys.
