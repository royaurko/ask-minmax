We present Hanbury-Brown Twiss measurements from the PHENIX experiment at
RHIC for final results for charged kaon pairs from sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 GeV Au+Au
collisions and preliminary results for charged pion pairs from sqrt{s} = 200
GeV p+p collisions. We find that for kaon pairs from Au+Au, each traditional 3D
Gaussian radius shows approximately the same linear increase as a function of
N^{1/3}_{part}. An imaging analysis reveals a significant non-Gaussian tail for
r \gtrsim 10 fm. The presence of a tail for kaon pairs demonstrates that
similar non-Gaussian tails observed in earlier pion measurements cannot be
fully explained by decays of long-lived resonances. The preliminary analysis of
pions from sqrt{s} = 200 GeV p+p minimum biased collisions show correlations
which are well suited to traditional 3D HBT radii extraction via the
Bowler-Sinyukov method, and we present R_out, R_side, and R_long as a function
of mean transverse pair mass.
