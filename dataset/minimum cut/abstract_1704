Generalizing the procedures of Girifalco and of Verheijen et al. and using
results of the preceding work it has been derived the interaction potential
between the molecules of different fullerenes Cn and Cm at orientationally
disordered (high-temperature solid and gaseous) phases. We have calculated the
coefficients for interactions of the C60 molecule with the molecules of higher
fullerenes from C70 to C96 and with the smaller one, C36. The dependence of the
minimum point and of the depth of the potential well on the numbers of the
atoms in the molecules m and n has been investigated.
