We show that a qubit chosen from equatorial or polar great circles on a Bloch
spehere can be remotely prepared with one cbit from Alice to Bob if they share
one ebit of entanglement. Also we show that any single particle measurement on
an arbitrary qubit can be remotely simulated with one ebit of shared
entanglement and communication of one cbit.
