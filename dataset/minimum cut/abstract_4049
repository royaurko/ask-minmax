We prove that a model atom having one bound state will be fully ionized by a
time periodic potential of arbitrary strength r and frequency omega. Starting
with the system in the bound state, the survival probability is for small r
given by exp(-Gamma t) for times of order GAMMA^(-1)~r^(-2n) where n is the
minimum number of 'photons' required for ionization (with large modifications
at resonances). For late times the decay is as t^(-3) with the power law
modulated by oscillations. As r increases, the time over which there is
exponential decay becomes shorter and the power law behaviour starts earlier.
Results are for a parametrically excited one-dimensional system with zero-range
potential but comparison with analyticalworks and with experiments indicates
that many features are general.
