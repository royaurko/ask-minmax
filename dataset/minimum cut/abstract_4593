We show that the convex hull of a large i.i.d. sample from an absolutely
continuous log-concave distribution approximates a predetermined convex body in
the logarithmic Hausdorff distance and in the Banach-Mazur distance. For
log-concave distributions that decay super-exponentially, we also have
approximation in the Hausdorff distance. These results are multivariate
versions of the Gnedenko law of large numbers, which guarantees concentration
of the maximum and minimum in the one-dimensional case. We provide quantitative
bounds in terms of the number of points and the dimension of the ambient space.
