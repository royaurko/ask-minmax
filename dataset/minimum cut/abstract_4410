The rank minimization problem is to find the lowest-rank matrix in a given
set. Nuclear norm minimization has been proposed as an convex relaxation of
rank minimization. Recht, Fazel, and Parrilo have shown that nuclear norm
minimization subject to an affine constraint is equivalent to rank minimization
under a certain condition given in terms of the rank-restricted isometry
property. However, in the presence of measurement noise, or with only
approximately low rank generative model, the appropriate constraint set is an
ellipsoid rather than an affine space. There exist polynomial-time algorithms
to solve the nuclear norm minimization with an ellipsoidal constraint, but no
performance guarantee has been shown for these algorithms. In this paper, we
derive such an explicit performance guarantee, bounding the error in the
approximate solution provided by nuclear norm minimization with an ellipsoidal
constraint.
