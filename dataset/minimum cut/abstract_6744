We revisit the high-energy spectral cutoff originating from the
electron-positron pair creation in the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
with numerical and analytical calculations. We show that the conventional
exponential and/or broken power law cutoff should be drastically modified to a
shallower broken power-law in practical observations that integrate emissions
from different internal shocks. Since the steepening is tiny for observations,
this "smearing" effect can generally reduce the previous estimates of the
Lorentz factor of the GRB outflows. We apply our formulation to GRB 080916C,
recently detected by the Large Area Telescope detector on the Fermi satellite,
and find that the minimum Lorentz factor can be ~600 (or even smaller values),
which is below but consistent with the previous result of ~900. Observing the
steepening energy (so-called "pair-break energy") is crucial to diagnose the
Lorentz factor and/or the emission site in the future observations, especially
current and future Cherenkov telescopes such as MAGIC, VERITAS, and CTA.
