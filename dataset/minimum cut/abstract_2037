This paper briefly describes the picoArray? architecture, and in particular
the deterministic internal communication fabric. The methods that have been
developed for debugging and verifying systems using devices from the picoArray
family are explained. In order to maximize the computational ability of these
devices, hardware debugging support has been kept to a minimum and the methods
and tools developed to take this into account.
