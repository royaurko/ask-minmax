Half-cycle laser pulse is applied on an absorbed molecule to investigate its
alignment and orientation behavior. Crossover from field-free to hindered
rotation motion is observed by varying the angel of hindrance of potential
well. At small hindered angle, both alignment and orientation show
sinusoidal-like behavior because of the suppression of higher excited states.
However, mean alignment decreases monotonically as the hindered angle is
increased, while mean orientation displays a minimum point at certain hindered
angle. The reason is attributed to the symmetry of wavefunction and can be
explained well by analyzing the coefficients of eigenstates.
