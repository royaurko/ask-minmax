We have performed resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) near the Cu-K
edge on cuprate superconductors La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4), La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4),
La(2-x)Sr(x)Cu(1-y)Fe(y)O(4) and Bi(1.76)Pb(0.35)Sr(1.89)CuO(6+d), covering
underdoped to heavily overdoped regime and focusing on charge excitations
inside the charge-transfer gap. RIXS measurements of the 214 systems with Ei =
8.993 keV have revealed that the RIXS intensity at 1 eV energy transfer has a
minimum at (0,0) and maxima at (0.4pi, 0) and $(0, 0.4pi) for all doping points
regardless of the stripe ordered state, suggesting that the corresponding
structure is not directly related to stripe order. Measurements with Ei = 9.003
keV on metallic La(1.7)Sr(0.3)CuO(4) and Bi(1.76)Pb(0.35)Sr(1.89)CuO(6+d)
exhibit a dispersive intra-band excitation below 4 eV, similar to that observed
in the electron-doped Nd(1.85)Ce(0.15)CuO(4). This is the first observation of
a dispersive intra-band excitation in a hole doped system, evidencing that both
electron and hole doped systems have a similar dynamical charge correlation
function.
