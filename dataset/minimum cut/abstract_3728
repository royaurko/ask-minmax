We provide an analytic method to discriminate among different types of black
holes on the ground of their strong field gravitational lensing properties. We
expand the deflection angle of the photon in the neighbourhood of complete
capture, defining a strong field limit, in opposition to the standard weak
field limit. This expansion is worked out for a completely generic spherically
symmetric spacetime, without any reference to the field equations and just
assuming that the light ray follows the geodesics equation. We prove that the
deflection angle always diverges logarithmically when the minimum impact
parameter is reached. We apply this general formalism to Schwarzschild,
Reissner-Nordstrom and Janis-Newman-Winicour black holes. We then compare the
coefficients characterizing these metrics and find that different collapsed
objects are characterized by different strong field limits. The strong field
limit coefficients are directly connected to the observables, such as the
position and the magnification of the relativistic images. As a concrete
example, we consider the black hole at the centre of our galaxy and estimate
the optical resolution needed to investigate its strong field behaviour through
its relativistic images.
