The EMC effect is studied by using the GLR-MQ-ZSR equation with minimum
number of free parameters, where the nuclear shadowing effect is a dynamical
evolution result of the equation, and nucleon swelling and Fermi motion in the
nuclear environment deform the input parton distributions. Parton distributions
of both proton and nucleus are predicted in a unified framework. We show that
the parton recombination as a higher twist correction plays an essential role
in the evolution of parton distributions either of proton or nucleus. We find
that the nuclear antishadowing contributes a part of enhancement of the ratio
of the structure functions around $x\sim 0.1$, while the other part origins
from the deformation of the nuclear valence quark distributions. We point out
that the nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects in the gluon distribution
are not stronger than that in the quark distributions.
