The star chromatic index $\chi_s'(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of
colors needed to properly color the edges of the graph so that no path or cycle
of length four is bi-colored. We obtain a near-linear upper bound in terms of
the maximum degree $\Delta=\Delta(G)$. Our best lower bound on $\chi_s'$ in
terms of $\Delta$ is $2\Delta(1+o(1))$ valid for complete graphs. We also
consider the special case of cubic graphs, for which we show that the star
chromatic index lies between 4 and 7 and characterize the graphs attaining the
lower bound. The proofs involve a variety of notions from other branches of
mathematics and may therefore be of certain independent interest.
