Critical current was recently measured near the transition from 0 to
$\pi$-contact in superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions.
Contrary to expectations, it does not vanish at the transition point. It shows
instead a tiny, though finite, minimum. The observation of fractional Shapiro
steps reenforces the idea that the vanishing of the main sinusoidal term in the
Josephson relation gives room to the next harmonics. Within quasiclassical
approach we calculate the Josephson relation taking into account magnetic
scattering. We find that the observed minimum is compatible with the value of
the second harmonics expected from the theory.
