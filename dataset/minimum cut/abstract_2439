We show that an escape from the potential minimum of Fabry-Perot
interferometers can be detected measuring the associated sudden change of
reflectivity. We demonstrate that the loss of information that occurs retaining
only the sequence of escapes, rather than the full trajectory, can be very mild
and can lead to an effective method to reveal the noise intensity or the
presence of a coherent signal.
