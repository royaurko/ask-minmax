I analyze the lattice simulation data of the Domain Wall Fermion in
quaternion basis. As pointed out by Atiyah and Ward, the minimum action
solution for SU(2) Yang-Mills fields in Euclidean 4-space correspond, via
Penrose twistor transform, to algebraic bundles on the complex projective
3-space. Assuming dominance of correlation between the fermions on the domain
walls via exchange of instantons, I extract parameters necessary for defining
gauge fields of Atiyah-Ward ansatz. The QCD effective coupling in the infrared
and the relation between the number of flavors and the infrared fixed point is
investigated.
  Consequence of this lepton flavor assignment to phenomenology of baryons is
also discussed.
