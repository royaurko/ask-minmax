We present the results of differential, time series photometry for GSC
02038-00293, a suspected RS CVn binary, using data collected with the Open
University's PIRATE robotic telescope located at the Observatori Astronomic de
Mallorca between 10 May and 13 June 2010. A full orbital period cycle in the V
band and partial cycle of B and R bands were obtained for GSC 02038-00293
showing an orbital period of 0.4955 +/- 0.0001 days. This period is in close
agreement with that of previously published values but significantly different
to that found by the All Sky Automated Survey of 0.330973 days. We suggest GSC
02038-00293 is a short period eclipsing RS CVn star and from our data alone we
calculate an ephemeris of JD 2455327.614 + 0.4955(1) x E. We also find that the
previously observed six to eight year cycle of star spot activity which
accounts for the behaviour of the secondary minimum is closer to six years and
that there is detectable reddening at both minima.
