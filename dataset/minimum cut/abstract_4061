A novel decomposition technique is used to extract the centrality dependence
of di-jet properties and yields from azimuthal correlation functions obtained
in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$=200 GeV. The width of the
near-side jet shows very little dependence on centrality. In contrast, the
away-side jet indicates substantial broadening as well as hints for for a local
minimum at $\Delta \phi=\pi$ for central and mid-central events. The yield of
jet-pairs (per trigger particle) slowly increases with centrality for both the
near- and away-side jets. These observed features are compatible with several
recent theoretical predictions of possible modifications of di-jet
fragmentation by a strongly interacting medium. Several new experimental
approaches, including the study of flavor permutation and higher order
multi-particle correlations, that might help to distinguish between different
theoretical scenarios are discussed.
