We describe the structure of 2-connected non-planar toroidal graphs with no
K_{3,3}-subdivisions, using an appropriate substitution of planar networks into
the edges of certain graphs called toroidal cores. The structural result is
based on a refinement of the algorithmic results for graphs containing a fixed
K_5-subdivision in [A. Gagarin and W. Kocay, "Embedding graphs containing
K_5-subdivisions'', Ars Combin. 64 (2002), 33-49]. It allows to recognize these
graphs in linear-time and makes possible to enumerate labelled 2-connected
toroidal graphs containing no K_{3,3}-subdivisions and having minimum vertex
degree two or three by using an approach similar to [A. Gagarin, G. Labelle,
and P. Leroux, "Counting labelled projective-planar graphs without a
K_{3,3}-subdivision", submitted, arXiv:math.CO/0406140, (2004)].
