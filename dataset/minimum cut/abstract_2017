Disks in the 6 Myr old cluster eta Chamaeleontis were searched for emission
from hot H2. Around the M3 star ECHAJ0843.3-7905 we detect circumstellar gas
orbiting at ~2 AU. If the gas is UV-excited, the ro-vibrational line traces a
hot gas layer supported by a disk of mass ~0.03Msolar, similar to the minimum
mass solar nebula. Such a gas reservoir at 6 Myr would promote the formation
and inwards migration of gas giant planets.
