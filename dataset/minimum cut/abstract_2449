We prove a conjecture of Aanjaneya, Bishnu, and Pal that the minimum number
of diffuse reflections sufficient to illuminate the interior of any simple
polygon with $n$ walls from any interior point light source is $\lfloor n/2
\rfloor - 1$. Light reflecting diffusely leaves a surface in all directions,
rather than at an identical angle as with specular reflections.
