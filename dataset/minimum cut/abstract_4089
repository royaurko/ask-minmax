The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and Kohn-Sham procedure are extended to
functionals of the localized intrinsic density of a self-bound system such as a
nucleus. After defining the intrinsic-density functional, we modify the usual
Kohn-Sham procedure slightly to evaluate the mean-field approximation to the
functional, and carefully describe the construction of the leading corrections
for a system of fermions in one dimension with a spin-degeneracy equal to the
number of particles N. Despite the fact that the corrections are complicated
and nonlocal, we are able to construct a local Skyrme-like intrinsic-density
functional that, while different from the exact functional, shares with it a
minimum value equal to the exact ground-state energy at the exact ground-state
intrinsic density, to next-to-leading order in 1/N. We briefly discuss
implications for real Skyrme functionals.
