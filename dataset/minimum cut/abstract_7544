In this paper, we study virtual full-duplex (FD) buffer-aided relaying to
recover the loss of multiplexing gain caused by half-duplex (HD) relaying in a
multiple relay network, where each relay is equipped with a buffer and multiple
antennas, through joint opportunistic relay selection (RS) and beamforming (BF)
design. The main idea of virtual FD buffer-aided relaying is that the source
and one of the relays simultaneously transmit their own information to another
relay and the destination, respectively. In such networks, inter-relay
interference (IRI) is a crucial problem which has to be resolved like
self-interference in the FD relaying. In contrast to previous work that
neglected IRI, we propose joint RS and BF schemes taking IRI into consideration
by using multiple antennas at the relays. In order to maximize average
end-to-end rate, we propose a weighted sum-rate maximization strategy assuming
that adaptive rate transmission is employed in both the source to relay and
relay to destination links. Then, we propose several BF schemes cancelling or
suppressing IRI in order to maximize the weighted sum-rate. Numerical results
show that our proposed optimal, zero forcing, and minimum mean square error
BF-based RS schemes asymptotically approach the ideal FD relaying upper bound
when increasing the number of antennas and/or the number of relays.
