We study numerically the energetics and atomic mechanisms of misfit
dislocation nucleation and stress relaxation in a two-dimensional atomistic
model of strained epitaxial layers on a substrate with lattice misfit.
Relaxation processes from coherent to incoherent states for different
transition paths are studied using interatomic potentials of Lennard-Jones type
and a systematic saddle point and transition path search method. The method is
based on a combination of repulsive potential minimization and the Nudged
Elastic Band method. For a final state with a single misfit dislocation, the
minimum energy path and the corresponding activation barrier are obtained for
different misfits and interatomic potentials. We find that the energy barrier
decreases strongly with misfit. In contrast to continuous elastic theory, a
strong tensile-compressive asymmetry is observed. This asymmetry can be
understood as manifestation of asymmetry between repulsive and attractive
branches of pair potential and it is found to depend sensitively on the form of
the potential.
