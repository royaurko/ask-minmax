We develop two methods for estimating the power spectrum, C_l, of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) from data and apply them to the COBE/DMR and
Saskatoon datasets. One method involves a direct evaluation of the likelihood
function, and the other is an estimator that is a minimum-variance weighted
quadratic function of the data. Applied iteratively, the quadratic estimator is
not distinct from likelihood analysis, but is rather a rapid means of finding
the power spectrum that maximizes the likelihood function. Our results bear
this out: direct evaluation and quadratic estimation converge to the same C_ls.
The quadratic estimator can also be used to directly determine cosmological
parameters and their uncertainties. While the two methods both require O(N^3)
operations, the quadratic is much faster, and both are applicable to datasets
with arbitrary chopping patterns and noise correlations. We also discuss
approximations that may reduce it to O(N^2) thus making it practical for
forthcoming megapixel datasets.
