George Voronoi (1908-09) introduced two important reduction methods for
positive quadratic forms: the reduction with perfect forms, and the reduction
with L-type domains.
  A form is perfect if can be reconstructed from all representations of its
arithmetic minimum. Two forms have the same L-type if Delaunay tilings of their
lattices are affinely equivalent. Delaunay (1937-38) asked about possible
relative volumes of lattice Delaunay simplexes. We construct an infinite series
of Delaunay simplexes of relative volume n-3, the best known as of now. This
series gives rise to a new infintie series of perfect forms TF_{n} with
interesting properties, e.g. TF_{5}=D_{5}, TF_{6}=E*_{6}, TF_{7}=\phi_{15}^{7}.
For all n the domain of TF_{n} is adjacent to the domain of the 2-nd perfect
form D_{n}. Perfect form TF_{n} is a direct n-dimensional generalization of
Korkine and Zolotareff's 3-rd perfect form \phi_{2}^{5} in 5 variables. It is
likely that this form is equivalent to Anzin's (1991) form h_n.
