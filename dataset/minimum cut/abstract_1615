We study the percolative properties of bi-dimensional systems generated by a
random sequential adsorption of line-segments on a square lattice. As the
segment length grows, the percolation threshold decreases, goes through a
minimum and then increases slowly for large segments. We explain this
non-monotonic behaviour by a structural change of the percolation clusters.
Moreover, it is strongly suggested that these systems do not belong to the
universality class of random site percolation.
