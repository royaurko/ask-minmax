We present some new theoretical and computational results for the stationary
points of bulk systems. First we demonstrate how the potential energy surface
can be partitioned into catchment basins associated with every stationary point
using a combination of Newton-Raphson and eigenvector-following techniques.
Numerical results are presented for a 256-atom supercell representation of a
binary Lennard-Jones system. We then derive analytical formulae for the number
of stationary points as a function of both system size and the Hessian index,
using a framework based upon weakly interacting subsystems. This analysis
reveals a simple relation between the total number of stationary points, the
number of local minima, and the number of transition states connected on
average to each minimum. Finally we calculate two measures of localisation for
the displacements corresponding to Hessian eigenvectors in samples of
stationary points obtained from the Newton-Raphson-based geometry optimisation
scheme. Systematic differences are found between the properties of eigenvectors
corresponding to positive and negative Hessian eigenvalues, and localised
character is most pronounced for stationary points with low values of the
Hessian index.
