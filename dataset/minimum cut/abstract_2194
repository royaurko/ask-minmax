Minimization variational principles for linear elastodynamic, acoustic, or
electromagnetic time-harmonic waves in dissipative media were obtained by
Milton, Seppecher and Bouchitt\'e generalizing the quasistatic variational
principles of Cherkaev and Gibiansky. Here a further generalization is made to
allow for a much wider variety of boundary conditions, and in particular
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. In addition minimization or
maximization principles of the Hashin-Shtrikman type, incorporating
"polarization fields", are developed.
