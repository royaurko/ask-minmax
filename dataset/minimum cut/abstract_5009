We present results on the magnetoresistance of the system Ni/Al203/n-doped
Si/Al2O3/Ni in fabricated nanostructures. The results at temperature of 14K
reveal a 75% magnetoresistance that decreases in value up to approximately 30K
where the effect disappears. We observe minimum resistance in the antiparallel
configurations of the source and drain of Ni. As a possibility, it seems to
indicate the existence of a magnetic state at the Si/oxide interface. The
average spin diffusion length obtained is of 650 nm approximately. Results are
compared to the window of resistances that seems to exist between the tunnel
barrier resistance and two threshold resistances but the spin transfer seems to
work in the range and outside the two thresholds.
