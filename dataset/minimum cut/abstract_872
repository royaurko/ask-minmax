The main contribution to hard elastic scattering comes from components of
wave functions of colliding hadrons that contain minimum number of partons. We
discuss this mechanism in regge and parton approaches and estimate the
probabilities that colliding hadrons are in such bare states. The behavior of
cross-sections in this regime at various energies can give nontrivial
information on high energy dynamics.
