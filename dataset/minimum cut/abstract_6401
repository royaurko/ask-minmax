We analyze the time profile $\Delta T(t)$ of the temperature difference,
measured across a very compressible supercritical $^3$He fluid layer in its
convective state. The experiments were done along the critical isochore in a
Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard cell after starting the vertical constant heat flow $q$.
For $q$ sufficiently well above that needed for the convection onset, the
transient $\Delta T(t)$ for a given $\epsilon\equiv(T-T_c)/T_c$, with $T_c$ =
3.318K, shows a damped oscillatory profile with period $t_{osc}$ modulating a
smooth base profile. The smooth profile forms the exponential tail of the
transient which tends to the steady-state $\Delta T(\infty)$ with a time
constant $\tau_{tail}$. The scaled times $t_{osc}/t_D$ and $\tau_{tail}/t_D$
from all the data could be collapsed onto two curves as a function of the
Rayleigh number over $\sim$ 3.5 decades. Here $t_D$ is the characteristic
thermal diffusion time. Furthermore comparisons are made between measurements
of a third characteristic time $t_m$ between the first peak and the first
minimum in the $\Delta T(t)$ profile and its estimation by Onuki et al. Also
comparisons are made between the observed oscillations and the 2D simulations
by Onuki et al. and by Amiroudine and Zappoli. For $\epsilon < 9\times 10^{-3}$
the experiments show a crossover to a different transient regime. This new
regime, which we briefly describe, is not understood at present.
