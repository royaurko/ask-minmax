Recent work by Divsalar et al. has shown that properly designed
protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes typically have minimum
(Hamming) distance linearly increasing with block length. This fact rests on
ensemble arguments over all possible expansions of the base protograph.
However, when implementation complexity is considered, the expansions are
frequently selected from a smaller class of structured expansions. For example,
protograph expansion by cyclically shifting connections generates a
quasi-cyclic (QC) code. Other recent work by Smarandache and Vontobel has
provided upper bounds on the minimum distance of QC codes. In this paper, we
generalize these bounds to punctured QC codes and then show how to tighten
these for certain classes of codes. We then evaluate these upper bounds for the
family of protograph codes known as AR4JA codes that have been recommended for
use in deep space communications in a standard established by the Consultative
Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). At block lengths larger than 4400
bits, these upper bounds fall well below the ensemble lower bounds.
