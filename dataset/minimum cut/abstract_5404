Latin hypercube designs (LHDs) with space-filling properties are widely used
for emulating computer simulators. Over the last three decades, a wide spectrum
of LHDs have been proposed with space-filling criteria like minimum correlation
among factors, maximin interpoint distance, and orthogonality among the factors
via orthogonal arrays (OAs). Projective geometric structures like spreads,
covers and stars of PG(p-1,q) can be used to characterize the randomization
restriction of multistage factorial experiments. These geometric structures can
also be used for constructing OAs and nearly OAs (NOAs). In this paper, we
present a new class of space-filling LHDs based on NOAs derived from stars of
PG(p-1, 2).
