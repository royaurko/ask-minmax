We make a frequentist analysis of the parameter space of the NUHM2, in which
the soft supersymmetry (SUSY)-breaking contributions to the masses of the two
Higgs multiplets, $m^2_{H_{u,d}}$, vary independently from the universal soft
SUSY-breaking contributions $m^2_0$ to the masses of squarks and sleptons. Our
analysis uses the MultiNest sampling algorithm with over $4 \times 10^8$ points
to sample the NUHM2 parameter space. It includes the ATLAS and CMS Higgs mass
measurements as well as their searches for supersymmetric jets + MET signals
using the full LHC Run~1 data, the measurements of $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ by
LHCb and CMS together with other B-physics observables, electroweak precision
observables and the XENON100 and LUX searches for spin-independent dark matter
scattering. We find that the preferred regions of the NUHM2 parameter space
have negative SUSY-breaking scalar masses squared for squarks and sleptons,
$m_0^2 < 0$, as well as $m^2_{H_u} < m^2_{H_d} < 0$. The tension present in the
CMSSM and NUHM1 between the supersymmetric interpretation of $g_\mu - 2$ and
the absence to date of SUSY at the LHC is not significantly alleviated in the
NUHM2. We find that the minimum $\chi^2 = 32.5$ with 21 degrees of freedom
(dof) in the NUHM2, to be compared with $\chi^2/{\rm dof} = 35.0/23$ in the
CMSSM, and $\chi^2/{\rm dof} = 32.7/22$ in the NUHM1. We find that the
one-dimensional likelihood functions for sparticle masses and other observables
are similar to those found previously in the CMSSM and NUHM1.
