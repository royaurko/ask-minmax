In this paper distributed storage systems with exact repair are studied. A
construction for regenerating codes between the minimum storage regenerating
(MSR) and the minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) points is given. To the best
of contributor's knowledge, no previous construction of exact-regenerating codes
between MBR and MSR points is done except in the work by Tian et al. On
contrast to their work, the methods used here are elementary.
  In this paper it is shown that in the case that the parameters $n$, $k$, and
$d$ are close to each other, the given construction is close to optimal when
comparing to the known functional repair capacity. This is done by showing that
when the distances of the parameters $n$, $k$, and $d$ are fixed but the actual
values approach to infinity, the fraction of the performance of constructed
codes with exact repair and the known capacity of codes with functional repair,
approaches to one. Also a simple variation of the constructed codes with almost
the same performance is given.
