Using a sum rule approach we investigate the dipole oscillation of a
spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a harmonic trap. The
crucial role played by the spin polarizability of the gas is pointed out. We
show that the lowest dipole frequency exhibits a characteristic jump at the
transition between the stripe and spin-polarized phase. Near the second order
transition between the spin-polarized and the single minimum phase the lowest
frequency is vanishingly small for large condensates, reflecting the divergent
behavior of the spin polarizability. We compare our results with recent
experimental measurements as well as with the predictions of effective mass
approximation.
