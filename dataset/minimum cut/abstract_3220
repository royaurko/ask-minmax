The large sample of main sequence stars with Hipparcos parallaxes and
estimates of the radial velocity has been used to study the relations among
kinematics, age and heavy element content for the solar neighbourhood. The
samples with V> -30 km $\rm s^{-1}$, although including stars as old as 10^10
yr, have a very young component (age $\simgt$ 10^7 yr), and have a metallicity
close to the solar one. Most of the stars with space velocity component V < -40
km $\rm s^{-1}$ have a minimum age of about 2 10^9 yr. Stars with V \simlt -80
km $\rm s^{-1}$ share a common age \simgt $10^{10}$ yr. The distribution in
\Feh of these latter objects suggests a decrease in metal content with
increasing $| V |$ till \Feh < -2. For V < -180 km $\rm s^{-1}$ only the metal
poor component ([Fe/H] < -0.7) is found. The common age for large space
velocity suggests that no substantial age spread exists in the inner halo, at
least in the local sample.
