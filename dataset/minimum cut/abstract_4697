Streaming erasure codes guarantee that each source packet is recovered within
a fixed delay at the receiver over a burst-erasure channel. This paper
introduces a new class of streaming codes: Diversity Embedded Streaming Erasure
Codes (DE-SCo), that provide a flexible tradeoff between the channel quality
and receiver delay. When the channel conditions are good, the source stream is
recovered with a low delay, whereas when the channel conditions are poor the
source stream is still recovered, albeit with a larger delay. Information
theoretic analysis of the underlying burst-erasure broadcast channel reveals
that DE-SCo achieve the minimum possible delay for the weaker user, without
sacrificing the single-user optimal performance of the stronger user. Our
constructions are explicit, incur polynomial time encoding and decoding
complexity and outperform random linear codes over burst-erasure channels.
