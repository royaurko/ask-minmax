A two-component link produces a torus as the product of the component knots
in a two-point configuration space of a three-sphere. This space can be
identified with a cotangent bundle and also with an indefinite Grassmannian. We
show that the integration of the absolute value of the canonical symplectic
form is equal to the area of the torus with respect to the pseudo-Riemannian
structure, and that it attains the minimum only at the "best" Hopf links.
