An asymptotic technique is presented to characterize the bits/symbol
achievable on a representative wireless link in a spatially distributed network
with active interferers at correlated positions, N receive diversity branches,
and linear Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) receivers. This framework is then
applied to systems including analogs to Matern type I and type II networks
which are useful to model systems with Medium-Access Control (MAC), cellular
uplinks with orthogonal transmissions and frequency reuse, and Boolean cluster
networks. It is found that for our network models, with moderately large N, the
correlation between interferer positions does not significantly influence the
bits/symbol resulting in simple approximations for the data rates achievable in
such networks which are known to be difficult to analyze and for which few
analytical results are available.
