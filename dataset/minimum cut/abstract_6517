We investigate a string-inspired scenario associated with a rolling massive
scalar field on D-branes and discuss its cosmological implications. In
particular, we discuss cosmological evolution of the massive scalar field on
the ant-D3 brane of KKLT vacua. Unlike the case of tachyon field, because of
the warp factor of the anti-D3 brane, it is possible to obtain the required
level of amplitude of density perturbations. We study the spectra of scalar and
tensor perturbations generated during the rolling scalar inflation and show
that our scenario satisfies the observational constraint coming from the Cosmic
Microwave Background anisotropies and other observational data. We also
implement the negative cosmological constant arising from the stabilization of
the modulus fields in the KKLT vacua and find that this leads to a successful
reheating in which the energy density of the scalar field effectively scales as
a pressureless dust. The present dark energy can be also explained in our
scenario provided that the potential energy of the massive rolling scalar does
not exactly cancel with the amplitude of the negative cosmological constant at
the potential minimum.
