The tasks of semantic web service (discovery, selection, composition, and
execution) are supposed to enable seamless interoperation between systems,
whereby human intervention is kept at a minimum. In the field of Web service
description research, the exploitation of descriptions of services through
semantics is a better support for the life-cycle of Web services. The large
number of developed ontologies, languages of representations, and integrated
frameworks supporting the discovery, composition and invocation of services is
a good indicator that research in the field of Semantic Web Services (SWS) has
been considerably active. We provide in this paper a detailed classification of
the approaches and solutions, indicating their core characteristics and
objectives required and provide indicators for the interested reader to follow
up further insights and details about these solutions and related software.
