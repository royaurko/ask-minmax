It has been known that the elemental Yb, a divalent metal at mbient pressure,
becomes a mixed-valent metal under external pressure, with its valence reaching
~2.6 at 30 GPa. In this work, infrared spectroscopy has been used to probe the
evolution of microscopic electronic states associated with the valence
crossover in Yb at external pressures up to 18 GPa. The measured infrared
reflectivity spectrum R(w) of Yb has shown large variations with pressure. In
particular, R(w) develops a deep minimum in the mid-infrared, which shifts to
lower energy with increasing pressure. The dip is attributed to optical
absorption due to a conduction c-f electron hybridization state, similarly to
those previously observed for heavy fermion compounds. The red shift of the dip
indicates that the $c$-$f$ hybridization decreases with pressure, which is
consistent with the increase of valence.
