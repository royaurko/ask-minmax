Particle ratios are important observables used to constrain models of
particle production in heavy-ion collisions. In this work we report on a
measurement of the p/pi ratio in the transverse momentum range 2.0 <
p_{T,assoc} < 4.0 GeV/c, associated with a charged trigger particle of 5.0 <
p_{T,trig} < 10.0 GeV/c, in 0-10% central Pb--Pb collisions at
sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76 TeV. The ratio is measured in the jet peak and in a region at
large Delta eta separation from the peak (bulk region). The presented results
are based on 14M minimum-bias Pb--Pb collisions, recorded by the ALICE
detector. It is observed that the p/pi ratio in the bulk region is compatible
with the p/pi ratio of an inclusive measurement, and is much larger than the
p/pi ratio in the jet peak. The p/pi ratio in the jet peak is compatible with a
PYTHIA reference, in which fragmentation in the vacuum is the dominant
mechanism of particle production.
