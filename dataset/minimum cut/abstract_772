We study the association of solar flares with coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
during the deep, extended solar minimum of 2007-2009, using extreme-ultraviolet
(EUV) and white-light (coronagraph) images from the {\it Solar Terrestrial
Relations Observatory} (STEREO). Although all of the fast (v $>$ 900 km
s$^{-1}$) {\it and} wide ($\theta >$ 100$\arcdeg$) CMEs are associated with a
flare that is at least identified in GOES soft X-ray light curves, a majority
of flares with relatively high X-ray intensity for the deep solar minimum (e.g.
$\gtrsim$1 \times 10^{-6}$ W m$^{-2}$ or C1) are not associated with CMEs.
Intense flares tend to occur in active regions with strong and complex
photospheric magnetic field, but the active regions that produce CME-associated
flares tend to be small, including those that have no sunspots and therefore no
NOAA active-region numbers. Other factors on scales comparable to and larger
than active regions seem to exist that contribute to the association of flares
with CMEs. We find the possible low coronal signatures of CMEs, namely
eruptions, dimmings, EUV waves, and Type III bursts, in 91%, 74%, 57%, and 74%,
respectively, of the 35 flares that we associate with CMEs. None of these
observables can fully replace direct observations of CMEs by coronagraphs.
