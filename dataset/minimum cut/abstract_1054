BPS monopoles in N=2 SUSY theories may lead to monopole condensation and
confinement. We have found that supersymmetric black holes with non-vanishing
area of the horizon may stabilize the moduli in theories where the potential is
proportional to the square of the graviphoton central charge. In particular, in
known models of spontaneous breaking of N=2 to N=1 SUSY theories, the
parameters of the electric and magnetic Fayet--Iliopoulos terms can be
considered proportional to electric and magnetic charges of the dyonic black
holes. Upon such identification the potential is found to be proportional to
the square of the black hole mass. The fixed values of the moduli near the
black hole horizon correspond exactly to the minimum of this potential. The
value of the potential at the minimum is proportional to the black hole
entropy.
