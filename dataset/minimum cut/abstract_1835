Eigenfunctions of total angular momentum for a charged vector field
interacting with a magnetic monopole are constructed and their properties
studied. In general, these eigenfunctions can be obtained by applying vector
operators to the monopole spherical harmonics in a manner similar to that often
used for the construction of the ordinary vector spherical harmonics. This
construction fails for the harmonics with the minimum allowed angular momentum.
These latter form a set of vector fields with vanishing covariant curl and
covariant divergence, whose number can be determined by an index theorem.
