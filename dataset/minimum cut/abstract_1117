An apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics occurs when an atom
coupled to a zero-temperature bath, being necessarily in an excited state, is
used to extract work from the bath. Here the fallacy is that it takes work to
couple the atom to the bath and this work must exceed that obtained from the
atom. For the example of an oscillator coupled to a bath described by the
single relaxation time model, the mean oscillator energy and the minimum work
required to couple the oscillator to the bath are both calculated explicitly
and in closed form. It is shown that the minimum work always exceeds the mean
oscillator energy, so there is no violation of the second law.
