We extend the Chow-Liu algorithm for general random variables while the
previous versions only considered finite cases. In particular, this paper
applies the generalization to Suzuki's learning algorithm that generates from
data forests rather than trees based on the minimum description length by
balancing the fitness of the data to the forest and the simplicity of the
forest. As a result, we successfully obtain an algorithm when both of the
Gaussian and finite random variables are present.
