We present the results of an experimental study of vortex dynamics in
non-twinned $YBa_2Cu_3O_{6,87}$ crystal. It is found that critical currents
$J_c$ and $J_{c,dyn}$, which correspond to the pinning force in the thermal
creep and flux flow mode, respectively, non-monotonically vary with the
magnetic field. However, the minimum in the $J_{c,dyn}(H)$ dependence is
observed in higher fields, compared with the minimum position $H_{OD}$ in the
$J_c(H)$ dependence. Considering that the field $H_{OD}$ corresponds to the
static order-disorder transition, this difference is explained by partial
dynamic ordering of the vortex solid. It is concluded that finite transverse
barriers guarantee finite density of transverse displacements of vortex lines
$u_t\simeq c_La_0$ suitable for preservation of the disordered state of the
moving vortex solid.
