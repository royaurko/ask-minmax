We study theoretically the chirality of a generic rigid object's
sedimentation in a fluid under gravity in the low Reynolds number regime. We
represent the object as a collection of small Stokes spheres or stokeslets, and
the gravitational force as a constant point force applied at an arbitrary point
of the object. For a generic configuration of stokeslets and forcing point, the
motion takes a simple form in the nearly free draining limit where the
stokeslet radius is arbitrarily small. In this case, the internal hydrodynamic
interactions between stokeslets are weak, and the object follows a helical path
while rotating at a constant angular velocity $\omega$ about a fixed axis. This
$\omega$ is independent of initial orientation, and thus constitutes a chiral
response for the object. Even though there can be no such chiral response in
the absence of hydrodynamic interactions between the stokeslets, the angular
velocity obtains a fixed, nonzero limit as the stokeslet radius approaches
zero. We characterize empirically how $\omega$ depends on the placement of the
stokeslets, concentrating on three-stokeslet objects with the external force
applied far from the stokeslets. Objects with the largest $\omega$ are aligned
along the forcing direction. In this case, the limiting $\omega$ varies as the
inverse square of the minimum distance between stokeslets. We illustrate the
prevalence of this robust chiral motion with experiments on small macroscopic
objects of arbitrary shape.
