The isotropic-nematic (I-N) phase transition in a system of long straight
rigid rods of length k on square lattices is studied by combining Monte Carlo
simulations and theoretical analysis. The process is analyzed by comparing the
configurational entropy of the system with the corresponding to a fully aligned
system, whose calculation reduces to the 1D case. The results obtained (1)
allow to estimate the minimum value of k which leads to the formation of a
nematic phase and provide an interesting interpretation of this critical value;
(2) provide numerical evidence on the existence of a second phase transition
(from a nematic to a non-nematic state) occurring at density close to 1 and (3)
allow to test the predictions of the main theoretical models developed to treat
the polymers adsorption problem.
