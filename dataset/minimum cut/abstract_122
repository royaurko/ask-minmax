We propose that the poloidal field at the end of the last sunspot cycle
before the Maunder minimum fell to a very low value due to fluctuations in the
Babcock--Leighton process. With this assumption, a flux transport dynamo model
is able to explain various aspects of the historical records of the Maunder
minimum remarkably well on choosing the parameters of the model suitably to
give the correct growth time.
