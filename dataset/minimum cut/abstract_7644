It is known that the restarted full orthogonalization method (FOM)
outperforms the restarted generalized minimum residual method (GMRES) in
several circumstances for solving shifted linear systems when the shifts are
handled simultaneously. Variants of them have been proposed to enhance their
performance. We show that another restarted method, restarted Hessenberg method
[M. Heyouni, Methode de Hessenberg Generalisee et Applications, Ph.D. Thesis,
Universite des Sciences et Technologies de Lille, France, 1996] based on
Hessenberg process, can effectively be employed, which can provide accelerating
convergence rate with respect to the number of restarts. Theoretical analysis
shows that the new residual of shifted restarted Hessenberg reduction method is
still collinear with each other. In these cases where our proposed algorithm
needs less enough number of restarts to converge than the earlier established
restarted shifted FOM and weighted restarted shifted FOM, the associated CPU
consuming time is also considerably reduced, as shown via extensive numerical
experiments involving the recent popular applications of handling structural
dynamics, time-fractional convection-diffusion equations and space-fractional
diffusion equations.
