We report the results from a Chandra observation of the powerful nearby
(z=0.1744) radio galaxy 3C 219. We find evidence for non-thermal X-ray emission
from the radio lobes which fits fairly well with a combination of inverse
Compton scattering of Cosmic Microwave Background radiation and of nuclear
photons with the relativistic electrons in the lobes. The comparison between
radio synchrotron and IC emission yields a magnetic field strength
significantly lower (about a factor 3) than that calculated under minimum
energy conditions; the source energetics is then dominated by the relativistic
particles.
