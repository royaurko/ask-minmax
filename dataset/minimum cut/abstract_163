Verified and updated calibrated absolute solar flux in the He II 30.4 nm
spectral band-pass as measured by the Solar EUV Monitor (SEM) allows us to
study variations of the solar EUV irradiance near the minima of Solar Cycles
22/23 and 23/24. Based on eight (1996 to 2007) NASA sounding rocket flights, a
comparison of SEM data with the measurements from three independent EUV
instruments was performed to verify and confirm the accuracy of the published
SEM data. SEM calibrated data were analyzed to determine and compare minima for
solar cycles 22/23 and 23/24. The minima points were calculated using SEM first
order daily averaged flux smoothed by a running mean (RM) filter with the
window of averaging equal to 365 days. These minima occurred on June 2, 1996
(22/23) and November 28, 2008 (23/24). The 23/24 minimum showed about 15% lower
EUV flux in the 30.4 nm band-pass than the 22/23 minimum. The 365-day RM curve
around the 23/24 minimum has significant asymmetry (fast decrease of the EUV
flux to the minimum and a long, near-horizontal profile after the minimum).
This profile is quite different from the much faster and symmetrical change of
the flux around the 22/23 minimum. SEM flux was compared with both high
spectral resolution (0.1 nm) Mg II index calculated from the Solar Radiation
and Climate Experiment (SORCE) using the Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison
Experiment (SOLSTICE) data and with the NOAA composite Mg II index spectrum.
