This paper studies the effect of parametric mismatch in minimum mean square
error (MMSE) estimation. In particular, we consider the problem of estimating
the input signal from the output of an additive white Gaussian channel whose
gain is fixed, but unknown. The input distribution is known, and the estimation
process consists of two algorithms. First, a channel estimator blindly
estimates the channel gain using past observations. Second, a mismatched MMSE
estimator, optimized for the estimated channel gain, estimates the input
signal. We analyze the regret, i.e., the additional mean square error, that is
raised in this process. We derive upper-bounds on both absolute and relative
regrets. Bounds are expressed in terms of the Fisher information. We also study
regret for unbiased, efficient channel estimators, and derive a simple
trade-off between Fisher information and relative regret. This trade-off shows
that the product of a certain function of relative regret and Fisher
information equals the signal-to-noise ratio, independent of the input
distribution. The trade-off relation implies that higher Fisher information
results to smaller expected relative regret.
