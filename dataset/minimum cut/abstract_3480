Using a generalization of the non-crossing approximation which incorporates
Andreev reflection, we study the properties of an infinite-U Anderson impurity
coupled to two superconducting leads. In the regime where $\Delta$ and $T_K$
are comparable, we find that the position of the sub-gap resonance in the
impurity spectral function develops a strong anomalous phase dependence-- its
energy is a minimum when the phase difference between the superconductors is
equal to $\pi$. Calculating the Josephson current through the impurity, we find
that $\pi$-junction behaviour is lost as the position of the bound-state moves
above the Fermi energy.
