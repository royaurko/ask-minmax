We present the centrality dependence of the azimuthal angle correlation
shapes between a trigger and associated charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV from the STAR experiment. The away-side structure is
significantly modified in central collisions and is characterised in terms of a
doubly-peaked yield. A minimum in the <$p_T$> of hadrons opposite to the
trigger particle is also investigated.
