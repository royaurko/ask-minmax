The dynamic provisioning of virtualized resources offered by cloud computing
infrastructures allows applications deployed in a cloud environment to
automatically increase and decrease the amount of used resources. This
capability is called auto-scaling and its main purpose is to automatically
adjust the scale of the system that is running the application to satisfy the
varying workload with minimum resource utilization. The need for auto-scaling
is particularly important during workload peaks, in which applications may need
to scale up to extremely large-scale systems.
  Both the research community and the main cloud providers have already
developed auto-scaling solutions. However, most research solutions are
centralized and not suitable for managing large-scale systems, moreover cloud
providers' solutions are bound to the limitations of a specific provider in
terms of resource prices, availability, reliability, and connectivity.
  In this paper we propose DEPAS, a decentralized probabilistic auto-scaling
algorithm integrated into a P2P architecture that is cloud provider
independent, thus allowing the auto-scaling of services over multiple cloud
infrastructures at the same time. Our simulations, which are based on real
service traces, show that our approach is capable of: (i) keeping the overall
utilization of all the instantiated cloud resources in a target range, (ii)
maintaining service response times close to the ones obtained using optimal
centralized auto-scaling approaches.
