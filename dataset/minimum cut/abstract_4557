We study the Schwinger effect in a system of non-parallel D1-branes for the
bosonic strings using the path integral formalism. We drive the string pair
creation rate by calculating the one loop vacuum amplitude of the setup in
presence of the background electric filed defined along one of the D1-branes.
We find an angle dependent minimum value for the background field and show that
the decaying of vacuum into string pairs takes place for the field above this
value. It is shown that in $\theta\rightarrow\frac{\pi}{2}$ limit the vacuum
becomes stable and thus no pair creation occurs.
