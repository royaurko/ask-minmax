In this paper Raptor code ensembles with linear random precodes in a
fixed-rate setting are considered. An expression for the average distance
spectrum is derived and this expression is used to obtain the asymptotic
exponent of the weight distribution. The asymptotic growth rate analysis is
then exploited to develop a necessary and sufficient condition under which the
fixed-rate Raptor code ensemble exhibits a strictly positive typical minimum
distance.
