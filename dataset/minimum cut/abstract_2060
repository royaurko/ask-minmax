The Fisher-Shannon information and a statistical measure of complexity are
calculated in the position and momentum spaces for the wave functions of the
H-atom. For each level of energy, it is found that these two indicators take
their minimum values on the orbitals that correspond to the classical
(circular) orbits in the Bohr atomic model, just those with the highest orbital
angular momentum.
