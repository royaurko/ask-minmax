We analyze the electrical conductance $G(\phi)$ of a two-dimensional, phase
coherent structure in contact with two superconductors, which is known to be an
oscillatory function of the phase difference $\phi$ between the
superconductors. It is predicted that for a metallic sample, the amplitude of
oscillation is enhanced by placing a normal barrier at the interface and that,
by tuning the strength of the barrier, can be orders of magnitude greater than
values observed in recent experiments. Giant oscillations can also be obtained
without a barrier, provided a crucial sum rule is broken. This can be achieved
by disorder induced normal scattering. In the absence of zero phase
inter-channel scattering, the conductance possesses a zero phase minimum.
