Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation in conjunction with molecular dynamics
simulation is utilized to study the effect of the steered deposition on the
growth of Cu on Cu(1,1,17). It is found that the deposition flux becomes
inhomogeneous in step train direction and the inhomogeneity depends on the
deposition angle, when the deposition is made along that direction. Steering
effect is found to always increase the growth instability, with respect to the
case of homogeneous deposition. Further, the growth instability depends on the
deposition angle and direction, showing minimum at a certain deposition angle
off-normal to (001) terrace, and shows a strong correlation with the
inhomogeneous deposition flux. The increase of the growth instability is
ascribed to the strengthened step Erlich Schwoebel barrier effects that is
caused by the enhanced deposition flux near descending step edge due to the
steering effect.
