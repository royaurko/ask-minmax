Instanton-dyons, also known as instanton-monopoles or instanton-quarks, are
topological constituents of the instantons at nonzero temperature and holonomy.
We perform numerical simulations of the ensemble of interacting dyons for the
SU(2) pure gauge theory. Unlike previous studies, we focus on back reaction on
the holonomy and the issue of confinement. We calculate the free energy as a
function of the holonomy and the dyon densities, using standard Metropolis
Monte Carlo and integration over parameter methods. We observe that as the
temperature decreases and the dyon density grows, its minimum indeed moves from
small holonomy to the value corresponding to confinement. We then report
various parameters of the self-consistent ensembles as a function of
temperature, and investigate the role of inter-particle correlations.
