In this paper a new class of lattices called turbo lattices is introduced and
established. We use the lattice Construction D to produce turbo lattices. This
method needs a set of nested linear codes as its underlying structure. We
benefit from turbo codes as our basis codes. Therefore, a set of nested turbo
codes based on nested interleavers (block interleavers) and nested
convolutional codes is built. To this end, we employ both tail-biting and
zero-tail convolutional codes. Using these codes, along with construction D,
turbo lattices are created. Several properties of Construction D lattices and
fundamental characteristics of turbo lattices including the minimum distance,
coding gain and kissing number are investigated. Furthermore, a multi-stage
turbo lattice decoding algorithm based on iterative turbo decoding algorithm is
given. We show, by simulation, that turbo lattices attain good error
performance within $\sim1.25 dB$ from capacity at block length of $n=1035$.
Also an excellent performance of only $\sim.5 dB$ away from capacity at SER of
$10^{-5}$ is achieved for size $n=10131$.
