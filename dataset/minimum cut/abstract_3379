We describe time-tagged observations of the Vela pulsar (PSR B0833-45) with
the HST STIS MAMA-UV detectors. Using an optimal extraction technique, we
obtain a NUV light curve and crude FUV phase-resolved spectra. The pulse is
dominated by complex non-thermal emission at all phases. We obtain approximate
spectral indices for the brightest pulse components, relate these to pulsations
observed in other wavebands, and constrain the thermal surface emission from
the neutron star. An upper limit on the Rayleigh-Jeans component at UV pulse
minimum suggests a rather low mean surface temperature T_eff^\infty <4.6 x 10^5
(d_{300}/R_{14.2})^2 K. If confirmed by improved phase-resolved spectroscopy,
this observation has significant impact on our understanding of neutron star
interiors.
