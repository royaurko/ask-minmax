The recently published spectroscopic metallicities of RR Lyrae stars in M3
(Sandstrom, K., Pilachowski, C. A., and Saha, A. 2001, AJ 122, 3212) though
show a relatively wide range of the [Fe/H] values, the conclusion that no
metallicity spread is real has been drawn, as no dependence on either minimum
temperature or period was detected. Comparing these spectroscopic metallicities
with [Fe/H] calculated from the Fourier parameters of the light curves of the
variables a correlation between the [Fe/H] values appears. As a consequence of
the independence of the spectroscopic and photometric metallicities, this
correlation points to the reality of a metallicity spread. The absolute
magnitudes of these stars follow a similar trend along both the spectroscopic
and photometric metallicities as the general $\mathrm{M_V - [Fe/H]}$ relation
predicts, which strengthens that the detected metallicity range is real.
