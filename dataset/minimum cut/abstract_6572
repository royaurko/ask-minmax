In this paper we try to deduce the in situ stresses from the monopole
acoustic waves of the well AIG10 between 689 and 1004 meters in depth (Corinth
Golf). This borehole crosses competent sedimentary formations (mainly
limestone), and the active Aigion fault between 769 and 780 meters in depth.
This study is the application of two methods previously described by the contributor
who shows the relationships between in situ horizontal stresses, and (i) the
presence or absence of double body waves, (ii) the amplitude ratios between S
and P waves (Rousseau, 2005a,b). The full waveforms of this well exhibit two
distinct domains separated by the Aigion fault. Within the upper area the three
typical waves (P, S and Stoneley) may appear, but the S waves are not numerous,
and there is no double body wave, whereas within the lower area there are
sometimes double P waves, but no S waves. From those observations, we conclude
that the stress domain is isotropic above the Aigion fault, and anisotropic
below, which is consistent with conclusions drawn by contributors from other kinds
of data. The calculation applied to the characteristics of the double P waves
suggests that this horizontal stress anisotropy is very high, up to 190 % with
the maximum horizontal stress superior to 100 MPa and the minimum horizontal
stress close to zero at 939 meters in depth. The amplitude ratios between the S
and P wave indicate a very strong compression - which is isotropic - above the
Aigion fault.
