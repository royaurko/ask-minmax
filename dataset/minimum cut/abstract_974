Limiting the number of model-dependent assumptions to a minimum, we discuss
the detectability of the sources responsible for reionization with existing and
planned telescopes. We conclude that if reionization sources are UV-efficient,
minimum luminosity sources, then it may be difficult to detect them before the
advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The best approach before the
launch of JWST may be either to exploit gravitational lensing by clusters of
galaxies, or to search for strong Ly-alpha sources by means of narrow-band
excess techniques or slitless grism spectroscopy.
