In a wired network, a packet can be transmitted to a specified destination
only, no broadcasting required. But in ad hoc wireless network a packet
transmitted by a node can reach all neighbors due to broadcasting. This
broadcasting introduces unnecessary retransmissions of same message. Therefore,
the total number of transmissions (forward nodes) is generally used as the cost
criterion for broadcasting. The problem of finding the minimum number of
forward nodes is NP-complete. In this paper, the goal is to reduce the number
of forward nodes which will reduce redundant transmission as a result. Thus
some of approximation approaches are analyzed, especially dominant pruning and
total dominant pruning which use 2-hop neighborhood information and a new
approach: Probability based algorithm is proposed with a view to minimizing
number of forward nodes. Simulation results of applying this algorithm shows
performance improvements with compared to dominant pruning and total dominant
pruning algorithms.
