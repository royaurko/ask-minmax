A spread code is a set of vector spaces of a fixed dimension over a finite
field Fq with certain properties used for random network coding. It can be
constructed in different ways which lead to different decoding algorithms. In
this work we present a new representation of spread codes with a minimum
distance decoding algorithm which is efficient when the codewords, the received
space and the error space have small dimension.
