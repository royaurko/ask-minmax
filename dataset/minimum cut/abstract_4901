Detailed solar Angular Momentum (AM) graphs produced from the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) DE405 ephemeris display cyclic perturbations that show a very
strong correlation with prior solar activity slowdowns. These same AM
perturbations also occur simultaneously with known solar path changes about the
Solar System Barycentre (SSB). The AM perturbations can be measured and
quantified allowing analysis of past solar cycle modulations along with the
11,500 year solar proxy records (14C & 10Be). The detailed AM information also
displays a recurring wave of modulation that aligns very closely with the
observed sunspot record since 1650. The AM perturbation and modulation is a
direct product of the outer gas giants (Uranus & Neptune). This information
gives the opportunity to predict future grand minima along with normal solar
cycle strength with some confidence. A proposed mechanical link between solar
activity and planetary influence via a discrepancy found in solar/planet AM
along with current AM perturbations indicate solar cycle 24 & 25 will be
heavily reduced in sunspot activity resembling a similar pattern to solar
cycles 5 & 6 during the Dalton Minimum (1790-1830).
