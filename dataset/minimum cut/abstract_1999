The minimum requirements for entanglement detection are discussed for a spin
chain in which the spins cannot be individually accessed. The methods presented
detect entangled states close to a cluster state and a many-body singlet state,
and seem to be viable for experimental realization in optical lattices of
two-state bosonic atoms. The entanglement criteria are based on entanglement
witnesses and on the uncertainty of collective observables.
