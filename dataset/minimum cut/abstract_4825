The orbital period of Sco X-1 was first identified by Gottlieb et al. (1975).
While this has been confirmed on multiple occasions, this work, based on nearly
a century of photographic data, has remained the reference in defining the
system ephemeris ever since. It was, however, called into question when
Vanderlinde et al. (2003) claimed to find the one-year alias of the historical
period in RXTE/ASM data and suggested that this was the true period rather than
that of Gottlieb et al. (1975). We examine data from the All Sky Automated
Survey (ASAS) spanning 2001-2009. We confirm that the period of Gottlieb et al.
(1975) is in fact the correct one, at least in the optical, with the one-year
alias strongly rejected by these data. We also provide a modern time of minimum
light based on the ASAS data.
