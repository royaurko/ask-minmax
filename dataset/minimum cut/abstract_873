The {\it crossing number} of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of pairwise
intersections of edges in a drawing of $G$. The {\it $n$-dimensional folded
hypercube} $FQ_n$ is a graph obtained from $n$-dimensional hypercube by adding
all complementary edges. In this paper, we obtain upper and lower bounds of the
crossing number of $FQ_n$.
