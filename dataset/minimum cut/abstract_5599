We first point out it is conditional to apply the variational approach to the
nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NNLSE), that is, the response
function must be an even function. Different from the variational approach, the
canonical Hamiltonian formulation for the first-order differential system are
used to deal with the problems of the nonlinear light-envelope propagations.
The Hamiltonian of the system modeled by the NNLSE is obtained, which can be
expressed as the sum of the generalized kinetic energy and the generalized
potential. The solitons correspond to extreme points of the generalized
potential. The stabilities of solitons in both local and nonlocal nonlinear
media are also investigated by the analysis of the generalized potential. They
are stable when the potential has minimum, and unstable otherwise.
