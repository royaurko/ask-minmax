Dye doping is a promising way to increase the spectral purity of polymer
light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Here we analyze the frequency and field
dependence of the complex admittance of Al-Ba-PPV-PEDOT-ITO LEDs with and
without dye. We compare the charge carrier mobilities of pristine and dye-doped
double-carrier and hole-only (Au replacing Al-Ba) devices. Dye doping is shown
to significantly influence the electron mobilities while the hole mobilities
are left unchanged and thereby changing the carrier balance in a double carrier
device towards that of a hole only device. The minimum in the LED capacitance
as function of voltage appears to be an excellent probe for the electron
trapping phenomenon underlying the reduction of the mobility.
