$^3$He+$^{12}$C scattering is studied in a coupled channel method by using a
double folding model with microscopic wave functions of $^{12}$C. Experimental
angular distributions in elastic and inelastic scattering to the $2^+$ (4.44
MeV), 0$^+_2$ (7.65 MeV) and 3$^-$ (9.63 MeV) states of $^{12}$C are well
reproduced. It is found that the Airy minimum of the prerainbow oscillations
for the Hoyle state is considerably shifted to a larger angle due to its dilute
density distribution compared with that of the normal ground state in agreement
with the idea of $\alpha$ particle condensation.
