Reasons have been found for thinking that the minimum diameter of channels of
a given length to support superconductivity at room temperature through films
of oxidised atactic polypropylene (OAPP) is considerably larger than found in a
model for Bose condensation in an array of nanofilaments [D.M. Eagles, Phil.
Mag. 85, 1931 (2005)] used previously. This model was introduced to interpret
experimental results dating from 1988 on OAPP. The channels are thought to be
of larger diameter than believed before because, for an N-S-N system where the
superconductor consists of an array of single-walled carbon nanotubes, the
resistance, for good contacts, is R_Q/2N, where N is the number of nanotubes
and R_Q=12.9 kOhm [See e.g. M. Ferrier et al., Solid State Commun. 131, 615
(2004)]. We assume this would be 2R_Q/N for a triplet superconductor with all
spins in the same direction and no orbital degeneracy, which may be the case
for nanofilaments in OAPP. Hence one may infer a minimum number of filaments
for a given resistance. In the present model, the E(K) curve for the bosons is
taken to be of a Bogoliubov form, but with a less steep initial linear term in
the dispersion at T_c than occurs at low T. This form is different from the
simple linear plus quadratic dispersion, with a steeper initial slope, used in
my 2005 paper. A combination of theory and experimental data has been used to
find approximate constraints on parameters appearing in the theory.
