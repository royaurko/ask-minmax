The potential energy surface of an off-lattice model protein is characterized
in detail by constructing a disconnectivity graph and by examining the
organisation of pathways on the surface. The results clearly reveal the
frustration exhibited by this system and explain why it does not fold
efficiently to the global potential energy minimum. In contrast, when the
frustration is removed by constructing a `Go-type' model, the resulting graph
exhibits the characteristics expected for a folding funnel.
