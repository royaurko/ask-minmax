In the present work, we revisit the process of gravitational collapse of a
spherically symmetric homogeneous dust fluid which is known as the
Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS) model [1]. We show that such a scenario would not end
in a spacetime singularity when the spin degrees of freedom of fermionic
particles within the collapsing cloud are taken into account. To this purpose,
we take the matter content of the stellar object as a homogeneous Weyssenhoff
fluid which is a generalization of perfect fluid in general relativity (GR) to
include the spin of matter. Employing the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW metric
for the interior spacetime setup, it is shown that the spin of matter, in the
context of a negative pressure, acts against the pull of gravity and
decelerates the dynamical evolution of the collapse in its later stages. Our
results bode a picture of gravitational collapse in which the collapse process
halts at a finite radius whose value depends on the initial configuration. We
thus show that the spacetime singularity that occurs in the OS model is
replaced by a non-singular bounce beyond which the collapsing cloud re-expands
to infinity. Depending on the model parameters, one can find a minimum value
for the boundary of the collapsing cloud or correspondingly a threshold value
for the mass content below which the horizon formation can be avoided. Our
results are supported by a thorough numerical analysis.
