This paper presents a new connection between the generalized Marcum-Q
function and the confluent hypergeometric function of two variables, phi3. This
result is then applied to the closed-form characterization of the bivariate
Nakagami-m distribution and of the distribution of the minimum eigenvalue of
correlated non-central Wishart matrices, both important in communication
theory. New expressions for the corresponding cumulative distributions are
obtained and a number of communication-theoretic problems involving them are
pointed out.
