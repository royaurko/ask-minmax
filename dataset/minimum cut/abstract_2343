In this paper we determine the graph whose least eigenvalue of signless
Laplacian attains the minimum or maximum among all connected non-bipartite
graphs of fixed order and given number of pendant vertices. Thus we obtain a
lower bound and an upper bound for the least eigenvalue of signless Laplacian
of a graph in terms of the number of pendent vertices.
