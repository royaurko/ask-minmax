We discuss semi-selfdecomposable laws in the minimum scheme and characterize
them using an autoregressive model. Semi-Pareto and semi-Weibull laws of Pillai
(1991) are shown to be semi-selfdecomposable in this scheme. Methods for
deriving this class of laws are then attempted from the angle of randomization.
Finally, discrete analogues of these results are also considered.
