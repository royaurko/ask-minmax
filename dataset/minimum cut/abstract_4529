We report the detection of a large mass planet orbiting around the K0
metal-rich subgiant HD38801 ($V=8.26$) by precise radial velocity (RV)
measurements from the Subaru Telescope and the Keck Telescope. The star has a
mass of $1.36M_{\odot}$ and metallicity of [Fe/H]= +0.26. The RV variations are
consistent with a circular orbit with a period of 696.0 days and a velocity
semiamplitude of 200.0\mps, which yield a minimum-mass for the companion of
$10.7\mjup$ and semimajor axis of 1.71 AU. Such super-massive objects with very
low-eccentricities and hundreds of days period are uncommon among the ensemble
of known exoplanets.
