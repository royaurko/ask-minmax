We report a bound on the relative frequency fluctuations in nonlinear second
harmonic generation. A 1064nm Nd:YAG laser is used to read out the phase of a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer while PPKTP, a nonlinear crystal, is placed in each
arm to generate second harmonic light. By comparing the arm length difference
of the Mach Zehnder as read out by the fundamental 1064 nm light, and its
second harmonic at 532 nm, we can bound the excess frequency noise introduced
in the harmonic generation process. We report an amplitude spectral density of
frequency noise with total RMS frequency deviation of 3mHz and a minimum value
of 20 {\mu}Hz/rtHz over 250 seconds with a measurement bandwidth of 128 Hz,
corresponding to an Allan deviation of 10^-19 at 20 seconds.
