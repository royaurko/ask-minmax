In this paper, we propose an upper bound on the minimum Bhattacharyya
distance of codes for channels with a zero-error capacity. The bound is
obtained by combining an extension of the Elias bound introduced by Blahut,
with an extension of a bound previously introduced by the contributor, which builds
upon ideas of Gallager, Lov\'asz and Marton.
