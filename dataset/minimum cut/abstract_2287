Applying a sparse constraint on the beam pattern has been suggested to
suppress the sidelobe level of a minimum variance distortionless response
(MVDR) beamformer. In this letter, we introduce a weighted sparse constraint in
the beamformer design to provide a lower sidelobe level and deeper nulls for
interference avoidance, as compared with a conventional MVDR beamformer. The
proposed beamformer also shows improved robustness against the mismatch between
the steering angle and the direction of arrival (DOA) of the desired signal,
caused by imperfect estimation of DOA.
