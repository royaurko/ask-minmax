Discovered by Bose, Chaudhuri and Hocquenghem, the BCH family of error
correcting codes are one of the most studied families in coding theory. They
are also among the best performing codes, particularly when the number of
errors being corrected is small relative to the code length. In this article we
consider binary codes with minimum distance of 7. We construct new families of
codes with these BCH parameters via a generalisation of the Kasami-Welch
Theorem.
