The main purpose of this study is the determination of solar minimum date of
the new sunspot cycle No 24. It is provided by using of four types of mean
daily data values for the period Jan 01. 2006 - Dec 31. 2009: (1) the solar
radioindex F10.7; (2) the International sunspot number Ri; (3) the total solar
irradiance index (TSI), and (4) the daily number of X-ray flares of classes
from "B" to "X" from the soft X-ray GOES satellite channel (0.1 - 0.8 nm). It
is found that the mean starting moment of the upward solar activity tendency
(the mean solar minimum) is Nov. 06th, 2008. So, the solar cycle No 23 length
is estimated to ~12.6 years. A conclusion for a relatively weak general
magnitude of solar cycle No 24 is made. By using of relationship based on the
"Waldmeier's rule" a near maximal mean yearly sunspot number value of 72 \pm 27
has been determined.
