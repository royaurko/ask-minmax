The electrical injection of spin polarized electrons in a semiconductor can
be achieved in principle by driving a current from a ferromagnetic metal, where
current is known to be significantly spin polarized, into the semiconductor via
ohmic conduction. For detection a second ferromagnet can be used as drain. We
studied submicron lateral spin valve junctions, based on high mobility
InAs/AlSb two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), with Ni, Co and Permalloy as
ferromagnetic electrodes. In the standard geometry it is very difficult to
separate true spin injection from other effects, including local Hall effect,
anomalous magnetoresistance (AMR) contribution from the ferromagnetic
electrodes and weak localization/anti-localization corrections, which can
closely mimic the signal expected from spin valve effect. The reduction in
size, and the use of a multiterminal non-local geometry allowed us to reduce
the unwanted effects to a minimum. Despite all our efforts, we have not been
able to observe spin injection. However, we find that this 'negative' result in
these systems is actually consistent with theoretical predictions for spin
transport in diffusive systems.
