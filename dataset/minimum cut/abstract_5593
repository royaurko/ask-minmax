We study incoherent Thomson scattering between an ultrashort laser pulse and
an electron beam accelerated from a laser wakefield. The energy chirp effects
of the accelerated electron beam on the final radiation spectrum bandwidth are
investigated. It is found that the scattered X-ray radiation has the minimum
spectrum width and highest intensity as electrons are accelerated up to around
the dephasing point. Furthermore, it is proposed the electron acceleration
process inside the wakefield can be studied by use of $90^\circ$ Thomson
scattering. The dephasing position and beam energy chirp can be deduced from
the intensity and bandwidth of the scattered radiation.
