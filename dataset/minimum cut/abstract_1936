We describe some properties of nuclear ground states using a microscopic
Vlasov approach. We propose a new method to find the energy minimum of the
system enforcing the fermionic nature of the system. Calculations are performed
for two different parametrization of the mean field: a simple momentum
independent Skyrme potential and a momentum dependent one as proposed by Gale,
Bertsch and Das Gupta. We show that the binding energies and radii of nuclei
from $^{16}$O to $^{208}$Pb are reasonably reproduced by opportunely tuning the
surface term. We also made some calculations for neutron rich/poor nuclei.
