Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of primary charged particles in Pb-Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV have been measured by the ALICE
Collaboration at the LHC. The data are presented for central and peripheral
collisions, corresponding to 0-5% and 70-80% of the hadronic Pb-Pb cross
section. The measured charged particle spectra in $|\eta|<0.8$ and $0.3 < p_T <
20$ GeV/$c$ are compared to the expectation in pp collisions at the same
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$, scaled by the number of underlying nucleon-nucleon
collisions. The comparison is expressed in terms of the nuclear modification
factor $R_{AA}$. The result indicates only weak medium effects ($R_{AA} \approx
$ 0.7) in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, $R_{AA}$ reaches a
minimum of about 0.14 at $p_T=6$-7GeV/$c$ and increases significantly at larger
$p_T$. The measured suppression of high-$p_T$ particles is stronger than that
observed at lower collision energies, indicating that a very dense medium is
formed in central Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.
