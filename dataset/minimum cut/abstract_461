We construct some $\ZZ_2^n$-equivariant triangulation of the real projective
space $\mathbb{RP}^n$ with $n(n+1)$ and $(n+1)^2$ vertices. We show that a
$\ZZ_2^n$-equivariant triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^n$ induces a triangulation
on the orbit space $\bigtriangleup^n$. We show that any vertex minimum
$\ZZ_2^3$- and $\ZZ_2^4$-equivariant triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ and
$\mathbb{RP}^4$ contain $11$ and $17$ vertices respectively. We classify all
vertex minimum equivariant triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ and
$\mathbb{RP}^4$.
