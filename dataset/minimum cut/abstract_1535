Over the summer of 2007, we obtained 1191 hours of `drift-scan' pulsar search
observations with the Green Bank Telescope at a radio frequency of 350 MHz.
Here we describe the survey setup, search procedure, and the discovery and
follow-up timing of thirteen pulsars. Among the new discoveries, one (PSR
J1623-0841) was discovered only through its single pulses, two (PSRs J1327-0755
and J1737-0814) are millisecond pulsars, and another (PSR J2222-0137) is a
mildly recycled pulsar. PSR J1327-0755 is a 2.7 ms pulsar at a DM of 27.9 pc
cm^{-3} in a 8.7 day orbit with a minimum companion mass of 0.22 solar mass.
PSR J1737-0814 is a 4.2 ms pulsar at a DM of 55.3 pc cm^{-3} in a 79.3 day
orbit with a minimum companion mass of 0.06 solar mass. PSR J2222-0137 is a
32.8 ms pulsar at a very low DM of 3.27 pc cm^{-3} in a 2.4 day orbit with a
minimum companion mass of 1.11 solar mass. It is most likely a white
dwarf-neutron star system or an unusual low-eccentricity double neutron star
system. Ten other pulsars discovered in this survey are reported in the
companion paper Lynch et al. 2012.
