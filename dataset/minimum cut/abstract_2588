A theory of dissipative nonlinear conductivity, $\sigma_1(\omega,H)$, of
s-wave superconductors under strong electromagnetic fields at low temperatures
is proposed. Closed-form expressions for $\sigma_1(H)$ and the surface
resistance $R_s(\omega,H)$ are obtained in the nonequilibrium dirty limit for
which $\sigma_1(H)$ has a significant minimum as a function of a low-frequency
$(\hbar\omega\ll k_BT)$ magnetic field $H$. The calculated microwave
suppression of $R_s(H)$ is in good agreement with recent experiments on alloyed
Nb resonator cavities. It is shown that superimposed dc and ac fields,
$H=H_0+H_a\cos\omega t$, can be used to reduce ac dissipation in thin film
nanostructures by tuning $\sigma_1(H_0)$ with the dc field.
