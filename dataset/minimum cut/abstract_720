We discovered that RX And, one of prototypical Z Cam-type dwarf novae,
underwent a deep, extended faint state in 1996-1997. Time-resolved photometry
at the bottom of the fading revealed the presence of strong flickering, and the
absence of detectable orbital modulation. This finding indicates that the
mass-transfer remained even at the deepest minimum of the fading, contrary to
what was observed in a deep minimum of a VY Scl-type star, MV Lyr. RX And
subsequently underwent a brightening (outburst) during its recovery stage. The
photometric and spectroscopic characteristics of the brightening significantly
differed from those of ordinary outbursts of RX And, and are considered to
resemble an inside-out type outburst of a long-period dwarf nova. An
examination of historical visual observations revealed the possible presence of
\~10-yr periodicity, which is close to what has been proposed for MV Lyr. The
common observed features between RX And and VY Scl-type stars may suggest a
common underlying mechanism for producing temporary deep fadings. The departure
from the disk instability model, as observed in VY Scl-type stars, was not
apparent in the present fading of RX And. In conjunction with the recently
published Hubble Space Telescope observation during the same fading, we can
conclude that the phenomenological difference from the VY Scl-type fading is
understood as a smaller effect of irradiation on the accretion disk in RX And.
