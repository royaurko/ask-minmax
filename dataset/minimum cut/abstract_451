A proper vertex coloring of a graph is equitable if the sizes of color
classes differ by at most one. The equitable chromatic number of a graph $G$,
denoted by $\chi_=(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ is equitably
$k$-colorable. The equitable chromatic threshold of a graph $G$, denoted by
$\chi_=^*(G)$, is the minimum $t$ such that $G$ is equitably $k$-colorable for
$k\ge t$. We develop a formula and a linear-time algorithm which compute the
equitable chromatic threshold of an arbitrary complete multipartite graph.
