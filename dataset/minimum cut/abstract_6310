We report follow-up XMM-Newton and optical observations of three new polars
found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Simple modeling of the X-ray spectra,
and consideration of the details of the X-ray and optical lightcurves
corroborate the polar nature of these three systems and provide further
insights into their accretion characteristics. During the XMM-Newton
observation of SDSS J072910.68+365838.3, X-rays are undetected apart from a
probable flare event, during which we find both the typical hard X-ray
bremsstrahlung component and a very strong line O VII (E=0.57 keV), but no
evidence of a soft blackbody contribution. In SDSS J075240.45+362823.2 we
identify an X-ray eclipse at the beginning of the observation, roughly in phase
with the primary minimum of the optical broad band curve. The X-ray spectra
require the presence of both hard and soft X-ray components, with their
luminosity ratio consistent with that found in other recent XMM-Newton results
on polars. Lastly, SDSS J170053.30+400357.6 appears optically as a very typical
polar, however its large amplitude optical modulation is 180 degrees out of
phase with the variation in our short X-ray lightcurve.
