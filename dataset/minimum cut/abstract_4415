In this paper, efficient turbo packet combining for single carrier (SC)
broadband multiple-input--multiple-output (MIMO) hybrid--automatic repeat
request (ARQ) transmission with unknown co-channel interference (CCI) is
studied. We propose a new frequency domain soft minimum mean square error
(MMSE)-based signal level combining technique where received signals and
channel frequency responses (CFR)s corresponding to all retransmissions are
used to decode the data packet. We provide a recursive implementation algorithm
for the introduced scheme, and show that both its computational complexity and
memory requirements are quite insensitive to the ARQ delay, i.e., maximum
number of ARQ rounds. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic performance, and
show that under a sum-rank condition on the CCI MIMO ARQ channel, the proposed
packet combining scheme is not interference-limited. Simulation results are
provided to demonstrate the gains offered by the proposed technique.
