A setup involving zero-delay sequential transmission of a vector Markov
source over a burst erasure channel is studied. A sequence of source vectors is
compressed in a causal fashion at the encoder, and the resulting output is
transmitted over a burst erasure channel. The destination is required to
reconstruct each source vector with zero-delay, but those source sequences that
are observed either during the burst erasure, or in the interval of length $W$
following the burst erasure need not be reconstructed. The minimum achievable
compression rate is called the rate-recovery function. We assume that each
source vector is sampled i.i.d. across the spatial dimension and from a
stationary, first-order Markov process across the temporal dimension.
  For discrete sources the case of lossless recovery is considered, and upper
and lower bounds on the rate-recovery function are established. Both these
bounds can be expressed as the rate for predictive coding, plus a term that
decreases at least inversely with the recovery window length $W$. For
Gauss-Markov sources and a quadratic distortion measure, upper and lower bounds
on the minimum rate are established when $W=0$. These bounds are shown to
coincide in the high resolution limit. Finally another setup involving i.i.d.
Gaussian sources is studied and the rate-recovery function is completely
characterized in this case.
