Recent experiments with trapped cooled atoms have produced evidences for
 Bose-Einstein condensation. Among the atoms used are $^7Li$ ones, with
attractive low energy interaction. Stability of their condensate is studied,
with a conclusion that for a number of atoms below the critical value there
exist a metastable minimum, separated from collapse by a potential barrier. The
lifetime due to tunneling is estimated: it is unlikely to happen in the present
experiment. Although in experimental conditions most of the atoms are not in
the condensate, we argue that they only slightly affect the stability
conditions for the condensate evaluated at T=0.
