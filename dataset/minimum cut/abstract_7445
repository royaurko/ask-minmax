The main promise of compressed sensing is accurate recovery of
high-dimensional structured signals from an underdetermined set of randomized
linear projections. Several types of structure such as sparsity and
low-rankness have already been explored in the literature. For each type of
structure, a recovery algorithm has been developed based on the properties of
signals with that type of structure. Such algorithms recover any signal
complying with the assumed model from its sufficient number of linear
projections. However, in many practical situations the underlying structure of
the signal is not known, or is only partially known. Moreover, it is desirable
to have recovery algorithms that can be applied to signals with different types
of structure.
  In this paper, the problem of developing "universal" algorithms for
compressed sensing of stochastic processes is studied. First, Renyi's notion of
information dimension is generalized to analog stationary processes. This
provides a measure of complexity for such processes and is connected to the
number of measurements required for their accurate recovery. Then a minimum
entropy pursuit (MEP) algorithm is proposed, and it is proven that it can
reliably and robustly recover any Markov process of any order from sufficient
number of randomized linear measurements, without having any prior information
about the distribution of the process. An implementable version of MEP with the
same performance guarantees is also provided.
