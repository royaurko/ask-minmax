We present two constructions for binary self-orthogonal codes. It turns out
that our constructions yield a constructive bound on binary self-orthogonal
codes. In particular, when the information rate R=1/2, by our constructive
lower bound, the relative minimum distance \delta\approx 0.0595 (for GV bound,
\delta\approx 0.110). Moreover, we have proved that the binary self-orthogonal
codes asymptotically achieve the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.
