This work approaches human chromosome mapping by developing algorithms for
ordering markers associated with radiation hybrid data. Motivated by recent
work of Boehnke et al. [1], we formulate the ordering problem by developing
stochastic spin models to search for minimum-break marker configurations. As a
particular application, the methods developed are applied to 14 human
chromosome-21 markers tested by Cox et al. [2]. The methods generate
configurations consistent with the best found by others. Additionally, we find
that the set of low-lying configurations is described by a Markov-like ordering
probability distribution. The distribution displays cluster correlations
reflecting closely linked loci.
