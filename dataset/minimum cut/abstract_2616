We show that the elastic energy $E(\gamma)$ of a closed curve $\gamma$ has a
minimizer among all plane simple regular closed curves of given enclosed area
$A(\gamma)$, and that the minimum is attained for a circle. The proof is of a
geometric nature and deforms parts of $\gamma$ in a finite number of steps to
construct some related convex sets with smaller energy.
