The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search experiment uses low-temperature solid-state
detectors to seek Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and has the
world's best exclusion limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross
section. The experiment uses ionization and athermal phonon signals from
particle interactions to discriminate between candidate (nuclear recoil) and
background (electron recoil) events with extremely high efficiency. The
detectors' low energy threshold for electron recoil events allows us to perform
the search for relic axions and solar axions which can interact in the detector
via the axio-electric coupling $g_{a\bar{e}e}$ and the Primakoff coupling
$g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ respectively. We describe the experiment and our most
recent results from the Soudan 5-tower data runs which include a world-leading
upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section with a minimum
of $4.6\times10^{-44}$ cm$^{2}$ at the 90% confidence level (CL) for a 60
GeV/c$^{2}$ WIMP, the world-leading experimental upper limit on the
axio-electric coupling of $1.4\times10^{-12}$ at the 90% CL for a 2.5
keV/c$^{2}$ axion, and the upper limit on the axion-photon coupling of
$2.4\times10^{-9}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at the 95% CL.
