Superheated Droplet Detectors (SDDs) are becoming commonplace in neutron
personnel dosimetry. Their total insensitivity to minimum ionizing radiation
(while responsive to nuclear recoils of energies ~ few keV), together with
their low cost, ease of production, and operation at room temperature and 1 atm
makes them ideal for Cold Dark Matter (CDM) searches. SDD's are optimal for the
exploration of the spin-dependent neutralino coupling due to their high
fluorine content. The status of SIMPLE (Superheated Instrument for Massive
ParticLe Experiments) is presented. Under realistic background considerations,
we expect an improvement in the present Cold Dark Matter sensitivity of 2-3
orders of magnitude after ~1 kg-y of data acquisition.
