A new type of dynamical behavior of a multistable system is reported. We
found that a simple non-equilibrium system can reduce its effective temperature
autonomously at a global minimum if the residual frustration at a global
minimum is small enough, which highlights an unexpected feature of
non-equilibrium multistable systems.
