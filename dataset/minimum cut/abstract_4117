Using the international ground-based network of two-frequency receivers of
the GPS navigation system provides a means of carrying out a global, continuous
and fully-computerized monitoring of phase fluctuations of signals from
satellite-borne radio engineering systems caused by the Earth's inhomogeneous
and nonstationary ionosphere. We found that during major geomagnetic storms,
the errors of determination of the range, frequency Doppler shift and angles of
arrival of transionospheric radio signals exceeds the one for magnetically
quiet days by one order of magnitude as a minimum. This can be the cause of
performance degradation of current satellite radio engineering navigation,
communication and radar systems as well as of superlong-baseline radio
interferometry systems.
