This paper studies the three-user finite-field multi-way relay channel, where
the users exchange messages via a relay. The messages are arbitrarily
correlated, and the finite-field channel is linear and is subject to additive
noise of arbitrary distribution. The problem is to determine the minimum
achievable source-channel rate, defined as channel uses per source symbol
needed for reliable communication. We combine Slepian-Wolf source coding and
functional-decode-forward channel coding to obtain the solution for two classes
of source and channel combinations. Furthermore, for correlated sources that
have their common information equal their mutual information, we propose a new
coding scheme to achieve the minimum source-channel rate.
