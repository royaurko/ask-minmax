We show that small soft terms can create a supersymmetry breaking minimum
along a pseudo-flat direction of a hidden sector which would otherwise be
incapable of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. As this minimum lies along a
pseudo-flat direction, with non-zero F- or D-terms, the resultant supersymmetry
breaking in the hidden sector can be orders of magnitude greater than the soft
terms which created the minimum. This opens new avenues for building models of
gauge mediation, may have consequences for the cosmology of hidden sectors, and
strengthens the case for multiple supersymmetry breaking sectors.
