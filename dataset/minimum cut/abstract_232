We examine the evolution of the zonal flow pattern in the upper solar
convection zone during the current extended solar minimum, and compare it with
that during the previous minimum. The results suggest that a configuration
matching that at the previous minimum was reached during 2008, but that the
flow band corresponding to the new cycle has been moving more slowly towards
the equator than was observed in the previous cycle, resulting in a gradual
increase in the apparent length of the cycle during the 2007 -- 2008 period.
The current position of the lower-latitude fast-rotating belt corresponds to
that seen around the onset of activity in the previous cycle.
