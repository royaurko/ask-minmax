The magneto-optical properties of Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As including their most
common defects were investigated with precise first--principles
density-functional FLAPW calculations in order to: {\em i}) elucidate the
origin of the features in the Kerr spectra in terms of the underlying
electronic structure; {\em ii}) perform an accurate comparison with
experiments; and {\em iii}) understand the role of the Mn concentration and
occupied sites in shaping the spectra. In the substitutional case, our results
show that most of the features have an interband origin and are only slightly
affected by Drude--like contributions, even at low photon energies. While not
strongly affected by the Mn concentration for the intermediately diluted range
($x\sim$ 10%), the Kerr factor shows a marked minimum (up to 1.5$^o$) occurring
at a photon energy of $\sim$ 0.5 eV. For interstitial Mn, the calculated
results bear a striking resemblance to the experimental spectra, pointing to
the comparison between simulated and experimental Kerr angles as a valid tool
to distinguish different defects in the diluted magnetic semiconductors
framework.
