We utilize the MIT bag model and two different versions of the Color
Dielectric Model in order to study the properties of strange matter, and to
discuss the stability of strangelets. We also investigate the effect of the
introduction of perturbative gluons. The MIT bag model and the Double Minimum
version of the Color Dielectric Model allow the existence of strangelets, while
the Single Minimum version excludes this possibility.
