In search of scalable solutions, CDNs are exploring P2P support. However, the
benefits of peer assistance can be limited by various obstacle factors such as
ISP friendliness - requiring peers to be within the same ISP, bitrate
stratification - the need to match peers with others needing similar bitrate,
and partial participation - some peers choosing not to redistribute content.
  This work relates potential gains from peer assistance to the average number
of users in a swarm, its capacity, and empirically studies the effects of these
obstacle factors at scale, using a month-long trace of over 2 million users in
London accessing BBC shows online. Results indicate that even when P2P swarms
are localised within ISPs, up to 88% of traffic can be saved. Surprisingly,
bitrate stratification results in 2 large sub-swarms and does not significantly
affect savings. However, partial participation, and the need for a minimum
swarm size do affect gains. We investigate improvements to gain from increasing
content availability through two well-studied techniques: content bundling -
combining multiple items to increase availability, and historical caching of
previously watched items. Bundling proves ineffective as increased server
traffic from larger bundles outweighs benefits of availability, but simple
caching can considerably boost traffic gains from peer assistance.
