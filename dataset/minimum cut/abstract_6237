We report the detection of a new candidate exoplanet around the metal-rich
star tau^1 Gruis. With M sin $i$ = 1.23+/-0.18 M_JUP, a period of 1326+/-300 d
and an orbit with an eccentricity of 0.14+/-0.14 it adds to the growing
population of long period exoplanets with near-circular orbits. This population
now comprises more than 20% of known exoplanets.
  When the companion to tau^1 Gruis is plotted together with all exoplanets
found by the Anglo-Australian Planet Search and other radial velocity searches
we find evidence for a peak in the number of short-period exoplanets, followed
by a minimum of planets between around 7 and 50 days and then an apparent rise
in the number of planets per unit radius that seems to set in by a hundred
days, indicating more planets farther from the host star. This is very
different from the gaussian-like period distribution found for stellar
companions. This lends support to the idea that once a clearing in the inner
protoplanetary disk develops, it halts the inward migration of planets. In
particular, the smooth distribution of exoplanets arising from planetary
migration through a disk is altered by an accumulation of exoplanets at the
point where the disk has been cleared out.
