In this letter, the impact of primary user traffic with multiple status
changes on the spectrum sensing performance is analyzed. Closed-form
expressions for the probabilities of false alarm and detection are derived.
Numerical results show that the multiple status changes of the primary user
cause considerable degradation in the sensing performance. This degradation
depends on the number of changes, the primary user traffic model, the primary
user traffic intensity and the signal-to-noise ratio of the received signal.
Numerical results also show that the amount of degradation decreases when the
number of changes increases, and converges to a minimum sensing performance due
to the limited sensing period and primary holding time.
