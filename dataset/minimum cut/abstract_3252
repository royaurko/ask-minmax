In this paper we show that, within the framework of the QSSC, the small scale
deviations on angular scales $\lesssim 1^{0}$ expected in the MBR are due to
inhomogeneities in the distribution of galaxies and clusters. It is shown how
these can be estimated on the galaxy-cluster-supercluster scale at the epoch of
redshift $\sim 5$ when the universe was last passing through the minimum phase
of the scale factor. Rich clusters on the scale of 5-10 Mpc generate the kind
of peak in the fluctuation power spectrum observed by the Boomrang and Maxima
projects. Weaker inhomogeneities on smaller scales with $l~\sim 10^3$ are
expected to arise from individual galaxies and small groups.
