In SUSY models, the fine tuning of the electroweak (EW) scale with respect to
their parameters gamma_i={m_0, m_{1/2}, mu_0, A_0, B_0,...} and the maximal
likelihood L to fit the experimental data are usually regarded as two different
problems. We show that, if one regards the EW minimum conditions as constraints
that fix the EW scale, this commonly held view is not correct and that the
likelihood contains all the information about fine-tuning. In this case we show
that the corrected likelihood is equal to the ratio L/Delta of the usual
likelihood L and the traditional fine tuning measure Delta of the EW scale. A
similar result is obtained for the integrated likelihood over the set
{gamma_i}, that can be written as a surface integral of the ratio L/Delta, with
the surface in gamma_i space determined by the EW minimum constraints. As a
result, a large likelihood actually demands a large ratio L/Delta or
equivalently, a small chi^2_{new}=chi^2_{old}+2*ln(Delta). This shows the
fine-tuning cost to the likelihood (chi^2_{new}) of the EW scale stability
enforced by SUSY, that is ignored in data fits. A good
chi^2_{new}/d.o.f.\approx 1 thus demands SUSY models have a fine tuning amount
Delta<<exp(d.o.f./2), which provides a model-independent criterion for
acceptable fine-tuning. If this criterion is not met, one can thus rule out
SUSY models without a further chi^2/d.o.f. analysis. Numerical methods to fit
the data can easily be adapted to account for this effect.
