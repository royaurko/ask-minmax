Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) All-Sky Monitor (ASM) observations of the
X-ray binary 2S0114+650 show modulations at periods close to both the optically
derived orbital period (11.591 days) and proposed pulse period (~ 2.7 hr). The
pulse period shows frequency and intensity variability during the more than 2
years of ASM observations analyzed. The pulse properties are consistent with
this arising from accretion onto a rotating neutron star and this would be the
slowest such period known. The shape of the orbital light curve shows
modulation over the course of the entire orbit and a comparison is made with
the orbital light curve of Vela X-1. However, the expected phase of eclipse,
based on an extrapolation of the optical ephemeris, does not correspond with
the observed orbital minimum. The orbital period derived from the ASM light
curve is also slightly longer than the optical period.
