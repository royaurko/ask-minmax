Casimir dark energy model in five-dimensional and six-dimensional spacetime
including non-relativistic matter and Gauss-Bonnet term is investigated. The
Casimir energy can play the role of dark energy to drive the late-time
acceleration of the universe while the radius of the extra dimensions can be
stabilized. The qualitative analysis in radion picture in four-dimensional
spacetime shows that the contribution from Gauss-Bonnet term will effectively
slow down the radion field at the beginning time. Therefore, the radion field
does not pass minimum point of the effective potential before the minimum of
the potential exists. This leads to the stabilizing mechanism of the extra
dimensions eventually.
