We propose a mechanism for stabilizing the size of the extra dimension in the
Randall-Sundrum scenario. The potential for the modulus field that sets the
size of the fifth dimension is generated by a bulk scalar with quartic
interactions localized on the two 3-branes. The minimum of this potential
yields a compactification scale that solves the hierarchy problem without fine
tuning of parameters.
