We evolve our Multiverse Blueprints to characterize our local neighborhood of
the String Landscape and the Multiverse of plausible string, M- and F-theory
vacua. Building upon the tripodal foundations of i) the Flipped SU(5) Grand
Unified Theory (GUT), ii) extra TeV-Scale vector-like multiplets derived out of
F-theory, and iii) the dynamics of No-Scale Supergravity, together dubbed
No-Scale F-SU(5), we demonstrate the existence of a continuous family of
solutions which might adeptly describe the dynamics of distinctive universes.
This Multiverse landscape of F-SU(5) solutions, which we shall refer to as the
F-Landscape, accommodates a subset of universes compatible with the presently
known experimental uncertainties of our own universe. We show that by
secondarily minimizing the minimum of the scalar Higgs potential of each
solution within the F-Landscape, a continuous hypervolume of distinct minimum
minimorum can be engineered which comprise a regional dominion of universes,
with our own universe cast as the bellwether. We conjecture that an
experimental signal at the LHC of the No-Scale F-SU(5) framework's
applicability to our own universe might sensibly be extrapolated as
corroborating evidence for the role of string, M- and F-theory as a master
theory of the Multiverse, with No-Scale supergravity as a crucial and pervasive
reinforcing structure.
