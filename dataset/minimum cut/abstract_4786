We measured the angular diameter of the exoplanet host star iota Dra with
Georgia State University's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA)
Array interferometer, and, using the star's parallax and photometry from the
literature, calculated its physical radius and effective temperature. We then
combined our results with stellar oscillation frequencies from Zechmeister et
al. (2008) and orbital elements from Kane et al. (2010) to determine the masses
for the star and exoplanet. Our value for the central star's mass is 1.82 +/-
0.23 M_Sun, which means the exoplanet's minimum mass is 12.6 +/- 1.1 M_Jupiter.
Using our new effective temperature, we recalculated the habitable zone for the
system, though it is well outside the star-planet separation.
