Recent CMS soft QCD results in proton-proton collisions at three LHC
center-of-mass energies are highlighted. The properties of minimum bias events
such as charged particle transverse momentum spectra, event-by-event
multiplicity distributions, the production of the strange particles are
measured. Particle correlations, such as long- and short-range angular
correlation as well as Bose-Einstein correlation are studied. Characteristics
of the underlying event and comparisons to MC tunes have been made.
