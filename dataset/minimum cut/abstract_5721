We report the first measurement of charged pion, kaon and (anti-)proton
production in jets from hadron colliders. The measurement was carried out with
the ALICE detector using $2\times10^8$ minimum bias pp collisions at a
centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV at the LHC. We present the $\pi$, K
and p transverse momentum ($p_\textrm{T}$) spectra, as well as the spectra of
the reduced momentum (${z^\textrm{ch}\equiv
p_\textrm{T}^\textrm{track}/p_\textrm{T, jet}^\textrm{ch}}$), in charged jets
of $p_\textrm{T}$ between 5--20 $\textrm{GeV}/c$. The measurement is compared
to Monte Carlo calculations.
