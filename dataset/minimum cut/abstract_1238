Gl581d has a minimum mass of 7 MEarth and is the first detected potentially
habitable rocky Super-Earth. Our models confirm that a habitable atmosphere can
exist on Gl581d. We derive spectroscopic features for atmospheres, assuming an
Earth-like composition for this planet, from high oxygen atmosphere analogous
to Earth's to high CO2 atmospheres with and without biotic oxygen
concentrations. We find that a minimum CO2 partial pressure of about 7 bar, in
an atmosphere with a total surface pressure of 7.6 bar, are needed to maintain
a mean surface temperature above freezing on Gl581d. We model transmission and
emergent synthetic spectra from 0.4{\mu}m to 40{\mu}m and show where indicators
of biological activities in such a planet's atmosphere could be observed by
future ground- and space-based telescopes. The model we present here only
represents one possible nature - an Earth-like composition - of a planet like
Gl581d in a wide parameter space. Future observations of atmospheric features
can be used to examine if our concept of habitability and its dependence on the
carbonate-silicate cycle is correct, and assess whether Gl581d is indeed a
habitable super-Earth.
