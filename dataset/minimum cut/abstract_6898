We study (p)reheating in modular (closed string) inflationary scenarios, with
a special emphasis on Kahler moduli/Roulette models. It is usually assumed that
reheating in such models occurs through perturbative decays. However, we find
that there are very strong non-perturbative preheating decay channels related
to the particular shape of the inflaton potential (which is highly nonlinear
and has a very steep minimum). Preheating after modular inflation, proceeding
through a combination of tachyonic instability and broad-band parametric
resonance, is perhaps the most violent example of preheating after inflation
known in the literature. Further, we consider the subsequent transfer of energy
to the standard model sector in scenarios where the standard model particles
are confined to a D7-brane wrapping the inflationary blow-up cycle of the
compactification manifold or, more interestingly, a non-inflationary blow up
cycle. We explicitly identify the decay channels of the inflaton in these two
scenarios. We also consider the case where the inflationary cycle shrinks to
the string scale at the end of inflation; here a field theoretical treatment of
reheating is insufficient and one must turn instead to a stringy description.
We estimate the decay rate of the inflaton and the reheat temperature for
various scenarios.
