We propose a new coding scheme using only one lattice that achieves the
$\frac{1}{2}\log(1+\SNR)$ capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel with lattice decoding, which is provable for signal-to-noise ratio
$\SNR>e$ at present. The scheme applies a discrete Gaussian distribution over
an AWGN-good lattice, but otherwise does not require a shaping lattice or
dither. Thus, it significantly simplifies the default lattice coding scheme of
Erez and Zamir which involves a quantization-good lattice as well as an
AWGN-good lattice. Using the flatness factor, we show that the error
probability of the proposed scheme under minimum mean-square error (MMSE)
lattice decoding is almost the same as that of Erez and Zamir, for any rate up
to the AWGN channel capacity. We introduce the notion of good constellations,
which carry almost the same mutual information as that of continuous Gaussian
inputs. We also address the implementation of Gaussian shaping for the proposed
lattice Gaussian coding scheme.
