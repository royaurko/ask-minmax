A low maintenance long-term operational cryogenic sapphire oscillator has
been implemented at 11.2 GHz using an ultra-low-vibration cryostat and
pulse-tube cryocooler. It is currently the world's most stable microwave
oscillator employing a cryocooler. Its performance is explained in terms of
temperature and frequency stability. The phase noise and the Allan deviation of
frequency fluctuations have been evaluated by comparing it to an ultra-stable
liquid-helium cooled cryogenic sapphire oscillator in the same laboratory.
Assuming both contribute equally, the Allan deviation evaluated for the
cryocooled oscillator is sigma_y = 1 x 10^-15 tau^-1/2 for integration times 1
< tau < 10 s with a minimum sigma_y = 3.9 x 10^-16 at tau = 20 s. The long term
frequency drift is less than 5 x 10^-14/day. From the measured power spectral
density of phase fluctuations the single side band phase noise can be
represented by L_phi(f) = 10^-14.0/f^4+10^-11.6/f^3+10^-10.0/f^2+10^-10.2/f+
10^-11.0 for Fourier frequencies 10^-3<f<10^3 Hz in the single oscillator. As a
result L_phi approx -97.5 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset from the carrier.
