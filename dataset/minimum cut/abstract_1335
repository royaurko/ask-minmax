We show the presence of both a minimum and clear oscillations in the
frequency dependence of the translocation time of a polymer described as a
unidimensional Rouse chain driven by a spatially localized oscillating linear
potential. The observed oscillations of the mean translocation time arise from
the synchronization between the very mean translocation time and the period of
the external force. We have checked the robustness of the frequency value for
the minimum translocation time by changing the damping parameter, finding a
very simple relationship between this frequency and the correspondent
translocation time. The translocation time as a function of the polymer length
has been also evaluated, finding a precise $L^2$ scaling. Furthermore, the role
played by the thermal fluctuations described as a Gaussian uncorrelated noise
has been also investigated, and the analogies with the resonant activation
phenomenon are commented.
