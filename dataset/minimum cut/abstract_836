We provide a proof of Connes' formula for a representative of the Hochschild
class of the Chern character for (p,\infty)-summable spectral triples. Our
proof is valid for all semifinite von Neumann algebras, and all integral p\geq
1. We employ the minimum possible hypotheses on the spectral triples.
