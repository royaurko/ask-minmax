Photometry of a large field around the young globular cluster Palomar 12 has
revealed the main-sequence of a low surface-brightness stellar system. This
main-sequence is indicative of a stellar population that varies significantly
in metallicity and/or age, but in the mean is more metal poor than Pal 12.
Under different assumptions for the properties of this population, we find
distances from the Sun in the range 17-24 kpc, which encompasses the distance
to Pal 12, $19.0\pm0.9$ kpc. The stellar system is also detected in a field
2$\arcdeg$ North of Pal 12, which indicates it has a minimum diameter of
$\sim0.9$ kpc. The orbit of Pal 12 (Dinescu et al. 2000), the color-magnitude
diagram of the stellar system, their positions on the sky, and their distances
suggest that they are debris from the tidal disruption of the Sgr dSph galaxy.
We discuss briefly the implications for the evolution of Sgr and the Galactic
halo.
