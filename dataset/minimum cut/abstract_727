We study the metal-insulator transition in two sets of amorphous Si_{1-x}Ni_x
films. The sets were prepared by different, electron-beam-evaporation-based
technologies: evaporation of the alloy, and gradient deposition from separate
Ni and Si crucibles. The characterization included electron and scanning
tunneling microscopy, glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, and
Rutherford back scattering. Investigating the logarithmic temperature
derivative of the conductivity, w = d ln sigma / d ln T, we observe that, for
insulating samples, w(T) shows a minimum increasing at both low and high T.
Both the minimum value of w and the corresponding temperature seem to tend to
zero as the transition is approached. The analysis of this feature of w(T,x)
leads to the conclusion that the transition in Si_{1-x}Ni_x is very likely
discontinuous at zero temperature in agreement with Mott's original views.
