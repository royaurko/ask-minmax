In this work, we consider several types of lubricants - including
non-Newtonian fluids - that were studied under various operating conditions
leading us to explore a wide range of dimensionless parameters. The
experimental results are compared with predictions given by the usual
analytical EHL relationships and by more recently developed models. This broad
comparison conducted with particular emphasis on minimum film thickness (hm)
showed a fair agreement between experimental data and a few predictions
including some obtained from extended models. Commonly used elasto-hydrodynamic
lubrication (EHL) models did not systematically gave accurate hm estimation,
whereas minimum film thickness not only is a yield value but also serves as a
key parameter in estimating lubrication regimes.
