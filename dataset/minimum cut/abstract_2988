A numerical model for the solar modulation of cosmic rays, based on the
solution of a set of stochastic differential equations, is used to illustrate
the effects of modifying the heliospheric magnetic field, particularly in the
polar regions of the heliosphere. To this end, the dfferences in the modulation
brought about by each of three choices for the heliospheric magnetic field,
i.e. the unmodified Parker field, the Smith-Bieber modified field, and the
Jokipii-Kota modified field, are studied. It is illustrated that both the
Jokipii-Kota and Smith-Bieber modifications are effective in modifying the
Parker field in the polar regions. In addition, it is argued that the
modification of Smith and Bieber is based on observational evidence and has a
firm physical basis, while these motivations are lacking in the case of the
Jokipii-Kota modification. From a cosmic ray modulation point of view, we found
the Smith-Bieber modification to be the most suitable choice for modifying the
heliospheric magnetic ?field. The features and effects of these three
modifications are illustrated both qualitatively and quantitatively. It is also
shown how the Smith-Bieber modified field can be applied in cosmic ray
modulation models to reproduce observational cosmic ray proton spectra from the
PAMELA mission during the solar minimum of 2006 - 2009. These results are
compared with those obtained in previous studies of this unusual solar minimum
activity period and found to be in good qualitative agreement.
