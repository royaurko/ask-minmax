We compare and analyse Bose-Einstein correlation data for $\pi^+ p$ and $K^+
p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=22\ GeV$ obtained by the NA22-Collaboration and data
for $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=630\ GeV$ obtained by the
UA1-Minimum-Bias-Collaboration. Using a parametrization for a longitudinally
expanding source, we observe that correlation lengths and radii extracted from
fits to the data change significantly if one goes from the NA22- to the
UA1-data: the transverse radius of the chaotic source increases by about $50\%$
while the correlation lengths in longitudinal and transverse directions
decrease by about $50\%$ and $30\%$, respectively. The chaoticity parameter
remains approximately constant or increases. DMR-THEP-94-6/W
