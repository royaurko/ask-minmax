In this paper, a new method is introduced to blindly estimate the transmit
power of multiple signal sources in multi-antenna fading channels, when the
number of sensing devices and the number of available samples are sufficiently
large compared to the number of sources. Recent advances in the field of large
dimensional random matrix theory are used that result in a simple and
computationally efficient consistent estimator of the power of each source. A
criterion to determine the minimum number of sensors and the minimum number of
samples required to achieve source separation is then introduced. Simulations
are performed that corroborate the theoretical claims and show that the
proposed power estimator largely outperforms alternative power inference
techniques.
