Nine variations of the concept of domination in a simple graph are identified
as fundamental domination concepts, and a unified approach is introduced for
studying them. For each variation, the minimum cardinality of a subset of
dominating elements is the corresponding fundamental domination number. It is
observed that, for each nontrivial connected graph, at most five of these nine
numbers can be different, and inequalities between these five numbers are
given. Finally, these fundamental dominations are interpreted in terms of the
total graph of the given graph, a concept introduced by the second contributor in
1965. It is argued that the very first domination concept, defined by O. Ore in
1962 and under a different name by C. Berge in 1958, deserves to be called the
most fundamental of graph dominations.
