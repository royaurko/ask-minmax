We measure the clustering of DEEP2 galaxies at z=1 as a function of
luminosity on scales 0.1 Mpc/h to 20 Mpc/h. Drawing from a parent catalog of
25,000 galaxies at 0.7<z<1.3 in the full DEEP2 survey, we create volume-limited
samples having upper luminosity limits between M_B=-19 and M_B=-20.5, roughly
0.2-1 L^* at z=1. We find that brighter galaxies are more strongly clustered
than fainter galaxies and that the slope of the correlation function does not
depend on luminosity for L<L^*. The brightest galaxies, with L>L^*, have a
steeper slope. The clustering scale-length, r_0, varies from 3.69 +/-0.14 for
the faintest sample to 4.43 +/-0.14 for the brightest sample. The relative bias
of galaxies as a function of L/L^* is steeper than the relation found locally
for SDSS galaxies (Zehavi et al. 2005) over the luminosity range that we
sample. The absolute bias of galaxies at z=1 is scale-dependent on scales r_p<1
Mpc/h, and rises most significantly on small scales for the brightest samples.
For a concordance cosmology, the large-scale bias varies from 1.26 +/-0.04 to
1.54 +/-0.05 as a function of luminosity and implies that DEEP2 galaxies reside
in dark matter halos with a minimum mass of ~1-3 10^12 h^-1 M_sun.
