We study the cost-minimization problem posed by Ferrer i Cancho and Sol\'e in
their model of communication that aimed at explaining the origin of Zipf's law
[PNAS 100, 788 (2003)]. Direct analysis shows that the minimum cost is $\min
{\lambda, 1-\lambda}$, where $\lambda$ determines the relative weights of
speaker's and hearer's costs in the total, as shown in several previous works
using different approaches. The nature and multiplicity of the minimizing
solution changes discontinuously at $\lambda=1/2$, being qualitatively
different for $\lambda < 1/2$, $\lambda > 1/2$, and $\lambda=1/2$. Zipf's law
is found only in a vanishing fraction of the minimum-cost solutions at $\lambda
= 1/2$ and therefore is not explained by this model. Imposing the further
condition of equal costs yields distributions substantially closer to Zipf's
law, but significant differences persist. We also investigate the solutions
reached by the previously used minimization algorithm and find that they
correctly recover global minimum states at the transition.
