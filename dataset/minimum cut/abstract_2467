In this paper, simple mathematical models from Control Theory are applied to
three very important economic paradigms, namely (a) minimum wages in
self-regulating markets, (b) market-versus-true values and currency rates, and
(c) government spending and taxation levels. Analytical solutions are provided
in all three paradigms and some useful conclusions are drawn in terms of
variable analysis. This short study can be used as an example of how feedback
models and stability analysis can be applied as a guideline of 'proofs' in the
context of economic policies.
