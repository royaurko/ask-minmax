In [1] a syndrome counting based upper bound on the minimum distance of
regular binary LDPC codes is given. In this paper we extend the bound to the
case of irregular and generalized LDPC codes over GF(q). The comparison to the
lower bound for LDPC codes over GF(q) and to the upper bound for non-binary
codes is done. The new bound is shown to lie under the Gilbert-Varshamov bound
at high rates.
