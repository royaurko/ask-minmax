We report the discovery of planetary-mass companions to two red giants by the
ongoing Penn State - Torun Planet Search (PTPS) conducted with the 9.2-m
Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The 1.1 Ms K0-giant, BD+15 2940, has a 1.1 Mj minimum
mass companion orbiting the star at a 137.5-day period in a 0.54 AU orbit what
makes it the closest - in planet around a giant and possible subject of
engulfment as the consequence of stellar evolution. HD 233604, a 1.5 Ms
K5-giant, is orbited by a 6.6 Mj minimum mass planet which has a period of 192
days and a semi-major axis of only 0.75 AU making it one of the least distant
planets to a giant star. The chemical composition analysis of HD 233604 reveals
a relatively high 7Li abundance which may be a sign of its early evolutionary
stage or recent engulfment of another planet in the system.
  We also present independent detections of planetary-mass companions to HD
209458 and HD 88133, and stellar activity-induced RV variations in HD 166435,
as part of the discussion of the observing and data analysis methods used in
the PTPS project.
