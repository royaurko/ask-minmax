We discuss the interpretation of distortions to stellar spectral lines with
particular attention to line bisectors in the presence of an orbiting planetary
companion. We present a simple model whereby light reflected by the companion
can cause temporal variations to the observed line profiles. These distortions
have a characteristic signature depending on the inclination angle of the
system. For the known close-in extrasolar giant planets, the expected amplitude
of the effect might not be far from current detection capabilities. This method
could be used to directly detect the presence of the companion, yielding the
orbital inclination and hence the planetary mass. Futhermore, a detection would
measure a combination of the planetary radius and albedo, from which a minimum
radius may be deduced.
