This paper describes the reclassification of DK And, formerly classified as a
RRc type star, as EW binary. 1599 CCD unfiltered and filtered (V and R band)
observations between 1999 and 2005 show, that the star is actually an eclipsing
binary star with a period of P = 0.4892224 +/- 0.0000002 [d] with epoch E0 =
2451435.4353 +/- 0.0010 (if all historic data were taken into account). From
our new observations 12 timings of minimum light are given.
