A summary of some of the recent minimum bias and underlying event
measurements by the ATLAS collaboration is given. The results of several
analyses using low-luminosity proton-proton collision data from the LHC taken
at center-of-mass energies of sqrt(s) = 0.9, 2.36 and 7 TeV are presented. Data
are compared to predictions by several different Monte Carlo event generators.
The measurements expose limitations of the phenomenological models in properly
describing the measured observables in all regions of phase space.
