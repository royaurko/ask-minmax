The shock discontinuities, generically present in inviscid solutions of the
forced Burgers equation, and their bifurcations happening in the course of time
(perestroikas) are classified in two and three dimensions -- the
one-dimensional case is well known. This classification is a result of
selecting among all the perestroikas occurring for minimum functions depending
generically on time, the ones permitted by the convexity of the Hamiltonian of
the Burgers dynamics. Topological restrictions on the admissible perestroikas
of shocks are obtained. The resulting classification can be extended to the
so-called viscosity solutions of a Hamilton--Jacobi equation, provided the
Hamiltonian is convex.
