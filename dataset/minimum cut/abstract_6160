The Cosmic Background due to the integrated radiation from galaxies over the
whole life of the Universe is reviewed. We find that this background is well
constrained by measurements. The total power in the background is in the range
60-93 nW/m2/sr. The data show the existence of a minimum separating the direct
stellar radiation from the infrared part due to radiation reemitted by dust.
This reemitted dust radiation is about 1-2.6 time the background power in the
optical/near-IR thus much larger than the same ratio measured locally (30%).
The far-infrared and submillimeter background is likely to be dominated by
redshifted infrared galaxies. The long wavelength spectrum of the background
being significantly flatter than the spectrum of these galaxies it strongly
constrains the far-infrared radiation production rate history which must
increase by a factor larger than 10 between the present time and a redshift 1
and then stays rather constant at higher redshift, contrary to the ultraviolet
radiation production rate which decreases rapidly.
  Several models of galaxy evolution have been proposed to explain the
submillimeter background. In this paper we do not propose a new model; we
systematically explore the allowed range of evolution histories allowed by the
data. If infrared galaxies are mostly powered by starbursts as indicated by
recent observations, this infrared production history reflects the history of
starbursts in the Universe.
