A classical action for open superstring field theory has been proposed which
does not suffer from contact term problems. After generalizing this action to
include the non-GSO projected states of the Neveu-Schwarz string, the pure
tachyon contribution to the tachyon potential is explicitly computed. The
potential has a minimum of $V = -{1\over{32 g^2}}$ which is 60% of the
predicted exact minimum of $V=-{1\over{2\pi^2 g^2}}$ from D-brane arguments.
