The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism provides an elegant solution to the strong CP
problem. However astrophysical constraints on axions require the PQ breaking
scale to be far higher than the electroweak scale. In supersymmetric models the
PQ symmetry can be broken at an acceptable scale if the effective potential for
the pseudo-modulus in the axion multiplet develops a minimum at large enough
field values. In this work we classify systematically hadronic axion models in
the context of gauge mediation and study their effective potentials at one
loop. We find that some models generate a PQ scale comparable to the messenger
scale. Our result may prove useful for constructing full realistic models of
gauge mediation that address the strong CP problem. We also comment briefly on
the cosmological aspects related to saxion and axino, and on the quality of the
PQ symmetry.
