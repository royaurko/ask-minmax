Identified mid-rapidity particle spectra of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, and
$p(\bar{p})$ from 200 GeV p+p and d+Au collisions are reported. A
time-of-flight detector based on multi-gap resistive plate chamber technology
is used for particle identification. The particle-species dependence of the
Cronin effect is observed to be significantly smaller than that at lower
energies. The ratio of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{dAu}$) between
protons $(p+\bar{p})$ and charged hadrons ($h$) in the transverse momentum
range $1.2<{p_{T}}<3.0$ GeV/c is measured to be
$1.19\pm0.05$(stat)$\pm0.03$(syst) in minimum-bias collisions and shows little
centrality dependence. The yield ratio of $(p+\bar{p})/h$ in minimum-bias d+Au
collisions is found to be a factor of 2 lower than that in Au+Au collisions,
indicating that the Cronin effect alone is not enough to account for the
relative baryon enhancement observed in heavy ion collisions at RHIC.
