An ordered pair $\hat{S}=(S,S^+)$ of subsets of $V$ is called a {\em biset}
if $S \subseteq S^+$; $(V-S^+,V-S)$ is the co-biset of $\hat{S}$. Two bisets
$\hat{X},\hat{Y}$ intersect if $X \cap Y \neq \emptyset$ and cross if both $X
\cap Y \neq \emptyset$ and $X^+ \cup Y^+ \neq V$. The intersection and the
union of two bisets $\hat{X},\hat{Y}$ is defined by $\hat{X} \cap \hat{Y} = (X
\cap Y, X^+ \cap Y^+)$ and $\hat{X} \cup \hat{Y} = (X \cup Y,X^+ \cup Y^+)$. A
biset-family ${\cal F}$ is crossing (intersecting) if $\hat{X} \cap \hat{Y},
\hat{X} \cup \hat{Y} \in {\cal F}$ for any $\hat{X},\hat{Y} \in {\cal F}$ that
cross (intersect). A directed edge covers a biset $\hat{S}$ if it goes from $S$
to $V-S^+$. We consider the problem of covering a crossing biset-family ${\cal
F}$ by a minimum-cost set of directed edges. While for intersecting ${\cal F}$,
a standard primal-dual algorithm computes an optimal solution, the
approximability of the case of crossing ${\cal F}$ is not yet understood, as it
includes several NP-hard problems, for which a poly-logarithmic approximation
was discovered only recently. Let us say that a biset-family ${\cal F}$ is
$k$-regular if $\hat{X} \cap \hat{Y}, \hat{X} \cup \hat{Y} \in {\cal F}$ for
any $\hat{X},\hat{Y} \in {\cal F}$ with $|V-(X \cup Y)| \geq k+1$ that
intersect. In this paper we obtain an $O(\log |V|)$-approximation algorithm for
arbitrary crossing ${\cal F}$; if in addition both ${\cal F}$ and the family of
co-bisets of ${\cal F}$ are $k$-regular, our ratios are: $O(\log
\frac{|V|}{|V|-k})$ if $|S^+ \setminus S|=k$ for all $\hat{S} \in {\cal F}$,
and $O(\frac{|V|}{|V|-k} \log \frac{|V|}{|V|-k})$ if $|S^+ \setminus S| \leq k$
for all $\hat{S} \in {\cal F}$. Using these generic algorithms, we derive
approximation algorithms for some network design problems.
