The model-independent "box" parameterization of neutrino oscillations is
examined. The invariant boxes are the classical amplitudes of the individual
oscillating terms. Being observables, the boxes are independent of the choice
of parameterization of the mixing matrix. Emphasis is placed on the relations
among the box parameters due to mixing--matrix unitarity, and on the reduction
of the number of boxes to the minimum basis set. Using the box algebra, we show
that CP-violation may be inferred from measurements of neutrino flavor mixing
even when the oscillatory factors have averaged. General analyses of neutrino
oscillations among $n\ge 3$ flavors can readily determine the boxes, which can
then be manipulated to yield magnitudes of mixing matrix elements.
