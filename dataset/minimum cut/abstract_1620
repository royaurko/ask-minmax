One-particle eigenstates and eigenvalues of two-dimensional electrons in the
strong magnetic field with short range impurity and impurities, cosine
potential, boundary potential, and periodic array of short range potentials are
obtained by magnetic von-Neumann lattice in which Landau level wave functions
have minimum spatial extensions. We find that there is a dual correspondence
between cosine potential and lattice kinetic term and that the representation
based on the von-Neumann lattice is quite useful for solving the system's
dynamics.
