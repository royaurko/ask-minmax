In this paper a stochastic generalisation of the standard Linde-Buzo-Gray
(LBG) approach to vector quantiser (VQ) design is presented, in which the
encoder is implemented as the sampling of a vector of code indices from a
probability distribution derived from the input vector, and the decoder is
implemented as a superposition of reconstruction vectors. This stochastic VQ
(SVQ) is optimised using a minimum mean Euclidean reconstruction distortion
criterion, as in the LBG case. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate
how this leads to self-organisation of the SVQ, where different stochastically
sampled code indices become associated with different input subspaces.
