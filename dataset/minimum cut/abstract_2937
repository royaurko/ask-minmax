The interaction of a single-mode field with both a weak Kerr medium and a
parametric nonlinearity in an intrinsically nonlinear optomechanical system is
studied. The nonlinearities due to the optomechanical coupling and Kerr-down
conversion lead to the bistability and tristability in the mean intracavity
photon number. Also, our work demonstrates that the lower bound of the resolved
sideband regime and the minimum attainable phonon number can be less than that
of a bare cavity by controlling the parametric nonlinearity and the phase of
the driving field. Moreover, we find that in the system under consideration the
degree of entanglement between the mechanical and optical modes is dependent on
the two stability parameters of the system. For both cooling and entanglement,
while parametric nonlinearity increases the optomechanical coupling, the weak
Kerr nonlinearity is very useful for extending the domain of the stability
region to the desired range in which the minimum effective temperature and
maximal entanglement are attainable. Also, as shown in this paper, the present
scheme allows to have significant entanglement in the tristable regime for the
lower and middle branches which makes the current scheme distinct from the bare
optomechanical system.
