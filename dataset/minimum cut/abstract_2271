We discuss some of the latest results concerning the non-Abelian vortices.
The first concerns the construction of non-Abelian BPS vortices based on
general gauge groups of the form G= G' x U(1). In particular detailed results
about the vortex moduli space have been obtained for G'=SO(N) or USp(2N). The
second result is about the "fractional vortices", i.e., vortices of the minimum
winding but having substructures in the tension (or flux) density in the
transverse plane. Thirdly, we discuss briefly the monopole-vortex complex.
