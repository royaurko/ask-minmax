A new class of metastable de Sitter vacua is presented and analyzed in N =1
supergravity and string theory with tunable (infinitesimally small) value of
the cosmological constant. They are based on a gauged R-symmetry and the
minimal spectrum contains a vector and a linear multiplet of the string dilaton
or of a compactification modulus. In the minimum of the scalar potential
supersymmetry is broken by an expectation value of both a D- and F-term.
