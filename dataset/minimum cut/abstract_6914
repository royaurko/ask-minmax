We report the detection of a giant planet in a 6.4950 day orbit around the
1.7 Msun subgiant HD102956. The planet has a semimajor axis a = 0.081 AU and
minimum mass Msini = 0.96 Mjup. HD102956 is the most massive star known to
harbor a hot Jupiter, and its planet is only the third known to orbit within
0.6 AU of a star more massive than 1.5 Msun. Based on our sample of 137
subgiants with M* > 1.45 Msun we find that 0.5-2.3% of A-type stars harbor a
close-in planet (a < 0.1 AU) with Msini > 1 Mjup, consistent with hot-Jupiter
occurrence for Sun-like stars. Thus, the paucity of planets with 0.1 < a/AU <
1.0 around intermediate-mass stars may be an exaggerated version of the "period
valley" that is characteristic of planets around Sun-like stars.
