A subset $S\subseteq V$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a $k$-quasiperfect dominating
set (for $k\geq 1$) if every vertex not in $S$ is adjacent to at least one and
at most $k$ vertices in $S$. The cardinality of a minimum $k$-quasiperfect
dominating set in $G$ is denoted by $\gamma_ {\stackrel{}{1k}}(G)$. Those sets
were first introduced by Chellali et al. (2013) as a generalization of the
perfect domination concept and allow us to construct a decreasing chain of
quasiperfect dominating numbers $ n \ge \gamma_ {\stackrel{}{11}}(G) \ge
\gamma_ {\stackrel{}{12}}(G)\ge \ldots \ge \gamma_
{\stackrel{}{1\Delta}}(G)=\gamma(G)$ in order to indicate how far is $G$ from
being perfectly dominated. In this paper we study properties, existence and
realization of graphs for which the chain is short, that is, $\gamma_
{\stackrel{}{12}}(G)=\gamma (G)$. Among them, one can find cographs, claw-free
graphs and graphs with extremal values of $\Delta(G)$.
