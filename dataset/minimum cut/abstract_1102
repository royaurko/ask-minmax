Relaxed States of a slightly resistive and turbulent magnetized plasma is
obtained by invoking the principle of minimum dissipation which leads to curl
curl curl B = \lambda B . A solution of the above equation is accomplished
using the analytic continuation of the Chandrasekhar-Kendall eigenfunctions in
the complex domain. The new features of this theory is to show (i) a single
fluid can relax to an MHD equilibrium which can support pressure gradient even
without a flow, (ii) field reversal (RFP) in states that are not force free.
