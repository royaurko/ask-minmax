A mesoscopic model is proposed to explain the anomalous dynamics in a
supercooled liquid as its glass transition temperature is approached from
above. The model is based on the assumption of $\beta$ organized $\alpha$
process, with the requirement of coherent excitation of a minimum critical
number $N_{c}$ of $\beta$ processes in the surroundings of a total $N_{\beta}$.
Numerical evaluation of the model shows that the growth in this critical number
in the background of a modest $N_{\beta}$ can lead to a severe entropic
bottleneck and slow down the dynamics to an extent observed near real glass
transition. The fragility of the glass-forming liquid is shown to be correlated
with the growth of the ratio $\gamma (= N_{c}/N_{\beta})$.
