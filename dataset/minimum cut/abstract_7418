We study depth lower bounds against non-monotone circuits, parametrized by a
new measure of non-monotonicity: the orientation of a function $f$ is the
characteristic vector of the minimum sized set of negated variables needed in
any DeMorgan circuit computing $f$. We prove trade-off results between the
depth and the weight/structure of the orientation vectors in any circuit $C$
computing the Clique function on an $n$ vertex graph. We prove that if $C$ is
of depth $d$ and each gate computes a Boolean function with orientation of
weight at most $w$ (in terms of the inputs to $C$), then $d \times w$ must be
$\Omega(n)$. In particular, if the weights are $o(\frac{n}{\log^k n})$, then
$C$ must be of depth $\omega(\log^k n)$. We prove a barrier for our general
technique. However, using specific properties of the Clique function and the
Karchmer-Wigderson framework (Karchmer and Wigderson, 1988), we go beyond the
limitations and obtain lower bounds when the weight restrictions are less
stringent. We then study the depth lower bounds when the structure of the
orientation vector is restricted. Asymptotic improvements to our results (in
the restricted setting), separates NP from NC. As our main tool, we generalize
Karchmer-Wigderson gamefor monotone functions to work for non-monotone circuits
parametrized by the weight/structure of the orientation. We also prove
structural results about orientation and prove connections between number of
negations and weight of orientations required to compute a function.
