The generalization of the Glauber formula for cumulative production events is
derived. On its basis the multiplicity distribution in such events is related
to the one in the minimum bias events. As compared to the rare events of type
$C$, the formula involves a shift in the arguments determined by the
multiplicity from a collision with a cluster of several nucleons.
