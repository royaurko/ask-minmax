We find out the number of different partitions of an n-kilogram stone into
the minimum number of parts so that all integral weights from 1 to n kilograms
can be weighed in one weighing using the parts of any of the partitions on a
two-pan balance. In comparison to the traditional partitions, these partitions
have advantage where there is a constraint on total weight of a set and the
number of parts in the partition. They may have uses in determining the optimal
size and number of weights and denominations of notes and coins.
