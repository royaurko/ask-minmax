We report a measurement of the fraction of events with a large pseudorapidity
gap $\Delta\eta$ within the pseudorapidity region available to the proton
dissociation products $X$ in $\bar p+p\to \bar p+X$. For a final state $\bar p$
of fractional momentum loss $\xi_{\bar p}$ and 4-momentum transfer squared
$t_{\bar p}$ within $0.06<\xi_{\bar p}<0.09$ and $|t_{\bar p}|<1.0$ [0.2]
GeV$^2$ at $\sqrt s=1800$ [630] GeV, the fraction of events with $\Delta
\eta>3$is found to be $0.246\pm 0.001 {\rm (stat)}\pm 0.042 {\rm (syst)}$
[$0.184\pm 0.001 {\rm (stat)}\pm 0.043 {\rm (syst)}$]. Our results are compared
with gap fractions measured in minimum bias $\bar pp$ collisions and with
theoretical expectations.
