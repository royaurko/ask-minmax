Tidal Disruption of stars by supermassive central black holes from dense
rotating star clusters is modelled by high-accuracy direct N-body simulation.
As in a previous paper on spherical star clusters we study the time evolution
of the stellar tidal disruption rate and the origin of tidally disrupted stars,
now according to several classes of orbits which only occur in axisymmetric
systems (short axis tube and saucer). Compared with that in spherical systems,
we found a higher TD rate in axisymmetric systems. The enhancement can be
explained by an enlarged loss-cone in phase space which is raised from the fact
that total angular momentum $\bf J$ is not conserved. As in the case of
spherical systems, the distribution of the last apocenter distance of tidally
accreted stars peaks at the classical critical radius. However, the angular
distribution of the origin of the accreted stars reveals interesting features.
Inside the influence radius of the supermassive black hole the angular
distribution of disrupted stars has a conspicuous bimodal structure with a
local minimum near the equatorial plane. Outside the influence radius this
dependence is weak. We show that the bimodal structure of orbital parameters
can be explained by the presence of two families of regular orbits, namely
short axis tube and saucer orbits. Also the consequences of our results for the
loss cone in axisymmetric galactic nuclei are presented.
