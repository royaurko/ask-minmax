Upcoming space-based photometric satellites offer the possibility of
detecting continuum flux variability at the micro-magnitude level. We show that
the Doppler flux variability induced by the reflex motion of stars due to
planetary companions has an amplitude of (3-alpha)K/c, where K is the reflex
radial velocity amplitude and alpha is the logarithmic slope of source spectral
flux in the observed frequency band. For many of the known close-in planetary
systems with periods less than ~0.2 years, the periodic Doppler variability is
of order a micromagnitude, and is significant relative to the variability
caused by reflected light from the planetary companion. For companions with
periods greater than ~0.2 years, the Doppler signal is larger than the
reflected light signal. We show that the future photometric satellites should
reach the sensitivity to detect this Doppler variability. In particular, the
Kepler satellite should have the photon-noise sensitivity to detect at a
signal-to-noise ratio > 5, all planets with minimum mass greater than 5 Jupiter
masses, and periods less than 0.1 years around the 10,000 main-sequence stars
with spectral types A through K and apparent magnitude V<12 in its
field-of-view.
