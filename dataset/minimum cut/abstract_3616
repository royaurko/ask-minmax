Accurate ab-initio pseudopotential calculations within density functional
theory in the LDA approximation have been performed for structural properties
and stability of ZnSe/GaAs(001) defected heterostructures. There is a strong
experimental evidence that ZnSe/GaAs heterostructures with minimum stacking
fault density are related to the presence of a substantial concentration of Ga
vacancies at interface. In order to gain insights into the still unknown
microscopic maechanism governing their formation and stability, we compared the
relative stability of some simple selected interface configurations, chosen
taking into account charge neutrality prescription and allowing the presence of
Ga vacancy next to the interface. Remarkably, our results show that, under
particular thermodynamic conditions, some interfaces with vacancies are
favoured over undefected ones.
