We study the projective normality of a linearly normal special scroll R of
degree d and speciality i over a smooth curve X of genus g. We relate it with
the Clifford index of the base curve X. If d>=4g-2i-Cliff(X)+1, i>=3 and R is
smooth, we prove that the projective normality of the scroll is equivalent to
the projective normality of its directrix curve of minimum degree.
