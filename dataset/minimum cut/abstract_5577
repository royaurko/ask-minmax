Our previously proposed OFDM with sufficient cyclic prefix (CP) synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) imaging algorithm is inter-range-cell interference (IRCI)
free and achieves ideally zero range sidelobes for range reconstruction. In
this OFDM SAR imaging algorithm, the minimum required CP length is almost equal
to the number of range cells in a swath, while the number of subcarriers of an
OFDM signal needs to be more than the CP length. This makes the length of a
transmitted OFDM sequence at least almost twice of the number of range cells in
a swath and for a wide swath imaging, the transmitted OFDM pulse length becomes
long, which may cause problems in some radar applications. In this paper, we
propose a CP based OFDM SAR imaging with arbitrary pulse length, which has IRCI
free range reconstruction and its pulse length is independent of a swath width.
We then present a novel design method for our proposed arbitrary length OFDM
pulses. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performances of the
OFDM pulse design and the arbitrary pulse length CP based OFDM SAR imaging.
