The evolution equations for a plasma comprising multiple species of charged
fluids with relativistic bulk and thermal motion are derived. It is shown that
a minimal fluid coupling model allows a natural casting of the evolution
equations in terms of generalized vorticity which treats the fluid motion and
electromagnetic fields equally. Equilibria can be found using a variational
principle based on minimizing the total enstrophy subject to energy and
helicity constraints. A subset of these equilibria correspond to minimum
energy. The equations for these states are presented with example solutions
showing the structure of the relaxed states.
