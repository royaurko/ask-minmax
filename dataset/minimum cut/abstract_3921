We argue that the trace structure of the non-abelian Born-Infeld action can
be fixed by demanding that the action be linearised by certain
energy-minimising BPS-like configurations. It is shown how instantons in
D4-branes, SU(2) monopoles and dyons in D3-branes, and vortices in D2-branes
are all BPS states of the action recently proposed by Tseytlin. The T-dual
worldvolume theories of D-strings and D0-branes are also considered. All such
configurations can be dealt with exactly within the context of non-abelian
Born-Infeld theory since, given the relevant BPS-like condition, the action
reduces to that of Yang-Mills theory. The worldvolume energy of such
configurations is an absolute minimum. It would seem, moreover, that such an
analysis holds for the symmetrised trace structure of Tseytlin's proposal only.
