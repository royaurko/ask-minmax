We present a complete phenomenological model accounting for the evolution of
the cosmic-ray spectrum and composition with energy, based on the available
data over the entire spectrum. We show that there is no need to postulate any
additional component, other than one single Galactic component depending on
rigidity alone, and one extragalactic component, whose characteristics are
similar to those derived from a study of particle acceleration at mildly
relativistic shocks in a GRB environment (Globus et al., 2015). In particular,
we show that the resulting cosmic ray spectrum and composition satisfy the
various constraints derived from the current data in the Galactic/extragalactic
transition region, notably from the measurements of KASCADE Grande and Auger.
Finally, we derive some generic features that a working phenomenological
scenario may exhibit to give a global account of the cosmic ray data with a
minimum number of free parameters.
