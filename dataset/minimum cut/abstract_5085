The combination of ultra-cold atomic clouds with the light fields of optical
cavities provides a powerful model system for the development of new types of
laser cooling and for studying cooperative phenomena. These experiments
critically depend on the precise tuning of an incident pump laser with respect
to a cavity resonance. Here, we present a simple and reliable experimental
tuning scheme based on a two-mode laser spectrometer. The scheme uses a first
laser for probing higher-order transversal modes of the cavity having an
intensity minimum near the cavity's optical axis, where the atoms are confined
by a magnetic trap. In this way the cavity resonance is observed without
exposing the atoms to unwanted radiation pressure. A second laser, which is
phase-locked to the first one and tuned close to a fundamental cavity mode
drives the coherent atom-field dynamics.
