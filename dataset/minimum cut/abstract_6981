For a graph X, let f_0(X) denote its number of vertices, d(X) its minimum
degree and Z_1(X;Z/2) its cycle space in the standard graph-theoretical sense
(i.e. 1-dimensional cycle group in the sense of simplicial homology theory with
Z/2-coefficients). Call a graph Hamilton-generated if and only if the set of
all Hamilton circuits is a Z/2-generating system for Z_1(X;Z/2). The main
purpose of this paper is to prove the following: for every s > 0 there exists
n_0 such that for every graph X with f_0(X) >= n_0 vertices, (1) if d(X) >=
(1/2 + s) f_0(X) and f_0(X) is odd, then X is Hamilton-generated, (2) if d(X)
>= (1/2 + s) f_0(X) and f_0(X) is even, then the set of all Hamilton circuits
of X generates a codimension-one subspace of Z_1(X;Z/2), and the set of all
circuits of X having length either f_0(X)-1 or f_0(X) generates all of
Z_1(X;Z/2), (3) if d(X) >= (1/4 + s) f_0(X) and X is square bipartite, then X
is Hamilton-generated. All these degree-conditions are essentially
best-possible. The implications in (1) and (2) give an asymptotic affirmative
answer to a special case of an open conjecture which according to [European J.
Combin. 4 (1983), no. 3, p. 246] originates with A. Bondy.
