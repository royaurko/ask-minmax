In this paper, the deployment of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a flying
base station used to provide on the fly wireless communications to a given
geographical area is analyzed. In particular, the co-existence between the UAV,
that is transmitting data in the downlink, and an underlaid device-todevice
(D2D) communication network is considered. For this model, a tractable
analytical framework for the coverage and rate analysis is derived. Two
scenarios are considered: a static UAV and a mobile UAV. In the first scenario,
the average coverage probability and the average sum-rate for the users in the
area are derived as a function of the UAV altitude and the number of D2D users.
In the second scenario, using the disk covering problem, the minimum number of
stop points that the UAV needs to visit in order to completely cover the area
is computed. Simulation and analytical results show that, depending on the
density of D2D users, optimal values for the UAV altitude exist for which the
average sum-rate and the coverage probability are maximized. Moreover, our
results also show that, by enabling the UAV to intelligently move over the
target area, the overall communication rate and coverage probability can be
significantly improved. Finally, in order to provide a full coverage for the
area of interest, the tradeoff between the coverage and delay, in terms of the
number of stop points, is discussed.
