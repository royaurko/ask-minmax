We calculate vacuum energy for twisted SUSY D-brane on toroidal background
with constant magnetic or constant electric field. Its behaviour for toroidal
D-brane (p=2) in constant electric field shows the presence of stable minimum
for twisted versions of the theory. That indicates such a background maybe
reasonable groundstate.
