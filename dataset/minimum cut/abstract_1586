We discuss the equation of motion of the rotating homogenous and isotropic
model of the Universe. We show that the model predicts the presence of a
minimum in the relation between the mass of an astronomical object and its
angular momentum. We show that this relation appears to be universal, and we
predict the masses of structures with minimal angular momenta in agreement with
observations. In such a manner we suggest the possibility at acquirement of
angular momenta of celestial bodies during their formation from the global
rotation of the Universe.
