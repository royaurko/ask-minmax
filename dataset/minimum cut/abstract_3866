We propose a model for gamma ray bursts in which a star subject to a high
level of fermion degeneracy undergoes a phase transition to a supersymmetric
state. The burst is initiated by the transition of fermion pairs to sfermion
pairs which, uninhibited by the Pauli exclusion principle, can drop to the
ground state of minimum momentum through photon emission. The jet structure is
attributed to the Bose statistics of sfermions whereby subsequent sfermion
pairs are preferentially emitted into the same state (sfermion amplification by
stimulated emission). Bremsstrahlung gamma rays tend to preserve the
directional information of the sfermion momenta and are themselves enhanced by
stimulated emission.
