Previous criteria for the feasibility of reconstructing phase information
from intensity measurements, both in x-ray crystallography and more recently in
coherent x-ray imaging, have been based on the Maxwell constraint counting
principle. We propose a new criterion, based on Shannon's mutual information,
that is better suited for noisy data or contrast that has strong priors not
well modeled by continuous variables. A natural application is magnetic domain
imaging, where the criterion for uniqueness in the reconstruction takes the
form that the number of photons, per pixel of contrast in the image, exceeds a
certain minimum. Detailed studies of a simple model show that the uniqueness
transition is of the type exhibited by spin glasses.
