We consider the two-dimensional electron gas confined laterally to a narrow
channel by a harmonic potential. As the Zeeman splitting matches the
intersubband separation the nonlocal spin polarization develops a minimum as
reported by Frolov et al. [Nature (London) 458, 868 (2009)]. This phenomenon
termed Ballistic Spin Resonance is due to the degeneracy between the nearest
oppositely polarized subbands that is lifted by spin-orbit coupling. We showed
that the resonance survives the weak and short-range interaction. The latter
detunes it and as a result shifts the Zeeman splitting at which the minimum in
spin polarization occurs. Here this shift is attributed to the absence of Kohn
theorem for the spin sloshing collective mode. We characterized the shift due
to weak interaction qualitatively by analyzing the spin sloshing mode within
the Fermi liquid phenomenology.
