In this report we investigate the Goldberger-Wise (GW) mechanism of radion
stabilization with quartic potential on the hidden brane and quadratic
potential on the visible brane. The advantage of our simplified scenario over
the original GW mechanism is that the modulus potential can be evaluated for
finite $\lv$ and $\lh$. This enables us to probe how the modulus potential
behaves over the entire range of $\lh$. By staying away from the GW limit of
${k \over \lv v_v^2} \to $0 and ${k \over \lh v_h^2}\to $0 we show that it is
possible to choose the parameters of the model so that the potential exhibits a
minimum at $k\rc \approx$ 12 and this adjustment does not involve any extreme
fine tuning of parameters.
