We consider a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator $H^h$, depending on the
semiclassical parameter $h>0$, on a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We
assume that there is no electric field. We suppose that the minimal value $b_0$
of the magnetic field $b$ is strictly positive, and there exists a unique
minimum point of $b$, which is non-degenerate. The main result of the paper is
a complete asymptotic expansion for the low-lying eigenvalues of the operator
$H^h$ in the semiclassical limit. We also apply these results to prove the
existence of an arbitrary large number of spectral gaps in the semiclassical
limit in the corresponding periodic setting.
