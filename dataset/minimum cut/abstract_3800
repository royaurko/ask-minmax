We describe a simple class of supersymmetric gauge theories that can act as
supersymmetry-breaking sectors for gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. The
models have a local supersymmetry-breaking minimum along a direction in field
space where a singlet gets a large expectation value. The potential along this
direction has a runaway behavior stabilized by supersymmetry breaking in the
effective low-energy theory. The supersymmetric vacua are at infinite field
values, and cosmological bounds on false vacuum decay are easily satisfied. The
models have no dimensionful parameters, and all mass scales arise through
strong coupling dynamics. Simple variants of the model are compatible with
perturbative unification, can naturally have dynamical supersymmetry breaking
at a scale as low as 10 TeV, and can solve the R axion problem without
appealing to Planck-scale effects.
