A projective Reed-Muller (PRM) code, obtained by modifying a (classical)
Reed-Muller code with respect to a projective space, is a doubly extended
Reed-Solomon code when the dimension of the related projective space is equal
to 1. The minimum distance and dual code of a PRM code are known, and some
decoding examples have been represented for the case of a low-dimensional
projective space. In this study, we construct an efficient decoding algorithm
for all PRM codes. For this purpose, we divide a projective space into a union
of affine spaces. In addition, we evaluate the computational complexity and
number of correctable errors of our algorithm. Finally, we compare the codeword
error rate of our algorithm with that of minimum distance decoding.
