We have investigated the magnetoresistance of strongly asymmetric double-well
structures formed by a thin AlGaAs barrier grown far from the interface in the
GaAs buffer of standard heterostructures. In magnetic fields oriented parallel
to the electron layers, the magnetoresistance exhibits an oscillation
associated with the depopulation of the higher occupied subband and with the
field-induced transition into a decoupled bilayer. In addition, the increasing
field transfers electrons from the triangular to rectangular well and, at high
enough field value, the triangular well is emptied. Consequently, the
electronic system becomes a single layer which leads to a sharp step in the
density of electron states and to an additional minimum in the
magnetoresistance curve.
