Quantile regression is an important tool for estimation of conditional
quantiles of a response Y given a vector of covariates X. It can be used to
measure the effect of covariates not only in the center of a distribution, but
also in the upper and lower tails. This paper develops a theory of quantile
regression in the tails. Specifically, it obtains the large sample properties
of extremal (extreme order and intermediate order) quantile regression
estimators for the linear quantile regression model with the tails restricted
to the domain of minimum attraction and closed under tail equivalence across
regressor values. This modeling setup combines restrictions of extreme value
theory with leading homoscedastic and heteroscedastic linear specifications of
regression analysis. In large samples, extreme order regression quantiles
converge weakly to \argmin functionals of stochastic integrals of Poisson
processes that depend on regressors, while intermediate regression quantiles
and their functionals converge to normal vectors with variance matrices
dependent on the tail parameters and the regressor design.
