We present McGenus, an algorithm to predict RNA secondary structures with
pseudoknots. The method is based on a classification of RNA structures
according to their topological genus. McGenus can treat sequences of up to 1000
bases and performs an advanced stochastic search of their minimum free energy
structure allowing for non trivial pseudoknot topologies. Specifically, McGenus
employs a multiple Markov chain scheme for minimizing a general scoring
function which includes not only free energy contributions for pair stacking,
loop penalties, etc. but also a phenomenological penalty for the genus of the
pairing graph. The good performance of the stochastic search strategy was
successfully validated against TT2NE which uses the same free energy
parametrization and performs exhaustive or partially exhaustive structure
search, albeit for much shorter sequences (up to 200 bases). Next, the method
was applied to other RNA sets, including an extensive tmRNA database, yielding
results that are competitive with existing algorithms. Finally, it is shown
that McGenus highlights possible limitations in the free energy scoring
function. The algorithm is available as a web-server at
