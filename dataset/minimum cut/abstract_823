Resonance penetration of two coupled particles through a repulsive barrier is
considered. It is shown that a local minimum of the total potential generates
metastable bound states, and their spectrum determines the position of
resonances in the penetration probability. It is pointed out that the
probabilities of tunneling of two interacting particles from the false vacuum
can be essentially higher than it has been assumed earlier.
