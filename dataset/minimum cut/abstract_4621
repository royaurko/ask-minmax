A positive definite quadratic form is called perfect, if it is uniquely
determined by its arithmetical minimum and the integral vectors attaining it.
In this self-contained survey we explain how to enumerate perfect forms in $d$
variables up to arithmetical equivalence and scaling. We put an emphasis on
practical issues concerning computer assisted enumerations. For the necessary
theory of Voronoi we provide complete proofs based on Ryshkov polyhedra. This
allows a very natural generalization to $T$-perfect forms, which are perfect
with respect to a linear subspace $T$ in the space of quadratic forms.
Important examples include Gaussian, Eisenstein and Hurwitz quaternionic
perfect forms, for which we present new classification results in dimensions
$8,10$ and 12.
