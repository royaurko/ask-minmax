Given a weighted $n$-vertex graph $G$ with integer edge-weights taken from a
range $[-M,M]$, we show that the minimum-weight simple path visiting $k$
vertices can be found in time $\tilde{O}(2^k \poly(k) M n^\omega) = O^*(2^k
M)$. If the weights are reals in $[1,M]$, we provide a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation which has a running time of $\tilde{O}(2^k
\poly(k) n^\omega(\log\log M + 1/\varepsilon))$. For the more general problem
of $k$-tree, in which we wish to find a minimum-weight copy of a $k$-node tree
$T$ in a given weighted graph $G$, under the same restrictions on edge weights
respectively, we give an exact solution of running time $\tilde{O}(2^k \poly(k)
M n^3) $ and a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution of running time
$\tilde{O}(2^k \poly(k) n^3(\log\log M + 1/\varepsilon))$. All of the above
algorithms are randomized with a polynomially-small error probability.
