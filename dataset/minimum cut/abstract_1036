We consider laboratory experiments that can detect stable, neutral strongly
interacting massive particles (SIMPs). We explore the SIMP annihilation cross
section from its minimum value (restricted by cosmological bounds) to the barn
range, and vary the mass values from a GeV to a TeV. We calculate, as a
function of the SIMP-nucleon cross section, the minimum nucleon number A for
which there should be binding in a nucleus. We consider accelerator mass
spectrometry with a gold (A=200) target, and compute the likely abundance of
anomalous gold nuclei if stable neutral SIMPs exist. We also consider the
prospects and problems of detecting such particles at the Tevatron. We estimate
optimistically that such detection might be possible for SIMPs with
SIMP-nucleon cross sections larger than 0.1 millibarn and masses between 25 and
50 GeV.
