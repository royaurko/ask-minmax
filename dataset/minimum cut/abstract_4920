Shear and bulk viscosities of deconfined gluonic matter are investigated
within an effective kinetic theory by describing the strongly interacting
medium phenomenologically in terms of quasiparticle excitations with
medium-dependent self-energies. We show that the resulting transport
coefficients reproduce the parametric dependencies on temperature and coupling
obtained in perturbative QCD at large temperatures and small running coupling.
The extrapolation into the non-perturbative regime results in a decreasing
specific shear viscosity with decreasing temperature, exhibiting a minimum in
the vicinity of the deconfinement transition, while the specific bulk viscosity
is sizeable in this region falling off rapidly with increasing temperature. The
temperature dependence of specific shear and bulk viscosities found within this
quasiparticle description of the pure gluon plasma is in agreement with
available lattice QCD results.
