In knot concordance three genera arise naturally, g(K), g_4(K), and g_c(K):
these are the classical genus, the 4-ball genus, and the concordance genus,
defined to be the minimum genus among all knots concordant to K. Clearly 0 <=
g_4(K) <= g_c(K) <= g(K). Casson and Nakanishi gave examples to show that
g_4(K) need not equal g_c(K). We begin by reviewing and extending their
results.
  For knots representing elements in A, the concordance group of algebraically
slice knots, the relationships between these genera are less clear. Casson and
Gordon's result that A is nontrivial implies that g_4(K) can be nonzero for
knots in A. Gilmer proved that g_4(K) can be arbitrarily large for knots in A.
We will prove that there are knots K in A with g_4(K) = 1 and g_c(K)
arbitrarily large.
  Finally, we tabulate g_c for all prime knots with 10 crossings and, with two
exceptions, all prime knots with fewer than 10 crossings. This requires the
description of previously unnoticed concordances.
