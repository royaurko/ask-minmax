We derive closed form kaon-nucleon scattering amplitudes using the ``quark
Born diagram" formalism, which describes the scattering as a single interaction
(here the OGE spin-spin term) followed by quark line rearrangement. The low
energy I=0 and I=1 S-wave KN phase shifts are in reasonably good agreement with
experiment given conventional quark model parameters. For $k_{lab}> 0.7$ Gev
however the I=1 elastic phase shift is larger than predicted by Gaussian
wavefunctions, and we suggest possible reasons for this discrepancy. Equivalent
low energy KN potentials for S-wave scattering are also derived. Finally we
consider OGE forces in the related channels K$\Delta$, K$^*$N and K$^*\Delta$,
and determine which have attractive interactions and might therefore exhibit
strong threshold enhancements or ``Z$^*$-molecule" meson-baryon bound states.
We find that the minimum-spin, minimum-isospin channels and two additional
K$^*\Delta$ channels are most conducive to the formation of bound states.
Related interesting topics for future experimental and theoretical studies of
KN interactions are also discussed.
