We study the entanglement creation in the low-energy scattering of two
particles in three dimensions, for a general class of interaction potentials
that are not required to be spherically symmetric. The incoming asymptotic
state, before the collision, is a product of two normalized Gaussian states.
After the scattering the particles are entangled. We take as a measure of the
entanglement the purity of one of them. We provide a rigorous explicit
computation, with error bound, of the leading order of the purity at
low-energy. The entanglement depends strongly in the difference of the masses.
It takes its minimum when the masses are equal, and it increases rapidly with
the difference of the masses. It is quite remarkable that the anisotropy of the
potential gives no contribution to the leading order of the purity, on spite of
the fact that entanglement is a second order effect.
