Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$ and let $\mathcal{L}(G,\lambda)=\sum_{k=0}^n
(-1)^{k}c_{k}(G)\lambda^{n-k}$ be the characteristic polynomial of its
Laplacian matrix. Motivated by Ili\'{c} and Ili\'{c}'s conjecture [A. Ili\'{c},
M. Ili\'{c}, Laplacian coefficients of trees with given number of leaves or
vertices of degree two, Linear Algebra and its Applications
431(2009)2195-2202.] on all extremal graphs which minimize all the Laplacian
coefficients in the set $\mathcal{U}_{n,l}$ of all $n$-vertex unicyclic graphs
with the number of leaves $l$, we investigate properties of the minimal
elements in the partial set $(\mathcal{U}_{n,l}^g, \preceq)$ of the Laplacian
coefficients, where $\mathcal{U}_{n,l}^g$ denote the set of $n$-vertex
unicyclic graphs with the number of leaves $l$ and girth $g$. These results are
used to disprove their conjecture. Moreover, the graphs with minimum
Laplacian-like energy in $\mathcal{U}_{n,l}^g$ are also studied.
