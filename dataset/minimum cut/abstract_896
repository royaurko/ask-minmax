Consider an orientable compact surface in three dimensional Euclidean space
with minimum total absolute curvature. If the Gaussian curvature changes sign
to finite order and satisfies a nondegeneracy condition along closed asymptotic
curves, we show that any other isometric surface differs by at most a Euclidean
motion.
