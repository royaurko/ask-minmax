We study the distribution of the minimum free energy (MFE) for the Turner
model of pseudoknot free RNA secondary structures over ensembles of random RNA
sequences. In particular, we are interested in those rare and intermediate
events of unexpected low MFEs. Generalized ensemble Markov-chain Monte Carlo
methods allow us to explore the rare-event tail of the MFE distribution down to
probabilities like $10^{-70}$ and to study the relationship between the
sequence entropy and structural properties for sequence ensembles with fixed
MFEs. Entropic and structural properties of those ensembles are compared with
natural RNA of the same reduced MFE (z-score).
