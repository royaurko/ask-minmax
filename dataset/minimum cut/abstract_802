Classical transport properties of an electron, moving in plain, in an array
of magnetic antidot has been calculated. The homogeneous magnetic field in
z-direction fills the whole space except of cylinders of radius r_0. The
magnetoresistance shows additional peak and minimum according to pinned orbits
at antidots and to propagating orbits in transport direction, respectively.
