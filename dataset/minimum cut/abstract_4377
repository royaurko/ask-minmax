By measuring the electrical transport properties of superconducting NbN
quarter-wave resonators in direct contact with a helium bath, we have
demonstrated a high-speed and spatially sensitive sensor for the permittivity
of helium. In our implementation a $\sim10^{-3}$ mm$^3$ sensing volume is
measured with a bandwidth of 300 kHz in the temperature range 1.8 to 8.8 K. The
minimum detectable change of the permittivity of helium is calculated to be
$\sim6\times$$10^{-11}$ $\epsilon_0$/Hz$^{1/2}$ with a sensitivity of order
$10^{-13}$ $\epsilon_0$/Hz$^{1/2}$ easily achievable. Potential applications
include operation as a fast, localized helium thermometer and as a transducer
in superfluid hydrodynamic experiments.
