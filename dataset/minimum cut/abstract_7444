Given a finite point set $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, a $k$-ary semi-algebraic
relation $E$ on $P$ is the set of $k$-tuples of points in $P$, which is
determined by a finite number of polynomial equations and inequalities in $kd$
real variables. The description complexity of such a relation is at most $t$ if
the number of polynomials and their degrees are all bounded by $t$. The Ramsey
number $R^{d,t}_k(s,n)$ is the minimum $N$ such that any $N$-element point set
$P$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ equipped with a $k$-ary semi-algebraic relation $E$, such
that $E$ has complexity at most $t$, contains $s$ members such that every
$k$-tuple induced by them is in $E$, or $n$ members such that every $k$-tuple
induced by them is not in $E$.
  We give a new upper bound for $R^{d,t}_k(s,n)$ for $k\geq 3$ and $s$ fixed.
In particular, we show that for fixed integers $d,t,s$, $R^{d,t}_3(s,n) \leq
2^{n^{o(1)}},$ establishing a subexponential upper bound on $R^{d,t}_3(s,n)$.
This improves the previous bound of $2^{n^C}$ due to Conlon, Fox, Pach,
Sudakov, and Suk, where $C$ is a very large constant depending on $d,t,$ and
$s$. As an application, we give new estimates for a recently studied
Ramsey-type problem on hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also study
multi-color Ramsey numbers for triangles in our semi-algebraic setting,
achieving some partial results.
