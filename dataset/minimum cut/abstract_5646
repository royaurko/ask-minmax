We calculate the effects of the spin-lattice coupling on the magnon spectrum
of thin ferromagnetic films consisting of the magnetic insulator yttrium-iron
garnet. The magnon-phonon hybridisation generates a characteristic minimum in
the spin dynamic structure factor which quantitatively agrees with recent
Brillouin light scattering experiments. We also show that at room temperature
the phonon contribution to the magnon damping exhibits a rather complicated
momentum dependence: In the exchange regime the magnon damping is dominated by
Cherenkov type scattering processes, while in the long-wavelength dipolar
regime these processes are subdominant and the magnon damping is two orders of
magnitude smaller. We supplement our calculations by actual measurements of the
magnon relaxation in the dipolar regime. Our theory provides a simple
explanation of a recent experiment probing the different temperatures of the
magnon and phonon gases in yttrium-iron garnet.
