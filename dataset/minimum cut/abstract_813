We define multilevel codes on bipartite graphs that have properties analogous
to multilevel serial concatenations. A decoding algorithm is described that
corrects a proportion of errors equal to half the Blokh-Zyablov bound on the
minimum distance. The error probability of this algorithm has exponent similar
to that of serially concatenated multilevel codes.
