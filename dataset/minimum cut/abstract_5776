Given a labeled graph $H$ with vertex set $\{1, 2,...,n\}$, the ordered
Ramsey number $r_<(H)$ is the minimum $N$ such that every two-coloring of the
edges of the complete graph on $\{1, 2, ...,N\}$ contains a copy of $H$ with
vertices appearing in the same order as in $H$. The ordered Ramsey number of a
labeled graph $H$ is at least the Ramsey number $r(H)$ and the two coincide for
complete graphs. However, we prove that even for matchings there are labelings
where the ordered Ramsey number is superpolynomial in the number of vertices.
Amongst other results, we also prove a general upper bound on ordered Ramsey
numbers which implies that there exists a constant $c$ such that $r_<(H) \leq
r(H)^{c \log^2 n}$ for any graph $H$ on $n$ vertices.
