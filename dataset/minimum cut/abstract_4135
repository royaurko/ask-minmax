The AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and its generalized
version (GARCH) family of models have grown to encompass a wide range of
specifications, each of them is designed to enhance the ability of the model to
capture the characteristics of stochastic data, such as financial time series.
The existing literature provides little guidance on how to select optimal
parameters, which are critical in efficiency of the model, among the infinite
range of available parameters. We introduce a new criterion to find suitable
parameters in GARCH models by using Markov length, which is the minimum time
interval over which the data can be considered as constituting a Markov
process. This criterion is applied to various time series and results support
the known idea that GARCH(1,1) model works well.
