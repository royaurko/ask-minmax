Let $p$ be a positive integer and $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph. A subset
$D\subseteq V$ is a $p$-dominating set if each vertex not in $D$ has at least
$p$ neighbors in $D$. The $p$-domination number $\g_p(G)$ is the minimum
cardinality among all $p$-dominating sets of $G$. The $p$-bondage number
$b_p(G)$ is the cardinality of a smallest set of edges whose removal from $G$
results in a graph with a $p$-domination number greater than the $p$-domination
number of $G$. In this note we determine the 2-domination number $\g_2$ and
2-bondage number $b_2$ for the grid graphs $G_{m,n}=P_m\times P_n$ for $2\leq
m\leq 4$.
