In this article we study percolation on the Cayley graph of a free product of
groups.
  The critical probability $p_c$ of a free product $G_1*G_2*...*G_n$ of groups
is found as a solution of an equation involving only the expected subcritical
cluster size of factor groups $G_1,G_2,...,G_n$. For finite groups these
equations are polynomial and can be explicitly written down. The expected
subcritical cluster size of the free product is also found in terms of the
subcritical cluster sizes of the factors. In particular, we prove that $p_c$
for the Cayley graph of the modular group $\hbox{PSL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ (with the
standard generators) is $.5199...$, the unique root of the polynomial
$2p^5-6p^4+2p^3+4p^2-1$ in the interval $(0,1)$.
  In the case when groups $G_i$ can be "well approximated" by a sequence of
quotient groups, we show that the critical probabilities of the free product of
these approximations converge to the critical probability of $G_1*G_2*...*G_n$
and the speed of convergence is exponential. Thus for residually finite groups,
for example, one can restrict oneself to the case when each free factor is
finite.
  We show that the critical point, introduced by Schonmann, $p_{\mathrm{exp}}$
of the free product is just the minimum of $p_{\mathrm{exp}}$ for the factors.
