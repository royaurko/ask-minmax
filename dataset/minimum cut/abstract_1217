The mean free path of light ($l^*$) calculated for elastic scattering on a
system of nanoparticles with spatially correlated disorder is found to have a
minimum when the correlation length is of the order of the wavelength of light.
For a typical choice of parameters for the scattering system, this minimum mean
free path ($l^*_{min}$) turns out to satisfy the Ioffe-Regel criterion for wave
localization, $l^*_{min} \sim \lambda$, over a range of the correlation length,
defining thus a stop-band for light transmission. It also provides a
semi-phenomenological explanation for several interesting findings reported
recently on the transmission/ reflection and the trapping/storage of light in a
magnetically tunable ferrofluidic system. The subtle effect of structural
anisotropy, induced by the external magnetic field on the scattering by the
medium, is briefly discussed in physical terms of the anisotropic Anderson
localization.
