A sensor network is used for distributed joint mean and variance estimation,
in a single time snapshot. Sensors observe a signal embedded in noise, which
are phase modulated using a constant-modulus scheme and transmitted over a
Gaussian multiple-access channel to a fusion center, where the mean and
variance are estimated jointly, using an asymptotically minimum-variance
estimator, which is shown to decouple into simple individual estimators of the
mean and the variance. The constant-modulus phase modulation scheme ensures a
fixed transmit power, robust estimation across several sensing noise
distributions, as well as an SNR estimate that requires a single set of
transmissions from the sensors to the fusion center, unlike the
amplify-and-forward approach. The performance of the estimators of the mean and
variance are evaluated in terms of asymptotic variance, which is used to
evaluate the performance of the SNR estimator in the case of Gaussian, Laplace
and Cauchy sensing noise distributions. For each sensing noise distribution,
the optimal phase transmission parameters are also determined. The asymptotic
relative efficiency of the mean and variance estimators is evaluated. It is
shown that among the noise distributions considered, the estimators are
asymptotically efficient only when the noise distribution is Gaussian.
Simulation results corroborate analytical results.
