Typical radio pulsars are magnetized neutron stars that are born rapidly
rotating and slow down as they age on time scales of 10 to 100 million years.
However, millisecond radio pulsars spin very rapidly even though many are
billions of years old. The most compelling explanation is that they have been
"spun up" by the transfer of angular momentum during accretion of material from
a companion star in so-called low-mass X-ray binary systems, LMXBs. (LMXBs
consist of a neutron star or black hole accreting from a companion less than
one solar mass.) The recent detection of coherent X-ray pulsations with a
millisecond period from a suspected LMXB system appears to confirm this link.
Here we report observations showing that the orbital period of this binary
system is two hours, which establishes it as an LMXB. We also find an apparent
modulation of the X-ray flux at the orbital period (at the two per cent level),
with a broad minimum when the pulsar is behind this low-mass companion star.
This system seems closely related to the "black widow" millisecond radio
pulsars, which are evaporating their companions through irradiation. It may
appear as an eclipsing radio pulsar during periods of X-ray quiescence.
