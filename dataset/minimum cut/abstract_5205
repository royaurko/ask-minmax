The dynamics of the Jaynes-Cummings interaction of a two-level atom
interacting with a single mode of the radiation field is investigated, as the
state of the field is gradually changed from a coherent state to a squeezed
coherent state. The effect of mild squeezing on the coherent light is shown to
be striking: the photon number distribution gets localized and it peaks
maximally for a particular value of squeezing. The atomic inversion retains its
structure for a longer time. The mean linear entropy shows that the atom has a
tendency to get disentangled from field within the collapse region and also in
the revival region, for mild squeezing. These properties are absent for the
case of a coherent state or for an excessively squeezed coherent state. We also
elucidate a connection between these properties and the photon statistics of
the mildly squeezed coherent state; these states have the minimum variance and
are also maximally sub-Poissonian.
