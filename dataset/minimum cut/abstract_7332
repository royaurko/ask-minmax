Field-induced magnetic ordering in the Haldane chain compound
SrNi$_{2}$V$_{2}$O$_{8}$ and effect of anisotropy have been investigated using
single crystals. Static susceptibility, inelastic neutron scattering,
high-field magnetization, and low temperature heat-capacity studies confirm a
non-magnetic spin-singlet ground state and a gap between the singlet ground
state and triplet excited states. The intra-chain exchange interaction is
estimated to be $J \sim 8.9{\pm}$0.1 meV. Splitting of the dispersions into two
modes with minimum energies 1.57 and 2.58 meV confirms the existence of
single-ion anisotropy $D(S^z){^2}$. The value of {\it D} is estimated to be
$-0.51{\pm}0.01$ meV and the easy axis is found to be along the
crystallographic {\it c}-axis. Field-induced magnetic ordering has been found
with two critical fields [$\mu_0H_c^{\perp c} = 12.0{\pm}$0.2 T and
$\mu_0H_c^{\parallel c} = 20.8{\pm}$0.5 T at 4.2 K]. Field-induced
three-dimensional magnetic ordering above the critical fields is evident from
the heat-capacity, susceptibility, and high-field magnetization study. The
Phase diagram in the {\it H-T} plane has been obtained from the high-field
magnetization. The observed results are discussed in the light of theoretical
predictions as well as earlier experimental reports on Haldane chain compounds.
