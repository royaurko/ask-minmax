The properties of the amplitude method for $\Bs$ oscillation analyses are
studied in detail. The world combination of measured amplitudes is converted
into a likelihood profile as a function of oscillation frequency. A procedure
is proposed to estimate the probability that the minimum observed is due to a
statistical fluctuation. This method, applied to the data available at the time
of 1999 Winter Conferences, gives $1 - CL \approx 0.03$ .
