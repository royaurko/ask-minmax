We present spectral synthesis calculations of the solar extreme UV (EUV) in
spherical symmetry carried out with the 'Solar Modeling in 3D' code. The
calculations are based on one-dimensional atmospheric structures that represent
a temporal and spatial mean of the chromosphere, transition region, and corona.
The synthetic irradiance spectra are compared with the recent calibration
spectrum taken with the EUV Variability Experiment during the Whole
Heliospheric Interval. The good agreement between the synthetic and observed
quiet Sun spectrum shows that the employed atmospheric structures are suitable
for irradiance calculations. The validation of the quiet Sun spectrum for the
present solar minimum is the first step towards the modeling of the EUV
variations.
