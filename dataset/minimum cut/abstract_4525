Goldman and Turaev constructed a Lie bialgebra structure on the free
$\mathbb{Z}$-module generated by free homotopy classes of loops on a surface.
Turaev conjectured that his cobracket $\Delta(\alpha)$ is zero if and only if
$\alpha$ is a power of a simple class. Chas constructed examples that show
Turaev's conjecture is, unfortunately, false. We define an operation $\mu$ in
the spirit of the Andersen-Mattes-Reshetikhin algebra of chord diagrams. The
Turaev cobracket factors through $\mu$, so we can view $\mu$ as a
generalization of $\Delta$. We show that Turaev's conjecture holds when
$\Delta$ is replaced with $\mu$. We also show that $\mu(\alpha)$ gives an
explicit formula for the minimum number of self-intersection points of a loop
in $\alpha$. The operation $\mu$ also satisfies identities similar to the
co-Jacobi and coskew symmetry identities, so while $\mu$ is not a cobracket,
$\mu$ behaves like a Lie cobracket for the Andersen-Mattes-Reshetikhin Poisson
algebra.
