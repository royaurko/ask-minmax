Using 4.68 fb^{-1} of e^+e^- annihilation data collected with the CLEO II
detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) we have studied tau
radiative decays tau -> mu nu nu gamma and tau -> e nu nu gamma. For a 10 MeV
minimum photon energy in the tau rest frame, the branching fraction of
radiative tau decay to a muon or electron is measured to be
(3.61+-0.16+-0.35)*10^{-3} or (1.75+-0.06+-0.17)*10^{-2}, respectively. The
branching fractions are in agreement with the Standard Model theoretical
predictions.
