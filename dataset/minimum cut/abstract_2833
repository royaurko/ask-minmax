11 UMi and HD 32518 belong to a sample of 62 K giant stars that has been
observed since February 2004 using the 2m Alfred Jensch telescope of the
Th\"uringer Landessternwarte (TLS) to measure precise radial velocities (RVs).
The aim of this survey is to investigate the dependence of planet formation on
the mass of the host star by searching for planetary companions around
intermediate-mass giants. An iodine absorption cell was used to obtain accurate
RVs for this study. Our measurements reveal that the RVs of 11 UMi show a
periodic variation of 516.22 days. The RV curve of HD 32518 shows sinusoidal
variations with a period of 157.54 days. The HIPPARCOS photometry as well as
our H\alpha core flux measurements reveal no variability with the RV period.
Thus, Keplerian motion is the most likely explanation for the observed RV
variations for both giant stars. An exoplanet with a minimum mass of 10.5
Jupiter masses orbits the K giant 11 UMi. The K1 III giant HD 32518 hosts a
planetary companion with a minimum mass of 3.0 Jupiter masses in a nearly
circular orbit. These are the 4th and 5th planets published from this TLS
survey.
