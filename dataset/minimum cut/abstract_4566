A necessary and sufficient condition of the possibility of a deterministic
local operations and classical communication (LOCC) transformation of
three-qubit pure states is given. The condition shows that the three-qubit pure
states are a partially ordered set parametrized by five well-known entanglement
parameters and a novel parameter; the five are the concurrences $C_{AB}$,
$C_{AC}$, $C_{BC}$, the tangle $\tau_{ABC}$ and the fifth parameter $J_{5}$ of
Ref. [18], while the other new one is the entanglement charge $Q_{e}$. The
order of the partially ordered set is defined by the possibility of a
deterministic LOCC transformation from a state to another state. In this sense,
the present condition is an extension of Nielsen's work [20] to three-qubit
pure states. We also clarify the rules of transfer and dissipation of the
entanglement which is caused by deterministic LOCC transformations. Moreover,
the minimum number of times of measurements to reproduce an arbitrary
deterministic LOCC transformation between three-qubit pure states is given.
