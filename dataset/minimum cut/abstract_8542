The energy flow created in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV is studied within
the pseudorapidity range 1.9<eta<4.9 with data collected by the LHCb
experiment. The measurements are performed for inclusive minimum-bias
interactions, hard scattering processes and events with an enhanced or
suppressed diffractive contribution. The results are compared to predictions
given by PYTHIA-based and cosmic-ray event generators, which provide different
models of soft hadronic interactions.
