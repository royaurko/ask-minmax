World wide technological advancement has brought in a widespread change in
adoption and utilization of open source tools. Since, most of the organizations
across the globe deal with a large amount of data to be updated online and
transactions are made every second, managing, mining and processing this
dynamic data is very complex. Successful implementation of the data mining
technique requires a careful assessment of the various tools and algorithms
available to mining experts. This paper provides a comparative study of open
source data mining tools available to the professionals. Parameters influencing
the choice of apt tools in addition to the real time challenges are discussed.
However, it is well proven that agents aid in improving the performance of data
mining tools. This paper provides information on an agent-based framework for
data preprocessing with implementation details for the development of better
tool in the market. An integration of open source data mining tools with agent
simulation enable one to implement an effective data pre processing
architecture thereby providing robust capabilities of the application which can
be upgraded using a minimum of pre planning requirement from the application
developer.
