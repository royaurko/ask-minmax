We construct configurations of NS-, D4-, and D6-branes in type IIA string
theory, realizing the recently discussed non-supersymmetric meta-stable minimum
of 4d N=1 SU(N_c) super-Yang-Mills theories with massive flavors. We discuss
their lift to M-theory and the mechanism of pseudo-moduli stabilization. We
extend the construction to many other examples of meta-stable minima, including
the SO/Sp theories, SU(N_c) with matter in two-index tensor representations,
and to a chiral gauge theory.
