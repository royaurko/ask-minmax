Decay of the CO2-dominated atmosphere is an important component of long-term
environmental change on Mars, but direct constraints on paleoatmospheric
pressure P are few. Of particular interest is the climate that allowed rivers
to flow early in Mars history, which was affected by P via direct and indirect
greenhouse effects. The size of craters embedded within ancient layered
sediments is a proxy for P: the smaller the minimum-sized craters that form,
the thinner the past atmosphere. Here we use high-resolution orthophotos and
Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) to identify ancient craters among the river
deposits of Aeolis close to Gale crater, and compare their sizes to models of
atmospheric filtering of impactors by thicker atmospheres. We obtain an upper
limit of P <= 760+/-70 mbar, rising to P <= 1640+/-180 mbar if rimmed circular
mesas are excluded. Our work assumes target properties appropriate for desert
alluvium: if sediment developed bedrock-like rock-mass strength by early
diagenesis, the upper limit increases by a factor of up to 2. If Mars did not
have a stable multibar atmosphere at the time that the rivers were flowing, the
warm-wet CO2 greenhouse of Pollack et al. (1987) is ruled out, and long-term
average temperatures were most likely below freezing.
