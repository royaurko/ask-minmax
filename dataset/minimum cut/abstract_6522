We present a novel supersymmetric solution to a nonlinear sigma model coupled
to supergravity. The solution represents a static, supersymmetric,
codimension-two object, which is different to the familiar cosmic strings. In
particular, we consider 6D chiral gauged supergravity, whose spectrum contains
a number of hypermultiplets. The scalar components of the hypermultiplet are
charged under a gauge field, and supersymmetry implies that they experience a
simple paraboloid-like (or 2D infinite well) potential, which is minimised when
they vanish. Unlike conventional vortices, the energy density of our
configuration is not localized to a string-like core. The solutions have two
timelike singularities in the internal manifold, which provide the necessary
boundary conditions to ensure that the scalars do not lie at the minimum of
their potential. The 4D spacetime is flat, and the solution is a continuous
deformation of the so-called ``rugby ball'' solution, which has been studied in
the context of the cosmological constant problem. It represents an unexpected
class of supersymmetric solutions to the 6D theory, which have gravity, gauge
fluxes and hyperscalars all active in the background.
