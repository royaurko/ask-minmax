Our photometric observations of the symbiotic binary Z And during its recent
(2000 -- 2003) active phase revealed a minimum in the U, B and V light curves
(LC) at the position of the inferior conjunction of its cool component (the
orbital phase 'phi' = 0). This fact and the behaviour of colour indices suggest
that the minimum was due to the eclipse of the active hot object by the red
giant. Physically plausible fit of the eclipse profile and a precise analysis
of the spectral energy distribution (SED) in the ultraviolet continuum suggest
a disk-like structure for the hot object during active phases. The present
knowledge of fundamental parameters of the system limits the orbital
inclination 'i' to 76 - 90 deg. The presence of the Rayleigh attenuated far-UV
continuum at 'phi' around 0 during quiescent phase confirms the very high
inclination of the Z And orbit.
