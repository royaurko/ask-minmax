Based on a recently started programme, we report the first search for
intranight optical variability among radio-quiet weak-line-quasars (RQWLQs).
Eight members of this class were observed on 13 nights in the R-band, such that
each source was monitored continuously at least once for a minimum duration of
about 3.5 hours, using the recently installed 130 cm telescope at Devasthal,
India. Statistical analysis of the differential light curves was carried out
using two versions of the F-test. Based on the INOV data acquired so far, the
radio-quiet WLQ population appears to exhibit stronger INOV activity as
compared to the general population of radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), but similar
to the INOV known for radio-loud quasars of non-blazar type. To improve upon
this early result, as well as extend the comparison to blazars, a factor of ?2
improvement in the INOV detection threshold would be needed. Such efforts are
underway, motivated by the objective to search for the elusive radio-quiet
blazars using INOV observations.
