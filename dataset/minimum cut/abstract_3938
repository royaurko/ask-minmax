We inspect a particular gauge field theory model that describes the
properties of a variety of physical systems, including a charge neutral
two-component plasma, a Gross-Pitaevskii functional of two charged Cooper pair
condensates, and a limiting case of the bosonic sector in the Salam-Weinberg
model. It has been argued that this field theory model also admits stable
knot-like solitons. Here we produce numerical evidence in support for the
existence of these solitons, by considering stable axis-symmetric solutions
that can be thought of as straight twisted vortex lines clamped at the two
ends. We compute the energy of these solutions as a function of the amount of
twist per unit length. The result can be described in terms of a energy
spectral function. We find that this spectral function acquires a minimum which
corresponds to a nontrivial twist per unit length, strongly suggesting that the
model indeed supports stable toroidal solitons.
