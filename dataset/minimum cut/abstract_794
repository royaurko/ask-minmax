From a minimum of total energy of celestial bodies, their basic parameters
are obtained. The steady-state values of the mass, radius, and temperature of
stars and white dwarfs, as well as masses of pulsars are calculated. The
luminosity and giromagnetic ratio of celestial bodies are estimated. All the
obtained values are in a satisfactory agreement with observation data.
