This paper characterizes when a Delone set X is an ideal crystal in terms of
restrictions on the number of its local patches of a given size or on the
hetereogeneity of their distribution. Let N(T) count the number of
translation-inequivalent patches of radius T in X and let M(T) be the minimum
radius such that every closed ball of radius M(T) contains the center of a
patch of every one of these kinds. We show that for each of these functions
there is a `gap in the spectrum' of possible growth rates between being bounded
and having linear growth, and that having linear growth is equivalent to X
being an ideal crystal. Explicitly, for N(T), if R is the covering radius of X
then either N(T) is bounded or N(T) >= T/2R for all T>0. The constant 1/2R in
this bound is best possible in all dimensions. For M(T), either M(T) is bounded
or M(T) >= T/3 for all T>0. Examples show that the constant 1/3 in this bound
cannot be replaced by any number exceeding 1/2. We also show that every
aperiodic Delone set X has M(T) >= c(n)T for all T>0, for a certain constant
c(n) which depends on the dimension n of X and is greater than 1/3 when n > 1.
