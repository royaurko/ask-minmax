Knots and links have been considered to be useful models for structural
analysis of molecular chains such as DNA and proteins. One quantity that we are
interested on molecular links is the minimum number of monomers necessary to
realize them. In this paper we consider every link in the cubic lattice.
Lattice stick number $s_L(L)$ of a link $L$ is defined to be the minimal number
of sticks required to construct a polygonal representation of the link in the
cubic lattice. Huh and Oh found all knots whose lattice stick numbers are at
most 14. They proved that only the trefoil knot $3_1$ and the figure-8 knot
$4_1$ have lattice stick numbers 12 and 14, respectively. In this paper we find
all links with more than one component whose lattice stick numbers are at most
14. Indeed we prove combinatorically that $s_L(2^2_1)=8$, $s_L(2^2_1 \sharp
2^2_1)=s_L(6^3_2)=s_L(6^3_3)=12$, $s_L(4^2_1)=13$, $s_L(5^2_1)=14$ and any
other non-split links have stick numbers at least 15.
