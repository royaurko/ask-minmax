A study of Underlying Events (UE) and Minimum Bias (MB) at Large Hadron
Collider (LHC)with CMS and ATLAS detector under nominal conditions is
discussed. Using charged particle and charged particle jets, it will be
possible to discriminate between various QCD models with different multiple
parton interaction schemes, which correctly reproduce Tevatron data but give
different predictions when extrapolated to the LHC energy. This will permit
improving and tuning Monte Carlo models at LHC start-up, and opens prospects
for exploring QCD dynamics in proton-proton collisions at 14TeV.
