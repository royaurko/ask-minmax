In this paper we investigate the decoding of parallel turbo codes over the
binary erasure channel suited for upper-layer error correction. The proposed
algorithm performs on-the-fly decoding, i.e. it starts decoding as soon as the
first symbols are received. This algorithm compares with the iterative decoding
of codes defined on graphs, in that it propagates in the trellises of the turbo
code by removing transitions in the same way edges are removed in a bipartite
graph under message-passing decoding. Performance comparison with LDPC codes
for different coding rates is shown.
