In this paper we prove the existence of two solutions having a prescribed
$L^2$-norm for a quasi-linear Schr\"odinger equation. One of these solutions is
a mountain pass solution relative to a constraint and the other one a minimum
either local or global. To overcome the lack of differentiability of the
associated functional, we rely on a perturbation method developed in [27].
