Industry reliability rules increasingly require utilities to study and
mitigate cascading failure risk in their system. Motivated by this, this paper
describes how cascading failure risk, in terms of expected blackout size,
varies with power system load level and pre-contingency dispatch. We used Monte
Carlo sampling of random branch outages to generate contingencies, and a model
of cascading failure to estimate blackout sizes. The risk associated with
different blackout sizes was separately estimated in order to separate small,
medium, and large blackout risk. Results from $N-1$ secure models of the IEEE
RTS case and a 2383 bus case indicate that blackout risk does not always
increase with load level monotonically, particularly for large blackout risk.
The results also show that risk is highly dependent on the method used for
generator dispatch. Minimum cost methods of dispatch can result in larger long
distance power transfers, which can increase cascading failure risk.
