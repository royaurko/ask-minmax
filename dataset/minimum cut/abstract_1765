We consider a minimum uncertainty vacuum choice at a fixed energy scale
Lambda as an effective description of trans-Planckian physics, and discuss its
implications for the linear perturbations of a massless scalar field in
power-law inflationary models. We find possible effects with a magnitude of
order H/\Lambda in the power spectrum, in analogy with previous results for
de-Sitter space-time.
