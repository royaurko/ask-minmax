Continuous control over azimuthal flow and shear in the edge of the Large
Plasma Device (LAPD) has been achieved using a biasable limiter which has
allowed a careful study of the effect of flow shear on pressure-gradient-driven
turbulence and transport in LAPD. LAPD rotates spontaneously in the ion
diamagnetic direction (IDD); positive limiter bias first reduces, then
minimizes (producing a near-zero shear state), and finally reverses the flow
into the electron diamagnetic direction (EDD). Degradation of particle
confinement is observed in the minimum shearing state and reduction in
turbulent particle flux is observed with increasing shearing in both flow
directions. Near-complete suppression of turbulent particle flux is observed
for shearing rates comparable to the turbulent autocorrelation rate measured in
the minimum shear state. Turbulent flux suppression is dominated by amplitude
reduction in low-frequency ($<10$kHz) density fluctuations. An increase in
fluctuations for the highest shearing states is observed with the emergence of
a coherent mode which does not lead to net particle transport. The variations
of density fluctuations are fit well with power-laws and compare favorably to
simple models of shear suppression of transport.
