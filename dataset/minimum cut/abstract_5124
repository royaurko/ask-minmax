The role of thermal pressure fluctuations in the ejection of tightly packaged
DNA from protein capsid shells is discussed in a model calculation. At
equilibrium before ejection we assume the DNA is folded many times into a
bundle of parallel segments that forms an equilibrium conformation at minimum
free energy, which presses tightly against internal capsid walls. Using a
canonical ensemble at temperature T we calculate internal pressure fluctuations
against a slowly moving or static capsid mantle for an elastic continuum model
of the folded DNA bundle. It is found that fluctuating pressure on the capsid
mantle from thermal excitation of longitudinal acoustic vibrations in the
bundle may have root-mean-square values which are several tens of atmospheres
for typically small phage dimensions.
