We have obtained echelle spectra with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the
MgII 2800A region of ten stars whose metallicities range from 1/300 to 1/3 that
of the Sun, and whose space velocities suggest a halo or old thick-disk origin.
Spectra of all ten show double-peaked emission in the MgII core, very much like
the quiet Sun. A half-dozen non-rotating stars were observed more than once,
and show at most a low level of variability in the emission flux, comparable to
that of quiet stars of solar metallicity. For four stars, we have obtained
Lyman-alpha spectra at 0.2A resolution; all four show emission. The data thus
strongly suggest that chromospheric activity at a minimum level is present in
all stars of near-solar temperature, regardless of age or metallicity. While
this points to non-magnetic sources such as acoustic waves, a contribution from
globally-organized magnetic fields is possible at a low level. We plan a longer
series of MgII and Lyman alpha observations to constrain this.
