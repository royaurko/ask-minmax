The rank modulation scheme has been proposed for efficient writing and
storing data in non-volatile memory storage. Error-correction in the rank
modulation scheme is done by considering permutation codes. In this paper we
consider codes in the set of all permutations on $n$ elements, $S_n$, using the
Kendall's $\tau$-metric. We prove that there are no perfect
single-error-correcting codes in $S_n$, where $n>4$ is a prime or $4\leq n\leq
10$. We also prove that if such a code exists for $n$ which is not a prime then
the code should have some uniform structure. We define some variations of the
Kendall's $\tau$-metric and consider the related codes and specifically we
prove the existence of a perfect single-error-correcting code in $S_5$.
Finally, we examine the existence problem of diameter perfect codes in $S_n$
and obtain a new upper bound on the size of a code in $S_n$ with even minimum
Kendall's $\tau$-distance.
