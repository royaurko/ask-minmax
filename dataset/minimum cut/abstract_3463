We have measured the electrical resistivity ($\rho$) and the thermoelectric
power (TEP) of the perchlorate (ClO4^-) doped stretch oriented polyacetylene
(PA) film. For the highly conducting samples ($\sigma_{RT} > 41000 S/cm$), the
temperature dependence of the 4-probe resistivity shows positive temperature
coefficient of resistivity (TCR) from T=1.5K to 300K. For the less conducting
samples, the 4-probe resistivity data show the crossover of TCR with a broad
minimum peak at T=T* > 200K. For samples of $\sigma_{RT}$$>$20000 S/cm, the
$\rho (1.5K)/\rho (300K) <1$, i.e., the resistivity at 1.5K is lower than the
room temperature resistivity value. The temperature dependence of the TEP shows
diffusive linear metallic TEP becoming temperature independent below 40K.
Unlike the others who used Cu(ClO_4)_2 for the ClO_4^- doping, the initial
doping material we used is anhydrous Fe(ClO_4)_3 which is crucial to obtain the
positive TCR from T=1.5K to 300K.
