A behavior of imaginary and real parts of the high-energy elastic hadron
scattering amplitude is examined in the diffraction region. It is shown that
the interference between Coulomb and hadronic scattering at small momentum
transfers and especially in the region of diffractive minimum can bring some
information about the structure of the hadron spin-non-flip amplitude.
