We illustrate the possibility of light trapping and funneling in periodic
arrays of metallic nanoparticles. A controllable minimum in the transmission
spectra of such constructs arises from a collective plasmon resonance
phenomenon, where an incident plane wave sharply localizes in the vertical
direction, remaining delocalized in the direction parallel to the crystal
plane. Using hybrid arrays of different structures or different materials, we
apply the trapping effect to structure the eigen-mode spectrum, introduce
overlapping resonances, and hence direct the light in space in a
wavelength-sensitive fashion.
