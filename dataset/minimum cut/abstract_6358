We present the results of applying a percolation algorithm to the initial
release of the Two Micron All-Sky Survey Extended Source Catalog, using
subsequently measured redshifts for almost all of the galaxies with K < 11.25
mag. This group catalog is based on the first near-IR all-sky flux-limited
survey that is complete to |b| = 5 deg. We explore the dependence of the
clustering on the length and velocity scales involved. The paper describes a
group catalog, complete to a limiting redshift of 10,000 km/s, created by
maximizing the number of groups containing 3 or more members. A second catalog
is also presented, created by requiring a minimum density contrast of 80 to
identify groups. We identify known nearby clusters in the catalogs and contrast
the groups identified in the two catalogs. We examine and compare the
properties of the determined groups and verify that the results are consistent
with the UZC-SSRS2 and northern CfA redshift survey group catalogs. The all-sky
nature of the catalog will allow the development of a flow-field model based on
the density field inferred from the estimated cluster masses.
