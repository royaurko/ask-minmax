We have completed a Chandra snapshot survey of 54 radio jets that are
extended on arcsec scales. These are associated with flat spectrum radio
quasars spanning a redshift range z=0.3 to 2.1. X-ray emission is detected from
the jet of approximately 60% of the sample objects. We assume minimum energy
and apply conditions consistent with the original Felten-Morrison calculations
in order to estimate the Lorentz factors and the apparent Doppler factors. This
allows estimates of the enthalpy fluxes, which turn out to be comparable to the
radiative luminosities.
