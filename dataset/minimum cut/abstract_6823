A previous study of the dynamical generation of masses in massless QCD is
considered from another viewpoint. The quark mass is assumed to have a
dynamical origin and is substituted by a scalar field without self-interaction.
The potential for the new field background is evaluated up to two loops.
Expressing the running coupling in terms of the scale parameter $\mu$, the
potential minimum is chosen to fix $m_{top}=175$ $GeV$ when $\mu_0=498 $ $MeV$.
The second derivative of the potential predicts a scalar field mass of 126.76
$GeV$. This number is close to the value 114 $GeV$ which, preliminary data
taken at CERN, suggested to be associated with the Higgs particle. However, the
simplifying assumptions limit the validity of the calculations done, as
indicated by the large value of $\alpha=\frac {g^2}{4\pi}=1.077 $ obtained.
However, supporting statements about the possibility of improving the scheme
come from the necessary inclusion of weak and scalar field couplings and mass
counterterms in the renormalization procedure, in common with the seemingly
needed consideration of the massive W and Z fields, if the real conditions of
the SM model are intended to be approached.
