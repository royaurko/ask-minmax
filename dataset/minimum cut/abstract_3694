Dynamics of reentry are studied in a one dimensional loop of model cardiac
cells with discrete intercellular gap junction resistance ($R$). Each cell is
represented by a continuous cable with ionic current given by a modified
Beeler-Reuter formulation. For $R$ below a limiting value, propagation is found
to change from period-1 to quasi-periodic ($QP$) at a critical loop length
($L_{crit}$) that decreases with $R$. Quasi-periodic reentry exists from
$L_{crit}$ to a minimum length ($L_{min}$) that is also shortening with $R$.
The decrease of $L_{crit}(R)$ is not a simple scaling, but the bifurcation can
still be predicted from the slope of the restitution curve giving the duration
of the action potential as a function of the diastolic interval. However, the
shape of the restitution curve changes with $R$.
