The phase transition of the electroweak vacuum induced by a strong magnetic
field is examined, and a connection is made with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of
type-II superconductivity. For solutions of the exact nonlinear field equations
of the electroweak theory with lattice periodicity in directions perpendicular
to the magnetic field, it is proven that, likewise, each lattice cell must
enclose an integer number of quanta of magnetic flux. Close to the lower
critical magnetic field, a perturbative method developed by MacDowell and the
contributor is used to study properties of the lattice solutions. Analytical
expressions for observables are obtained in terms of a complex parameter $\tau$
specifying the lattice and it is shown that the triangular Abrikosov solution
constitutes a local minimum of the energy provided $M_H > M_Z$.
