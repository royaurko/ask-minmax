Motivated by Bonahon's result for hyperbolic surfaces, we construct an
analogue of the Patterson-Sullivan-Bowen-Margulis map from the Culler-Vogtmann
outer space $CV(F_k)$ into the space of projectivized geodesic currents on a
free group. We prove that this map is a topological embedding. We also prove
that for every $k\ge 2$ the minimum of the volume entropy of the universal
covers of finite connected volume-one metric graphs with fundamental group of
rank $k$ and without degree-one vertices is equal to $(3k-3)\log 2$ and that
this minimum is realized by trivalent graphs with all edges of equal lengths,
and only by such graphs.
