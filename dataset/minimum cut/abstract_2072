In numerous positional games the identity of the winner is easily determined.
In this case one of the more interesting questions is not {\em who} wins but
rather {\em how fast} can one win. These type of problems were studied earlier
for Maker-Breaker games; here we initiate their study for unbiased
Avoider-Enforcer games played on the edge set of the complete graph $K_n$ on
$n$ vertices. For several games that are known to be an Enforcer's win, we
estimate quite precisely the minimum number of moves Enforcer has to play in
order to win. We consider the non-planarity game, the connectivity game and the
non-bipartite game.
