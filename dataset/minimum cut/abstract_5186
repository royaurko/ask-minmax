We report unfiltered CCD photometry of the eclipsing dwarf nova SDSS
J093249.57+472523.0 obtained during its first confirmed outburst in 2011 March.
The outburst amplitude was at least 3.0 magnitudes above mean quiescence and it
lasted at least 11 days, although we missed the beginning of the outburst.
Superhumps having peak-to-peak amplitude up to 0.3 magnitudes were present
during the outburst, thereby establishing it to be a member of the SU UMa
family. The mean superhump period was Psh = 0.06814(11) d. Analysis of our
measurements of eclipse times of minimum, supplemented with data from other
researchers, allowed us to measure the orbital period as Porb = 0.06630354(5)
d. The superhump period excess was epsilon = 0.028(1) which is consistent with
of SU UMa systems of similar Porb. The FWHM eclipse duration varied between 6
and 13 mins and the eclipse depth was up to 1.6 magnitudes.
