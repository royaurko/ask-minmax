The dynamics of microphase separation and the orientation of lamellae in
diblock copolymers is investigated in terms of a mean-field model. The
formation of lamellar structures and their stable states are explored and it is
shown that lamellae are stable not only for the period of the structure
corresponding to the minimum of the free energy. The range of wavelengths of
stable lamellae is determined by a functional approach, introduced with this
work, which is in agreement with the results of a linear stability analysis.
The effects of the interaction of block copolymers with confining plane
boundaries on the lamellae orientation are studied by an extensive analysis of
the free energy. By changing the surface property at one boundary, a transition
from a preferentially perpendicular to a parallel lamellar orientation with
respect to the boundaries is found, which is rather independent of the distance
between the boundaries. Computer simulations reveal, that the time scale of the
lamellar orientational order dynamics, which is quantitatively characterized in
terms of an orientational order parameter and the structure factor, depends
significantly on the properties of the confining boundaries as well as on the
quench depth.
