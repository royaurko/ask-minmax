We have studied imposing the condition that the Standard Model effective
Higgs potential should have two approximately degenerate vacua, such that the
vacuum we live in is just barely metastable: the one in which we live has a
vacuum expectation value of 246 GeV and the other one should have a vacuum
expectation value of order the Planck scale. Alone borderline metastability
gives, using the experimental top quark mass 173.1 \pm 4.6 GeV, the Higgs mass
prediction 121.8 \pm 11 GeV. The requirement that the second minimum be at the
Planck scale already gave the prediction 173\pm 4 GeV for the top quark mass
according to our 1995 paper.
