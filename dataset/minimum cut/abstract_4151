We perform a quantitative analysis of the cooling dynamics of three-level
atomic systems interacting with two distinct lasers. Employing sparse-matrix
techniques, we find numerical solutions to the fully quantized master equation
in steady state. Our method allows straightforward determination of
laser-cooling temperatures without the ambiguity often accompanied by
semiclassical calculations, and more quickly than non-sparse techniques. Our
calculations allow us to develop an understanding of the regimes of cooling, as
well as a qualitative picture of the mechanism, related to the phenomenon of
electromagnetically induced transparency. Effects of the induced asymmetric
Fano-type lineshapes affect the detunings required for optimum cooling, as well
as the predicted minimum temperatures which can be lower than the Doppler limit
for either transition.
