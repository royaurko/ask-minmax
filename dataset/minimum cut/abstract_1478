Fluctuation measurements of event-wise mean transverse momentum $\langle p_t
\rangle$ for p-p and Pb-Pb collisions at the large hadron collider (LHC) have
been reported recently. In that study it was concluded that the strength of
"nonstatistical" $\langle p_t \rangle$ fluctuations decreases with increasing
particle multiplicity $n_{ch}$ (or A-A centrality) and is nearly independent of
collision energy over a large interval. Among several potential mechanisms for
those trends onset of thermalization and collectivity are mentioned. The LHC
analysis employed one fluctuation measure selected from several possibilities.
An alternative fluctuation measure reveals strong increase of $p_t$
fluctuations with $n_{ch}$ (or A-A centrality) and collision energy, consistent
with previous measurements at the relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC). The
$p_t$ fluctuation data for LHC p-p collisions can be described accurately by a
two-component (soft+hard) model (TCM) in which the hard component represents
dijet production. The data for Pb-Pb collisions are described accurately by a
TCM reference for more-peripheral collisions (suggesting transparent
collisions), but the data deviate quantitatively from the reference for
more-central collisions suggesting modification of jet formation. Overall
fluctuation data trends suggest that minimum-bias jets (minijets) dominate
$p_t$ fluctuations at both the LHC and RHIC.
