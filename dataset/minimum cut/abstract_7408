We present a study of the Galactic Center region as a possible source of both
secondary gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from annihilating dark matter. We have
studied the gamma-ray flux observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System
(HESS) from the J1745-290 Galactic Center source. The data are well fitted as
annihilating dark matter in combination with an astrophysical background. The
analysis was performed by means of simulated gamma spectra produced by Monte
Carlo event generators packages. We analyze the differences in the spectra
obtained by the various Monte Carlo codes developed so far in particle physics.
We show that, within some uncertainty, the HESS data can be fitted as a signal
from a heavy dark matter density distribution peaked at the Galactic Center,
with a power-law for the background with a spectral index which is compatible
with the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) data from the same region. If this
kind of dark matter distribution generates the gamma-ray flux observed by HESS,
we also expect to observe a neutrino flux. We show prospective results for the
observation of secondary neutrinos with the Astronomy with a Neutrino Telescope
and Abyss environmental RESearch project (ANTARES), Ice Cube Neutrino
Observatory (Ice Cube) and the Cubic Kilometer Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT).
Prospects solely depend on the device resolution angle when its effective area
and the minimum energy threshold are fixed.
