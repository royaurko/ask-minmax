The recent paucity of sunspots and the delay in the expected start of Solar
Cycle 24 have drawn attention to the challenges involved in predicting solar
activity. Traditional models of the solar cycle usually require information
about the starting time and rise time as well as the shape and amplitude of the
cycle. With this tutorial, we investigate the variations in the length of the
sunspot number cycle and examine whether the variability can be explained in
terms of a secular pattern. We identified long-term cycles in archival data
from 1610 - 2000 using median trace analyses of the cycle length and power
spectrum analyses of the (O-C) residuals of the dates of sunspot minima and
maxima. Median trace analyses of data spanning 385 years indicate a cycle
length with a period of 183 - 243 years, and a power spectrum analysis
identifies a period of 188 $\pm$ 38 years. We also find a correspondence
between the times of historic minima and the length of the sunspot cycle, such
that the cycle length increases during the time when the number of spots is at
a minimum. In particular, the cycle length was growing during the Maunder
Minimum when almost no sunspots were visible on the Sun. Our study suggests
that the length of the sunspot number cycle should increase gradually, on
average, over the next $\sim$75 years, accompanied by a gradual decrease in the
number of sunspots. This information should be considered in cycle prediction
models to provide better estimates of the starting time of each cycle.
