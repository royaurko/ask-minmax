Using a Tsallis nonextensive approach, we simultaneously analyze recent data
obtained by the LHC ATLAS experiment on distributions of transverse momenta of
jets, p_T^{jet}, together with distributions of transverse momenta of particles
produced within these jets (defined relative to the jet's axis), p_T^{rel}, and
their multiplicity distributions, P(N). The respective nonextensivity
parameters for distributions of jets, q_{jet}, for distributions of particles
in jets, q_{rel} and the global nonextensivity parameter obtained from P(N),
q_N, were then compared with nonextensivity parameters q obtained from minimum
bias pp collisions at energies corresponding to the energies of these jets. The
values of the corresponding nonextensivity parameters were found to be similar,
strongly indicating the existence of a common mechanism behind all these
processes. We tentatively identify this as a self-similarity property known to
be present there and resulting in Tsallis type distributions. If confirmed,
this would considerably strengthen the nonextensive Tsallis approach.
