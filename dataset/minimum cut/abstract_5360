It is shown that viscoelastic wave dispersion and attenuation in a
viscoelastic medium with a completely monotonic relaxation modulus is
completely characterized by the phase speed and the dispersion-attenuation
spectral measure. The dispersion and attenuation functions are expressed in
terms of a single dispersion-attenuation spectral measure. An alternative
expression of the mutual dependence of the dispersion and attenuation
functions, known as the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation, is also derived
from the theory. The minimum phase aspect of the filters involved in the
Green's function is another consequence of the theory. Explicit integral
expressions for the attenuation and dispersion functions are obtained for a few
analytical relaxation models.
