We present a numerical method for solving the Poisson equation on a nested
grid. The nested grid consists of uniform grids having different grid spacing
and is designed to cover the space closer to the center with a finer grid. Thus
our numerical method is suitable for computing the gravity of a centrally
condensed object. It consists of two parts: the difference scheme for the
Poisson equation on the nested grid and the multi-grid iteration algorithm. It
has three advantages: accuracy, fast convergence, and scalability. First it
computes the gravitational potential of a close binary accurately up to the
quadraple moment, even when the binary is resolved only in the fine grids.
Second residual decreases by a factor of 300 or more by each iteration. We
confirmed experimentally that the iteration converges always to the exact
solution of the difference equation. Third the computation load of the
iteration is proportional to the total number of the cells in the nested grid.
Thus our method gives a good solution at the minimum expense when the nested
grid is large. The difference scheme is applicable also to the adaptive mesh
refinement in which cells of different sizes are used to cover a domain of
computation.
