We introduce a highly structured family of hard satisfiable 3-SAT formulas
corresponding to an ordered spin-glass model from statistical physics. This
model has provably "glassy" behavior; that is, it has many local optima with
large energy barriers between them, so that local search algorithms get stuck
and have difficulty finding the true ground state, i.e., the unique satisfying
assignment. We test the hardness of our formulas with two Davis-Putnam solvers,
Satz and zChaff, the recently introduced Survey Propagation (SP), and two local
search algorithms, Walksat and Record-to-Record Travel (RRT). We compare our
formulas to random 3-XOR-SAT formulas and to two other generators of hard
satisfiable instances, the minimum disagreement parity formulas of Crawford et
al., and Hirsch's hgen. For the complete solvers the running time of our
formulas grows exponentially in sqrt(n), and exceeds that of random 3-XOR-SAT
formulas for small problem sizes. SP is unable to solve our formulas with as
few as 25 variables. For Walksat, our formulas appear to be harder than any
other known generator of satisfiable instances. Finally, our formulas can be
solved efficiently by RRT but only if the parameter d is tuned to the height of
the barriers between local minima, and we use this parameter to measure the
barrier heights in random 3-XOR-SAT formulas as well.
