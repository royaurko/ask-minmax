Every classical or virtual knot is equivalent to the unknot via a sequence of
extended Reidemeister moves and the so-called forbidden moves. The minimum
number of forbidden moves necessary to unknot a given knot is an invariant we
call the {\it forbidden number}. We relate the forbidden number to several
known invariants, and calculate bounds for some classes of virtual knots.
