In order to study the vortex pinning determined by artificially introduced
pinning centers in the small-vortex displacement regime, we measured the
microwave surface impedance at 47.7 GHz in the mixed state of
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films, where sub-micrometric BaZrO$_3$
particles have been incorporated. As a function of the BaZrO$_3$ content, we
observe that the absolute losses slightly decrease up to a BaZrO$_3$ content of
5%, and then increase. We found that the magnetic-field-induced losses behave
differently, in that they are not monotonic with increasing BaZrO$_3$
concentration: at small concentration (2.5%) the field-induced losses increase,
but large reduction of the losses themselves, by factors up to 3, is observed
upon further increasing the BaZrO$_3$ concentration in the target up to 7%.
Using measurements of both surface resistance and surface reactance we estimate
vortex pinning-related parameters. We find that BaZrO$_3$ inclusions introduce
deep and steep pinning wells. In particular, the minimum height of the energy
barrier for single vortices is raised. At larger BaZrO$_3$ content (5% and 7%)
the phenomenon is at its maximum, but it is unclear whether it shows a
saturation or not, thus leaving room for further improvements.
