An interpolation-based decoding scheme for interleaved subspace codes is
presented. The scheme can be used as a (not necessarily polynomial-time) list
decoder as well as a probabilistic unique decoder. Both interpretations allow
to decode interleaved subspace codes beyond half the minimum subspace distance.
Further, an efficient interpolation procedure for the required linearized
multivariate polynomials is presented and a computationally- and
memory-efficient root-finding algorithm for the probabilistic unique decoder is
proposed. These two efficient algorithms can also be applied for accelerating
the decoding of interleaved Gabidulin codes.
