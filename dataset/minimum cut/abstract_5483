The ability to transport energy is a fundamental property of the
two-dimensional Dirac fermions in graphene. Electronic thermal transport in
this system is relatively unexplored and is expected to show unique fundamental
properties and to play an important role in future applications of graphene,
including opto-electronics, plasmonics, and ultra-sensitive bolometry. Here we
present measurements of bipolar, electron-diffusion and electron-phonon thermal
conductances, and infer the electronic specific heat, with a minimum value of
10 $k_{\rm{B}}$ ($10^{-22}$ JK$^{-1}$) per square micron. We test the validity
of the Wiedemann-Franz law and find the Lorenz number equals
$1.32\times(\pi^2/3)(k_{\rm{B}}/e)^2$. The electron-phonon thermal conductance
has a temperature power law $T^2$ at high doping levels, and the coupling
parameter is consistent with recent theory, indicating its enhancement by
impurity scattering. We demonstrate control of the thermal conductance by
electrical gating and by suppressing the diffusion channel using
superconducting electrodes, which sets the stage for future graphene-based
single microwave photon detection.
