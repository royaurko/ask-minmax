Using the Planetary Camera on board the Hubble Space Telescope we have
measured the projected separation of the binary components in the nucleus of
the planetary nebula Abell 35 to be larger than 0.08 arcsecs but less than 0.14
arcsecs. The system was imaged in three filters centered at 2950, 3350 and 5785
Ang. The white dwarf primary star responsible for ionizing the nebula is half
as bright as its companion in the 2950 Ang filter causing the source to be
visibly elongated. The 3350 Ang setting, on the other hand, shows no elongation
as a result of the more extreme flux ratio. The F300W data allows the
determinination of the binary's projected separation. At the minimum distance
of 160 parsec to the system, our result corresponds to 18+/-5 AU. This outcome
is consistent with the wind accretion induced rapid rotation hypothesis, but
cannot be reconciled with the binary having emerged from a common-envelope
phase.
