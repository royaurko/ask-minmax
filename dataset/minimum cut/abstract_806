A gaseous Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) irradiated by a far off-resonance
laser has long-range interatomic correlations caused by laser-induced
dipole-dipole interactions. These correlations, which are tunable via the laser
intensity and frequency, can produce a `roton' minimum in the excitation
spectrum--behavior reminiscent of the strongly correlated superfluid liquid
helium II.
