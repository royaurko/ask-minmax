In 2013, the present contributors introduced the altermatic number and the strong
altermatic number of graphs and showed that they provide tight lower bounds for
the chromatic number. In this paper, we consider Hedetniemi's conjecture (1966)
which asserts that the chromatic number of the Categorical product of two
graphs is equal to the minimum of their chromatic numbers. A family of graphs
is tight if Hedetniemi's conjecture holds for any two graphs of this family. By
topological methods, it has earlier been shown that the family of Schrijver
graphs and also the iterated Mycielskian of Schrijver graphs are tight. We
prove some relaxation versions of Hedetniemi's conjecture for the altermatic
number and the strong altermatic number. As a consequence, we enrich the
aforementioned tight family to other graphs such as a large family of Kneser
multigraphs, matching graphs, permutation graphs, and the iterated Mycielskian
of any such graphs.
  Moreover, by presenting a generalization of Gale's lemma, we show that the
altermatic number and the storng altermatic number provide tight lower bounds
for some well-known topological parameters attached to graphs via the
Borsuk-Ulam theorem.
