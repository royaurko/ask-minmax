We have performed numerical simulations on a pure electron plasma system
under a strong magnetic field, in order to examine quasi-stationary states that
the system eventually evolves into. We use ring states as the initial states,
changing the width, and find that the system evolves into a vortex crystal
state from a thinner-ring state while a state with a single-peaked density
distribution is obtained from a thicker-ring initial state. For those
quasi-stationary states, density distribution and macroscopic observables are
defined on the basis of a coarse-grained density field. We compare our results
with experiments and some statistical theories, which include the
Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics, Tsallis statistics, the fluid entropy theory, and
the minimum enstrophy state. From some of those initial states, we obtain the
quasi-stationary states which are close to the minimum enstrophy state, but we
also find that the quasi-stationary states depend upon initial states, even if
the initial states have the same energy and angular momentum, which means the
ergodicity does not hold.
