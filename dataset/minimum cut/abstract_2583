We categorise coherent band (aka nullification) pathways between knots and
2-component links. Additionally, we characterise the minimal coherent band
pathways (with intermediates) between any two knots or 2-component links with
small crossing number. We demonstrate these band surgeries for knots and links
with small crossing number. We apply these results to place lower bounds on the
minimum number of recombinant events separating DNA configurations, restrict
the recombination pathways and determine chirality and/or orientation of the
resulting recombinant DNA molecules.
