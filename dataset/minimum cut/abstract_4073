The Comment of Gazdzicki and Heinz is flawed because their assumed baryon
stopping power in $pA$ is inconsistent with data and because they ignored half
the analysis based on the VENUS model. The Comment continues the misleading
presentation of strangeness enhancement by focusing on ratios of integrated
yields. Those ratios discard essential experimental information on the rapidity
dependence of produced $\Lambda$ and obscure discrepancies between different
data sets. Our conclusion remains that the NA35 minimum bias data on
$p+S\rightarrow\Lambda +X $ indicate an anomalous enhancement of central
rapidity strangeness in few nucleon reactions that points to non-equilibrium
dynamics as responsible for strangeness enhancement in nuclear reactions.
