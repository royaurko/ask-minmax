We report the structural and electron transport properties of 3R-Nb_{1+x}S_2
(x >= .07) and 3R-Ga_xNbS_2 (.1 <= x <= .33) prepared as polycrystalline
pellets as well as single crystals grown by vapour transport. We observe a
resistance minimum in these compounds between 20-60 K, with the T_min
proportional to x. The resistance scales as rho/rho_min(T/T_min) between .2 <
T/T_min < 2 for different phases with x <= .25 whose resistivity differs by an
order of magnitude. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) also shows progressively
increasing intensity of superlattice lines with cation concentration. The
thermopower changes sign around the resistance minimum. The explanation of the
resistance minimum and the simultaneous rapid suppression of superconductivity
is sought in e-e scattering effects in the presence of cation disorder in these
narrow band anisotropic materials.
