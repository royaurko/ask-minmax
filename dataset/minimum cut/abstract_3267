We present a Chandra observation of Abell 2052, a cooling flow cluster with a
central cD that hosts the complex radio source 3C 317. The data reveal
``holes'' in the X-ray emission that are coincident with the radio lobes. The
holes are surrounded by bright ``shells'' of X-ray emission. The data are
consistent with the radio source displacing and compressing, and at the same
time being confined by, the X-ray gas. The compression of the X-ray shells
appears to have been relatively gentle and, at most, slightly transonic. The
pressure in the X-ray gas (the shells and surrounding cooler gas) is
approximately an order of magnitude higher than the minimum pressure derived
for the radio source, suggesting that an additional source of pressure is
needed to support the radio plasma. The compression of the X-ray shells has
speeded up the cooling of the shells, and optical emission line filaments are
found coincident with the brightest regions of the shells.
