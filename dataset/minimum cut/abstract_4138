As shown in the previous publications, the shape of the histograms
constructed by measurements of alpha-activity of samples of Pu-239, changes
with periods equal approximately 24 hours, 27 days, and a year. At a higher
resolution each of these periods splits as a minimum in two components: daily
period consists of two: sidereal day (1436 minutes) and solar day (1440
minutes), 27-days period splits in 2 to 3 "sub-periods", and the yearly period
appears to be a join of "calendar" period (which is equal to 1440 x 365 =
525600 minutes) and "solar" period (equal to [(1440 x 365) + 369] =525969
minutes). In the present paper results of more detailed research of this
phenomenon are offered.
