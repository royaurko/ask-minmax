We discuss electric transport and orbital magnetism of multilayer graphenes
in a weak-magnetic field using the matrix decomposition technique. At zero
temperature, the minimum conductivity is given by that of the monolayer system
multiplied by the layer number $N$, independent of the interlayer hopping $t$.
When the interlayer hopping satisfies the condition $t\gg \hbar/\tau$ with
$\tau$ being collision time of impurity scattering, $[N/2]$ kinks and $[N/2]+1$
plateaux appear in the Fermi-energy (gate voltage) dependence of the
conductivity and the Hall conductivity, respectively. These behaviors are
interpreted as multiband effects. We also found that the Hall conductivity and
the magnetic susceptibility take minimum value as a function of temperature,
for certain value of the gate voltage. This behavior is explained by
Fermi-energy dependence of these functions at zero temperature.
