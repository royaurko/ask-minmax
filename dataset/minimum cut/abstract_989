The ground states of the Bernasconi model are binary +1/-1 sequences of
length N with low autocorrelations. We introduce the notion of perfect
sequences, binary sequences with one-valued off-peak correlations of minimum
amount. If they exist, they are ground states. Using results from the
mathematical theory of cyclic difference sets, we specify all values of N for
which perfect sequences do exist and how to construct them. For other values of
N, we investigate almost perfect sequences, i.e. sequences with two-valued
off-peak correlations of minimum amount. Numerical and analytical results
support the conjecture that almost perfect sequences do exist for all values of
N, but that they are not always ground states. We present a construction for
low-energy configurations that works if N is the product of two odd primes.
