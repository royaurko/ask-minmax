Let $F$ be a graph which contains an edge whose deletion reduces its
chromatic number. For such a graph $F,$ Simonovits proved there exists a
constant $n_0=n_0(F)$ such that every graph on $n>n_0$ vertices with more than
$\frac{\chi(F)-2}{\chi(F)-1}\cdot \frac{n^2}{2}$ edges contains a copy of $F$.
In this paper we derive a similar theorem for multipartite graphs.
  For a graph $H$ and an integer $\ell \geq v(H)$, let $d_{\ell}(H)$ be the
minimum real number such that every $\ell$-partite graph whose edge density
between any two parts is greater than $d_{\ell}(H)$ contains a copy of $H$. Our
main contribution is to show $d_{\ell}(H)=\frac{\chi(H)-2}{\chi(H)-1}$ for
large enough $\ell$ depending solely on $H$ if and only if $H$ has a coloring
with $\chi(H)-1$ colors such that all color classes but one are independent
sets, and the exceptional class induces just a matching. When $H$ is a clique,
this recovers a result of Pfender. We also consider several extensions of
Pfender's result.
