We compare reaction-diffusion processes of the $A+A\to 0$ type on scale-free
networks created with either the configuration model or the uncorrelated
configuration model. We show via simulations that except for the difference in
the behavior of the two models, different results are observed within the same
model when the minimum number of connections for a node varies from $k_{\rm
min}=1$ to $k_{\rm min}=2$. This difference is attributed to the varying local
properties of the two systems. In all cases we are able to identify a power law
behavior of the density decay with time with an exponent $f>1$, considerably
larger than its lattice counterpart.
