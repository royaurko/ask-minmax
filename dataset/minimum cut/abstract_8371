The hunt for Earth analogue planets orbiting Sun-like stars has forced the
introduction of novel methods to detect signals at, or below, the level of the
intrinsic noise of the observations. We present a new global periodogram method
that returns more information than the classic Lomb-Scargle periodogram method
for radial velocity signal detection. Our method uses the Minimum Mean Squared
Error as a framework to determine the optimal number of genuine signals present
in a radial velocity timeseries using a global search algorithm, meaning we can
discard noise spikes from the data before follow-up analysis. This method also
allows us to determine the phase and amplitude of the signals we detect,
meaning we can track these quantities as a function of time to test if the
signals are stationary or non-stationary. We apply our method to the radial
velocity data for GJ876 as a test system to highlight how the phase information
can be used to select against non-stationary sources of detected signals in
radial velocity data, such as rotational modulation of star spots. Analysis of
this system yields two new statistically significant signals in the combined
Keck and HARPS velocities with periods of 10 and 15 days. Although a planet
with a period of 15 days would relate to a Laplace resonant chain configuration
with three of the other planets (8:4:2:1), we stress that follow-up dynamical
analyses are needed to test the reliability of such a six planet system.
