The 3-phase version of the hybrid chiral bag model, containing the phase of
asymptotic freedom, the hadronization phase as well as the intermediate phase
of constituent quarks, is proposed. For this model the self-consistent
solutions, which take into account the fermion vacuum polarization effects, are
found in 1+1 D. The renormalized total energy of the bag is studied as a
function of its geometry and topological (baryon) number. It is shown that in
the case of non-zero topological charge there exists a set of configurations
being the local minima of the total energy of the bag and containing all the
three phases, while in the non-topological case the minimum of the total energy
of the bag corresponds to vanishing size of the phase of asymptotic freedom.
