We have introduced excluded volume effect, which is an important factor to
model a realistic pedestrian queue, into queueing theory. The probability
distributions of pedestrian number and pedestrian waiting time in a queue have
been calculated exactly. Due to time needed to close up the queue, the mean
number of pedestrians increases as pedestrian arrival probability ($\lambda$)
and leaving probability ($\mu$) increase even if the ratio between them (i.e.,
$\rho=\lambda/\mu$) remains constant. Furthermore, at a given $\rho$, the mean
waiting time does not increase monotonically with the service time (which is
inverse to $\mu$), a minimum could be reached instead.
