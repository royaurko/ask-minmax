A new electronic structure principle, viz. the minimum magnetizability
principle (MMP) has been proposed and also has been verified through ab initio
calculations, to extend the domain of applicability of the conceptual density
functional theory (DFT) in explaining the magnetic interactions and
magnetochemistry. This principle may be stated as, "A stable
configuration/conformation of a molecule or a favorable chemical process is
associated with a minimum value of the magnetizability". It has also been shown
that a soft molecule is easily polarizable and magnetizable than a hard one.
