Short range correlations are introduced using unitary correlation method in a
relativistic approach to the equation of state of the infinite nuclear matter
in the framework of the Hartree-Fock approximation. It is shown that the
correlations give rise to an extra node in the ground-state wave-function in
the nucleons, contrary to what happens in non-relativistic calculations with a
hard core. The effect of the correlations in the ground state properties of the
nuclear matter and neutron matter is studied. The nucleon effective mass and
equation of state (EOS) are very sensitive to short range correlations. In
particular, if the pion contact term is neglected a softening of the EOS is
predicted. Correlations have also an important effect on the neutron matter EOS
which presents no binding but only a very shallow minimum contrary to the
Walecka model.
