We notice that Haynes-Hedetniemi-Slater Conjecture is true (i.e. $\gamma(G)
\leq \frac{\delta}{3\delta -1}n$ for every graph $G$ of size $n$ with minimum
degree $\delta \geq 4$, where $\gamma(G)$ is the domination number of $G$).
Because the conjecture for $\delta =6$ follows from the estimate n (1 -
\prod_{i= 1}^[\delta + 1} (\delta i)/(\delta i + 1) by W. E. Clark, B.
