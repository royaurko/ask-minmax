It is believed that there may have been a large number of black holes formed
in the very early universe. These would have quantised masses. A charged
``elementary black hole'' (with the minimum possible mass) can capture
electrons, protons and other charged particles to form a ``black hole atom''.
We find the spectrum of such an object with a view to laboratory and
astronomical observation of them, and estimate the lifetime of the bound
states. There is no limit to the charge of the black hole, which gives us the
possibility of observing Z>137 bound states and transitions at the lower
continuum. Negatively charged black holes can capture protons. For Z>1, the
orbiting protons will coalesce to form a nucleus (after beta-decay of some
protons to neutrons), with a stability curve different to that of free nuclei.
In this system there is also the distinct possibility of single quark capture.
This leads to the formation of a coloured black hole that plays the role of an
extremely heavy quark interacting strongly with the other two quarks. Finally
we consider atoms formed with much larger black holes.
