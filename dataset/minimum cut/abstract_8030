PHENIX has measured the e^+e^- pair continuum in sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV Au+Au and
p+p collisions over a wide range of mass and transverse momenta. The e^+e^-
yield is compared to the expectations from hadronic sources, based on PHENIX
measurements. In the intermediate mass region, between the masses of the phi
and the J/psi meson, the yield is consistent with expectations from correlated
c^bar-c production, though other mechanisms are not ruled out. In the low mass
region (below the phi) the p+p inclusive mass spectrum is well described by
known contributions from light meson decays. In contrast, the Au+Au minimum
bias inclusive mass spectrum in this region shows an enhancement by a factor of
4.7+/-0.4(stat)+/-1.5(syst)+/-0.9(model) At low mass (m_ee<0.3 GeV/c^2) and
high p_T (1<p_T<5 GeV/c) an enhanced e^+e^- pair yield is observed that is
consistent with production of virtual direct photons. This excess is used to
infer the yield of real direct photons. In central Au+Au collisions, the excess
of the direct photon yield over the p+p is exponential in p_T, with inverse
slope T=221+/-19(stat)+/-19(syst) MeV. Hydrodynamical models with initial
temperatures ranging from T_init ~=300--600 MeV at times of 0.6--0.15 fm/c
after the collision are in qualitative agreement with the direct photon data in
Au+Au. For low p_T<1 GeV/c the low mass region shows a further significant
enhancement that increases with centrality and has an inverse slope of T ~=100
MeV. Theoretical models under predict the low mass, low p_T enhancement.
