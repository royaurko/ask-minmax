Dark matter has been recognized as an essential part of matter for over 70
years now, and many suggestions have been made, what it could be. Most of these
ideas have centered on Cold Dark Matter, particles that are predicted in
extensions of standard particle physics, such as supersymmetry. Here we explore
the concept that dark matter is sterile neutrinos, particles that are commonly
referred to as Warm Dark Matter. Such particles have keV masses, and decay over
a very long time, much longer than the Hubble time. In their decay they produce
X-ray photons which modify the ionization balance in the very early universe,
increasing the fraction of molecular Hydrogen, and thus help early star
formation. Sterile neutrinos may also help to understand the baryon-asymmetry,
the pulsar kicks, the early growth of black holes, the minimum mass of dwarf
spheroidal galaxies, as well as the shape and smoothness of dark matter halos.
As soon as all these tests have been made quantitative in their various
parameters, we may focus on the creation mechanism of these particles, and
could predict the strength of the sharp X-ray emission line, expected from any
large dark matter assembly. A measurement of this X-ray emission line would be
definitive proof for the existence of may be called weakly interacting
neutrinos, or WINs.
