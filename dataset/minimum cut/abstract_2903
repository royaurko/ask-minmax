The active K2 dwarf epsilon Eri has been extensively characterized, both as a
young solar analog and more recently as an exoplanet host star. As one of the
nearest and brightest stars in the sky, it provides an unparalleled opportunity
to constrain stellar dynamo theory beyond the Sun. We confirm and document the
3 year magnetic activity cycle in epsilon Eri originally reported by Hatzes and
coworkers, and we examine the archival data from previous observations spanning
45 years. The data show coexisting 3 year and 13 year periods leading into a
broad activity minimum that resembles a Maunder minimum-like state, followed by
the resurgence of a coherent 3 year cycle. The nearly continuous activity
record suggests the simultaneous operation of two stellar dynamos with cycle
periods of 2.95+/-0.03 years and 12.7+/-0.3 years, which by analogy with the
solar case suggests a revised identification of the dynamo mechanisms that are
responsible for the so-called "active" and "inactive" sequences as proposed by
Bohm-Vitense. Finally, based on the observed properties of epsilon Eri we argue
that the rotational history of the Sun is what makes it an outlier in the
context of magnetic cycles observed in other stars (as also suggested by its Li
depletion), and that a Jovian-mass companion cannot be the universal
explanation for the solar peculiarities.
