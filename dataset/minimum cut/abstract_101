Using molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the ability of an
analytical three-dimensional double well in reproducing static and dynamic
anomalies found experimentally in liquid water. We find anomalous behavior in
the stable region of the phase diagram if the outer minimum is deeper than the
inner minimum. In the case of a deeper inner minimum, anomalous behavior is
also present but inside the unstable region.
