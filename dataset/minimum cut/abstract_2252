Genuine multipartite correlations in finite-size XY chains are studied as a
function of the applied external magnetic field. We find that, for low
temperatures, multipartite correlations are sensitive to the parity change in
the Hamiltonian ground state, given that they exhibit a minimum every time that
the ground state becomes degenerate. This implies that they can be used to
detect the factorizing point, that is, the value of the external field such
that, in the termodynamical limit, the ground state becomes the tensor product
of single-spin states.
