The magnetic properties of annealed, epitaxial Ga0.93Mn0.07As layers under
tensile and compressive stress have been investigated by X-band (9GHz) and
Q-band (35GHz) ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. From the analysis of
the linewidths of the uniform mode spectra the FMR Gilbert damping factor
"alpha" has been determined. At T=4K we obtain a minimum damping factor of
"alpha" = 0.003 for the compressively stressed layer. Its value is not
isotropic. It has a minimum value for the easy axes orientations of the
magnetic field and increases with the measuring temperature. Its average value
is for both type of films of the order of 0.01 in spite of strong differences
in the inhomogeneous linewidth which vary between 20 Oe and 600 Oe for the
layers grown on GaAs and GaInAs substrates respectively.
