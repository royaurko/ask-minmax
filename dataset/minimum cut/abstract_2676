We prove localization and probabilistic bounds on the minimum level spacing
for a random block Anderson model without monotonicity. Using a sequence of
narrowing energy windows and associated Schur complements, we obtain detailed
probabilistic information about the microscopic structure of energy levels of
the Hamiltonian, as well as the support and decay of eigenfunctions.
