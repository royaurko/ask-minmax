This paper presents a new control, namely additive-state-decomposition
dynamic inversion stabilized control, that is used to stabilize a class of
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems subject to nonparametric time-varying
uncertainties with respect to both state and input. By additive state
decomposition and a new definition of output, the considered uncertain system
is transformed into a minimum-phase uncertainty-free system with relative
degree one, in which all uncertainties are lumped into a new disturbance at the
output. Subsequently, dynamic inversion control is applied to reject the lumped
disturbance. Performance analysis of the resulting closed-loop dynamics shows
that the stability can be ensured. Finally, to demonstrate its effectiveness,
the proposed control is applied to two existing problems by numerical
simulation. Furthermore, in order to show its practicability, the proposed
control is also performed on a real quadrotor to stabilize its attitude when
its inertia moment matrix is subject to a large uncertainty.
