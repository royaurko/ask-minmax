In this paper we derive analytically the evolution equation of the interface
for a model of surface growth with relaxation to the minimum (SRM) in complex
networks. We were inspired by the disagreement between the scaling results of
the steady state of the fluctuations between the discrete SRM model and the
Edward-Wilkinson process found in scale-free networks with degree distribution
$ P(k) \sim k^{-\lambda}$ for $\lambda <3$ [Pastore y Piontti {\it et al.},
Phys. Rev. E {\bf 76}, 046117 (2007)]. Even though for Euclidean lattices the
evolution equation is linear, we find that in complex heterogeneous networks
non-linear terms appear due to the heterogeneity and the lack of symmetry of
the network; they produce a logarithmic divergency of the saturation roughness
with the system size as found by Pastore y Piontti {\it et al.} for $\lambda
<3$.
