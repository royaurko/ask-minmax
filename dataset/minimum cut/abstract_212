A new atomic cluster structure corresponding to the global minimum of the
98-atom Lennard-Jones cluster has been found using a variant of the
basin-hopping global optimization algorithm. The new structure has an unusual
tetrahedral symmetry with an energy of -543.665361, which is 0.022404 lower
than the previous putative global minimum. The new LJ_98 structure is of
particular interest because its tetrahedral symmetry establishes it as one of
only three types of exceptions to the general pattern of icosahedral structural
motifs for optimal LJ microclusters. Similar to the other exceptions the global
minimum is difficult to find because it is at the bottom of a narrow funnel
which only becomes thermodynamically most stable at low temperature.
