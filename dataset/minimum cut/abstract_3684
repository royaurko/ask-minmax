We investigate the possible binding configurations of pairs of C60 molecules
when pushed against each other. Tersoff potential, which represents
intramolecular interactions well, has been used to calculate potential
energies. We begin relaxation of atomic coordinates at various distances of
separation and for all possible mutual orientations of the two molecules. As a
result, we have been able to show that several minimum energy configurations
exist. Some of these configurations have not been reported earlier. Only two
types of dimer structures, involving interlinkage through a single bond, or
through so called 2+2 cycloaddition, have been commonly referred in the
literature. Our calculation shows that apart from these configurations, many
interesting composite phases also result, such as fused and peanut structures
and (5,5) and (10,0) nanotubes. A link with experiment to find these structures
can be established by application of suitable critical applied pressure in the
solid phase, accompanied by high temperature corresponding to orientational
melting so that suitable mutual orientations are available. High energy
molecular beams of C60 incident upon C60 layers could also achieve the same.
