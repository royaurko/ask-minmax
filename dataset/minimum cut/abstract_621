We first prove that for every vertex x of a 4-connected graph G there exists
a subgraph H in G isomorphic to a subdivision of the complete graph K4 on four
vertices such that G-V(H) is connected and contains x. This implies an
affirmative answer to a question of W. Kuehnel whether every 4-connected graph
G contains a subdivision H of K4 as a subgraph such that G-V(H) is connected.
The motor for our induction is a result of Fontet and Martinov stating that
every 4-connected graph can be reduced to a smaller one by contracting a single
edge, unless the graph is the square of a cycle or the line graph of a cubic
graph. It turns out that this is the only ingredience of the proof where
4-connectedness is used. We then generalize our result to connected graphs of
minimum degree at least 4, by developing the respective motor: A structure
theorem for the class of simple connected graphs of minimum degree at least 4.
