Coordinated checkpointing is an effective fault tolerant technique in
distributed system as it avoids the domino effect and require minimum storage
requirement. Most of the earlier coordinated checkpoint algorithms block their
computation during checkpointing and forces minimum-process or non-blocking but
forces all nodes to takes checkpoint even though many of them may not be
necessary or non-blocking minimum-process but takes useless checkpoints or
reduced useless checkpoint but has higher synchronization message overhead or
has high checkpoint request propagation time. Hence in mobile distributed
systems there is a great need of minimizing the number of communication message
and checkpointing overhead as it raise new issues such as mobility, low
bandwidth of wireless channels, frequently disconnections, limited battery
power and lack of reliable stable storage on mobile nodes. In this paper, we
propose a minimum-process coordinated checkpointing algorithm for mobile
distributed system where no useless checkpoints are taken, no blocking of
processes takes place and enforces a minimum-number of processes to take
checkpoints. Our algorithm imposes low memory and computation overheads on MH's
and low communication overheads on wireless channels. It avoids awakening of an
MH if it is not required to take its checkpoint and has reduced latency time as
each process involved in a global checkpoint can forward its own decision
directly to the checkpoint initiator.
