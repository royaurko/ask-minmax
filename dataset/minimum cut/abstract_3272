Starting in 1999, the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) has monitored the
central bulge region of the Galaxy with the Proportional Counter Array (PCA),
resolving about 50 binary X-ray sources, including 18 sources discovered by
RXTE and BeppoSAX. The accretion rates that RXTE observed from these sources
ranged from highs approaching Eddington limits to lows that may correspond to
mass exchange for a binary period near the minimum of 80 minutes. Several
neutron star binaries with low peak luminosity have outburst or cycle
time-scales which are shorter than those of brighter and better known
counterparts. We compare the characteristics of the binaries with low rates of
mass exchange to predictions of their evolution.
