We compute the expectations of the squares of the electric and magnetic
fields in the vacuum region outside a half-space filled with a uniform
dispersive dielectric. We find a positive energy density of the electromagnetic
field which diverges at the interface despite the inclusion of dispersion in
the calculation. We also investigate the mean squared fields and the energy
density in the vacuum region between two parallel half-spaces. Of particular
interest is the sign of the energy density. We find that the energy density is
described by two terms: a negative position independent (Casimir) term, and a
positive position dependent term with a minimum value at the center of the
vacuum region. We argue that in some cases, including physically realizable
ones, the negative term can dominate in a given region between the two
half-spaces, so the overall energy density can be negative in this region.
