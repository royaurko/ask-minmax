At the TeV scale, heavy quarks, for example the 4th generation quarks of the
Standard Model with four generations, can form condensates which dynamically
break the electroweak symmetry. A dense quark system may form other types of
condensates which dynamically break the Lorentz symmetry. These condensates are
described by a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type effective action, similar to the quark
condensation models in hadronic matter with finite density. The vacua
corresponding to these two types of condensates compete for the global minimum
of the effective potential, depending on the energy scale and the related
strong dynamics. The resultant Goldstone gauge boson may produce observable
effects in relativistic heavy-ion colliders.
