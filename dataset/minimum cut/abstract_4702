The edit distance between two graphs on the same labeled vertex set is the
size of the symmetric difference of the edge sets. The distance between a
graph, $G$, and a hereditary property, ${\cal H}$, is the minimum of the
distance between $G$ and each $G'\in{\cal H}$. The edit distance function of
${\cal H}$ is a function of $p\in[0,1]$ and is the limit of the maximum
normalized distance between a graph of density $p$ and ${\cal H}$.
  This paper develops a method, called localization, for computing the edit
distance function of various hereditary properties. For any graph $H$, ${\rm
Forb}(H)$ denotes the property of not having an induced copy of $H$. This paper
gives some results regarding estimation of the function for an arbitrary
hereditary property. This paper also gives the edit distance function for ${\rm
Forb}(H)$, where $H$ is a cycle on 9 or fewer vertices.
