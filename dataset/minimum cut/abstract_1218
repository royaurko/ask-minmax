It is shown that the R-parity violating decays of the lighter top squarks
(${\widetilde t}_1$) triggered by the lepton number violating couplings
$\lambda^{\prime}_{i33}$, where the lepton family index i = 1-3, can be
observed at the LHC via the dilepton di-jet channel even if the coupling is as
small as 10$^{-4}$ or 10$^{-5}$, which is the case in several models of
neutrino mass, provided it is the next lightest supersymmetric particle(NLSP)
the lightest neutralino being the lightest supersymmetric particle(LSP). We
have first obtained a fairly model independent estimate of the minimum
observable value of the parameter ($P_{ij} \equiv BR(\widetilde t \to l_i^+ b)
\times BR(\widetilde t^* \to l_j^- \bar b$)) at the LHC for an integrated
luminosity of 10fb$^{-1}$ as a function of $\mlstop$ by a standard Pythia based
analysis. We have then computed the parameter $P_{ij}$ in several
representative models of neutrino mass constrained by the neutrino oscillation
data and have found that the theoretical predictions are above the estimated
minimum observable levels for a wide region of the parameter space.
