Minimum numbers decide e.g. whether a given map f: S^m --> S^n/G from a
sphere into a spherical space form can be deformed to a map f' such that f(x)
not equal f'(x) for all x in S^m. In this paper we compare minimum numbers to
(geometrically defined) Nielsen numbers (which are more computable). In the
stable dimension range these numbers coincide. But already in the first
nonstable range (when m=2n-2) the Kervaire invariant appears as a decisive
additional obstruction which detects interesting geometric coincidence
phenomena. Similar results (involving e.g. Hopf invariants, taken mod 4) are
obtained in the next seven dimension ranges (when 1<m-2n+3<9). The
selfcoincidence context yields also a precise geometric criterion for the open
question whether the Kervaire invariant vanishes on the 126-stem or not.
