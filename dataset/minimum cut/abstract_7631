The Of?p star CPD -28 2561 was monitored at high energies with XMM-Newton and
HST. In X-rays, this magnetic oblique rotator displays bright and hard emission
that varies by ~55% with rotational phase. These changes occur in phase with
optical variations, as expected for magnetically confined winds; there are two
maxima and two minima in X-rays during the 73d rotational period of CPD -28
2561. However, contrary to previously studied cases, no significant hardness
variation is detected between minima and maxima, with the exception of the
second minimum which is slightly distinct from the first one. In the UV domain,
broad-band fluxes remain stable while line profiles display large variations.
Stronger absorptions at low velocities are observed when the magnetic equator
is seen edge-on, which can be reproduced by a detailed 3D model. However, a
difference in absorption at high velocities in the CIV and NV lines is also
detected for the two phases where the confined wind is seen nearly pole-on.
This suggests the presence of strong asymmetries about the magnetic equator,
mostly in the free-flowing wind (rather than in the confined dynamical
magnetosphere).
