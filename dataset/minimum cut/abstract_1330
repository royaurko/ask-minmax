We derive estimates of the Babu\u{s}ka-Brezzi inf-sup constant $\beta$ for
two-dimensional incompressible flow in a periodic channel with one flat
boundary and the other given by a periodic, Lipschitz continuous function $h$.
If $h$ is a constant function (so the domain is rectangular), we show that
periodicity in one direction but not the other leads to an interesting
connection between $\beta$ and the unitary operator mapping the Fourier sine
coefficients of a function to its Fourier cosine coefficients. We exploit this
connection to determine the dependence of $\beta$ on the aspect ratio of the
rectangle. We then show how to transfer this result to the case that $h$ is
$C^{1,1}$ or even $C^{0,1}$ by a change of variables. We avoid non-constructive
theorems of functional analysis in order to explicitly exhibit the dependence
of $\beta$ on features of the geometry such as the aspect ratio, the maximum
slope, and the minimum gap thickness (if $h$ passes near the substrate). We
give an example to show that our estimates are optimal in their dependence on
the minimum gap thickness in the $C^{1,1}$ case, and nearly optimal in the
Lipschitz case.
