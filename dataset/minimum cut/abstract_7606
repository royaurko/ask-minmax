A prototype of Multi-strip Multi-gap Resistive Plate chamber (MMRPC) with
active area 40 cm $\times$ 20 cm has been developed at SINP, Kolkata. Detailed
response of the developed detector was studied with the pulsed electron beam
from ELBE at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf. In this report the response
of SINP developed MMRPC with different controlling parameters is described in
details. The obtained time resolution ($\sigma_t$) of the detector after slew
correction was 91.5$ \pm $3 ps. Position resolution measured along ($\sigma_x$)
and across ($\sigma_y$) the strip was 2.8$\pm$0.6 cm and 0.58 cm, respectively.
The measured absolute efficiency of the detector for minimum ionizing particle
like electron was 95.8$\pm$1.3 $\%$. Better timing resolution of the detector
can be achieved by restricting the events to a single strip. The response of
the detector was mainly in avalanche mode but a few percentage of streamer mode
response was also observed. A comparison of the response of these two modes
with trigger rate was studied
