We report the discovery of a new planet candidate orbiting the subgiant star
HD118203 with a period of P=6.1335 days. The best Keplerian solution yields an
eccentricity e=0.31 and a minimum mass m2sin(i)=2.1MJup for the planet. This
star has been observed with the ELODIE fiber-fed spectrograph as one of the
targets in our planet-search programme biased toward high-metallicity stars,
on-going since March 2004 at the Haute-Provence Observatory. An analysis of the
spectroscopic line profiles using line bisectors revealed no correlation
between the radial velocities and the line-bisector orientations, indicating
that the periodic radial-velocity signal is best explained by the presence of a
planet-mass companion. A linear trend is observed in the residuals around the
orbital solution that could be explained by the presence of a second companion
in a longer-period orbit. We also present here our orbital solution for another
slightly evolved star in our metal-rich sample, HD149143, recently proposed to
host a 4-d period Hot Jupiter by the N2K consortium. Our solution yields a
period P=4.09 days, a marginally significant eccentricity e=0.08 and a
planetary minimum mass of 1.36MJup. We checked that the shape of the spectral
lines does not vary for this star as well.
