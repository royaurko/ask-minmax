Dijet cross sections as functions of several jet observables are measured in
photoproduction using the H1 detector at HERA. The data sample comprises e^+p
data with an integrated luminosity of 34.9 pb^(-1). Jets are selected using the
inclusive k_T algorithm with a minimum transverse energy of 25 GeV for the
leading jet. The phase space covers longitudinal proton momentum fraction x_p
and photon longitudinal momentum fraction x_gamma in the ranges 0.05<x_p<0.6
and 0.1<x_gamma<1. The predictions of next-to-leading order perturbative QCD,
including recent photon and proton parton densities, are found to be compatible
with the data in a wide kinematical range.
