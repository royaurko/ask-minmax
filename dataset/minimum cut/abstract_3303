We have obtained FUSE spectra of sigma Her, a nearby binary system, with a
main sequence primary, that has a Vega-like infrared excess. We observe
absorption in the excited fine structure lines C II* at 1037 A, N II* at 1085
A, and N II** at 1086 A that are blueshifted by as much as ~30 km/sec with
respect to the star. Since these features are considerably narrower than the
stellar lines and broader than interstellar features, the C II and N II are
circumstellar. We suggest that there is a radiatively driven wind, arising from
the circumstellar matter, rather than accretion as occurs around beta Pic,
because of sigma Her's high luminosity. Assuming that the gas is liberated by
collisions between parent bodies at 20 AU, the approximate distance at which
blackbody grains are in radiative equilibrium with the star and at which 3-body
orbits become unstable, we infer dM/dt ~ 6 * 10^-12 M_{sun}/yr. This wind
depletes the minimum mass of parent bodies in less than the estimated age of
the system.
