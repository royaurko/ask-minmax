A singular point of a smooth map F: M -> N of manifolds is a point in M at
which the rank of the differential dF is less than the minimum of dimensions of
M and N. The classical invariant of the set S of singular points of F of a
given type is defined by taking the fundamental class [\bar{S}]\in H_*(M) of
the closure of S. We introduce and study new invariants of singular sets for
which the classical invariants may not be defined, i.e., for which \bar{S} may
not possess the fundamental class. The simplest new invariant is defined by
carefully choosing the fundamental class of the intersection of \bar{S} and its
slight perturbation in M. Surprisingly, for certain singularity types such an
invariant is well-define (and not trivial) despite the fact that \bar{S} does
not possess the fundamental class.
  We determine new invariants for maps with Morin singularities---i.e.,
singularities of types A_k for k>0 in the ADE-classification of simple
singularities by Dynkin diagrams---and, as an application, show that these
invariants together with generalized Miller-Morita-Mumford classes form a
commutative graded algebra of characteristic classes that completely determine
the cobordism groups of maps with at most A_k-singularities for each k>0.
