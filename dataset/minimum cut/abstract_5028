The pt-differential production cross sections of the prompt (B feed-down
subtracted) charmed mesons D0, D+, and D*+ in the rapidity range |y|<0.5, and
for transverse momentum 1< pt <12 GeV/c, were measured in proton-proton
collisions at sqrt(s) = 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron
Collider. The analysis exploited the hadronic decays D0 -> K pi, D+ -> K pi pi,
D*+ -> D0 pi, and their charge conjugates, and was performed on a L_{int} = 1.1
nb^{-1} event sample collected in 2011 with a minimum-bias trigger. The total
charm production cross section at sqrt(s) = 2.76 TeV and at 7 TeV was evaluated
by extrapolating to the full phase space the pt-differential production cross
sections at sqrt(s) = 2.76 TeV and our previous measurements at sqrt(s) = 7
TeV. The results were compared to existing measurements and to perturbative-QCD
calculations. The fraction of cdbar D mesons produced in a vector state was
also determined.
