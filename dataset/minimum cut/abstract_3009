Current trends in parallel processors call for the design of efficient
massively parallel algorithms for scientific computing. Parallel algorithms for
Monte Carlo simulations of thermodynamic ensembles of particles have received
little attention because of the inherent serial nature of the statistical
sampling. In this paper, we present a massively parallel method that obeys
detailed balance and implement it for a system of hard disks on the GPU. We
reproduce results of serial high-precision Monte Carlo runs to verify the
method. This is a good test case because the hard disk equation of state over
the range where the liquid transforms into the solid is particularly sensitive
to small deviations away from the balance conditions. On a Tesla K20, our GPU
implementation executes over one billion trial moves per second, which is 148
times faster than on a single Intel Xeon E5540 CPU core, enables 27 times
better performance per dollar, and cuts energy usage by a factor of 13. With
this improved performance we are able to calculate the equation of state for
systems of up to one million hard disks. These large system sizes are required
in order to probe the nature of the melting transition, which has been debated
for the last forty years. In this paper we present the details of our
computational method, and discuss the thermodynamics of hard disks separately
in a companion paper.
