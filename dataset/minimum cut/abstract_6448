The performance of a parallel algorithm in a very large scale grid is
significantly influenced by the underlying Internet protocols and
inter-connectivity. Many grid programming platforms use TCP due to its
reliability, usually with some optimizations to reduce its costs. However, TCP
does not perform well in a high bandwidth and high delay network environment.
On the other hand, UDP is the fastest protocol available because it omits
connection setup process, acknowledgments and retransmissions sacrificing
reliable transfer. Many new bulk data transfer schemes using UDP for data
transmission such as RBUDP, Tsunami, and SABUL have been introduced and shown
to have better performance compared to TCP. In this paper, we consider the use
of UDP and examine the relationship between packet loss and speedup with
respect to the number of grid nodes. Our measurement suggests that packet loss
rates between 5%-15% on average are not uncommon between PlanetLab nodes that
are widely distributed over the Internet. We show that transmitting multiple
copies of same packet produces higher speedup. We show the minimum number of
packet duplication required to maximize the possible speedup for a given number
of nodes using a BSP based model. Our work demonstrates that by using an
appropriate number of packet copies, we can increase performance of parallel
program.
