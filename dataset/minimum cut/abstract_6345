We present the precise radial velocity (RV) data for the metal-rich star HD
45350 collected with the Harlan J. Smith (HJS) 2.7 m telescope and the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at McDonald Observatory. This star was noticed by
us as a candidate for having a giant planetary companion in a highly eccentric
orbit, but the lack of data close to periastron left the amplitude and thus
mass of the planet poorly constrained. Marcy et al. (2005) announced the
presence of the planet based on their Keck/HIRES data, but those contributors also
cautioned that the remaining uncertainties in the orbital solution might be
large due to insufficient data near periastron passage. In order to close this
phase gap we exploited the flexible queue scheduled observing mode of the HET
to obtain intensive coverage of the most recent periastron passage of the
planet. In combination with the long term data from the HJS 2.7 m telescope we
determine a Keplerian orbital solution for this system with a period of 962
days, an eccentricity of e=0.76 and a velocity semi-amplitude K of 57.4 m/s.
The planet has a minimum mass of m sin i = 1.82 +- 0.14 M_Jup and an orbital
semi-major axis of a = 1.92 +-0.07 AU.
