Linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector has been shown to alleviate
the noise amplification problem, resulting in the conventional zero-forcing
(ZF) detector. In this paper, we analyze the performance improvement by the
MMSE detector in terms of the condition number of its filtering matrix, and in
terms of the post-precessing signal to noise ratio (SNR) improvement. To this
end, we derive explicit formulas for the condition numbers of the filtering
matrices and the post-processing SNRs. Analytical and simulation results
demonstrate that the improvement achieved by the MMSE detector over the ZF
detector is not only dependent on the noise variance and the condition number
of the channel matrix, but also on how close the smallest singular values are
to the noise variance.
