We derive the differential equation governing the asymptotic quasi-stationary
states of the two dimensional plasma immersed in a strong confining magnetic
field and of the planetary atmosphere. These two systems are related by the
property that there is an intrinsic constant length: the Larmor radius and
respectively the Rossby radius and a condensate of the vorticity field in the
unperturbed state related to the cyclotronic gyration and respectively to the
Coriolis frequency. Although the closest physical model is the
Charney-Hasegawa-Mima (CHM) equation, our model is more general and is related
to the system consisting of a discrete set of point-like vortices interacting
in plane by a short range potential. A field-theoretical formalism is developed
for describing the continuous version of this system. The action functional can
be written in the Bogomolnyi form (emphasizing the role of Self-Duality of the
asymptotic states) but the minimum energy is no more topological and the
asymptotic structures appear to be non-stationary, which is a major difference
with respect to traditional topological vortex solutions. Versions of this
field theory are discussed and we find arguments in favor of a particular form
of the equation. We comment upon the significant difference between the CHM
fluid/plasma and the Euler fluid and respectively the Abelian-Higgs vortex
models.
