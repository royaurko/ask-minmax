We reduce the classification of all supersymmetric backgrounds in eleven
dimensions to the evaluation of the supercovariant derivative and of an
integrability condition, which contains the field equations, on six types of
spinors. We determine the expression of the supercovariant derivative on all
six types of spinors and give in each case the field equations that do not
arise as the integrability conditions of Killing spinor equations. The Killing
spinor equations of a background become a linear system for the fluxes,
geometry and spacetime derivatives of the functions that determine the spinors.
The solution of the linear system expresses the fluxes in terms of the geometry
and specifies the restrictions on the geometry of spacetime for all
supersymmetric backgrounds. We also show that the minimum number of field
equations that is needed for a supersymmetric configuration to be a solution of
eleven-dimensional supergravity can be found by solving a linear system. The
linear systems of the Killing spinor equations and their integrability
conditions are given in both a timelike and a null spinor basis. We illustrate
the construction with examples.
