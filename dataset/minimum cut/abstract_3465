Resonant tunnelling through an Anderson impurity is investigated by employing
a new perturbation scheme at nonequilibrium. This new approach gives the
correct weak and strong coupling limit in $U$ by introducing adjustable
parameters in the self-energy and imposing self-consistency of the occupation
number of the impurity. We have found that the zero-temperature linear response
conductance agrees well with that obtained from the exact sum rule. At finite
temperature the conductance shows a nonzero minimum at the Kondo valley, as
shown in recent experiments. The effects of an applied bias voltage on the
single-particle density of states and on the differential conductances are
discussed for Kondo and non-Kondo systems.
