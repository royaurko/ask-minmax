Semiclassical multimode laser theory is extended to gas lasers with open
two-dimensional resonators of arbitrary shape. The Doppler frequency shift of
the linear-gain coefficient leads to an additional linear coupling between the
modes, which, however, is shown to be negligible. The nonlinear laser equations
simplify in the special case of wave-chaotic resonators. In the single-mode
regime, the intensity of a chaotic laser, as a function of the mode frequency,
displays a local minimum at the frequency of the atomic transition. The width
of the minimum scales with the inhomogeneous linewidth, in contrast to the Lamb
dip in uniaxial resonators whose width is given by the homogeneous linewidth.
