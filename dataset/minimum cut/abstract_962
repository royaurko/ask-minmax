We consider an alternative to the standard picture of CV and LMXB evolution,
namely the idea that most CVs (and by extension LMXBs) may not yet have had
time to evolve to their theoretical minimum orbital periods. We call this the
Binary Age Postulate (BAP). The observed short-period cutoff in the CV
histogram emerges naturally as the shortest period yet reached in the age of
the Galaxy, while the post-minimum-period space density problem is removed. The
idea has similar desirable consequences for LMXBs. In both cases systems with
nuclear-evolved secondary stars form a prominent part of the short-period
distributions. Properties such as the existence and nature of ultrashort-period
systems, and the spread in mass transfer rates at a given orbital period, are
naturally reproduced.
