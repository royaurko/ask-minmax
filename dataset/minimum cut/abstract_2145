We review or main results concerning the transport coefficients of a light
meson gas, in particular we focus on the case of a massive pion gas. Leading
order results according to the chiral power-counting are presented for the DC
electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, shear viscosity, and bulk
viscosity. We also comment on the possible correlation between the bulk
viscosity and the trace anomaly in QCD, as well as the relation between
unitarity and a minimum of the quotient $\eta/s$ near the phase transition.
