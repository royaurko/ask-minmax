The project Massive Unseen Companions to Hot Faint Underluminous Stars from
SDSS (MUCHFUSS) aims at finding hot subdwarf stars with massive compact
companions like massive white dwarfs (M > 1.0 Msun), neutron stars or stellar
mass black holes. The existence of such systems is predicted by binary
evolution theory and recent discoveries indicate that they exist in our Galaxy.
First results are presented for seven close binary sdBs with short orbital
periods ranging from 0.21 d to 1.5 d. The atmospheric parameters of all objects
are compatible with core helium-burning stars. The companions are most likely
white dwarfs. In one case the companion could be shown to be a white dwarf by
the absence of light-curve variations. However, in most cases late type main
sequence stars cannot be firmly excluded. Comparing our small sample with the
known population of close sdB binaries we show that our target selection method
aiming at massive companions is efficient. The minimum companion masses of all
binaries in our sample are high compared to the reference sample of known sdB
binaries.
