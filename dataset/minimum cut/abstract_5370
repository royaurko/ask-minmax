We study a reaction-diffusion system of partial differential equations, which
can be taken to be a basic model for criminal activity. We show that the
assumption of a populations natural tendency towards crime significantly
changes the long-time behavior of criminal activity patterns. Under the right
assumptions on these natural tendencies we first show that there exists
traveling wave solutions connecting zones with no criminal activity and zones
with high criminal activity, known as hotspots. This corresponds to an invasion
of criminal activity onto all space. Second, we study the problem of preventing
such invasions by employing a finite number of resources that reduce the payoff
committing a crime in a finite region. We make the concept of wave propagation
mathematically rigorous in this situation by proving the existence of entire
solutions that approach traveling waves as time approaches negative infinity.
Furthermore, we characterize the minimum amount of resources necessary to
prevent the invasion in the case when prevention is possible. Finally, we apply
our theory to what is commonly known as the gap problem in the excitable media
literature, proving existing conjectures in the literature.
