Few magnon measurements in half-doped manganites are available. Recently, the
spin-wave spectrum of half-doped bilayer Pr(Ca0.9Sr0.1)2Mn2O7 was reported
(Johnstone et al 2012 Phys.Rev.Lett.109 237202). The best fit included, using a
localized spin model, corresponds to a ground state with a combined spin,
charge and orbital ordering analogous to the CE phase proposed by Goodenough in
1955, though with a quite larger Mn-charge disproportionation. The latter
contradicts previous experimental indications in half-doped manganites,
pointing toward smaller Mn-disproportionations: in a range between the minimum
value corresponding to the Zener-polaron or dimer phase (with all Mn-charges
formally equal to 3.5+), and the maximum disproportionation found in
Goodenough's CE phase (with Mn3+ and Mn4+). Such indications led to the
intermediate phase proposal (Efremov et al 2004 Nat.Mats.3 853). Here, we
analize the spin excitations of half-doped bilayer (and layered) manganites,
calculating them in terms of a localized spin model suitable to describe the
intermediate, CE and dimer phases. We discuss the effects of an extensive set
of magnetic couplings, including all those introduced in previous fits. An
improved description of the magnons reported for bilayer manganites is obtained
assuming a generalized CE phase with Mn-disproportionation inside the expected
range, by including next-nearest-neighbour magnetic coupling parameters between
the planar Mn zig-zag chains.
