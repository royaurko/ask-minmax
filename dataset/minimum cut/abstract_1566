High-resolution optical spectra of the R Coronae Borealis (RBC) star V854
Centauri in the early stages of a decline show, in addition to the features
reported for other RCBs in decline, narrow absorption lines from the C_2
Phillips system. The low rotational temperature, T_rot = 1150K, of the C_2
ground electronic state suggests the cold gas is associated with the developing
shroud of carbon dust. These absorption lines were not seen at a fainter
magnitude on the rise from minimum light nor at maximum light. This is the
first detection of cold gas around a RCB star.
