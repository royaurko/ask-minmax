Based on currently available kinematic data, we have searched for stars
outside the Hipparcos list that either closely encountered in the past or will
encounter in the future the Solar system within several parsecs. For the first
time, we have identified two single stars, GJ 3379 (G 099-049) and GJ 3323 (LHS
1723), as candidate for a close encounter with the solar orbit. The star GJ
3379 could encounter the Sun more closely to a minimum distance
d_min=1.32+\-0.03 pc at time t_min=-163+\-3 thousand years. We have found two
potential candidates for a close encounter that have only photometrical
distances: the white dwarf SSSPM J1549-3544 without any data on its radial
velocity and the L-dwarf SDSS J1416+1348. The probabilities of their
penetration into the Oort cloud region are 0.09 (at a model radial velocity
|V_r| = 50 km/s) and 0.05, respectively.
