We model the observed vertical distribution of the neutral hydrogen (HI) in
the faint (M_B ~ -13.7 mag) edge-on dwarf irregular galaxy KK250. Our model
assumes that the galaxy consists of axi-symmetric, co-planar gas and stellar
discs in the external force-field of a spherical dark matter halo, and in
vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. The velocity dispersion of the gas is left as
a free parameter in the model. Our best fit model is able to reproduce the
observed vertical distribution of the HI gas, as well as the observed velocity
profiles. The best fit model has a large velocity dispersion (~ 22 km/s) at the
centre of the galaxy, which falls to a value of ~ 8 km/s by a galacto-centric
radius of ~ 1 kpc, which is similar to both the scale-length of the stellar
disc, as well as the angular resolution of the data along the radial direction.
Similarly we find that the thickness of the HI disc is also minimum at ~ 1 kpc,
and increases by about a factor of ~ 2 as one goes to the centre of the galaxy
or out to ~ 3 kpc. The minimum intrinsic HWHM of the HI vertical distribution
in KK250 is ~ 350 pc. For comparison the HWHM of the vertical distribution of
the HI in the solar neighbourhood is ~ 70-140 pc. Our results are hence
consistent with other observations which indicate that dwarf galaxies have
significantly puffier gas discs than spirals.
