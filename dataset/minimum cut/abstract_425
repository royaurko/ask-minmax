Using geometric properties of the variety $\cV_{r,t}$, the image under the
Grassmannian map of a Desarguesian $(t-1)$-spread of $\PG(rt-1,q)$, we
introduce error correcting codes related to the twisted tensor product
construction, producing several families of constacyclic codes. We exactly
determine the parameters of these codes and characterise the words of minimum
weight.
