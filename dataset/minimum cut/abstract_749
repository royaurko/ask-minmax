The discrimination between two unknown states can be performed by a universal
programmable discriminator, where the copies of the two possible states are
stored in two program systems respectively and the copies of data, which we
want to confirm, are provided in the data system. In the present paper, we
propose a group-theretic approach to the multi-copy programmable state
discrimination problem. By equivalence of unknown pure states to known mixed
states and with the representation theory of U(n) group, we construct the
Jordan basis to derive the analytical results for both the optimal unambiguous
discrimination and minimum-error discrimination. The POVM operators for
unambiguous discrimination and orthogonal measurement operators for
minimum-error discrimination are obtained. We find that the optimal failure
probability and minimum-error probability for the discrimination between the
mean input mixd states are dependent on the dimension of the unknown qudit
states. We applied the approach to generalize the results of He and Bergou
(Phys. Rev. A {\bf 75}, 032316 (2007)) from qubit to qudit case, and we further
solve the problem of programmable dicriminators with arbitrary copies of
unknown states in both program and data systems.
