The Amosov-Holevo-Werner conjecture implies the additivity of the minimum
Re'nyi entropies at the output of a channel. The conjecture is proven true for
all Re'nyi entropies of integer order greater than two in a class of Gaussian
bosonic channel where the input signal is randomly displaced or where it is
coupled linearly to an external environment.
