Recent progress in the formulation of a fully dynamical local approximation
to time-dependent Density Functional Theory appeals to the longitudinal and
transverse components of the exchange and correlation kernel in the linear
current-density response of the homogeneous fluid at long wavelength. Both
components are evaluated for the electron gas in dimensionality D=3 and D=2 by
an approximate decoupling in the equation of motion for the current density,
which accounts for processes of excitation of two electron-hole pairs. Each
pair is treated in the random phase approximation, but the role of exchange and
correlation is also examined; in addition, final-state exchange processes are
included phenomenologically so as to satisfy the exactly known high-frequency
behaviours of the kernel. The transverse and longitudinal spectra involve the
same decay channels and are similar in shape. A two-plasmon threshold in the
spectrum for two-pair excitations in D=3 leads to a sharp minimum in the real
part of the exchange and correlation kernel at twice the plasma frequency. In
D=2 the same mechanism leads to a broad spectral peak and to a broad minimum in
the real part of the kernel, as a consequence of the dispersion law of the
plasmon vanishing at long wavelength. The numerical results have been fitted to
simple analytic functions.
