Using high speed scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we perform a full mapping
of the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) in single crystals of
BiPbSrCaCuO(2212). The measurements carried out at 5 K showed a complex spatial
pattern of important variations of the local DOS on the nanometer scale.
Superconducting areas are co-existing with regions of a smooth and larger
gap-like DOS structure. The superconducting regions are found to have a minimum
size of about 3 nm. The role of Pb-introduced substitutional disorder in the
observed spatial variations of the local DOS is discussed.
