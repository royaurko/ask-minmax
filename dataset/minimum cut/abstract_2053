In the framework of Quark-Gluon String Model we calculate the inclusive
spectra of secondaries produced in d+Au collisions at intermediate (CERN SPS)
and at much higher (RHIC) energies. The results of numerical calculations at
intermediate energies are in reasonable agreement with the data. At RHIC
energies numerically large inelastic screening corrections (percolation
effects) should be accounted for in calculations. We extract these effects from
the existing RHIC experimental data on minimum bias and central d+Au
collisions. The predictions for p+Au interactions at LHC energy are also given.
