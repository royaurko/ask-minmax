We investigate the occurrence of rotons in a quadrupolar Bose-Einstein
condensate confined to two dimensions. Depending on the particle density, the
ratio of the contact and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, and the alignment
of the quadrupole moments with respect to the confinement plane, the dispersion
relation features two or four point-like roton minima, or one ring-shaped
minimum. We map out the entire parameter space of the roton behavior and
identify the instability regions. We propose to observe the exotic rotons by
monitoring the characteristic density wave dynamics resulting from a short
local perturbation, and discuss the possibilities to detect the predicted
effects in state-of-the-art experiments with ultracold homonuclear molecules.
