We analyse the main features of the third edition of Google Scholar Metrics
(GSM), released in June 2014, focusing on its more important changes,
strengths, and weaknesses. Additionally, we present some figures that outline
the dimensions of this new edition, and we compare them to those of previous
editions. Principal among these figures are the number of visualized
publications, publication types, languages, and the maximum and minimum
h5-index and h5-median values by language, subject area, and subcategory. This
new edition is marked by continuity. There is nothing new other than the
updating of the time frame (2009-2013) and the removal of some redundant
subcategories (from 268 to 261) for English written publications. Google has
just updated the data, which means that some of the errors discussed in
previous studies still persist. To sum up, GSM is a minimalist information
product with few features, closed (it cannot be customized by the user), and
simple (navigating it only takes a few clicks). For these reasons, we consider
it a 'low cost' bibliometric tool, and propose a list of features it should
incorporate in order to stop being labeled as such. Notwithstanding the above,
this product presents a stability in its bibliometric indicators that supports
its ability to measure and track the impact of scientific publications.
