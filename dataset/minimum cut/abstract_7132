The gamma-ray emission of blazar jets shows a pronounced variability and this
feature provides limits to the size and to the speed of the emitting region. We
study the gamma-ray variability of bright blazars using data from the first 18
months of activity of the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space
Telescope. From the daily light-curves of the blazars characterized by a
remarkable activity, we firstly determine the minimum variability time-scale,
giving an upper limit for the size of the emitting region of the sources,
assumed to be spheroidal blobs in relativistic motion. These regions must be
smaller than ~10^-3 parsec. Another interesting time-scale is the duration of
the outbursts. We conclude that they cannot correspond to radiation produced by
a single blob moving relativistically along the jet, but they are either the
signature of emission from a standing shock extracting energy from a modulated
jet, or the superposition of a number of flares occurring on a shorter
time-scale. We also derive lower limits on the bulk Lorentz factor needed to
make the emitting region transparent for gamma-rays interacting through
photon-photon collisions.
