We describe the recent developments to extend the multi-parton interaction
model of underlying events in Herwig++ into the soft, non-perturbative, regime.
This allows the program to describe also minimum bias collisions in which there
is no hard interaction, for the first time. It is publicly available from
versions 2.3 onwards and describes the Tevatron underlying event and minimum
bias data. The extrapolations to the LHC nevertheless suffer considerable
ambiguity, as we discuss.
