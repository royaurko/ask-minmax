We present a new, universally applicable toy model of colour reconnections in
hadronic final states. The model is based on hadronising strings and has one
free parameter. We next present an implementation of this model in the Pythia
event generator and provide several parameter sets ("tunes"), constrained by
fits to Tevatron minimum-bias data. Finally, we consider the sensitivity of a
simplified top mass analysis to these effects, in exclusive semi-leptonic top
events at the Tevatron. A first attempt at isolating the genuine
non-perturbative effects gives an estimate of order delta(m_top) ~ 0.5 GeV from
non-perturbative uncertainties, and a further delta(m_top) ~ 1 GeV from shower
effects.
