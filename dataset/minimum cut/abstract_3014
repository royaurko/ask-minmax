We describe the discovery of a likely brown dwarf (BD) companion with a
minimum mass of 31.7 +/- 2.0 M_Jup to GSC 03546-01452 from the MARVELS radial
velocity survey, which we designate as MARVELS-6b. For reasonable priors, our
analysis gives a probability of 72% that MARVELS-6b has a mass below the
hydrogen-burning limit of 0.072 M_Sun, and thus it is a high-confidence BD
companion. It has a moderately long orbital period of 47.8929 +0.0063/-0.0062
days with a low eccentricty of 0.1442 +0.0078/-0.0073, and a semi-amplitude of
1644 +12/-13 m/s. Moderate resolution spectroscopy of the host star has
determined the following parameters: T_eff = 5598 +/- 63, log g = 4.44 +/-
0.17, and [Fe/H] = +0.40 +/- 0.09. Based upon these measurements, GSC
03546-01452 has a probable mass and radius of M_star = 1.11 +/- 0.11 M_Sun and
R_star = 1.06 +/- 0.23 R_Sun with an age consistent with less than ~6 Gyr at a
distance of 219 +/- 21 pc from the Sun. Although MARVELS-6b is not observed to
transit, we cannot definitively rule out a transiting configuration based on
our observations. There is a visual companion detected with Lucky Imaging at
7.7 arcsec from the host star, but our analysis shows that it is not bound to
this system. The minimum mass of MARVELS-6b exists at the minimum of the mass
functions for both stars and planets, making this a rare object even compared
to other BDs.
