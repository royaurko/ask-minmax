A new type of spatial-temporal correlation in the process approaching to the
self-organized criticality is investigated for the two simple models for
biological evolution. The change behaviors of the position with minimum barrier
are shown to be quantitatively different in the two models. Different results
of the correlation are given for the two models. We argue that the correlation
can be used, together with the power-law distributions, as criteria for
self-organized criticality.
