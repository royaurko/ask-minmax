Double neutron stars are one of the most promizing sources for terrestrial
gravitational wave interferometers. For actual interferometers and their
planned upgrades, the probability of having a signal present in the data is
small, but as the sensitivity improves, the detection rate increases and the
waveforms may start to overlap, creating a confusion background, ultimately
limiting the capabilities of future detectors. The third generation Einstein
Telescope, with an horizon of $z > 1$ and very low frequency ``seismic wall''
may be affected by such confusion noise. At a minimum, careful data analysis
will be require to separate signals which will appear confused. This result
should be borne in mind when designing highly advanced future instruments.
