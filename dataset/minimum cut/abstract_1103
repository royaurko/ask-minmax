Cryogenically cooled microelectromagnet mirrors were used to reflect a cloud
of free-falling laser-cooled 85Rb atoms at normal incidence. The mirrors
consisted of microfabricated current-carrying Au wires in a periodic serpentine
pattern on a sapphire substrate. The fluorescence from the atomic cloud was
imaged after it had bounced off a mirror. The transverse width of the cloud
reached a local minimum at an optimal current corresponding to minimum mirror
roughness. A distinct increase in roughness was found for mirror configurations
with even versus odd number of lines. These observations confirm theoretical
predictions.
