It is generally argued that the combined effect of Heisenberg principle and
general relativity leads to a minimum time uncertainty. Most of the analyses
supporting this conclusion are based on a perturbative approach to
quantization. We consider a simple family of gravitational models, including
the Einstein-Rosen waves, in which the (non-linearized) inclusion of gravity
changes the normalization of time translations by a monotonic energy-dependent
factor. In these circumstances, it is shown that a maximum time resolution
emerges non-perturbatively only if the total energy is bounded. Perturbatively,
however, there always exists a minimum uncertainty in the physical time.
