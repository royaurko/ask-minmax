In the skutterudite compounds the anharmonic 'rattling' oscillations of
4f-host ions in the surrounding Sb12 cages are found to have significant
influence on the low temperature properties. Recently specific heat analysis of
Pr(Os{1-x}Ru{x})4Sb12 has shown that the energy of crystalline electric field
(CEF) singlet-triplet excitations increases strongly with Ru-concentration x
and crosses the almost constant rattling mode frequency $\omega_0$ at about x ~
0.65. Due to magnetoelastic interactions this may entail prominent nonadiabatic
effects in inelastic neutron scattering (INS) intensity and quadrupolar
susceptibility. Furthermore the Ru- concentration dependence of the
superconducting Tc, notably the minimum at intermediate x is explained as a
crossover effect from pairforming aspherical Coulomb scattering to pairbreaking
exchange scattering.
