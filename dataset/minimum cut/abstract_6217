We have discovered an X-ray jet with Chandra imaging of the z=1.187
radio-loud quasar PKS1127-145. In this paper we present the Chandra X-ray data,
follow-up VLA observations, and optical imaging using the HST WFPC2. The X-ray
jet contains 273+/-5 net counts in 27ksec and extends ~30 arcsec, from the
quasar core, corresponding to a minimum projected linear size of ~330/h_50 kpc.
The evaluation of the X-ray emission processes is complicated by the observed
offsets between X-ray and radio brightness peaks. We discuss the problems posed
by these observations to jet models. In addition, PKS1127-145 is a Giga-Hertz
Peaked Spectrum radio source, a member of the class of radio sources suspected
to be young or ``frustrated'' versions of FRI radio galaxies. However the
discovery of an X-ray and radio jet extending well outside the host galaxy of
PKS1127-145 suggests that activity in this and other GPS sources may be
long-lived and complex.
