We study a wide class of finite-dimensional su(m|n)-supersymmetric models
closely related to the representations of the Yangian Y(sl(m|n)) labeled by
border strips. We quantitatively analyze the degree of degeneracy of these
models arising from their Yangian invariance, measured by the average
degeneracy of the spectrum. We compute in closed form the minimum average
degeneracy of any such model, and show that in the non-supersymmetric case it
can be expressed in terms of generalized Fibonacci numbers. Using several
properties of these numbers, we show that (except in the simpler su(1|1) case)
the minimum average degeneracy grows exponentially with the number of spins. We
apply our results to several well-known spin chains of Haldane-Shastry type,
quantitatively showing that their degree of degeneracy is much higher than
expected for a generic Yangian-invariant spin model. Finally, we show that the
set of distinct levels of a Yangian-invariant spin model is described by an
effective model of quasi-particles. We study this effective model, discussing
its connections to one-dimensional anyons and properties of generalized
Fibonacci numbers.
