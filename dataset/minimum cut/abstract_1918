The existence of anticipatory, complete and lag synchronization in a single
system having two different time-delays, that is feedback delay $\tau_1$ and
coupling delay $\tau_2$, is identified. The transition from anticipatory to
complete synchronization and from complete to lag synchronization as a function
of coupling delay $\tau_2$ with suitable stability condition is discussed. The
existence of anticipatory and lag synchronization is characterized both by the
minimum of similarity function and the transition from on-off intermittency to
periodic structure in laminar phase distribution.
