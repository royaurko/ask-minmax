Topological confinement by center vortices does not immediately explain
either a minimum-area law for non-planar Wilson loops or the L\"uscher term. I
conjecture that both a minimal-area law and a L\"uscher term arise in a
confinement model of random ensembles of vortices with no propagating gluons (a
polymer model), and propose their test by polymer-like lattice simulations. I
also consider the role of dynamically-massive gluons propagating from one point
to another on a Wilson loop, and conjecture an approximate duality between the
gluon-chain model and a condensate of center vortices with nexuses (magnetic
monopoles) propagating on the vortex surfaces. I explore the old fishnet model,
updated to deal with propagating massive QCD gluons, and argue that it leads to
a surface tension and therefore a L\"uscher term, as expressed through an
effective action of the Dirichlet form that describes tension. I propose
various lattice studies of non-planar Wilson loops to investigate such issues.
Finally, in a different vein I urge the lattice community to study gauge-fixing
to the background-field Feynman gauge, which will yield the gauge-invariant
off-shell Greens functions of the pinch technique.
