Constructing the density-dependent one-body momentum distribution (DDOBMD)
functions and the density-momentum dependent single particle potential (DMDSPP)
from the calculations of the LOCV method for the symmetric nuclear matter with
the $A\upsilon_{18}$ potential, the role of the DDOBMD functions on the
calculation of the ground-state properties of closed shell nuclei, i.e.,
$^{16}O$, $^{40}Ca$ and $^{56}Ni$, is investigated. Since the contribution of
partial waves with $J_{max} > 2$ are not very significant relative to those of
$J_{max} \leq 2$ on the calculation of the DDOBMD function and the DMDSPP, as
shown by including the $A\upsilon_{18}(J_{max}=5)$ potential, the investigation
of the DDOBMD role on the major single particle levels (SPLs) and the nuclei
binding energies are studied by the $A\upsilon_{18}(J_{max}=2)$ potential. The
best fit of spin-orbit splitting is taken into account when correcting the
major SPLs of the nuclei at the minimum point of energy (MPE) by means of the
new parameterized Wood-Saxon potential. Considering the point-like protons in
the spherical Coulomb potential well, the single proton levels are corrected in
the MPE of the nuclei. Contrary $^{40}Ca$ and $^{56}Ni$, the improved binding
energy of $^{16}O$ by the DDOBMD functions is closer the experimental data.
