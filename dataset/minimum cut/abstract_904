Gravier et al. investigated the identifying codes of Cartesian product of two
graphs. In this paper we consider the identifying codes of lexicographic
product G[H] of a connected graph G and an arbitrary graph H, and obtain the
minimum cardinality of identifying codes of G[H] in terms of some parameters of
G and H.
