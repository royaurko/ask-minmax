We study general properties of the leading eigenvalue $\overline{w}(q)$ of
Eigen's evolutionary matrices depending on the probability $q$ of faithful
reproduction. This is a linear algebra problem that has various applications in
theoretical biology, including such diverse fields as the origin of life,
evolution of cancer progression, and virus evolution. We present the exact
expressions for $\overline{w}(q),\overline{w}'(q),\overline{w}''(q)$ for
$q=0,0.5,1$ and prove that the absolute minimum of $\overline{w}(q)$, which
always exists, belongs to the interval $[0,0.5]$. For the specific case of a
single peaked landscape we also find lower and upper bounds on
$\overline{w}(q)$, which are used to estimate the critical mutation rate, after
which the distribution of the types of individuals in the population becomes
almost uniform. This estimate is used as a starting point to conjecture another
estimate, valid for any fitness landscape, and which is checked by numerical
calculations. The last estimate stresses the fact that the inverse dependence
of the critical mutation rate on the sequence length is not a generally valid
fact. Therefore, the discussions of the error threshold applied to biological
systems must take this fact into account.
