The observation of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the gamma-ray band has been
advanced by the AGILE and Fermi satellites after the era of the Compton
Gamma-Ray Observatory. AGILE and Fermi are showing that the GeV-bright GRBs
share a set of common features, particularly the high fluence from the keV up
to the GeV energy bands, the high value of the minimum Lorentz factor, the
presence of an extended emission of gamma-rays, often delayed with respect to
lower energies, and finally the possible presence of multiple spectral
components. GRB 100724B, localised in a joint effort by Fermi and the
InterPlanetary Newtork, is the brightest burst detected in gamma-rays so far by
AGILE. Characteristic features of GRB 100724B are the simultaneous emissions at
MeV and GeV, without delayed onset nor time lag as shown by the analysis of the
cross correlation function, and the significant spectral evolution in hard
X-rays over the event duration. In this paper we show the analysis of the AGILE
data of GRB 100724B and we discuss its features in the context of the bursts
observed so far in gamma-rays and the recently proposed models.
