The star complexes (large scale star forming regions) of NGC 6822 were traced
and mapped and their size distribution was compared with the size distribution
of star complexes in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). Furthermore, the spatial
distributions of different age stellar populations were compared with each
other. The star complexes of NGC 6822 were determined by using the isopleths,
based on star counts, of the young stars of the galaxy, using a statistical
cutoff limit in density. In order to map them and determine their geometrical
properties, an ellipse was fitted to every distinct region satisfying this
minimum limit. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test was used to study
possible patterns in their size distribution. Isopleths were also used to study
the stellar populations of NGC 6822. The star complexes of NGC 6822 were
detected and a list of their positions and sizes was produced. Indications of
hierarchical star formation, in terms of spatial distribution, time evolution
and preferable sizes were found in NGC 6822 and the MCs. The spatial
distribution of the various age stellar populations has indicated traces of an
interaction in NGC 6822, dated before 350 +/- 50 Myr.
