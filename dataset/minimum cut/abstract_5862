This work concerns the behavior of "good" (capacity achieving) codes in
several multi-user settings in the Gaussian regime, in terms of their minimum
mean-square error (MMSE) behavior. The settings investigated in this context
include the Gaussian wiretap channel, the Gaussian broadcast channel (BC) and
the Gaussian BC with confidential messages (BCC). In particular this work
addresses the effects of transmitting such codes on unintended receivers, that
is, receivers that neither require reliable decoding of the transmitted
messages nor are they eavesdroppers that must be kept ignorant, to some extent,
of the transmitted message. This work also examines the effect on the capacity
region that occurs when we limit the allowed disturbance in terms of MMSE on
some unintended receiver. This trade-off between the capacity region and the
disturbance constraint is given explicitly for the Gaussian BC and the secrecy
capacity region of the Gaussian BCC.
