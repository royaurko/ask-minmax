We develop a topological model of knots and links arising from a single (or
multiple processive) round(s) of recombination starting with an unknot, unlink,
or (2,m)-torus knot or link substrate. We show that all knotted or linked
products fall into a single family, and prove that the size of this family
grows linearly with the cube of the minimum number of crossings. Additionally,
we prove that the only possible products of an unknot substrate are either
clasp knots and links or (2,m)-torus knots and links. Finally, in the (common)
case of (2,m)-torus knot or link substrates whose products have minimal
crossing number m+1, we prove that the types of products are tightly
prescribed, and use this to examine previously uncharacterized experimental
data.
