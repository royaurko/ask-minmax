In Dirac's hole theory (HT) the vacuum state is generally believed to be the
state of minimum energy due to the assumption that the Pauli Exclusion
Principle prevents the decay of positive energy electrons into occupied
negative energy states. However recently papers have appeared that claim to
show that there exist states with less energy than that of the vacuum[4][5][6].
Here we will consider a simple model of HT consisting of zero mass electrons in
1-1D space-time. It will be shown that for this model there are states with
less energy than the HT vacuum state and that the Pauli Principle is obeyed.
Therefore the conjecture that the Pauli Principle prevents the existence of
states with less energy than the vacuum state is not correct.
