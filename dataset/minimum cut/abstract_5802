The sparse, hierarchical, and modular processing of natural signals is
related to the ability of humans to recognize objects with high accuracy. In
this study, we report a sparse feature processing and encoding method, which
improved the recognition performance of an automated object recognition system.
Randomly distributed localized gradient enhanced features were selected before
employing aggregate functions for representation, where we used a modular and
hierarchical approach to detect the object features. These object features were
combined with a minimum distance classifier, thereby obtaining object
recognition system accuracies of 93% using the Amsterdam library of object
images (ALOI) database, 92% using the Columbia object image library (COIL)-100
database, and 69% using the PASCAL visual object challenge 2007 database. The
object recognition performance was shown to be robust to variations in noise,
object scaling, and object shifts. Finally, a comparison with eight existing
object recognition methods indicated that our new method improved the
recognition accuracy by 10% with ALOI, 8% with the COIL-100 database, and 10%
with the PASCAL visual object challenge 2007 database.
