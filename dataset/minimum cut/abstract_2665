The triple point number of a surface-knot is the minimum number of triple
points taken over all possible diagrams representing it. It is known that there
is no surface-knot with triple point number one. In this paper, we prove that
there is no orientable surface-knot with triple point number two by using
quandle colourings of surface diagrams.
