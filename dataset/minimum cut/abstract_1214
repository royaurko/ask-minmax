In a graph $G$, a fire starts at some vertex. At every time step,
firefighters can protect up to $k$ vertices, and then the fire spreads to all
unprotected neighbours. The $k$-surviving rate $\rho_k(G)$ of $G$ is the
expectation of the proportion of vertices that can be saved from the fire, if
the starting vertex of the fire is chosen uniformly at random. For a given
class of graphs $\cG$ we are interested in the minimum value $k$ such that
$\rho_k(G)\ge\epsilon$ for some constant $\epsilon>0$ and all $G\in\cG$ i.e.,
such that linearly many vertices are expected to be saved in every graph from
$\cG$).
  In this note, we prove that for planar graphs this minimum value is at most
4, and that it is precisely 2 for triangle-free planar graphs.
