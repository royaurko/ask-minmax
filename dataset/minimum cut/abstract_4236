We study the electron transport properties through a supported organic
molecule styrene (C8H8) on an ideal silicon surface Si[111] and probed by a
STM-tip. The I-V characteristics and the differential conductance of the
molecule are calculated using a self consistent approach based on non
equilibrium Green's functions. Two different adsorption configurations for the
molecule on the surface were considered which corresponds to a global and a
local minimum of the total energy. In both cases we find a negative
differential resistance (NDR) in a given interval of bias voltages. This effect
is controlled by the states available close to the Fermi level of the surface
and can be manipulated by properly doping the substrate. We also analyze the
influence of the tip-shape on the I-V characteristics.
