High-precision radial velocity surveys explore the population of low-mass
exoplanets orbiting bright stars. This allows accurately deriving their orbital
parameters such as their occurrence rate and the statistical distribution of
their properties. Based on this, models of planetary formation and evolution
can be constrained. The SOPHIE spectrograph has been continuously improved in
past years, and thanks to an appropriate correction of systematic instrumental
drift, it is now reaching 2 m/s precision in radial velocity measurements on
all timescales. As part of a dedicated radial velocity survey devoted to search
for low-mass planets around a sample of 190 bright solar-type stars in the
northern hemisphere, we report the detection of a warm Neptune with a minimum
mass of 16.1 +- 2.7 Mearth orbiting the solar analog HD164595 in 40 +- 0.24
days . We also revised the parameters of the multiplanetary system around
HD190360. We discuss this new detection in the context of the upcoming space
mission CHEOPS, which is devoted to a transit search of bright stars harboring
known exoplanets.
