The ozone layer state in the stratosphere over Yakutia depending on the year
time is considered. It is shown that the layer thickness is maximum in
February-March (450 Dobson's units) and it is minimum in July-September (300 -
350 DU). Measurements indicate that the ozone layer thickness was significantly
decreased in the 1990's. A problem of change of ozone layer state is discussed.
