In the present work, we investigate subsequential production of three kaons
and $\Omega^-$ baryon based on an effective Lagrangian approach. We only
consider the intermediate states with the light mass baryon to suggest the
minimum of the total cross section. Coupling constants for verteces of
meson-octet baryons are fixed from the empirical data and/or quark models
together with SU(3) symmetry considerations and these for meson-decouplet are
predicted not only quark model but also Chiral-quark soliton model calculation.
Gauge invariance of the resulting amplitude is maintained by introducing the
contact currents by extending the gauge-invariant approach of Haberzettl for
one-meson photoproduction to two-meson photoproduction.
