We have monitored the Neptune-mass exoplanet-hosting M-dwarf Gl 581 with the
1m Swope Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory over two predicted transit
epochs. A neutral density filter centered at 550nm was used during the first
epoch, yielding 6.33 hours of continuous light curve coverage with an average
photometric precision of 1.6 mmags and a cadence of 2.85 min. The second epoch
was monitored in B-band over 5.85 hours, with an average photometric precision
of 1.2 mmags and 4.28 min cadence. No transits are apparent on either night,
indicating that the orbital inclination is less than 88.1 deg for all planets
with radius larger than 0.38 R_Nep = 1.48 R_Earth. Because planets of most
reasonable interior composition have radii larger than 1.55 R_Earth we place an
inclination limit for the system of 88.1 deg. The corresponding minimum mass of
Gl 581b remains 0.97 M_Nep = 16.6 M_Earth.
