The multiple point principle (MPP), according to which several vacuum states
with the same energy density exist, is put forward as a fine-tuning mechanism
predicting the ratio between the fundamental and weak scales in the Standard
Model (SM) and in its two Higgs doublet extension (2HDM). Using renormalization
group equations for the SM, we obtain the effective potential in the 2-loop
approximation and investigate the existence of its postulated second minimum at
the fundamental scale. In the SM an exponentially huge ratio between the
fundamental (Planck) and electroweak scales results:
$\frac{\Lambda_{fund}}{\Lambda_{ew}} \sim e^{40}.$ But in the 2HDM the
fundamental scale $\Lambda$ can vary from 10 TeV up to the Planck scale. Using
the MPP, we predict the masses of the Higgs bosons.
