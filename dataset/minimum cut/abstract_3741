A total of 614 upward through-going muons of minimum energy 1.6 GeV are
observed by Super-Kamiokande during 537 detector live days. The measured muon
flux is 1.74+/-0.07(stat.)+/-0.02(sys.)x10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1} compared
to an expected flux of 1.97+/-0.44(theo.)x10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}. The
absolute measured flux is in agreement with the prediction within the errors.
However, the zenith angle dependence of the observed upward through-going muon
flux does not agree with no-oscillation predictions. The observed distortion in
shape is consistent with the \nu_\mu <-> \nu_\tau oscillation hypothesis with
\sin^22\theta > 0.4 and 1x10^{-3} < \Delta m^2 < 1x10^{-1} eV^{2} at 90%
confidence level.
