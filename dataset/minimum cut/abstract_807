It is shown that the spectacular metal-insulator transition in Eu-rich EuO
can be simulated within an extended Kondo lattice model. The different orders
of magnitude of the jump in resistivity in dependence on the concentration of
oxygen vacancies as well as the low-temperature resistance minimum in
high-resistivity samples are reproduced quantitatively. The huge colossal
magnetoresistance (CMR) is calculated and discussed.
