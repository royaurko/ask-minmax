We prove that the global minimum of the real part of the full effective
potential of the many-electron system with attractive delta-interaction is in
fact given by the BCS mean field configuration. This is a consequence of a
simple bound which is obtained by applying Hadamard's inequality to the
functional determinant. The second order Taylor expansion around the minimum is
computed.
