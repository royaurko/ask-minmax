Measurements of primary charged hadron multiplicity distributions are
presented for non-single-diffractive events in proton-proton collisions at
centre-of-mass energies of sqrt(s) = 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV, in five
pseudorapidity ranges from |eta|<0.5 to |eta|<2.4. The data were collected with
the minimum-bias trigger of the CMS experiment during the LHC commissioning
runs in 2009 and the 7 TeV run in 2010. The multiplicity distribution at
sqrt(s) = 0.9 TeV is in agreement with previous measurements. At higher
energies the increase of the mean multiplicity with sqrt(s) is underestimated
by most event generators. The average transverse momentum as a function of the
multiplicity is also presented. The measurement of higher-order moments of the
multiplicity distribution confirms the violation of Koba-Nielsen-Olesen scaling
that has been observed at lower energies.
