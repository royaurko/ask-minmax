For each of n=1,2,3 we find the minimal height h^(P) of a nontorsion point P
of an elliptic curve E over C(T) of discriminant degree d=12n (equivalently, of
arithmetic genus n), and exhibit all (E,P) attaining this minimum. The minimal
h^(P) was known to equal 1/30 for n=1 (Oguiso-Shioda) and 11/420 for n=2
(Nishiyama), but the formulas for the general (E,P) were not known, nor was the
fact that these are also the minima for an elliptic curve of discriminant
degree 12n over a function field of any genus. For n=3 both the minimal height
(23/840) and the explicit curves are new. These (E,P) also have the property
that that mP is an integral point (a point of naive height zero) for each
m=1,2,...,M, where M=6,8,9 for n=1,2,3; this, too, is maximal in each of the
three cases.
