The electrical conductivity of graphene containing point defects is studied
within the binary alloy model in its dependence on the Fermi level position at
the zero temperature. It is found that the minimal conductivity value does not
have a universal character and corresponds to the impurity resonance energy
rather than to the Dirac point position in the spectrum. The substantial
asymmetry of the resulting dependence of the conductivity on the gate voltage
magnitude is attributed as well to this same shift of the conductivity minimum
to the resonance state energy.
