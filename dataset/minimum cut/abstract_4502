The critical BEC temperature $T_{c}$ of a non interacting boson gas in a
layered structure like those of cuprate superconductors is shown to have a
minimum $T_{c,m}$, at a characteristic separation between planes $a_{m}$. It is
shown that for $a<a_{m}$, $T_{c}$ increases monotonically back up to the ideal
Bose gas $T_{0}$ suggesting that a reduction in the separation between planes,
as happens when one increases the pressure in a cuprate, leads to an increase
in the critical temperature. For finite plane separation and penetrability the
specific heat as a function of temperature shows two novel crests connected by
a ridge in addition to the well-known BEC peak at $T_{c}$ associated with the
3D behavior of the gas. For completely impenetrable planes the model reduces to
many disconnected infinite slabs for which just one hump survives becoming a
peak only when the slab widths are infinite.
