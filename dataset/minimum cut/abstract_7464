In recent work, Li et al.\ (Comm.\ Math.\ Sci., 7:81-107, 2009) developed a
diffuse-domain method (DDM) for solving partial differential equations in
complex, dynamic geometries with Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary
conditions. The diffuse-domain method uses an implicit representation of the
geometry where the sharp boundary is replaced by a diffuse layer with thickness
$\epsilon$ that is typically proportional to the minimum grid size. The
original equations are reformulated on a larger regular domain and the boundary
conditions are incorporated via singular source terms. The resulting equations
can be solved with standard finite difference and finite element software
packages. Here, we present a matched asymptotic analysis of general
diffuse-domain methods for Neumann and Robin boundary conditions. Our analysis
shows that for certain choices of the boundary condition approximations, the
DDM is second-order accurate in $\epsilon$. However, for other choices the DDM
is only first-order accurate. This helps to explain why the choice of
boundary-condition approximation is important for rapid global convergence and
high accuracy. Our analysis also suggests correction terms that may be added to
yield more accurate diffuse-domain methods. Simple modifications of first-order
boundary condition approximations are proposed to achieve asymptotically
second-order accurate schemes. Our analytic results are confirmed numerically
in the $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms for selected test problems.
