We present a consistent model for the UV and supersoft X-ray emission from
the symbiotic nova SMC3 (=RX J0048.4-7332). Following the present picture of
symbiotic stars, the model consists of radiation from a hot star and an
emission nebula excited by that star. The observations were compared to
theoretical models in which the hot star's emission is calculated with the help
of hydrostatic and Wolf-Rayet-type non-LTE model atmospheres. Our analysis
clearly shows evidence for mass loss rates of several 10^{-6} Msolar/yr. The
minimum effective temperature compatible with both the observed UV and X-ray
flux is about 260000K, which is higher than in any other star analyzed with
sophisticated NLTE model atmospheres.
 Since the hydrostatic surface is hidden by the stellar wind no upper limit for
the temperature can be determined.  However, we were able to determine the
total luminosity of a symbiotic nova with reasonable accuracy
L_SMC3=10^{4.05\pm 0.05} Lsun. This value is well below the Eddington limit
(approx. 50000~Lsun). In order to reproduce the observed energy distribution a
carbon-to-helium ratio >2 10^{-4} --- leading to an absorption edge at
0.39\,keV --- is necessary.
