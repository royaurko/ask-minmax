Let $G$ be a graph with no isolated vertex. In this paper, we study a
parameter that is a relaxation of arguably the most important domination
parameter, namely the total domination number, $\gamma_t(G)$. A set $S$ of
vertices in $G$ is a disjunctive total dominating set of $G$ if every vertex is
adjacent to a vertex of $S$ or has at least two vertices in $S$ at distance2
from it. The disjunctive total domination number, $\gamma^d_t(G)$, is the
minimum cardinality of such a set. We observe that $\gamma^d_t(G) \le
\gamma_t(G)$. We prove that if $G$ is a connected graph of order$n \ge 8$, then
$\gamma^d_t(G) \le 2(n-1)/3$ and we characterize the extremal graphs. It is
known that if $G$ is a connected claw-free graph of order$n$, then $\gamma_t(G)
\le 2n/3$ and this upper bound is tight for arbitrarily large$n$. We show this
upper bound can be improved significantly for the disjunctive total domination
number. We show that if $G$ is a connected claw-free graph of order$n > 10$,
then $\gamma^d_t(G) \le 4n/7$ and we characterize the graphs achieving equality
in this bound.
