2M1938+4603 (KIC 9472174) displays a spectacular light curve dominated by a
strong reflection effect and rather shallow, grazing eclipses. The orbital
period is 0.126 days, the second longest period yet found for an eclipsing
sdB+dM, but still close to the minimum 0.1-d period among such systems. The
phase-folded light curve was used to detrend the orbital effects from the
dataset, and the resulting amplitude spectrum shows a rich collection of
pulsation peaks spanning frequencies from ~50 to 4500 uHz. The presence of a
complex pulsation spectrum in both the p-mode and the g-mode regions has never
been seen before in a compact pulsator. Eclipsing sdB+dM stars are very rare,
with only seven systems known and only one with a pulsating primary. Pulsating
stars in eclipsing binaries are especially important since they permit masses
derived from seismological model fits to be cross checked with orbital mass
constraints. We present a first analysis of this star based on the Kepler
9.7-day commissioning light curve and extensive ground-based photometry and
spectroscopy that allow us to set useful bounds on the system parameters. We
derive a radial-velocity amplitude K_1 = 65.7 +/- 0.6 km/s, inclination angle i
= 69.45 +/- 0.20 degrees, and find that the masses of the components are M_1 =
0.48 +/- 0.03 and M_2 = 0.12 +/- 0.01 solar masses.
