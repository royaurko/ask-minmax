In this report, we assess muon multiple scattering tomography as a
non-destructive inspection technique in several typical areas of interest to
the nuclear power industry, including monitoring concrete degradation, gate
valve conditions, and pipe wall thickness. This work is motivated by the need
for radiographic methods that do not require the licensing, training, and
safety controls of x-rays, and by the need to be able to penetrate considerable
overburden to examine internal details of components that are otherwise
inaccessible, with minimum impact on industrial operations. In some scenarios,
we find that muon tomography may be an attractive alternative to more typical
measurements.
