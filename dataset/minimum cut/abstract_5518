We advocate to create a \emph{spot} Internet transit market, where transit is
sold using the under-utilized backbone capacity at a lower price. The providers
can improve profit by capitalizing the perishable capacity, and customers can
buy transit on-demand without a minimum commitment level for elastic traffic,
and as a result improve its surplus (i.e. utility gains). We conduct a
systematic study of the economical benefits of spot transit both theoretically
and empirically. We propose a simple analytical framework with a general demand
function, and solve the pricing problem of maximizing the expected profit,
taking into account the revenue loss of regular transit when spot transit
traffic hikes. We rigorously prove the price advantage of spot transit, as well
as profit and surplus improvements for tier-1 ISPs and customers, respectively.
Using real-world price data and traffic statistics of 6 IXPs with more than
1000 ISPs, we quantitatively evaluate spot transit and show that significant
financial benefits can be achieved in both absolute and relative terms, robust
to parameter values.
