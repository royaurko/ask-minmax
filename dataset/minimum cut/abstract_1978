A statistical method which uses a combination of two subdetectors to monitor
the luminosity in high energy interactions is presented. To illustrate its
performance, this method was applied to random triggered minimum bias data
collected in the commissioning period of the HERA-B experiment in spring 2000.
It is found that luminosity estimates with an intrinsic systematic error of 3%
can be obtained.
