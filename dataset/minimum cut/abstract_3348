We present maps of the nature of single star progenitors of supernovae and
their remnants in mass and metallicity space. We find our results are similar
to others but we have gone further in varying the amount of mixing and using
various mass-loss schemes to see how the maps change. We find that
extra-mixing, in the form of convective overshooting, moves boundaries such as
the minimum mass for a supernova or WR star to lower masses. We also find that
the pre-WR mass-loss determines the shape of our maps. We find that different
mass-loss rates lead to quite different results. We find that the rise in
luminosity at 2nd dredge-up places quite tight constraints on the masses of
some progenitors and in particular the progenitor of supernova 2003gd.
