Extreme mass-ratio contact binaries with a high degree of overcontact may be
in the late evolutionary stages of the contact phase. Detailed photometric
analyses and orbital period studies of those systems can provide invaluable
information for the coalescence scenario of close binary systems, as recently
observed in V1309 Sco. In this paper the first light curve analysis and period
study for the totally eclipsing contact binary AW CrB is presented. The VRcIc
CCD photometric light curves are analysed by means of the WD code. The
asymmetry of the light curves is modelled by a cool star spot on the primary
component. It is shown that AW CrB has a high degree of overcontact f=75% and
an extreme mass-ratio of q=0.10, placing it among the few contact binaries with
the lowest known mass-ratios. The mean density of the primary component suggest
that it has evolved away from the ZAMS. Eighty-four times of minimum light are
reported, derived from observations available in public archives, the
literature, and the observations presented in this paper. The orbital period
study shows a continuously increasing period, at a rate of dP/dt=3.58x10^-7 d
yr^-1, suggesting a mass transfer from the secondary component to the primary
one, implying a further decreasing mass-ratio.
