We explore empirical relations between three different populations of
high-redshift galaxies and their hosting dark halos employing the halo model
approach. Specifically we consider Lyman-break galaxies at z\sim4 and at
z\sim5, and Lyman-Alpha emitters at z\simeq 4.86. We adopt a halo occupation
function prescription to parameterize the properties of their hosting halos and
the efficiency of halo-dependent star formation. We find that the two LBG
samples are well described by the halo model with an appropriate HOF. We obtain
constraints on properties of their hosting halos. A typical mass of hosting
halos for LBGs is 5\times10^{11}h^{-1}M_\odot and the expected number of LBGs
per halo is \sim0.5, therefore there is an approximate one-to-one
correspondence between halos and LBGs. We also find a sign of the minimum mass
of LBG hosting halos decreasing with time. We discuss implications of these
findings on the star formation history of LBGs. On the other hand, for LAEs,
our simple HOF prescription fails to reproduce simultaneously the observed
angular correlation function and the number density. This might imply either
that the distribution of LAEs within hosting halos differs from that of dark
matter, or that the strong large-scale correlation is due to the existence of
an unusual, large overdense region, and so the survey region is not a
representative of the z\sim5 universe, the definite answer should wait for a
much wider survey of LAEs at high redshifts.
