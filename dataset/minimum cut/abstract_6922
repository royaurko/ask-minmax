The aim of this work is to model the jets produced by conical wire arrays on
the MAGPIE generator, and to design and test new setups to strengthen the link
between laboratory and astrophysical jets. We performed the modelling with
direct three-dimensional magneto-hydro-dynamic numerical simulations using the
code GORGON. We applied our code to the typical MAGPIE setup and we
successfully reproduced the experiments. We found that a minimum resolution of
approximately 100 is required to retrieve the unstable character of the jet. We
investigated the effect of changing the number of wires and found that arrays
with less wires produce more unstable jets, and that this effect has magnetic
origin. Finally, we studied the behaviour of the conical array together with a
conical shield on top of it to reduce the presence of unwanted low density
plasma flows. The resulting jet is shorter and less dense.
