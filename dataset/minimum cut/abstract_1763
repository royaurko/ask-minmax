A two-components mixture fluid which complies with the gamma law is
considered in the framework of inflation with finite temperature. The model is
developed for a quartic scalar potential without symmetry breaking. The
radiation energy density is assumed to be zero when inflation starts and
remains below the GUT temperature during the inflationary stage. Furthermore,
provides the necessary number of e-folds and sufficient radiation energy
density to GUT baryogenesis can take place near the minimum energetic
configuration.
