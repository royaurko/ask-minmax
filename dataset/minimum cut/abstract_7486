We studied ZrO2-La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 pillar matrix thin films which were found to
show anomalous magnetic and electron transport properties controlled by the
amount of ZrO2. With the application of an aberration corrected transmission
electron microscope, structure and chemical information of the system,
especially of the pillar matrix interface were revealed at atomic resolution.
Minor amounts of Zr were found to occupy Mn positions within the matrix and its
solubility within the matrix was found to be less than 6 mol%. Moreover, the Zr
concentration reached minimum concentration at the pillar matrix interface
accompanied by oxygen deficiency. La and Mn diffusion into the pillar was
observed along with a change of the Mn valence state. La and Mn positions
inside ZrO2 pillars were also revealed at atomic resolution. These results
provide detailed information for future studies of macroscopic properties of
these materials.
