We employ genetic algorithms (GA), which allow for an unbiased search for the
global minimum of energy landscapes, to identify the ordered equilibrium
configurations formed by binary dipolar systems confined on a plane. A large
variety of arrangements is identified, the complexity of which grows with
increasing asymmetry between the two components and with growing concentration
of the small particles. The effects of the density are briefly discussed and a
comparison with results obtained via conventional lattice-sum minimization is
presented. Our results can be confirmed by experiments involving Langmuir
monolayers of polystyrene dipolar spheres or super-para-magnetic colloids
confined on the air-water interface and polarized by an external, perpendicular
magnetic field.
