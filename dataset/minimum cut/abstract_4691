New times of minima of the Algol-type eclipsing binary UZ Sge, obtained at
the Athens University Observatory, have been used together with all reliable
timings found in the literature in order to study the period variation and
search for the presence of a third body in the system. Its O-C diagram is
presented and apparent period changes are discussed with respect to possible
Light-Time Effect (LITE) in the system. A least square method has been used to
compute new light elements (updated ephemeris of binary) as well as the mass
function, its minimum mass and the period of a possible third body.
