Regulations impose idiosyncratic capital and funding costs for holding
derivatives. Capital requirements are costly because derivatives desks are
risky businesses; funding is costly in part because regulations increase the
minimum funding tenor. Idiosyncratic costs mean no single measure makes
derivatives martingales for all market participants. Hence Regulatory-compliant
pricing is not risk-neutral. This has implications for exit prices and
mark-to-market.
