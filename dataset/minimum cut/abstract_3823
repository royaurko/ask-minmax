The scalar top discovery potential has been studied with a full-statistics
background simulation for sqrt(s) = 500 GeV and L = 500 fb-1. The simulation is
based on a fast and realistic simulation of a TESLA detector. The large
simulated data sample allowed the application of an Iterative Discriminant
Analysis (IDA) which led to a significantly higher sensitivity than in previous
studies. The effects of beam polarization on signal efficiency and individual
background channels are studied using separate optimization with the IDA for
both polarization states. The beam polarization is very important to measure
the scalar top mixing angle and to determine its mass. Simulating a 180 GeV
scalar top at minimum production cross section, we obtain Delta(m) = 1 GeV and
Delta(cos(theta)) = 0.009.
