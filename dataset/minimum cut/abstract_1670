We report experimental evidence of the existence of two variants of the E'
gamma centers induced in silica by gamma rays at room temperature. The two
variants are distinguishable by the fine features of their line shapes in
paramagnetic resonance spectra. These features suggest that the two E' gamma
differ for their topology. We find a thermally induced interconversion between
the centers with an activation energy of about 34 meV. Hints are also found for
the existence of a structural configuration of minimum energy and of a
metastable state.
