Applying a quark combination model for the hadronization of Quark Gluon
Plasma (QGP) and A Relativistic Transport (ART) model for the subsequent
hadronic rescattering process, we investigate the production of $K^{*0}$ and
$\Sigma^*$ resonances in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV
and 62.4 GeV. The initial $K^{*0}$ produced via hadronization is higher than
the experimental data in the low $p_T$ region and is close to the data at 2-3
GeV/c. We take into account the hadronic rescattering effects which lead to a
strong suppression of $K^{*0}$ with low $p_T$, and find that the $p_T$ spectrum
of $K^{*0}$ can be well described. According to the suppressed magnitude of
$K^{*0}$ yield, the time span of hadronic rescattering stage is estimated to be
about 13 fm/c at 200 GeV and 5 fm/c at 62.4 GeV. The $p_T$ spectrum of
$\Sigma^*$ directly obtained by quark combination hadronization in central
Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV is in well agreement with the experimental data,
which shows a weak hadronic rescattering effects. The elliptic flow v2 of
$\Sigma^*$ in minimum bias Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV and $p_T$ spectrum of
$\Sigma^*$ at lower 62.4 GeV are predicted.
