The `sodalite' network is the edge-skeleton of the uniform tiling in
Euclidean 3-dimensional space by Archimedean tetrakaidecahedra (truncated
octahedra). We develop explicit expressions for its `height' (minimum network
path length from some fixed to given vertex) and `coordination' (content of
network sphere of given height) functions. The final discussion should to some
extent assist in motivating and signposting our proof strategy, in the course
of ruminating on its potential generalisation.
