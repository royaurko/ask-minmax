We look for instanton solutions in a class of two scalar field gravity
models, which includes the low energy string action in four dimensions. In
models where the matter field has a potential with a false vacuum, we find that
non-singular instantons exist as long as the Dilaton field found in string
theory has a potential with a minimum, and provide an example of such an
instanton. The class of singular instanton solutions are also examined, and we
find that depending on the parameter values, the volume factor of the Euclidean
region does not always vanish fast enough at the singularity to make the action
finite.
