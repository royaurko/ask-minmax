Slow parameter drift is common in many systems (e.g., the amount of
greenhouse gases in the terrestrial atmosphere is increasing). In such
situations, the attractor on which the system trajectory lies can be destroyed,
and the trajectory will then go to another attractor of the system. We consider
the case where there are more than one of these possible final attractors, and
we ask whether we can control the outcome (i.e., the attractor that ultimately
captures the trajectory) using only small controlling perturbations.
Specifically, we consider the problem of controlling a noisy system whose
parameter slowly drifts through a saddle-node bifurcation taking place on a
fractal boundary between the basins of multiple attractors. We show that, when
the noise level is low, a small perturbation of size comparable to the noise
amplitude applied at a single point in time can ensure that the system will
evolve toward a target attracting state with high probability. For a range of
noise levels, we find that the minimum size of perturbation required for
control is much smaller within a time period that starts some time after the
bifurcation, providing a "window of opportunity" for driving the system toward
a desirable state. We refer to this procedure as tipping point control.
