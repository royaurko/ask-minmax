We have used the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) in conjunction with the Very
Long Baseline Array (VLBA) Pie Town antenna as a real-time interferometer
system to measure the size of the extragalactic source J1801-231 as a function
of frequency from 1285 to 4885 MHz. These observations were made in an attempt
to determine the effect interstellar scattering has on the observed sizes of OH
(1720 MHz) masers in the nearby (d=2.5 kpc) supernova remnant W28. The
observations clearly show that J1801-231 displays angular broadening due to
turbulence in the Galaxy's interstellar medium. The minimum distance of the
nearby (two arcminutes from J1801-231) pulsar PSR B1758-23 is constrained to be
9.4 +/- 2.4 kpc. This value is based on both the measured size of 220 mas for
J1801-231 at 1715 MHz and the temporal broadening of the pulsar. A single thin
scattering screen along the line of sight to the W28 OH(1720 MHz) masers must
be at 4.7 +/- 1.2 kpc for this minimum pulsar distance. The screen may be
placed closer to the Earth, but for reasonable values of the pulsar distance
(i.e., the pulsar is within the Galaxy), this choice leads to a negligible
scattering contribution to the sizes of the masers. Thus the OH(1720 MHz)
masers, at a distance of 2.5 +/- 0.7 kpc, are unaffected by interstellar
scattering, and the measured maser sizes must be intrinsic. Our measured upper
limits to the size of the pulsar itself are consistent with the distance
estimates to the pulsar and the scattering screen.
