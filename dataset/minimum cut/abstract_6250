Spherically symmetric equal mass star clusters containing a large amount of
primordial binaries are studied using a hybrid method, consisting of a gas
dynamical model for single stars and a Monte Carlo treatment for relaxation of
binaries and the setup of close resonant and fly-by encounters of single stars
with binaries and binaries with each other (three- and four-body encounters).
What differs from our previous work is that each encounter is being integrated
using a highly accurate direct few-body integrator which uses regularized
variables. Hence we can study the systematic evolution of individual binary
orbital parameters (eccentricity, semi-major axis) and differential and total
cross sections for hardening, dissolution or merging of binaries (minimum
distance) from a sampling of several ten thousands of scattering events as they
occur in real cluster evolution including mass segregation of binaries,
gravothermal collapse and reexpansion, binary burning phase and ultimately
gravothermal oscillations. For the first time we are able to present empirical
cross sections for eccentricity variation of binaries in close three- and
four-body encounters. It is found that a large fraction of three-body and
four-body encounters results in merging. Previous cross sections obtained by
Spitzer and Gao for strong encounters can be reproduced, while for weak
encounters non-standard processes like formation of hierarchical triples occur.
