We investigate formation mechanisms for icy super-Earth mass planets orbiting
at 2-20 AU around 0.1-0.5 solar mass stars. A large ensemble of coagulation
calculations demonstrates a new formation channel: disks composed of large
planetesimals with radii of 30-300 km form super-Earths on time scales of
roughly 1 Gyr. In other gas-poor disks, a collisional cascade grinds
planetesimals to dust before the largest planets reach super-Earth masses. Once
icy Earth-mass planets form, they migrate through the leftover swarm of
planetesimals at rates of 0.01-1 AU per Myr. On time scales of 10 Myr to 1 Gyr,
many of these planets migrate through the disk of leftover planetesimals from
semimajor axes of 5-10 AU to 1-2 AU. A few per cent of super-Earths might
migrate to semimajor axes of 0.1-0.2 AU. When the disk has an initial mass
comparable with the minimum mass solar nebula scaled to the mass of the central
star, the predicted frequency of super-Earths matches the observed frequency.
