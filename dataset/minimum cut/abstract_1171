In this paper we present a block coded modulation scheme for a 2 x 2 MIMO
system over slow fading channels, where the inner code is the Golden Code. The
scheme is based on a set partitioning of the Golden Code using two-sided ideals
whose norm is a power of two. In this case, a lower bound for the minimum
determinant is given by the minimum Hamming distance. The description of the
ring structure of the quotients suggests further optimization in order to
improve the overall distribution of determinants. Performance simulations show
that the GC-RS schemes achieve a significant gain over the uncoded Golden Code.
