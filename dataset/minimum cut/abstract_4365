By starting with the simpliest expression of the first order linear wave
equation (Dirac's equation) and by confining the elements of the coefficients
(matrices) to the quaternions, it is shown that the association of the
imaginary bases of the quaternions with three "colors" and their conserved
currents results in quasi-particles with charges of 2/3 and -1/3 with a minimum
of assumptions. It is shown how color neutral particles are required by Q
covariance, first discussed by Finkelstein, et. al. in 1963.
