A typical problem of the leptogenesis scenario is the mismatch between the
maximum reheat temperature implied by gravitino overproduction bound and the
minimum temperature required to create thermally the lightest right-handed
neutrino. We explore the possibility of baryogenesis via leptogenesis in the
presence of low scale mass right-handed neutrino. In such a scenario,
right-handed neutrinos are created thermally at low reheat temperatures without
relying on non-perturbative production mechanisms. We focus on two specific
realizations of the scenario, namely the out-of-equilibrium decay of
right-handed neutrinos (Fukugita-Yanagida) and the leptogenesis via the $LH_u$
flat direction (Affleck-Dine). We find that in general, the two scenarios are
able to produce the required baryon excess for a reasonable amount of CP
violation.
