We propose a novel mechanism for DCC formation in a first-order chiral phase
transition. In this case the effective potential for the chiral order parameter
has a local minimum at $\Phi\sim 0$ in which the chiral field can be
``trapped''. If the expansion is sufficiently fast a bubble of disoriented
chiral field can emerge and decouple from the rest of the fireball. The bubble
may overshoot the mixed phase and subsequently supercool until the barrier
disappears, when the potential resembles that at T=0. This situation
corresponds to the initial condition realized in a ``quench''. Thus, the
subsequent alignment in the vacuum direction leads to strong amplification of
low momentum modes of the pion field. We propose that these DCCs could
accompany the previously suggested baryon rapidity fluctuations.
