A Markov chain model for spatially distributed autocatalytic systems with a
quadratic reaction rate is considered. An approximate solution for the local
probability distribution is obtained in the form of a perturbation expansion
for the regimes where diffusion is relatively fast. Using this approximate
distribution, properties of the chemical wave fronts found in these
autocatalytic systems are studied, and deviations of the minimum propagation
velocity and the concentration profile from deterministic predictions are
analyzed. A comparison with numerical results from lattice-gas automaton
simulations is also provided.
