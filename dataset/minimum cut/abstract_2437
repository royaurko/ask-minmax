We consider time global behavior of solutions to the focusing
mass-subcritical NLS equation in weighted $L^2$ space. We prove that there
exists a threshold solution such that (i) it does not scatter; (ii) with
respect to a certain scale-invariant quantity, this solution attains minimum
value in all non-scattering solutions. In the mass-critical case, it is known
that ground states are this kind of threshold solution. However, in our case,
it turns out that the above threshold solution is not a standing-wave solution.
