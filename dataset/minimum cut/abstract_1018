We study Josephson effect in a ballistic graphene strip of length $L$ smaller
than the superconducting coherence length and arbitrary width $W$. We find that
the dependence of the critical supercurrent $I_{c}$ on $W$ is drastically
different for different types of the edges. For \textit{smooth} and
\textit{armchair} edges at low concentration of the carriers $I_{c}$ decreases
monotonically with decreasing $W/L$ and tends to a constant minimum for a
narrow strip $W/L\lesssim1$. The minimum supercurrent is zero for smooth edges
but has a finite value $e\Delta_{0}/\hbar$ for the armchair edges. At higher
concentration of the carriers, in addition to this overall monotonic variation,
the critical current undergoes a series of peaks with varying $W$. On the other
hand in a strip with \textit{zigzag} edges the supercurrent is half-integer
quantized to $(n+1/2)4e\Delta_{0}/\hbar$, showing a step-wise variation with
$W$.
