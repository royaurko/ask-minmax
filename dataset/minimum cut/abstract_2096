We present a convex formulation of dictionary learning for sparse signal
decomposition. Convexity is obtained by replacing the usual explicit upper
bound on the dictionary size by a convex rank-reducing term similar to the
trace norm. In particular, our formulation introduces an explicit trade-off
between size and sparsity of the decomposition of rectangular matrices. Using a
large set of synthetic examples, we compare the estimation abilities of the
convex and non-convex approaches, showing that while the convex formulation has
a single local minimum, this may lead in some cases to performance which is
inferior to the local minima of the non-convex formulation.
