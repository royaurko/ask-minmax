Motivated by a formula (due to Zelobenko) for finite Lie algebra tensor
products, we propose a reformulation of the Gepner-Witten depth rule.
Implementation of this rule remains difficult, however, since the basis states
convenient for calculating tensor product coefficients do not have a
well-defined depth. To avoid this problem, we present a `crystal depth rule',
that gives a lower bound for the minimum level at which a WZNW fusion appears.
The bound seems to be quite accurate for $su(N>3),$ and for $su(3)$ the rule is
proven to be exact. (Talk presented by M.W. at the XIXth International
Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics.)
