The energy spectrum of cosmic-ray antiprotons from 0.17 to 3.5 GeV has been
measured using 7886 antiprotons detected by BESS-Polar II during a
long-duration flight over Antarctica near solar minimum in December 2007 and
January 2008. This shows good consistency with secondary antiproton
calculations. Cosmologically primary antiprotons have been investigated by
comparing measured and calculated antiproton spectra. BESS-Polar II data show
no evidence of primary antiprotons from evaporation of primordial black holes.
