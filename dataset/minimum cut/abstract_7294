We consider the problem of 20 questions with noise for multiple players under
the minimum entropy criterion in the setting of stochastic search, with
application to target localization. Each player yields a noisy response to a
binary query governed by a certain error probability. First, we propose a
sequential policy for constructing questions that queries each player in
sequence and refines the posterior of the target location. Second, we consider
a joint policy that asks all players questions in parallel at each time instant
and characterize the structure of the optimal policy for constructing the
sequence of questions. This generalizes the single player probabilistic
bisection method for stochastic search problems. Third, we prove an equivalence
between the two schemes showing that, despite the fact that the sequential
scheme has access to a more refined filtration, the joint scheme performs just
as well on average. Fourth, we establish convergence rates of the mean-square
error (MSE) and derive error exponents. Lastly, we obtain an extension to the
case of unknown error probabilities. This framework provides a mathematical
model for incorporating a human in the loop for active machine learning
systems.
