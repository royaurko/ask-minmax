The weak radio source LBDS 53W091 is associated with a very faint (R approx.
24.5) red (R-K approx. 5.8) galaxy. Long spectroscopic integrations with the W.
M. Keck telescope have provided an absorption-line redshift, z=1.552 +/-
0.002. The galaxy has a rest frame ultraviolet spectrum very similar to that of
an F6V star, and a single-burst old stellar population that matches the IR
colors, the optical energy distribution and the spectral discontinuities has a
minimum age of 3.5 Gyr. We present detailed population synthesis analyses of
the observed spectrum in order to estimate the time since the last major epoch
of star formation. We discuss the discrepancies in these estimates resulting
from using different models, subjecting the UV spectrum of M32 to the same
tests as a measure of robustness of these techniques. The models most
consistent with the data tend to yield ages at z=1.55 of >3.5Gyr, similar to
that inferred for the intermediate-age population in M32. Depending upon the
assumed Hubble constant and the value of Omega_0, only certain cosmological
expansion times are consistent with the age of LBDS 53W091; in particular, for
Omega_0=1, only models with H_0 < 45 km/s/Mpc are permitted. For H_0=50
km/s/Mpc and Omega_0=0.2, we derive a formation redshift, z_f >= 5.
