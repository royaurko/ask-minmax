The current big-bang cosmological model requires re-introduction of
Einstein's "regretted" old cosmological constant to fit the astronomical
measurements of supernova Ia magnitude versus redshift. The physical basis of
the cosmological constant and the resulting acceleration of the universe are
not supported by any other physical evidence and some advise caution in rushing
to its acceptance. An altogether new cosmological model with only one
adjustable parameter, the present age of the universe, does provide an
excellent prediction of the supernova measurements without the cosmological
constant. With a minimum description of the new model, a full set of equations
is presented here sufficient to calculate the peak effective magnitude of a
type Ia supernova for an input value of redshift Z and age t0. A full
description of the model, together with many more falsifiable predictions, are
presented elsewhere.
