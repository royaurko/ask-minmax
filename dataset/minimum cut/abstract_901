We consider a generalized discriminant associated to a symmetric space which
generalizes the discriminant of real symmetric matrices, and note that it can
be written as a sum of squares of real polynomials. A method to estimate the
minimum number of squares required to represent the discrimininant is developed
and applied in examples.
