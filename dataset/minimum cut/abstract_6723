HS 0705+6700 is a short-period (P=2.3 hours), close binary containing a hot
sdB-type primary and a fully convective secondary. We have monitored this
eclipsing binary for more than 2 years and as a result, 32 times of light
minimum were obtained. Based on our new eclipse times together with these
compiled from the literature, it is discovered that the O-C curve of HS
0705+6700 shows a cyclic variation with a period of 7.15 years and a
semiamplitude of 92.4 s. The periodic change was analyzed for the light-travel
time effect that may be due to the presence of a tertiary companion. The mass
of the third body is determined to be M3 sin i = 0.0377 (+/-0.0043) Msun when a
total mass of 0.617 Msun for HS 0705+6700 is adopted. For orbital inclinations
i >= 32.8, the mass of the tertiary component would be below the stable
hydrogen-burning limit of M3~0.072 Msun, and thus it would be a brown dwarf.
The third body is orbiting the sdB-type binary at a distance shorter than 3.6
astronomical units (AU). HS 0705+6700 was formed through the evolution of a
common envelope after the primary becomes a red giant. The detection of a
sub-stellar companion in HS 0705+6700 system at this distance from the binary
could give some constraints on stellar evolution in such systems and the
interactions between red giants and their companions.
