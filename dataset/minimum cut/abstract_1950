Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the symmetry that a physical system
possesses, is not preserved for the ground state of the system. Although the
procedure of symmetry breaking is quite clear from the mathematical point of
view, the physical interpretation of the phenomenon is worth to be better
understood. In this note we present a simple and instructive example of the
symmetry breaking in a mechanical system. It demonstrates that the spontaneous
symmetry breaking can occur for the spatially extended solutions in a potential
characterised by a single minimum.
