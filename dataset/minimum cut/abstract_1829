We study the Affleck-Dine mechanism with various types of the Kahler
potential, and investigate whether or not the Affleck-Dine field could acquire
a large VEV as an initial condition for successful baryogenesis. In addition to
a negative Hubble-induced mass term, we find that large enough Hubble-induced
A-terms could also develop the minimum at large amplitude of the field.
Therefore, the Affleck-Dine mechanism works for broader classes of the
theories.
