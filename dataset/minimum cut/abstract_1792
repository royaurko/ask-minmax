We study various methods of constructing fat links based upon the HYP (by
Hasenfratz & Knechtli) and Fat7-bar (by W. Lee) algorithms. We present the
minimum plaquette distribution for these fat links. This enables us to
determine which algorithm is most effective at reducing the spread of plaquette
values - a strong indicator of improved statistics for spectrum and static
potential measurements, among other quantities.
