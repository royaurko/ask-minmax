The two stars that form the subject of this paper are both short-period
double- lined eclipsing binaries having non-circular orbits despite their short
periods. Although the HD type of HD 152028 is G0, the integrated spectral type
of the system must actually be much earlier: the B-V colour index is only about
0.37 mag and the parallax indicates an integrated absolute magnitude as bright
as +1.4 mag. A published photometric investigation suggests that the primary
star exhibits delta Scuti pulsations, with a period of 0.1138 days. That period
is not present in the radial velocities, but we have identified a comparable
periodicity in the initially excessive residuals (sigma of the order of 2 km/s)
in the radial velocities of the primary star: there is an asymmetrical
pulsational velocity curve with a semi-amplitude of about 3 km/s and a period
of 0.1178 days. HDE 284195 was not observed by Hipparcos, but its HDE type of
G0 is in reasonable agreement with its colour and the nature of its
radial-velocity traces. The rotations of both stars appear to be
pseudo-synchronized to the orbit. The orbital inclinations are not formally
determined but they must be very high,however and there is specific evidence
that the inclination of HD 152028 is very close to 90 degrees,so it is
permissible to assume that the masses are scarcely above the minimum values,
which in the case of HD 152028 are 1.78 and 1.42 solar mass and in that of HDE
284195 are 1.10 and 1.01 solar mass, with uncertainties below 1%.(ABRIDGED)
