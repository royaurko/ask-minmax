The CCD photometric observations of the eclipsing binary PS Persei (PS Per)
were obtained on two consecutive days in 2009. The 2003 version Wilson-Devinney
code was used to analyze the first complete light curves in $V$ and $R$ bands.
It is found that PS Per is a short-period Algol-type binary with the less
massive component accurately filling its inner critical Roche lobe. The mass
ratio of $q=0.518$ and the orbital inclination of $i=89.^{\circ}86$ are
obtained. On the other hand, based on all available times of primary light
minimum including two new ones, the orbital period has been improved.
