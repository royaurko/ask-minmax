The $p_{\rm T}$-differential production cross section of electrons from
semileptonic decays of heavy-flavor hadrons has been measured at mid-rapidity
in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ TeV in the transverse momentum
range 0.5 < $p_{\rm T}$ < 12 GeV/$c$ with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The
analysis was performed using minimum bias events and events triggered by the
electromagnetic calorimeter. Predictions from perturbative QCD calculations
agree with the data within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties.
