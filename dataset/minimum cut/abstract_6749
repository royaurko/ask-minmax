We present the spectroscopic orbit solutions of three double-lines eclipsing
binaries, BG Ind, IM Mon and RS Sgr. The first precise radial velocities (RVs)
of the components were determined using high resolution echelle spectra
obtained at Mt. John University Observatory in New Zealand. The RVs of the
components of BG Ind and RS Sgr were measured using Gaussian fittings to the
selected spectral lines, whereas two-dimensional cross-correlation technique
was preferred to determine the RVs of IM Mon since it has relatively short
orbital period among the other targets and so blending of the lines is more
effective. For all systems, the Keplerian orbital solution was used during the
analysis and also circular orbit was adopted because the eccentricities for all
targets were found to be negligible. The first precise orbit analysis of these
systems gives the mass ratios of the systems as 0.894, 0.606 and 0.325,
respectively for BG Ind, IM Mon and RS Sgr. Comparison of the mass ratio
values, orbital sizes and minimum masses of the components of the systems
indicates that all systems should have different physical, dynamical and
probable evolutionary status.
