Phase transitions induced by high temperatures and strong magnetic fields are
investigated in the Standard model. The consistent effective potential
including the one-loop and ring diagram contributions is calculated and
investigated for the wide range of the fields, temperatures and Higgs boson
mass $m_H$. All other particles - fermions and bosons - are taken into account
with actual values of their masses. This effective potential is real at
sufficiently high temperatures . It is shown that symmetry restoration is a
first type phase transition for $m_H < 70 $ Gev . For heavier Higgs particles
and the field strengths $H > 0.1 \cdot 10^{24} G $ the local electroweak
minimum could not be realized at all. Hence, the upper limit on the Higgs mass
as well as the limit on the field strengths in the phase transition epoch
follow.
