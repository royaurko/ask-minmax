The magnetic field dependence of the spin-susceptibility, $\chi_{s}$ was
measured in the superconducting state of high purity MgB$_{2}$ fine powders
below 1.3 T. $\chi_{s}$ was determined from the intensity of the conduction
electron spin resonance spectra at 3.8, 9.4, and 35 GHz. At the lowest magnetic
fields (0.14 T), a gap opens in the density of states at the Fermi energy and,
accordingly, $\chi_{s}(T)$ is small at low temperatures. Fields above 0.2 T
(about 15 % of $H^{c}_{c2}$, the minimum upper critical field), destroy the
gap. The field induced $\chi_{s}$ is much larger than expected from current
superconductor models of MgB$_{2}$.
