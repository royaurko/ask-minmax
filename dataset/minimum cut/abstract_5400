We present photometry obtained during the 2012 May and September outbursts of
the frequently outbursting dwarf nova, V1227 Her. Superhumps were present in
both cases with a peak-to peak amplitude of up to 0.28 mag, showing these
events to be superoutbursts. We show for the first time that the system
undergoes small eclipses with a depth of up to 0.08 mag, lasting 11 to 14 min,
which are likely to be grazing eclipses of the accretion disc. The September
outburst was the better observed of the two and lasted at least 14 days with an
outburst amplitude of approximately 4 magnitudes. The mean superhump period was
Psh = 0.065103(20) d. Analysis of eclipse times of minimum gave an orbital
period Porb = 0.064419(26) d, although there is some ambiguity due to the
relatively short time over which the eclipses were observed. The fractional
superhump period excess, epsilon, was 0.0106(7).
