We present the results of a comparative study of HI narrow self-absorption
(HINSA), OH, 13CO, and C18O in five dark clouds. The HINSA follows the
distribution of the emission of the carbon monoxide isotopologues, and has a
characteristic size close to that of 13CO. This confirms that the HINSA is
produced by cold HI which is well mixed with molecular gas in well-shielded
regions. The ratio of the atomic hydrogen density to total proton density for
these sources is 5 to 27 x 10^{-4}. Using cloud temperatures and the density of
HI, we set an upper limit to the cosmic ray ionization rate of 10^{-16} s^{-1}.
Comparison of observed and modeled fractional HI abundances indicates ages for
these clouds to be 10^{6.5} to 10^{7} yr. The low values of the HI density we
have determined make it certain that the time scale for evolution from an
atomic to an almost entirely molecular phase, must be a minimum of several
million years. This clearly sets a lower limit to the overall time scale for
star formation and the lifetime of molecular clouds.
