The vacuum state of SU(3) gluodynamics at high temperature is investigated. A
consistent approach including the calculation of either the spontaneously
generated constant chromomagnetic isotopic $H_{3}$ and hypercharge $H_{8}$
fields or the polarization operator of charged gluons in this background is
applied. It is shown within the effective potential including the one-loop plus
daisy diagrams that the specific values of the fields deliver a global minimum
to free energy. The spectrum of the transversal charged modes is stable at high
temperature due to a gluon magnetic mass accounting for the vacuum fields. This
leads to stable chromomagnetic fields in the deconfinement phase of QCD. A
comparison with the results of other approaches is done.
