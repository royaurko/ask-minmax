We calculate the expected angular power spectrum of the temperature
fluctuations in the microwave background radiation (MBR) generated in the
quasi-steady state cosmology (QSSC). The paper begins with a brief description
of how the background is produced and thermalized in the QSSC. We then discuss
within the framework of a simple model, the likely sources of fluctuations in
the background due to astrophysical and cosmological causes. Power spectrum
peaks at $l \approx 6-10$, 180-220 and 600-900 are shown to be related in this
cosmology respectively to curvature effects at the last minimum of the scale
factor, clusters and groups of galaxies. The effect of clusters is shown to be
related to their distribution in space as indicated by a toy model of structure
formation in the QSSC. We derive and parameterize the angular power spectrum
using six parameters related to the sources of temperature fluctuations at
three characteristic scales. We are able to obtain a satisfactory fit to the
observational band power estimates of MBR temperature fluctuation spectrum.
Moreover, the values of `best fit' parameters are consistent with the range of
expected values.
