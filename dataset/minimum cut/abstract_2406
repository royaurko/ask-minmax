We prove that the number of Hamilton cycles in the random graph G(n,p) is
n!p^n(1+o(1))^n a.a.s., provided that p\geq (ln n+ln ln n+\omega(1))/n.
Furthermore, we prove the hitting-time version of this statement, showing that
in the random graph process, the edge that creates a graph of minimum degree 2
creates (ln n/e)^n(1+o(1))^n Hamilton cycles a.a.s.
