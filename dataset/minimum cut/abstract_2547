We focus on three different convexity principles for local and nonlocal
variational integrals. We prove various generalizations of them, as well as
their equivalences. Some applications to nonlinear eigenvalue problems and
Hardy-type inequalities are given. We also prove a measure-theoretic minimum
principle for nonlocal and nonlinear positive eigenfunctions.
