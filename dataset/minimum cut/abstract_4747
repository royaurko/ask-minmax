Given an ideal $I$ on $\omega$ let $a(I) $ ($\bar{a}(I)$) be minimum of the
cardinalities of infinite (uncountable) maximal $I$-almost disjoint subsets of
$[{\omega}]^{\omega}$, and denote $b_I$ and$d_I$ the unbounding and dominating
numbers of $(\omega^\omega,\le_I)$.
  We show that (1) $a(I)>omega$ if $I$ is a summable ideal; (2) $a(Z)=\omega$
and $\bar{a}(Z)\le a$ if $Z$ is a tall density ideal, (3) $b\le \bar{a}(I)$,
and $b_I=b$ and $d_I=d$, for any analytic P-ideal $I$ on $\omega$. Given an
analytic $P$-ideal $I$ we investigate the relationship between the Sack, the
$I$-bounding, $I$-dominating and ${\omega}^{\omega}$-bounding properties of a
given poset $P$. For example, for the density zero ideal $Z$ we can prove: (i)
a poset $P$ is $Z$-bounding iff it has the Sacks property, (ii) if $P$ adds a
slalom capturing all ground model reals then $P$ is $Z$-dominating.
