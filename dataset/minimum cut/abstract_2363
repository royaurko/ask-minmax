The magnetic compensation phenomenon has been explored in the
Pr(1-x)Gd(x)Al(2) series. The contributions from Pr and Gd moments compensate
each other at a specific temperature in the ordered state (below (T(c)). At
high fields, the magnetic reorientation (with respect to the external field
direction) of the Pr and Gd moments appears as a minimum in the thermomagnetic
response. We demonstrate several interesting attributes related with the
magnetic reorienation phenomenon, viz., oscillatory behavior of the
magneto-resistance, sign change of the anamalous Hall resistivity, fingerprints
of field induced changes in the specific heat and ac-susceptibility data.
