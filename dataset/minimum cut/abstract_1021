Dissolving armored bubbles stabilize with nonspherical shapes by jamming the
initially Brownian particles adsorbed on their interfaces. In a gas-saturated
solution, these shapes are characterized by planar facets or folds for
decreasing ratios of the particle to bubble radii. We perform numerical
simulations that mimic dissolution, and show that the faceted shape represents
a local minimum of energy during volume reduction. This minimum is marked by
the vanishing of the Laplace overpressure $\Delta P$, which together with the
existence of a $V$-interval where $d\Delta P/dV>0$ guarantees stability against
dissolution. The reduction of $\Delta P$ is due to the saddle-shape deformation
of most of the interface which accompanies the reduction in the mean curvature
of the interface.
