In this work, the residual complexity (RC) similarity measure, is employed
for time delay estimation (TDE) in gas pipe leak localization. The properties
of TDE by RC is compared with those of Cross Correlation(CC) and Mutual
Information(MI) similarity measures on our experimental data. The comparison
confirms the advantages of RC relative to CC and MI, in robustness against both
correlated noises and reduction of number of samples. These advantages
originate from not only its mathematical nature of RC similarity measure which
considers inter-dependency but also from broadband frequency of acoustic waves
propagating during gas pipes.
