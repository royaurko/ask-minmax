In this paper, an Eigenvector based system has been presented to recognize
facial expressions from digital facial images. In the approach, firstly the
images were acquired and cropping of five significant portions from the image
was performed to extract and store the Eigenvectors specific to the
expressions. The Eigenvectors for the test images were also computed, and
finally the input facial image was recognized when similarity was obtained by
calculating the minimum Euclidean distance between the test image and the
different expressions.
