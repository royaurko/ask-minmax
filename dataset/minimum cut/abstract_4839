This paper describes a computationally inexpensive and efficient generic
summarization algorithm for Arabic texts. The algorithm belongs to extractive
summarization family, which reduces the problem into representative sentences
identification and extraction sub-problems. Important keyphrases of the
document to be summarized are identified employing combinations of statistical
and linguistic features. The sentence extraction algorithm exploits keyphrases
as the primary attributes to rank a sentence. The present experimental work,
demonstrates different techniques for achieving various summarization goals
including: informative richness, coverage of both main and auxiliary topics,
and keeping redundancy to a minimum. A scoring scheme is then adopted that
balances between these summarization goals. To evaluate the resulted Arabic
summaries with well-established systems, aligned English/Arabic texts are used
through the experiments.
