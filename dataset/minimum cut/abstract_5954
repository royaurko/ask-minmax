We review CP properties of the Two-Higgs-Doublet model. In particular, we
show that spontaneous CP violation occurs in the parameter space on the border
between regions allowing explicit CP violation and those where there is another
minimum, deeper than the one corresponding to v=246 GeV. We discuss weak-basis
invariants which describe CP violation and express them through measurable
quantities like coupling constants and masses. Also, we discuss how CP
violation is constrained by the LHC Higgs data. Finally, we identify effective
operators that could be adopted to measure CP-invariants.
