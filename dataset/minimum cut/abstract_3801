Inclusive single jet production in hadron collisions is considered. It is
shown that the QCD parton model predicts a nonmonotonic dependence of the
inclusive cross section on the fraction of the energy deposited in the jet
registered, if it is normalized on the same cross section measured at another
collision energy. Specifically, if the cross section is normalized by the one
measured at a higher collision energy, it possesses a minimum which depends on
jet rapidity. This prediction can be tested at the Fermilab Tevatron, at the
CERN LHC, and at the Very Large Hadron Collider under discussion.
