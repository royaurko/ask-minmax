The short-lived $K(892)^{*}$ resonance provides an efficient tool to probe
properties of the hot and dense medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions. We report measurements of $K^{*}$ in $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV
Au+Au and $p+p$ collisions reconstructed via its hadronic decay channels
$K(892)^{*0} \to K\pi$ and $K(892)^{*\pm} \to K_S^0\pi^{\pm}$ using the STAR
detector at RHIC. The $K^{*0}$ mass has been studied as a function of $p_T$ in
minimum bias $p+p$ and central Au+Au collisions. The $K^{*}$ $p_T$ spectra for
minimum bias $p+p$ interactions and for Au+Au collisions in different
centralities are presented. The $K^{*}/K$ yield ratios for all centralities in
Au+Au collisions are found to be significantly lower than the ratio in minimum
bias $p+p$ collisions, indicating the importance of hadronic interactions
between chemical and kinetic freeze-outs. A significant non-zero $K^{*0}$
elliptic flow ($v_2$) is observed in Au+Au collisions and compared to the
$K_S^0$ and $\Lambda$ $v_2$. The nuclear modification factor of $K^{*}$ at
intermediate $p_{T}$ is similar to that of $K_{S}^{0}$, but different from
$\Lambda$. This establishes a baryon-meson effect over a mass effect in the
particle production at intermediate $p_T$ ($2 < p_T \leq 4$ GeV/$c$).
