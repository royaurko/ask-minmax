In ordinal evaluations of proposals in peer review systems, a set of
proposals is assigned to a fixed set of referees so as to maximize the number
of pairwise comparisons of proposals under certain referee capacity and
proposal subject constraints. In this paper, the following two related problems
are considered: (1) Assuming that each referee has a capacity to review k out
of n proposals, 2 < k < n, determine the minimum number of referees needed to
ensure that each pair of proposals is reviewed by at least one referee, (2)
Find an assignment that meets the lower bound determined in (1). It is easy to
see that one referee is both necessary and sufficient when k = n, and n(n-1)/2
referees are both necessary and sufficient when k = 2. We show that 6 referees
are both necessary and sufficient when k = n/2. We further show that 11
referees are necessary and 12 are sufficient when k = n/3, and 18 referees are
necessary and 20 referees are sufficient when k = n/4. A more general lower
bound of n(n-1)/k(k-1) referees is also given for any k, 2 < k < n, and an
assignment asymptotically matching this lower bound within a factor of 2 is
presented. These results are not only theoretically interesting but they also
provide practical methods for efficient assignments of proposals to referees.
