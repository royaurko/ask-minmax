A new kind of deformed calculus was introduced recently in studying of
parabosonic coordinate representation. Based on this deformed calculus, a new
deformation of Hermite polynomials is proposed, its some properties such as
generating function, orthonormality, differential and integral representaions,
and recursion relations are also discussed in this paper. As its applications,
we calculate explicit forms of parabose squeezed number states, derive a
particularly simple subset of minimum uncertainty states for parabose
amplitude-squared squeezing, and discuss their basic squeezing behaviours.
