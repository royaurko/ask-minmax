The relation between the geometry of refrigeration cycles and their
performance is explored. The model studied is based on a coupled spin system.
Small cycle times termed sudden refrigerators, develop coherence and inner
friction. We explore the interplay between coherence and energy of the working
medium employing a family of sudden cycles with decreasing cycle times. At the
point of minimum ratio between energy and coherence the cycle changes geometry.
This region of cycle times is characterised by short circuit cycles where heat
is dissipated both to the hot and cold baths. We rationalise the cycle change
of geometry as a result of a half integer quantisation which maximises
coherence. From this point on, increasing or decreasing the cycle time,
eventually leads to refrigeration cycles. The transition point between
refrigerators and short circuit cycles is characterised by a transition from
?finite to singular dynamical temperature. Extremely short cycle times reach a
universal limit where all cycles types are equivalent.
