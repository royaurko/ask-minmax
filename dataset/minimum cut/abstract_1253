Mars was observed in X-rays during April 3-5 2008 for 82 ksec with the
Japanese Suzaku observatory. Mars has been known to emit X-rays via the
scattering of solar X-rays and via the charge exchange between neutral atoms in
the exosphere and solar wind ions. Past theoretical studies suggest that the
exospheric neutral density may vary by a factor of up to 10 over the solar
cycle. To investigate a potential change of the exospheric charge exchange
emission, Mars was observed with Suzaku at solar minimum. Significant signals
were not detected at the position of Mars in the energy band of 0.2-5 keV. A 2
sigma upper limit of the O VII line flux in 0.5-0.65 keV was 4.3$\times10^{-5}$
ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Comparing this upper limit to the past Chandra and
XMM-Newton observations conducted near solar maximum, it was found that the
exospheric density at solar minimum does not exceed that near solar maximum by
more than 6-70 times.
