The isoperimetric constant of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, $i(G)$, is the
minimum of $\frac{|\partial S|}{|S|}$, taken over all nonempty subsets
$S\subset V(G)$ of size at most $n/2$, where $\partial S$ denotes the set of
edges with precisely one end in $S$. A random graph process on $n$ vertices,
$\widetilde{G}(t)$, is a sequence of $\binom{n}{2}$ graphs, where
$\widetilde{G}(0)$ is the edgeless graph on $n$ vertices, and
$\widetilde{G}(t)$ is the result of adding an edge to $\widetilde{G}(t-1)$,
uniformly distributed over all the missing edges. We show that in almost every
graph process $i(\widetilde{G}(t))$ equals the minimal degree of
$\widetilde{G}(t)$ as long as the minimal degree is $o(\log n)$. Furthermore,
we show that this result is essentially best possible, by demonstrating that
along the period in which the minimum degree is typically $\Theta(\log n)$, the
ratio between the isoperimetric constant and the minimum degree falls from 1 to
1/2, its final value.
