We study self-consistent D=4 gravity-matter systems coupled to a new class of
Weyl-conformally invariant lightlike branes (WILL}-branes). The latter serve as
material and charged source for gravity and electromagnetism. Further, due to
the natural coupling to a 3-index antisymmetric tensor gauge field, the
WILL-brane dynamically produces a space-varying bulk cosmological constant. We
find static spherically-symmetric solutions where the space-time consists of
two regions with black-hole-type geometries separated by the WILL-brane which
"straddles" their common event horizon and, therefore, provides an explicit
dynamical realization of the "membrane paradigm" in black hole physics.
Finally, by matching via WILL-brane of internal Schwarzschild-de-Sitter with
external Reissner-Nordstrom-de-Sitter (or external
Schwarzschild-de-Sitter)geometries we discover the emergence of a potential
"well" for infalling test particles in the vicinity of the WILL-brane (the
common horizon) with a minimum on the brane itself.
