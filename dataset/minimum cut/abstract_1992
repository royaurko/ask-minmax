Recently, entanglement teleportation has been investigated in Phys. Rev.
Lett. 84, 4236 (2000). In this paper we study entanglement teleportation via
two separate thermally entangled states of two-qubit Heisenberg XX chain. We
established the condition under which the parameters of the model have to
satisfy in order to teleport entanglement. The necessary minimum amount of
thermal entanglement for some fixed strength of exchange coupling is a function
of the magnetic field and temperature.
