In a recent paper, K. Raschel and R. Garbit proved that the exponential
decreasing rate of the probability that a random walk (with all exponential
moments) stays in a $d$-dimensional orthant is given by the minimum on this
orthant of the Laplace transform of the random walk increments, as soon as this
minimum exists. In other cases, the random walk is "badly oriented," and the
exponential rate may depend on the starting point $x$. We prove here that this
rate is nevertheless asymptotically equal to the infimum of the Laplace
transform, as some selected coordinates of $x$ tend to infinity.
