We present a proposal for a gravitational wave detector, based on the
excitation of an electromagnetic mode in a resonance cavity. The mode is
excited due to the interaction between a large amplitude electromagnetic mode
and a quasi-monochromatic gravitational wave. The minimum metric perturbation
needed for detection is estimated to the order 7.10^(-23) using current data on
superconducting niobium cavities. Using this value together with different
standard models predicting the occurrence of merging neutron star or black hole
binaries, the corresponding detection rate is estimated to 1-20 events per
year, with a `table top' cavity of a few meters length.
