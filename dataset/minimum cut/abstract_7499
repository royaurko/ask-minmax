The distinguishing number of a graph $G$ is a symmetry related graph
invariant whose study started a decade ago. The distinguishing number $D(G)$ is
the least integer $d$ such that $G$ has a $d$-distinguishing colouring. A
$d$-distinguishing colouring is a colouring $c:V(G)\rightarrow\{1,...,d\}$
invariant only under the trivial automorphism. In this paper, we introduce a
game variant of this invariant.
  The distinguishing game is a game with two players, the Gentle and the
Rascal, with antagonist goals. This game is played on a graph $G$ with a set of
$d\in\mathbb{N}^*$ colours. Alternatively, the two players choose a vertex of
$G$ and colour it with one of the $d$ colours. The game ends when all the
vertices have been coloured. Then the Gentle wins if the colouring is
$d$-distinguishing and the Rascal wins otherwise. This game leads to a
definition of two new invariants for a graph $G$, which are the minimum numbers
of colours needed to ensure that the Gentle has a winning strategy, depending
on who starts. Those invariants could be infinite, thus we start by giving
sufficient conditions to have infinite distinguishing number. After that, we
compute those numbers for the cycles. Improving the strategy used for even
cycles, we define a class of graphs, the involutive graphs, for which the game
distinguishing number is at most quadratic in the classical distinguishing
invariant. We finaly use this result to compute the exact value of those
invariants in the case of hypercubes.
