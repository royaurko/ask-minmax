The acoustic nucleation threshold for bubbles trapped in cavities has
theoretically been predicted within the crevice theory by Atchley & Prosperetti
[J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 86, 1065-1084 (1989)]. Here, we determine this threshold
experimentally, by applying a single pressure pulse to bubbles trapped in
cylindrical nanoscopic pits ("artificial crevices") with radii down to 50 nm.
By decreasing the minimum pressure stepwise, we observe the threshold for which
the bubbles start to nucleate. The experimental results are quantitatively in
excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of Atchley & Prosperetti.
In addition, we provide the mechanism which explains the deactivation of
cavitation nuclei: gas diffusion together with an aspherical bubble collapse.
Finally, we present superhydrophobic nuclei which cannot be deactivated, unless
with a high-speed liquid jet directed into the pit.
