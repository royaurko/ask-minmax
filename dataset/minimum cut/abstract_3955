In this paper we first give a simple parametrization of the scalar coset
manifold of the only known anomaly free chiral gauged supergravity in six
dimensions in the absence of linear multiplets, namely gauged minimal
supergravity coupled to a tensor multiplet, E_6 x E_7 x U(1)_R Yang-Mills
multiplets and suitable number of hypermultiplets. We then construct the
potential for the scalars and show that it has a unique minimum at the origin.
We also construct a new BPS dyonic string solution in which U(1)_R x U(1) gauge
fields, in addition to the metric, dilaton and the 2-form potential, assume
nontrivial configurations in any U(1)_R gauged 6D minimal supergravity coupled
to a tensor multiplet with gauge symmetry G\supseteq U(1). The solution
preserves 1/4 of the 6D supersymmetries and can be trivially embedded in the
anomaly free model, in which case the U(1) activated in our solution resides in
E_7.
