Following the lines of the analysis done in [BPZ07, BCF07] for first-order
G\"odel logics, we present an analogous investigation for Nilpotent Minimum
logic NM. We study decidability and reciprocal inclusion of various sets of
first-order tautologies of some subalgebras of the standard Nilpotent Minimum
algebra. We establish a connection between the validity in an NM-chain of
certain first-order formulas and its order type. Furthermore, we analyze
axiomatizability, undecidability and the monadic fragments.
