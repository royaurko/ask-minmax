In this paper, we have studied nonstationary radiative spherically symmetric
spacetime, in general covariant theory ($U(1)$ extension) of {the}
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with the minimum coupling, in the post-newtonian
approximation (PPN), without the projectability condition and in the infrared
limit. The Newtonian prepotential $\varphi$ was assumed null. We have shown
that there is not the analogue of the Vaidya's solution in the
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Theory (HLT) with the minimum coupling, as we know in the
General Relativity Theory (GRT).
