An extensive model-independent analysis of B->DD decays is carried out
employing SU(3) flavour symmetry, including symmetry-breaking corrections.
Several theoretically clean observables are identified which allow for testing
the Standard Model. These include the known time-dependent CP asymmetries, the
penguin pollution of which can be controlled in this framework, but notably
also quasi-isospin relations which are experimentally well accessible and
unaffected by symmetry-breaking corrections. Theoretical assumptions can be
kept to a minimum and controlled by additional sum rules. Available data are
used in global fits to predict the branching ratio for the B0->DsDs decay as
well as several CP asymmetries which have not been measured so far, and future
prospects are analyzed.
