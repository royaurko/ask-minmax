An optical spectral singularity is a zero-width resonance that corresponds to
lasing at threshold gain. Its time-reversal causes coherent perfect absorption
of light and forms the theoretical basis of antilasing. In this article we
explore optical spectral singularities of a two-layer spherical medium. In
particular, we examine the cases that a gain medium is coated by a thin layer
of high-refractive index glass and a spherical glass covered by a layer of gain
material. In the former case, the coating reduces the minimum radius required
for exciting spectral singularities and gives rise to the formation of clusters
of spectral singularities separated by wide spectral gaps. In the latter case,
the coating leads to a doubling of the number of spectral singularities.
