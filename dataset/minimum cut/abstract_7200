Recently, we have demonstrated that for a certain class of Casimir-type
systems ("devices") the energy of zero-point vacuum fluctuations reaches its
global minimum when the device rotates about a certain axis rather than remains
static. This rotational vacuum effect may lead to the emergence of permanently
rotating objects provided the negative rotational energy of zero-point
fluctuations cancels the positive rotational energy of the device itself. In
this paper, we show that for massless electrically charged particles the
rotational vacuum effect should be drastically (astronomically) enhanced in the
presence of a magnetic field. As an illustration, we show that in a background
of experimentally available magnetic fields the zero-point energy of massless
excitations in rotating torus-shaped doped carbon nanotubes may indeed
overwhelm the classical energy of rotation for certain angular frequencies so
that the permanently rotating state is energetically favored. The suggested
"zero-point driven" devices -- which have no internally moving parts --
correspond to a perpetuum mobile of a new, fourth kind: They do not produce any
work despite the fact that their equilibrium (ground) state corresponds to a
permanent rotation even in the presence of an external environment. We show
that our proposal is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics.
