We show the existence of new stable ring-like localized scalar field
configurations whose stability is due to a combination of topological and
nontopological charges. In that sense these defects may be called
semitopological. These rings are Noether charged and also carry Noether current
(they are superconducting). They are local minima of the energy in scalar field
theories with an unbroken U(1) global symmetry. We obtain numerical solutions
of the field configuration corresponding to large rings and derive virial
theorems demonstrating their stability. We also derive the minimum energy field
configurations in 3D and simulate the evolution of a finite size Q ring on a
three dimensional lattice thus generalizing our demonstration of stability.
