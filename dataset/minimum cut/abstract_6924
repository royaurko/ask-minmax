A {\it gauge invariant} combination of LLe {\it sleptons} within the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model is one of the few inflaton candidates that can
naturally explain population of the observable sector and creation of matter
after inflation. After the end of inflation, the inflaton oscillates coherently
about the minimum of its potential, which is a point of {\it enhanced gauged
symmetry}. This results in bursts of non-perturbative production of the
gauge/gaugino and (s)lepton quanta. The subsequent decay of these quanta is
very fast and leads to an extremely efficient transfer of the inflaton energy
to (s)quarks via {\it instant} preheating. Around 20% of the inflaton energy
density is drained during every inflaton oscillation. However, all of the
Standard Model degrees of freedom (and their supersymmetric partners) {\it do
not} thermalize immediately, since the large inflaton vacuum expectation value
breaks the electroweak symmetry. After about 100 oscillations -- albeit within
one Hubble time -- the amplitude of inflaton oscillations becomes sufficiently
small, and all of the degrees of freedom will thermalize. This provides by far
the most efficient reheating of the universe with the observed degrees of
freedom.
