Josephson plasma excitations in the high $T_c$ superconductor
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ have been investigated in a wide microwave
frequency region (9.8 -- 75 GHz), in particular, in magnetic field applied
parallel to the $ab$ plane of the single crystal. In sharp contrast to the case
for magnetic fields parallel to the c axis or tilted from the $ab$ plane, it
was found that there are two kinds of resonance modes, which are split in
energy and possess two distinctly different magnetic field dependences. One
always lies higher in energy than the other and has a shallow minimum at about
0.8 kOe, then increases linearly with magnetic field. On the other hand,
another mode begins to appear only in a magnetic field (from a few kOe and
higher) and has a weakly decreasing tendency with increasing magnetic field. By
comparing with a recent theoretical model the higher energy mode can naturally
be attributed to the Josephson plasma resonance mode propagating along the
primitive reciprocal lattice vector of the Josephson vortex lattice, whereas
the lower frequency mode is assigned to the novel phase collective mode of the
Josephson vortex lattice, which has never been observed before.
