We present a minimum hypothesis model for an IMF that resembles a lognormal
distribution at low masses but has a distinct power-law tail. Even if the
central limit theorem ensures a lognormal distribution of condensation masses
at birth, a power-law tail in the distribution arises due to accretion from the
ambient cloud, coupled with a non-uniform (exponential) distribution of
accretion times.
