Aims. We analyze the surroundings of HD 97300, one of two intermediate-mass
stars in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. The star is known to be
surrounded by a conspicuous ring of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
  Methods. We present infrared images taken with Herschel and Spitzer using 11
different broad-band filters between 3.6 um and 500 um. We compare the
morphology of the emission using cuts along different position angles. We
construct spectral energy distributions, which we compare to different dust
models, and calculate dust temperatures. We also derive opacity maps and
analyze the density structure of the environment of HD 97300.
  Results. We find that HD 97300 has no infrared excess at or below 24 um,
confirming its zero-age main-sequence nature. The morphology of the ring is
very similar between 3.6 um and 24 um. The emission at these wavelengths is
dominated by either PAH features or PAH continuum. At longer wavelengths, only
the northwestern part of the ring is visible. A fit to the 100-500 um
observations suggests that the emission is due to relatively warm (~26 K) dust.
The temperature gradually decreases with increasing distance from the ring. We
find a general decrease in the density from north to south, and an approximate
10% density increase in the northeastern part of the ring.
  Conclusions. Our results are consistent with the theory that the ring around
HD 97300 is essentially a bubble blown into the surrounding interstellar matter
and heated by the star.
