The structure of collective states and quasi-particle excitations in
$^{68}$Se is analyzed by using the projected shell model. It is found that the
$g_{9/2}$ orbitals play a decisive role for the structure of this nucleus. At
the prolate minimum, alignment of the low-K states causes the observed first
backbending in moment of inertia and we predict a second backbending that has
not yet been reported. At the oblate minimum, quasi-particles having high-K can
form long-lived isomeric states. The structure of $^{68}$Se is discussed with
respect to the isomers and their possible impact on the determination of its
nuclear mass.
