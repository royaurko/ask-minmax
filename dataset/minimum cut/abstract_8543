Charged particle multiplicities are studied in proton-proton collisions in
the forward region at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 7\;$TeV with data
collected by the LHCb detector. The forward spectrometer allows access to a
kinematic range of $2.0<\eta<4.8$ in pseudorapidity, momenta down to
$2\;$GeV/$c$ and transverse momenta down to $0.2\;$GeV/$c$. The measurements
are performed using minimum-bias events with at least one charged particle in
the kinematic acceptance. The results are presented as functions of
pseudorapidity and transverse momentum and are compared to predictions from
several Monte Carlo event generators.
