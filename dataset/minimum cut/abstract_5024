We report the detection of two new planets from the Anglo-Australian Planet
Search. These planets orbit two stars each previously known to host one planet.
The new planet orbiting HD 142 has a period of 6005\pm427 days, and a minimum
mass of 5.3M_Jup. HD142c is thus a new Jupiter analog: a gas-giant planet with
a long period and low eccentricity (e = 0.21 \pm 0.07). The second planet in
the HD 159868 system has a period of 352.3\pm1.3 days, and m sin i=0.73\pm0.05
M_Jup. In both of these systems, including the additional planets in the
fitting process significantly reduced the eccentricity of the original planet.
These systems are thus examples of how multiple-planet systems can masquerade
as moderately eccentric single-planet systems.
