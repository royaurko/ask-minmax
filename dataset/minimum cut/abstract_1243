We present high resolution absorption-line spectroscopy of 3 face-on
galaxies, NGC 98, NGC 600, and NGC 1703 with the aim of searching for
box/peanut (B/P)-shaped bulges. These observations test and confirm the
prediction of Debattista et al. (2005) that face-on B/P-shaped bulges can be
recognized by a double minimum in the profile of the fourth-order Gauss-Hermite
moment h_4. In NGC 1703, which is an unbarred control galaxy, we found no
evidence of a B/P bulge. In NGC 98, a clear double minimum in h_4 is present
along the major axis of the bar and before the end of the bar, as predicted. In
contrast, in NGC 600, which is also a barred galaxy but lacks a substantial
bulge, we do not find a significant B/P shape.
