We establish the minimum time it takes for an initial state of mean energy E
and energy spread DE to move from its initial configuration by a predetermined
amount. Distances in Hilbert space are estimated by the fidelity between the
initial and final state. In this context, we also show that entanglement is
necessary to achieve the ultimate evolution speed when the energy resources are
distributed among all subsystems.
