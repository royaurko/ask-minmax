We compute the transverse energy-energy correlation (EEC) and its asymmetry
(AEEC) in next-to-leading order (NLO) in $\alpha_s$ in proton-proton collisions
at the LHC with the center-of-mass energy $E_{\rm c.m.}=7$ TeV. We show that
the transverse EEC and the AEEC distributions are insensitive to the QCD
factorization- and the renormalization-scales, structure functions of the
proton, and for a judicious choice of the jet-size, also the underlying minimum
bias events. Hence they can be used to precisely test QCD in hadron colliders
and determine the strong coupling $\alpha_s$. We illustrate these features by
defining the hadron jets using the anti-$k_T$ jet algorithm and an event
selection procedure employed in the analysis of jets at the LHC and show the
$\alpha_s(M_Z)$-dependence of the transverse EEC and the AEEC in the
anticipated range $0.11 \leq \alpha_s(M_Z) \leq 0.13$.
