We calculate the X-ray luminosity and light curve for the stellar binary
system Eta Carinae for the entire orbital period of 5.54 years. By using a new
approach we find, as suggested before, that the collision of the winds blown by
the two stars can explain the X-ray emission and temporal behavior. Most X-ray
emission in the $2-10 \kev$ band results from the shocked secondary stellar
wind. The observed rise in X-ray luminosity just before minimum is due to
increase in density and subsequent decrease in radiative cooling time of the
shocked fast secondary wind. Absorption, particularly of the soft X-rays from
the primary wind, increases as the system approaches periastron and the shocks
are produced deep inside the primary wind. However, absorption can not account
for the drastic X-ray minimum. The 70 day minimum is assumed to result from the
collapse of the collision region of the two winds onto the secondary star. This
process is assumed to shut down the secondary wind, hence the main X-ray
source. We show that this assumption provides a phenomenological description of
the X-ray behavior around the minimum.
