Infrared spectroscopic observations of LL Andromedae and EF Eridani are
presented. Our K band spectrum of LL Andromedae reveals the presence of methane
absorption in the secondary star indicating an effective temperature less than
1300K, similar to a "T" type methane brown dwarf. The secondary star in EF
Eridani is seen to be warmer with an effective temperature of ~1650K and a
spectroscopic classification consistent with an L4-5 star. Both secondaries
have theoretical mass estimates of 0.04-0.055 solar masses (40-55 Jupiter
masses). Our IR spectroscopic observations of LL And and EF Eri provide the
first direct proof of the theoretical prediction that post-period minimum
cataclysmic variables contain brown dwarf-like secondary stars.
