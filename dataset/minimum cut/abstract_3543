We conduct a numerical investigation of structural order in the shifted-force
Lennard-Jones system by calculating metrics of translational and
bond-orientational order along various paths in the phase diagram covering
equilibrium solid, liquid, and vapor states. A series of non-equilibrium
configurations generated through isochoric quenches, isothermal compressions,
and energy minimizations are also considered. Simulation results are analyzed
using an ordering map representation [Torquato et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 84,
2064 (2000); Truskett et al., Phys. Rev. E 62, 993 (2000)] that assigns to both
equilibrium and non-equilibrium states coordinates in an order metric plane.
Our results show that bond-orientational order and translational order are not
independent for simple spherically symmetric systems at equilibrium. We also
demonstrate quantitatively that the Lennard-Jones and hard sphere systems
sample the same configuration space at supercritical densities. Finally, we
relate the structural order found in fast-quenched and minimum-energy
configurations (inherent structures).
