In this paper we construct constant dimension space codes with prescribed
minimum distance. There is an increased interest in space codes since a paper
by Koetter and Kschischang were they gave an application in network coding.
There is also a connection to the theory of designs over finite fields. We will
modify a method of Braun, Kerber and Laue which they used for the construction
of designs over finite fields to do the construction of space codes. Using this
approach we found many new constant dimension spaces codes with a larger number
of codewords than previously known codes. We will finally give a table of the
best found constant dimension space codes.
