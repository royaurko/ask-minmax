We discuss the moduli stabilization arising in the presence of gauge fluxes,
R-symmetry twists and non-perturbative effects in the context of 6-dimensional
supergravity models. We show how the presence of D-terms, due to the gauge
fluxes, is compatible with gaugino condensation, and that the two effects,
combined with the R-symmetry twist, do stabilize all the Kaehler moduli present
in the model, in the spirit of KKLT. We also calculate the flux-induced
one-loop correction to the scalar potential coming from charged
hypermultiplets, and find that it does not destabilize the minimum.
