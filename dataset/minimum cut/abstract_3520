Coarse-grained flux density profiles in type-II superconductors with
non-parallel vortex configurations are obtained by a proposed phenomenological
least action principle. We introduce a functional $C[H(x)]$, which is minimized
under a constraint of the kind $J$ belongs to $Delta$ for the current density
vector, where $Delta$ is a bounded set. This generalizes the concept of
critical current density introduced by C. P. Bean for parallel vortex
configurations. In particular, we choose the isotropic case ($Delta$ is a
circle), for which the field penetration profiles $H(x,t)$ are derived when a
changing external excitation is applied. Faraday's law, and the principle of
minimum entropy production rate for stationary thermodynamic processes dictate
the evolution of the system. Calculations based on the model can reproduce the
physical phenomena of flux transport and consumption, and the striking effect
of magnetization collapse in crossed field measurements.
