If Lorentz symmetry is violated at high energies, interactions that are
usually non-renormalizable can become renormalizable by weighted power
counting. Recently, a CPT invariant, Lorentz violating extension of the
Standard Model containing two scalar-two fermion interactions (which can
explain neutrino masses) and four fermion interactions (which can explain
proton decay) was proposed. In this paper we consider a variant of this model,
obtained suppressing the elementary scalar fields, and argue that it can
reproduce the known low energy physics. In the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio spirit, we
show, using a large N_c expansion, that a dynamical symmetry breaking takes
place. The effective potential has a Lorentz invariant minimum and the Lorentz
violation does not reverberate down to low energies. The mechanism generates
fermion masses, gauge-boson masses and scalar bound states, to be identified
with composite Higgs bosons. Our approach is not plagued by the ambiguities of
approaches based on non-renormalizable vertices. The low-energy effective
action is uniquely determined and predicts relations among parameters of the
Standard Model.
