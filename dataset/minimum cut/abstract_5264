A graph $G$ is $k$-{\em critical} if it has chromatic number $k$, but every
proper subgraph of $G$ is $(k-1)$--colorable. Let $f_k(n)$ denote the minimum
number of edges in an $n$-vertex $k$-critical graph. In a very recent paper, we
gave a lower bound, $f_k(n) \geq F(k,n)$, that is sharp for every $n=1\,({\rm
mod}\, k-1)$. It is also sharp for $k=4$ and every $n\geq 6$. In this note, we
present a simple proof of the bound for $k=4$. It implies the case $k=4$ of the
conjecture by Ore from 1967 that for every $k\geq 4$ and $n\geq k+2$,
$f_k(n+k-1)=f(n)+\frac{k-1}{2}(k - \frac{2}{k-1})$. We also show that our
result implies a simple short proof of the Gr\" otzsch Theorem that every
triangle-free planar graph is 3-colorable.
