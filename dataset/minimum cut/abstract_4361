We study the collective escape dynamics of a chain of coupled, weakly damped
nonlinear oscillators from a metastable state over a barrier when driven by a
thermal heat bath in combination with a weak, globally acting periodic
perturbation. Optimal parameter choices are identified that lead to a drastic
enhancement of escape rates as compared to a pure noise-assisted situation. We
elucidate the speed-up of escape in the driven Langevin dynamics by showing
that the time-periodic external field in combination with the thermal
fluctuations triggers an instability mechanism of the stationary homogeneous
lattice state of the system. Perturbations of the latter provided by incoherent
thermal fluctuations grow because of a parametric resonance, leading to the
formation of spatially localized modes (LMs). Remarkably, the LMs persist in
spite of continuously impacting thermal noise. The average escape time assumes
a distinct minimum by either tuning the coupling strength and/or the driving
frequency. This weak ac-driven assisted escape in turn implies a giant speed of
the activation rate of such thermally driven coupled nonlinear oscillator
chains.
