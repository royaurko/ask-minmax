Results of a partial wave analysis of new high-statistics data on $\gamma
p\to p\eta$ from MAMI are presented. A fit using known broad resonances and
only standard background amplitudes can not describe the relatively narrow
peaking structure in the cross section in the mass region of 1660-1750 MeV
which follows a minimum. An improved description of the data can be reached by
either assuming the existence of a narrow resonance at a mass of about 1700 MeV
with small photo-coupling or by a threshold effect. In the latter case the
observed structure is explained by a strong (resonant or non-resonant) $\gamma
p\to\omega p$ coupling in the $S_{11}$ partial wave. When the beam asymmetry
data, published by part of the GRAAL collaboration, are included in the fit,
the solution with a narrow $P_{11}$ state is slightly preferred. In that fit,
mass and width of the hypothetical resonance are determined to $M\sim$1694 MeV
and $\Gamma\sim 40$ MeV, respectively, and the photo-coupling to $\sqrt{{\rm
Br}_{\eta N}} A_{1/2}^p \sim 2.6\cdot 10^{-3}$ GeV$^{-1/2}$. High precision
measurements of the target asymmetry and $F$-observable are mandatory to
establish the possible existence of such a narrow state and to provide the
necessary information to define which partial wave is responsible for the
structure observed in the data.
