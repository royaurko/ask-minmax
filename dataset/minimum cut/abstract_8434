We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the interacting
transient SN 2009ip taken during the 2013 and 2014 observing seasons. We
characterise the photometric evolution as a steady and smooth decline in all
bands, with a decline rate that is slower than expected for a solely
$^{56}$Co-powered supernova at late phases. No further outbursts or eruptions
were seen over a two year period from 2012 December until 2014 December. SN
2009ip remains brighter than its historic minimum from pre-discovery images.
Spectroscopically, SN 2009ip continues to be dominated by strong, narrow
($\lesssim$2000 km~s$^{-1}$) emission lines of H, He, Ca, and Fe. While we make
tenuous detections of [Fe~{\sc ii}] $\lambda$7155 and [O~{\sc i}]
$\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 lines at the end of 2013 June and the start of 2013
October respectively, we see no strong broad nebular emission lines that could
point to a core-collapse origin. In general, the lines appear relatively
symmetric, with the exception of our final spectrum in 2014 May, when we
observe the appearance of a redshifted shoulder of emission at +550
km~s$^{-1}$. The lines are not blue-shifted, and we see no significant near- or
mid-infrared excess. From the spectroscopic and photometric evolution of SN
2009ip until 820 days after the start of the 2012a event, we still see no
conclusive evidence for core-collapse, although whether any such signs could be
masked by ongoing interaction is unclear.
