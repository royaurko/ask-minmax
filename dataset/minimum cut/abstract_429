We reconsidered the Coleman de Luccia solution building an AdS4 bubble
expanding into a false flat vacuum. In this construction when junction
conditions are imposed we find an upper bound to the radius of the AdS4 and a
domain wall whose tension is a function of the minimum of the scalar potential.
We prove that this solution is exactly the solution found by Coleman and de
Luccia, but in addition there is a new condition that restricts the AdS4 radius
and a precise relation between the tension and the minimum of the scalar
potential. The applicability of the ADS/CFT correspondence is discussed.
