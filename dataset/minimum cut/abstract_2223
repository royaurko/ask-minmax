We address the relationship between membrane microheterogeneity and anomalous
subdiffusion in cell membranes by carrying out Monte Carlo simulations of
two-component lipid membranes. We find that near-critical fluctuations in the
membrane lead to transient subdiffusion, while membrane-cytoskeleton
interaction strongly affects phase separation, enhances subdiffusion, and
eventually leads to hop diffusion of lipids. Thus, we present a minimum
realistic model for membrane rafts showing the features of both microscopic
phase separation and subdiffusion.
