Measuring device is proposed for determining a linear dimension. The device
comprises three associated longitudinally moving parts one of which is a scale.
The integer part of the device reading is being taken from the standard
millimeter or inches scale, and The fine measurement (smaller than the minimum
scale division) is being done by a setup of two sliders coupled to the device.
The first slider includes measuring points. And the other slider includes
measuring line. The decimal part of the reading is being taken in such a way
that the measuring points reading is related to the fractions of the
displacement between the graduated scale and the corresponding measuring line.
