These notes give an elementary introduction to Lie groups, Lie algebras, and
their representations. Designed to be accessible to graduate students in
mathematics or physics, they have a minimum of prerequisites. Topics include
definitions and examples of Lie groups and Lie algebras, the relationship
between Lie groups and Lie algebras via the exponential mapping, the basics of
representations theory, the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, a detailed study
of the representations of SU(3), and a brief survey of the representation
theory of general semisimple groups.
