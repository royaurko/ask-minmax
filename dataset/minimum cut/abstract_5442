We study the spectral minimum and Lifshitz tails for continuum random
Schr\"{o}dinger operators of the form \begin{equation*}
H_{\om}=-\De+V_{0}+\sum_{i\in\Z^{d}}\om_{i}u(\cdot-i), \end{equation*} where
$V_{0}$ is the periodic potential, $\{\om_{i}\}_{i\in\Z^{d}}$ are i.i.d random
variables and $u$ is the sign-indefinite impurity potential. Recently, this
model has been proven to exhibit Lifshitz tails near the bottom of the spectrum
under the small support assuption of $u$ and the reflection symmetry assumption
of $V_{0}$ and $u$. We here drop the reflection symmetry assumption of $V_{0}$
and $u$. We first give characterizations of the bottom of the spectrum. Then,
we show the existence of Lifshitz tails in the regime where the
characterization of the bottom of the spectrum is explicit. In particular, this
regime covers the reflection symmetry case.
