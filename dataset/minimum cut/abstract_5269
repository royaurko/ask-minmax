We review searches for closed string axions and axion-like particles (ALPs)
in IIB string flux compactifications. For natural values of the background
fluxes and TeV scale gravitino mass, the moduli stabilisation mechanism of the
LARGE Volume Scenario predicts the existence of a QCD axion candidate with
intermediate scale decay constant, f_a ~ 10^9 ... 10^12 GeV, associated with
the small cycles wrapped by the branes hosting the visible sector, plus a
nearly massless and nearly decoupled ALP associated with the LARGE cycle. In
setups where the visible sector branes are wrapping more than the minimum
number of two intersecting cycles, there are more ALPs which have approximately
the same decay constant and coupling to the photon as the QCD axion candidate,
but which are exponentially lighter. There are exciting phenomenological
opportunities to search for these axions and ALPs in the near future. For f_a ~
10^11 ... 10^12 GeV, the QCD axion can be the dominant part of dark matter and
be detected in haloscopes exploiting microwave cavities. For f_a ~ 10^9 ...
10^10 GeV, the additional ALPs could explain astrophysical anomalies and be
searched for in the upcoming generation of helioscopes and
light-shining-through-a-wall experiments.
