Following arXiv:1310.2027 and arXiv:0801.0762, we consider a
non-supersymmetric Seiberg duality between electric and magnetic "orientifold
field theories". These theories live on brane configurations of type 0' string
theory. In the electric theory side the scalars acquire a mass and decouple,
resulting in an SU(Nc) gauge theory coupled to Nf massless quarks and an
additional massless fermion that transforms in the two-index antisymmetric
representation. In the magnetic theory side there exists a fundamental meson
field that develops a Coleman-Weinberg potential. At the one-loop approximation
the potential admits a minimum with chiral symmetry breaking of the form
SU(Nf)L x SU(Nf)R --> SU(Nf)V and an additional breaking of an axial U(1)
symmetry. The resulting theory admits a spectrum whose massless degrees of
freedom are Nf^2 Nambu-Goldstone bosons.
