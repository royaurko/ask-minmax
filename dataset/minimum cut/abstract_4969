We identify a phase transition in the vortex system of a high-temperature
superconductor with nano-columnar stacks of precipitates as strong vortex
pinning centers. Above a particular, temperature-dependent field $B_X(T)$ the
vortex response is no longer determined by the nano-columns, and is instead
determined by point-like pinning. This phase transition leads to the change in
the measured critical current density as a function of angle between the
applied magnetic field and the nano-columns. Below the unbinding, there is a
strong maximum in $J_C$ when field is aligned parallel to the columns. Above
the unbinding, there is a minimum for this orientation.
