We present an experimental study of discrete breathers in an underdamped
Josephson-junction array. Breathers exist under a range of dc current biases
and temperatures, and are detected by measuring dc voltages. We find the
maximum allowable bias current for the breather is proportional to the array
depinning current while the minimum current seems to be related to a junction
retrapping mechanism. We have observed that this latter instability leads to
the formation of multi-site breather states in the array. We have also studied
the domain of existence of the breather at different values of the array
parameters by varying the temperature.
