The adsorption behavior of ions at liquid-vapor interfaces exhibits several
unexpected yet generic features. In particular, energy and entropy are both
minimum when the solute resides near the surface, for a variety of ions in a
range of polar solvents, contrary to predictions of classical theories.
Motivated by this generality, and by the simple physical ingredients implicated
by computational studies, we have examined interfacial solvation in highly
schematic models, which resolve only coarse fluctuations in solvent density and
cohesive energy. Here we show that even such lattice gas models recapitulate
surprising thermodynamic trends observed in detailed simulations and
experiments. Attention is focused on the case of two dimensions, for which
approximate energy and entropy profiles can be calculated analytically.
Simulations and theoretical analysis of the lattice gas highlight the role of
capillary wave-like fluctuations in mediating adsorption. They further point to
ranges of temperature and solute-solvent interaction strength where surface
propensity is expected to be strongest.
