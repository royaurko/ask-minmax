We study the closed universe recollapse conjecture for positively curved FRW
models with a perfect fluid matter source and a scalar field which arises in
the conformal frame of the $R+\alpha R^{2}$ theory. By including ordinary
matter, we extend the analysis of a previous work. We analyze the structure of
the resulted four-dimensional dynamical system with the methods of the center
manifold theory and the normal form theory. It is shown that an initially
expanding closed FRW universe, starting close to the Minkowski spacetime,
cannot avoid recollapse. We discuss the posibility that potentials with a
positive minimum may prevent the recollapse of closed universes.
