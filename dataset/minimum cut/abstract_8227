We use dark matter only and full hydrodynamical Constrained Local UniversE
Simulations (CLUES) of the formation of the Local Group to study the density
profile of subhaloes of the simulated Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. We show
that the Einasto model provides the best description of the subhaloes' density
profile, as opposed to the more commonly used NFW profile or any generalisation
of it. We further find that the Einasto shape parameter \nEin\ is strongly
correlated with the total subhalo mass, pointing towards the notion of a
non-universality of the subhaloes' density profile. We observe that the effect
of mass loss due to tidal stripping, in both the dark matter only and the
hydrodynamical run, is the reduction of the shape parameter \nEin\ between the
infall and the present time. Assuming now that the dSphs of our Galaxy follow
the Einasto profile and using the maximum and minimum values of \nEin\ from our
hydrodynamical simulation as a gauge, we can improve the observational
constraints on the \Rmax-\Vmax\ pairs obtained for the brightest satellite
galaxies of the Milky Way. When considering only the subhaloes with
$-13.2\lesssim M_V\lesssim-8.8$, i.e. the range of luminosity of the classical
dwarfs, we find that all our simulated objects are consistent with the observed
dSphs if their haloes follow the Einasto model with $1.6\lesssim n_{\rm E}
\lesssim5.3$. The numerically motivated Einasto profile for the observed dSphs
will alleviate the recently presented "massive failures" problem.
