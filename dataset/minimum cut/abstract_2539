Blue and Visual photoelectric light curves have been achieved for the
eclipsing binary SW Lac in 1995. Nine moments of minimum light were derived.
Period of 0.320854 days have been determined as the mean of those derived from
blue and visual observations. B and V light curves have been analyzed using W-D
code where the system has been viewed through the ellipsoidal model. The system
geometrical and physical parameters were determined and compared with those
published recently.
