The self-energies and the spectral densities of longitudinal and transverse
gluons at zero temperature in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase are
calculated. There appears a collective excitation, a light plasmon, at energies
smaller than two times the gap parameter and momenta smaller than about eight
times the gap. The minimum in the dispersion relation of this mode at some
nonzero value of momentum corresponds to the van Hove singularity.
