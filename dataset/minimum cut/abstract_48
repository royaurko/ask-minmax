We show that the ground state of the well-known pseudo-stationary states for
the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian is a generalized minimum uncertainty state,
which has the minimum allowed uncertainty $\Delta q \Delta p = \hbar
\sigma_0/2$, where $\sigma_0 (\geq 1)$ is a constant depending on the damping
factor and natural frequency. The most general symmetric Gaussian states are
obtained as the one-parameter squeezed states of the pseudo-stationary ground
state. It is further shown that the coherent states of the pseudo-stationary
ground state constitute another class of the generalized minimum uncertainty
states.
