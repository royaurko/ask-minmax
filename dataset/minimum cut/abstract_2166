We investigate proton acceleration by a laser pulse obliquely incident on a
double layer target via 3D PIC simulations. It is found that the proton beam
energy spread changes by the laser irradiation position and it reaches a
minimum at certain position. This provides a way to control the proton energy
spectrum. We show that by appropriately adjusting the size and position of the
second proton layer that high energy protons with much smaller energy spread
can be obtained.
