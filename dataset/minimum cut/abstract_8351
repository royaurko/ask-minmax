In this paper, we propose an opportunistic downlink interference alignment
(ODIA) for interference-limited cellular downlink, which intelligently combines
user scheduling and downlink IA techniques. The proposed ODIA not only
efficiently reduces the effect of inter-cell interference from other-cell base
stations (BSs) but also eliminates intra-cell interference among spatial
streams in the same cell. We show that the minimum number of users required to
achieve a target degrees-of-freedom (DoF) can be fundamentally reduced, i.e.,
the fundamental user scaling law can be improved by using the ODIA, compared
with the existing downlink IA schemes. In addition, we adopt a limited feedback
strategy in the ODIA framework, and then analyze the required number of
feedback bits leading to the same performance as that of the ODIA assuming
perfect feedback. We also modify the original ODIA in order to further improve
sum-rate, which achieves the optimal multiuser diversity gain, i.e., $\log \log
N$, per spatial stream even in the presence of downlink inter-cell
interference, where $N$ denotes the number of users in a cell. Simulation
results show that the ODIA significantly outperforms existing interference
management techniques in terms of sum-rate in realistic cellular environments.
Note that the ODIA operates in a distributed and decoupled manner, while
requiring no information exchange among BSs and no iterative beamformer
optimization between BSs and users, thus leading to an easier implementation.
