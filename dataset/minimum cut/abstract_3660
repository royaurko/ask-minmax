We report the preparation and results of our magnetic and transport
measurements on a new Yb-based ternary compound Yb$_2$Ir$_3$Sn$_5$. This
compound forms in the orthorhombic Cmc21 structure. DC magnetic susceptibility
between 1.8 K and 300 K reveal that Yb is in its magnetic trivalent state in
this compound. Electrical resistivity measurements down to 1. 5K show a
behavior typical of Kondo lattice compounds with a minimum in resistivity
around 8K and a coherence peak near 3K. AC magnetic susceptibility down to
100mK reveals an anti-ferromagnetic transition below 1.35 K.
