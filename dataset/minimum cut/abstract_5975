The \textit{Distinguishing Chromatic Number} of a graph $G$, denoted
$\chi_D(G)$, was first defined in \cite{collins} as the minimum number of
colors needed to properly color $G$ such that no non-trivial automorphism
$\phi$ of the graph $G$ fixes each color class of $G$. In this paper, 1. We
prove a lemma that may be considered a variant of the Motion lemma of \cite{RS}
and use this to give examples of several families of graphs which satisfy
$\chi_D(G)=\chi(G)+1$. 2.We give an example of families of graphs that admit
large automorphism groups in which every proper coloring is distinguishing. We
also describe families of graphs with (relatively) very small automorphism
groups which satisfy $\chi_D(G)=\chi(G)+1$, for arbitrarily large values of
$\chi(G)$. 3. We describe non-trivial families of bipartite graphs that satisfy
$\chi_D(G)>r$ for any positive integer $r$.
