We introduce the concept of Hofer-Zehnder $G$-semicapacity (or $G$-sensitive
Hofer-Zehnder capacity) and prove that given a geometrically bounded symplectic
manifold $(M,\omega)$ and an open subset $N \subset M$ endowed with a
Hamiltonian free circle action $\phi$ then $N$ has bounded Hofer-Zehnder
$G_\phi$-semicapacity, where $G_\phi \subset \pi_1(N)$ is the subgroup
generated by the homotopy class of the orbits of $\phi$. In particular, $N$ has
bounded Hofer-Zehnder capacity.
  We give two types of applications of the main result. Firstly, we prove that
the cotangent bundle of a compact manifold endowed with a free circle action
has bounded Hofer-Zehnder capacity. In particular, the cotangent bundle $T^*G$
of any compact Lie group $G$ has bounded Hofer-Zehnder capacity. Secondly, we
consider Hamiltonian circle actions given by symplectic submanifolds. For
instance, we prove the following generalization of a recent result of
Ginzburg-G\"urel: almost all low levels of a function on a geometrically
bounded symplectic manifold carry contractible periodic orbits of the
Hamiltonian flow, provided that the function attains its minimum along a closed
symplectic submanifold.
