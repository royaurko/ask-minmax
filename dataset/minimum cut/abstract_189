In this article we prove that integral lattices with minimum <= 7 (or <= 9)
whose set of minimal vectors form spherical 9-designs (or 11-designs
respectively) are extremal, even and unimodular. We furthermore show that there
does not exist an integral lattice with minimum <=11 which yields a 13-design.
