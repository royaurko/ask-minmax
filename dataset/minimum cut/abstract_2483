We compute the exponential decay of the probability that a given
multi-dimensional random walk stays in a convex cone up to time $n$, as $n$
goes to infinity. We show that the latter equals the minimum, on the dual cone,
of the Laplace transform of the random walk increments. As an example, our
results find applications in the counting of walks in orthants, a classical
domain in enumerative combinatorics.
