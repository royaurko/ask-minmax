We present a general model with both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
couplings to describe a two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric superconductor. The
combined effects of the two spin-orbit couplings on superconductivity are
investigated in the framework of mean-field theory. We find that the Rashba and
Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings result in similar effects on superconductivity
if they are present solely in the system. Mixing of spin-singlet and triplet
pairings in electron band is induced under the assumption that each
quasiparticle band is p-wave paired. If the two types of spin-orbit couplings
appear jointly, both the singlet and triplet pairings are weakened and
decreased down to their minimum values in the equal-Rashba-Dresselhaus case.
