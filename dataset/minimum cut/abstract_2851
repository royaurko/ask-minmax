This paper is concerned with statistical methods for the segmental
classification of linear sequence data where the task is to segment and
classify the data according to an underlying hidden discrete state sequence.
Such analysis is commonplace in the empirical sciences including genomics,
finance and speech processing. In particular, we are interested in answering
the following question: given data $y$ and a statistical model $\pi(x,y)$ of
the hidden states $x$, what should we report as the prediction $\hat{x}$ under
the posterior distribution $\pi (x|y)$? That is, how should you make a
prediction of the underlying states? We demonstrate that traditional approaches
such as reporting the most probable state sequence or most probable set of
marginal predictions can give undesirable classification artefacts and offer
limited control over the properties of the prediction. We propose a decision
theoretic approach using a novel class of Markov loss functions and report
$\hat{x}$ via the principle of minimum expected loss (maximum expected
utility). We demonstrate that the sequence of minimum expected loss under the
Markov loss function can be enumerated exactly using dynamic programming
methods and that it offers flexibility and performance improvements over
existing techniques. The result is generic and applicable to any probabilistic
model on a sequence, such as Hidden Markov models, change point or product
partition models.
