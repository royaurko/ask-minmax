The issue of giant planet formation by core instability (CI) far from the
central star is rather controversial because the growth of massive solid core
necessary for triggering the CI can take longer than the lifetime of the
protoplanetary disk. In this work we assess the range of separations at which
the CI may operate by (1) allowing for arbitrary (physically meaningful) rate
of planetesimal accretion by the core and (2) properly taking into account the
dependence of the critical mass for the CI on the planetesimal accretion
luminosity. This self-consistent approach distinguishes our work from similar
studies in which only a specific planetesimal accretion regime was explored
and/or the critical core mass was fixed at some arbitrary level. We demonstrate
that the largest separation at which the CI can occur within 3 Myr corresponds
to the surface density of solids in the disk higher than 0.1 g cm^{-2} and is
40-50 AU in the minimum mass Solar nebula. This limiting separation is achieved
when the planetesimal accretion proceeds at the fastest possible rate, even
though the high associated accretion luminosity increases the critical core
mass delaying the onset of the CI. Our constraints are independent of the mass
of the central star and vary only weakly with the core density and its
atmospheric opacity. We also discuss various factors which can strengthen or
weaken our limits on the operation of the CI.
