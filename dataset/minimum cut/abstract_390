This article introduces SatHyS (SAT HYbrid Solver), a novel hybrid approach
for propositional satisfiability. It combines local search and conflict driven
clause learning (CDCL) scheme. Each time the local search part reaches a local
minimum, the CDCL is launched. For SAT problems it behaves like a tabu list,
whereas for UNSAT ones, the CDCL part tries to focus on minimum unsatisfiable
sub-formula (MUS). Experimental results show good performances on many classes
of SAT instances from the last SAT competitions.
