The following is a progress report on the long-term coronal activity of Alpha
Centauri A (HD128620: G2V) and B (HD128621: K1V). Since 2005, Chandra X-ray
Observatory has carried out semiannual pointings on AB, mainly with the High
Resolution Camera (HRC-I), but also on two occasions with the Low-Energy
Transmission Grating Spectrometer (LETGS), fully resolving the close pair in
all cases. During 2008-2013, Chandra captured the rise, peak, and initial
decline of B's coronal luminosity. Together with previous high states
documented by ROSAT and XMM-Newton, the long-term X-ray record suggests a
period of 8.2+/-0.2 yr, compared to 11 yr for the Sun; with a minimum-to-peak
contrast of 4.5, about half the typical solar cycle amplitude. Meanwhile, the A
component has been mired in a Maunder-Minimum-like low state since 2005,
initially recognized by XMM. But now, A finally appears to be climbing out of
the extended lull. If interpreted simply as an over-long cycle, the period
would be 19.1+/-0.7 yr, with a minimum-to-peak contrast of 3.4. The short X-ray
cycle of B, and possibly long cycle of A, are not unusual compared with the
diverse (albeit much lower amplitude) chromospheric variations recorded, for
example, by the HK Project. Further, the deep low state of A also is not
unusual, but instead is similar to the Sun during recent minima of the sunspot
cycle.
