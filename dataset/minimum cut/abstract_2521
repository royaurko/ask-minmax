For readers already familiar with Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we
show that PID's definition of synergy enables quantifying at least four
different notions of irreducibility. First, we show four common notions of
"parts" give rise to a spectrum of four distinct measures of irreducibility.
Second, we introduce a nonnegative expression based on PID for each notion of
irreducibility. Third, we delineate these four notions of irreducibility with
exemplary binary circuits. This work will become more useful once the
complexity community has converged on a palatable $\operatorname{I}_{\cap}$ or
$\operatorname{I}_{\cup}$ measure.
