A study of the resistively detected nuclear magnetic resonance (RDNMR)
lineshape in the vicinity of $\nu=1$ was performed on a high-mobility 2D
electron gas formed in GaAs/AlGaAs. In higher Landau levels, application of an
RF field at the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency coincides with an observed
minimum in the longitudinal resistance, as predicted by the simple hyperfine
interaction picture. Near $\nu=1$ however, an anomalous dispersive lineshape is
observed where a resistance peak follows the usual minimum. In an effort to
understand the origin of this anomalous peak we have studied the resonance
under various RF and sample conditions. Interestingly, we show that the
lineshape can be completely inverted by simply applying a DC current. We
interpret this as evidence that the minima and maxima in the lineshape
originate from two distinct mechanisms.
