We present a renormalizable flavor model with Z_4 as flavor symmetry in both
the quark and lepton sectors. The model is constructed with a minimal approach
and no-right handed neutrinos are introduced. In this approach a minimum number
of two SU(2) Higgs doublets and one scalar singlet are required in order to
obtain the Nearest Neighbor Interaction form for charged fermions and to
generate neutrino masses radiatively. For the quark sector we follow the charge
assignations made by Branco et. al. in reference [1]. All fermion masses and
mixing angles in the model are in agreement with current experimental data and
only the inverted hierarchy for the neutrino mass spectrum is allowed. Since
neutrinos are Majorana the contribution to neutrinoless double beta decay is
also analyzed.
