We report two low mass companions orbiting the nearby K7 dwarf GJ 221 that
have emerged from re-analyzing 4.4 years of publicly available HARPS spectra
complemented with 2 years of high precision Doppler measurements with
Magellan/PFS. The HARPS measurements alone contain the clear signal of a low
mass companion with a period of 125 days and a minimum mass of 53.2 \mearth (GJ
221b), falling in a mass range where very few planet candidates have been found
(sub-Saturn desert). The addition of 17 PFS observations allow the confident
detection of a second low mass companion (6.5 \mearth) in a hot orbit (3.87
days period, GJ 221c). Spectrocopic and photometric calibrations suggest that
GJ 221 is slightly depleted ([Fe/H]$\sim$ -0.1) compared to the Sun so the
presence of two low mass companions in the system confirms the trend that
slightly reduced stellar metallicity does not prevent the formation of planets
in the super-Earth to sub-Saturn mass regime.
