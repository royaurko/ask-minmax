We calculate the finite temperature 2-loop effective potential in the MSSM
with stop condensation, using a 3-dimensional effective theory. We find that in
a part of the parameter space, a two-stage electroweak phase transition appears
possible. The first stage would be the formation of a stop condensate, and the
second stage is the transition to the standard electroweak minimum. The
two-stage transition could significantly relax the baryon erasure bounds, but
the parameter space allowing it (m_H \lsim 100 GeV, m_tR \sim 155-160 GeV) is
not very large. We estimate the reliability of our results using
renormalization scale and gauge dependence. Finally we discuss some real-time
aspects relevant for the viability of the two-stage scenario.
