By the results of the contributor and Chiantini in Math.AG/0110102, on a general
quintic threefold $X \subset {\mathbf P}^4$ the minimum integer $p$ for which
there exists a positive dimensional family of irreducible rank $p$ vector
bundles on $X$ without intermediate cohomology is at least three. In this paper
we show that $p \leq 4$, by constructing series of positive dimensional
families of rank 4 vector bundles on $X$ without intermediate cohomology. The
general member of such family is an indecomposable bundle from the extension
class $Ext^1(E,F)$, for a suitable choice of the rank 2 ACM bundles $E$ and $F$
on $X$. The existence of such bundles of rank $p = 3$ remains under question.
