Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that the switching behavior
of magnetic nanoparticles can be well controlled by external time-dependent
magnetic fields. In this work, we inspect theoretically the influence of the
temperature and the magnetic anisotropy on the spin-dynamics and the switching
properties of single domain magnetic nanoparticles (Stoner-particles). Our
theoretical tools are the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation extended as to deal
with finite temperatures within a Langevine framework. Physical quantities of
interest are the minimum field amplitudes required for switching and the
corresponding reversal times of the nanoparticle's magnetic moment. In
particular, we contrast the cases of static and time-dependent external fields
and analyze the influence of damping for a uniaxial and a cubic anisotropy.
