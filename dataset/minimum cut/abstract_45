We study the minimum distance of codes defined on bipartite graphs. Weight
spectrum and the minimum distance of a random ensemble of such codes are
computed. It is shown that if the vertex codes have minimum distance $\ge 3$,
the overall code is asymptotically good, and sometimes meets the
Gilbert-Varshamov bound.
  Constructive families of expander codes are presented whose minimum distance
asymptotically exceeds the product bound for all code rates between 0 and 1.
