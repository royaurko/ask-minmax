We study the symmetry breaking sector of a supersymmetric left-right model
based on the gauge group $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$. The explicit
mass matrices of neutral, singly charged and doubly charged scalars are
constructed. In the minimum the $R$-parity is found to be spontaneously broken.
An experimentally interesting feature of the model is that one of the doubly
charged scalars is possibly light enough to be seen in the next linear
collider.
