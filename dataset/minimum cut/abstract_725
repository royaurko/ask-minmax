We analyze the steady 1D flow equations for a rotating stellar wind based on
a ``nozzle'' analogy for terms that constrain the local mass flux. For low
rotation, we find the nozzle minimum occurs near the stellar surface, allowing
a transition to a standard, CAK-type steep-acceleration solution; but for
rotations > 75% of the critical rate, this inner nozzle minimum exceeds the
global minimum, implying near-surface supercritical solutions would have an
overloaded mass loss rate. In steady, analytic models in which the acceleration
is assumed to be monotonically positive, this leads the solution to switch to a
slow acceleration mode. However, time-dependent simulations using a numerical
hydrodynamics code show that, for rotation rates 75 - 85% of critical, the flow
can develop abrupt "kink" transitions from a steep acceleration to a
decelerating solution. For rotations above 85% of critical, the hydrodynamic
simulations confirm the slow acceleration, with the lower flow speed implying
densities 5 - 30 times higher than the polar (or a nonrotating) wind. Still,
when gravity darkening and 2D flow effects are accounted for, it seems unlikely
that rotationally modified equatorial wind outflows could account for the very
large densities inferred for the equatorial regions around B[e] supergiants.
