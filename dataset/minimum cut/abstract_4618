Electric S-brane solutions with two non-composite electric branes and a set
of l scalar fields are considered. The intersection rules for branes correspond
to Lie algebras A_2, C_2 and G_2. The solutions contain five factor spaces. One
of them, M_0, is interpreted as our 3-dimensional space. It is shown that there
exists a time interval where accelerated expansion of our 3-dimensional space
is compatible with a small enough variation of the effective gravitational
constant G(\tau). This interval contains \tau_0, a point of minimum of the
function G(\tau). A special solution with two phantom scalar fields is analyzed
and it is shown that in the vicinity of the point \tau_0 the time variation of
G(\tau) (calculated in the linear approximation) decreases in the sequence of
Lie algebras A_2, C_2 and G_2.
