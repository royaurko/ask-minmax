Kelly, Kuehn and Osthus conjectured that for any l>3 and the smallest number
k>2 that does not divide l, any large enough oriented graph G with minimum
indegree and minimum outdegree at least \lfloor |V(G)|/k\rfloor +1 contains a
directed cycle of length l. We prove this conjecture asymptotically for the
case when l is large enough compared to k and k>6. The case when k<7 was
already settled asymptotically by Kelly, Kuehn and Osthus.
