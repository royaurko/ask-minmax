We demonstrate that a spherical accretion onto astrophysical black holes,
under the influence of Newtonian or various post-Newtonian pseudo-Schwarzschild
gravitational potentials, may constitute a concrete example of classical
analogue gravity naturally found in the Universe. We analytically calculate the
corresponding analogue Hawking temperature as a function of the minimum number
of physical parameters governing the accretion flow. We study both the
polytropic and the isothermal accretion. We show that unlike in a general
relativistic spherical accretion, analogue white hole solutions can never be
obtained in such post-Newtonian systems. We also show that an isothermal
spherical accretion is a remarkably simple example in which the only one
information--the temperature of the fluid, is sufficient to completely describe
an analogue gravity system. For both types of accretion, the analogue Hawking
temperature may become higher than the usual Hawking temperature. However, the
analogue Hawking temperature for accreting astrophysical black holes is
considerably lower compared with the temperature of the accreting fluid.
