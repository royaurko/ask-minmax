We consider the one-loop effective potential at zero temperature in field
theories with anisotropic space-time scaling, with critical exponent $z=3$,
including scalar, fermion and gauge fields. The fermion determinant generates a
symmetry breaking term at one loop in the effective potential and a local
minimum appears, for non zero scalar field, for every value of the Yukawa
coupling. Depending on the relative strength of the coupling constants for the
scalar and the gauge field, we find a second symmetry breaking local minimum in
the effective potential for a bigger value of the scalar field.
