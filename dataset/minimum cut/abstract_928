Sprout graphs are finite directed graphs matured over a finite subset of the
non-negative time line. A simple undirected connected graph on at least two
vertices is required to construct an infant graph to mature from. The maxi-max
arc-weight principle and the maxi-min arc-weight principle are introduced in
the paper. These principles are used to determine the maximum and minimum
maturity weight of a sprout graph.
