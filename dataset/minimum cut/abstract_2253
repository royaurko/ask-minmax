Let X be a complex Fano manifold of dimension n. Let s(X) be the sum of
l(R)-1 for all the extremal rays of X, the edges of the cone NE(X) of curves of
X, where l(R) denotes the minimum of (-K_X \cdot C) for all rational curves C
whose class [C] belongs to R. We show that s(X)\leq n if n\leq 4. And for n\leq
4, we completely classify the case the equality holds. This is a refinement of
the Mukai conjecture on Fano fourfolds.
