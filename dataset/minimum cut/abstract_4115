The population dynamics and stability of ecosystems of interacting species is
studied from the perspective of non-equilibrium thermodynamics by assuming that
species, through their biotic and abiotic interactions, are units of entropy
production and exchange in an open thermodynamic system with constant external
constraints. Within the context of the linear theory of irreversible
thermodynamics, such a system will naturally evolve towards a stable stationary
state in which the production of entropy within the ecosystem is at a local
minimum value. It is shown that this extremal condition leads to equations for
the stationary (steady) state population dynamics of interacting species, more
general than those of Lotka-Volterra, and to conditions on the parameters of
the community interaction matrix guaranteeing ecosystem stability. The
paradoxical stability of real complex ecosystems thus has a simple explanation
within the proposed framework. Furthermore, it is shown that the second law of
thermodynamics constrains the inter- and intra-species interaction coefficients
in the sense of maintaining stability during evolution from one stationary
state to another. A firm connection is thus established between the second law
of thermodynamics and natural selection.
