We prove that if G is a 4-critical graph of girth at least five then
|E(G)|>=(5|V(G)|+2)/3. As a corollary, graphs of girth at least five embeddable
in the Klein bottle or torus are 3-colorable. These are results of Thomas and
Walls, and Thomassen respectively. The proof uses the new potential technique
developed by Kostochka and Yancey who proved that 4-critical graphs satisfy:
|E(G)|>=(5|V(G)|-2)/3.
