Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) in which the signature code assignment
to users contains a random element has recently become a cornerstone of CDMA
research. The random element in the construction is particularly attractive in
that it provides robustness and flexibility in application, whilst not making
significant sacrifices in terms of multiuser efficiency. We present results for
sparse random codes of two types, with and without modulation. Simple
microscopic consideration on system samples would suggest differences in the
phase space of the two models, but we demonstrate that the thermodynamic
results and metastable states are equivalent in the minimum bit error rate
detector. We analyse marginal properties of interactions and also make
analogies to constraint satisfiability problems in order to understand
qualitative features of detection and metastable states. This may have
consequences for developing algorithmic methods to escape metastable states,
thus improving decoding performance.
