Let $d_i(m)$ denote the coefficients of the Boros-Moll polynomials. Moll's
minimum conjecture states that the sequence
$\{i(i+1)(d_i^2(m)-d_{i-1}(m)d_{i+1}(m))\}_{1\leq i \leq m}$ attains its
minimum with $i=m$. This conjecture is a stronger than the log-concavity
conjecture proved by Kausers and Paule. We give a proof of Moll's conjecture by
utilizing the spiral property of the sequence $\{d_i(m)\}_{0\leq i \leq m}$,
and the log-concavity of the sequence $\{i!d_i(m)\}_{0\leq i \leq m}$.
