Huge volume of data from domain specific applications such as medical,
financial, library, telephone, shopping records and individual are regularly
generated. Sharing of these data is proved to be beneficial for data mining
application. On one hand such data is an important asset to business decision
making by analyzing it. On the other hand data privacy concerns may prevent
data owners from sharing information for data analysis. In order to share data
while preserving privacy, data owner must come up with a solution which
achieves the dual goal of privacy preservation as well as an accuracy of data
mining task - clustering and classification. An efficient and effective
approach has been proposed that aims to protect privacy of sensitive
information and obtaining data clustering with minimum information loss.
