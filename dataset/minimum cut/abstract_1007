Granular materials fluidized by a rapidly vibrating bottom plate often
develop a fascinating density inversion: a heavier layer of granulate supported
by a lower-density region. We employ the Navier-Stokes granular hydrodynamics
to follow a density inversion as it develops in time. Assuming a dilute
low-Mach-number flow, we derive a reduced time-dependent model of the late
stage of the dynamics. The model looks especially simple in the Lagrangian
coordinates. The time-dependent solution describes the growth of a density peak
at an intermediate height. A transient temperature minimum is predicted to
develop in the region of the density peak. The temperature minimum disappears
at later times, as the system approaches the steady state. At late times, the
predictions of the low-Mach-number model are in good agreement with a numerical
solution of the full hydrodynamic equations. At an early stage of the dynamics,
pressure oscillations are predicted.
