A path in an edge-colored graph $G$ is \textit{rainbow} if no two edges of it
are colored the same. The graph $G$ is \textit{rainbow colored} if there is a
rainbow path between every pair of vertices. If there is a rainbow shortest
path between every pair of vertices, the graph $G$ is \textit{strong rainbow
colored}. The minimum number of colors needed to make $G$ rainbow colored is
known as the \textit{rainbow connection number}, and is denoted by $\rc(G)$.
The minimum number of colors needed to make $G$ strong rainbow colored is known
as the \textit{strong rainbow connection number}, and is denoted by $\src(G)$.
A graph is \textit{chordal} if it contains no induced cycle of length 4 or
more. We show that for every $k \geq 3$, deciding whether a chordal graph can
be strong rainbow colored using $k$ colors is $\NP$-complete. We then consider
the rainbow and strong rainbow connection numbers of \textit{block graphs},
which form a subclass of chordal graphs. We give an exact linear time algorithm
for strong rainbow coloring block graphs exploiting a \textit{clique tree}
representation each chordal graph has. We characterize the bridgeless block
graphs having rainbow connection number 2, 3, or 4, and show that for every $k
\leq 4$, it is in $\P$ to decide whether $\rc(G) = k$, where $G$ is a
bridgeless block graph. We also derive a tight upper bound of $|S|+2$ on
$\rc(G)$, where $G$ is a block graph, and $S$ its set of minimal separators.
