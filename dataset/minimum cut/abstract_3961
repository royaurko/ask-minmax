We discuss prospects for stabilizing the volume modulus of N=1 supersymmetric
type IIB orientifold compactifications using only perturbative corrections to
the Kahler potential. Concretely, we consider the known string loop corrections
and tree-level alpha' corrections. They break the no-scale structure of the
potential, which otherwise prohibits stabilizing the volume modulus. We argue
that when combined, these corrections provide enough flexibility to stabilize
the volume of the internal space without non-perturbative effects, although we
are not able to present a completely explicit example within the limited set of
currently available models. Furthermore, a certain amount of fine-tuning is
needed to obtain a minimum at large volume.
