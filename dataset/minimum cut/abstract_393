We examine a simple model for Pb(In$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_3$ (PIN), which
includes both long-range dipole-dipole interaction and random local anisotropy.
A improved algorithm optimized for long-range interaction has been applied for
efficient large-scale Monte Carlo simulation. We demonstrate that the phase
diagram of PIN is qualitatively reproduced by this minimum model. Some
properties characteristic of relaxors such as nano-scale domain formation, slow
dynamics and dispersive dielectric responses are also examined.
