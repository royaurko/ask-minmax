The glass transition of a hard sphere system is investigated within the
framework of the density functional theory (DFT). Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations are performed to study dynamical behavior of the system on the one
hand and to provide the data to produce the density field for the DFT on the
other hand. Energy landscape analysis based on the DFT shows that there appears
a metastable (local) free energy minimum representing an amorphous state as the
density is increased. This state turns out to become stable, compared with the
uniform liquid, at some density, around which we also observe sharp slowing
down of the $alpha$ relaxation in MD simulations.
