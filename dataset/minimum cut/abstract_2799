A vertical partial gate carbon nanotube (CNT) field-effect transistor (FET),
which is amenable to the vertical CNT growth process and offers the potential
for a parallel CNT array channel, is simulated using a self-consistent
atomistic approach. We show that the underlap between the gate and the bottom
electrode (required for isolation between electrodes) is advantageous for
transistor operation because it suppresses ambipolar conduction. A vertical
CNTFET with a gate length that covers only 1/6 of the channel length has a much
smaller minimum leakage current than one without underlap, while maintaining
comparable on current. Both n-type and p-type transistor operations with
balanced performance metrics can be achieved on a single partial gate FET by
using proper bias schemes. Even with a gate underlap, it is demonstrated that
increasing the CNT diameter still leads to a simultaneous increase of on
current and minimum leakage current. Along with a partial gate, the simulated
transistor features a significant amount of air between the surface of the
channel CNT and the gate insulator, as is caused by the vertical CNT growth
process. Filing this pore with a high-k insulator is shown to have the
potential to decrease the on current, due to electrostatic phenomena at the
source-channel contact.
