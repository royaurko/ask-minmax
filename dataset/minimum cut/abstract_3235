We present the first detections of the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105
at sub-millimetre wavelengths. We clearly detect the source at 350 GHz on two
epochs, with significant variability over the 24 hr between epochs.
Quasi-simultaneous radio monitoring indicates an approximately flat spectrum
from 2 - 350 GHz, although there is marginal evidence for a minimum in the
spectrum between 15 - 350 GHz. The flat spectrum and correlated variability
imply that the sub-mm emission arises from the same synchrotron source as the
radio emission. This source is likely to be a quasi-steady partially
self-absorbed jet, in which case these sub-mm observations probe significantly
closer to the base of the jet than do radio observations and may be used in
future as a valuable diagnostic of the disc:jet connection in this source.
