A mechanism of the translation in oligomer world is proposed. The translation
is carried out by a minimum cycle, which is sustained by adaptors and
helicases, and the first information processing in oligomer world. We expect
that such a cycle actually worked in a primitive cell and can be constructed in
vitro. By computer simulation we have shown that a proofreading is achieved by
the fluctuation in the cell. It is rather paradoxical that the proofreading is
effective for the system consisting of molecular machines with low efficiency.
