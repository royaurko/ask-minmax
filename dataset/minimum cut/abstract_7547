At a distance of 50 kpc and with a dark matter mass of $\sim10^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a natural target for indirect
dark matter searches. We use five years of data from the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT) and updated models of the gamma-ray emission from standard
astrophysical components to search for a dark matter annihilation signal from
the LMC. We perform a rotation curve analysis to determine the dark matter
distribution, setting a robust minimum on the amount of dark matter in the LMC,
which we use to set conservative bounds on the annihilation cross section. The
LMC emission is generally very well described by the standard astrophysical
sources, with at most a $1-2\sigma$ excess identified near the kinematic center
of the LMC once systematic uncertainties are taken into account. We place
competitive bounds on the dark matter annihilation cross section as a function
of dark matter particle mass and annihilation channel.
