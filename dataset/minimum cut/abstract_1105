In our work, we have proposed the arcade structures as minimum dissipative
relaxed states (including both the viscous and resistive channels) pertaining
to a two-fluid description of the plasma. The obtained relaxed state is non
force-free in nature and appropriate to an open system with external drives.
The Euler-Lagrange equations are solved in Cartesian coordinates subject to the
existing photospheric boundary conditions. The solutions are seen to support
flow-containing arcade like magnetic field configurations with inherent
dissipative properties that may play an important role in the coronal heating.
An interesting feature observed is the generation of different types of arcades
with the variation of a single parameter characterizing the relaxed state.
Also, recent observations with the LASCO coronagraph on board the SOHO
spacecraft suggest that the helmet streamers originating from the sun may have
an internal triple-arcade structure. The two-fluid relaxed state obtained here
is also seen to support such structures.
