We present a numerical study of the cascades damage in {\alpha}-iron for high
cascade energy up to 250keV, corresponding to neutron energy above and beyond
14.1MeV. We observe that Frenkel pairs production efficiency and perfect
crystal lattices damage efficiency have the close trend within the statistical
uncertainty versus cascade energy, and the two kinds of curves first decrease
with power-law trend, and arrive at their minimum at threshold energy of
subcascades, then these curves begin to increase with cascade energy. The
analysis demonstrates that the tendency of these curves reflects degree of
concentration of defects and depends on the number of subcascades which keeps
identical with defects scattering and the energy of subcascades reflecting
defects concentration. The pair analysis technique may help us understand the
total damage of perfect crystal lattices.
