The Monte Carlo method of the nominal orbit clonning was applied to the case
of 99942 Apophis, the asteroid from the Aten group. Calculations based on
observations from the time interval of 2004 03 15 - 2008 01 09 have shown that
the asteroid will pass near Earth in 2029 at the minimum distance of 5.921 \pm
0.042 R_{Earth}, what implies that the likelihood that Apophis strikes the
planet at 2036 April 13 increased to 4.5\times 10^{-6} (from about 6\times
10^{-7} previously announced by us in Paper~I (Krolikowska, Sitarski and
Soltan, 2009, MNRAS 399, 1964). This value is identical with that given by
Chesley, Baer, and Monet (2010, Icarus, in press).
