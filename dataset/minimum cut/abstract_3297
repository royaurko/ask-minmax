We present the results of a deep, optical/IR wide field imaging survey of
selected fields in the nearby (d ~ 140 pc) Taurus star-forming region. We
report the discovery of 9 new members with spectral types M5.75-M9.5. We derive
an Initial Mass Function encompassing 54% of the known members in Taurus.
Comparison with dense regions like the Trapezium Cluster in Orion shows that
Taurus has produced x2 less brown dwarfs. We suggest that the lower frequency
of brown dwarfs in Taurus may result from the low-density star-forming
environment, leading to larger minimum Jeans masses.
