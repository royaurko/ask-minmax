In this paper we investigate the global dynamics for the minimally coupled
scalar field representation of the modified Chaplygin gas in the context of
flat FLRW cosmology. The tool for doing this is a new set of bounded variables
that lead to a regular dynamical system. It is shown that the exact modified
Chaplygin gas perfect fluid solution appears as a straight line in the
associated phase plane. It is also shown that no other solutions stay close to
this solution during their entire temporal evolution, but that there exists an
open subset of solutions that stay arbitrarily close during an intermediate
time interval, and into the future in the case the scalar field potential
exhibits a global minimum.
