The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured the invariant cross section for
omega-meson production at mid-rapidity in the transverse momentum range 2.5 <
p_T < 9.25 GeV/c in p+p and d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV.
Measurements in two decay channels (omega --> pi^0 pi^+ pi^- and omega --> pi^0
gamma) yield consistent results, and the reconstructed omega mass agrees with
the accepted value within the p_T range of the measurements. The omega/pi^0
ratio is found to be 0.85 +/- 0.05(stat) +/- 0.09(sys) and 0.94 +/- 0.08(stat)
+/- 0.12(sys) in p+p and d+Au collisions respectively, independent of p_T . The
nuclear modification factor R_dA is 1.03 +/- 0.12(stat) +/- 0.21(sys) and 0.83
+/- 0.21(stat) +/- 0.17(sys) in minimum bias and central (0-20%) d+Au
collisions, respectively.
