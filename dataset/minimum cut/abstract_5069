We demonstrate an amplitude-based micro-displacement sensor that uses a
plastic photonic bandgap Bragg fiber with one end coated with a silver layer.
The reflection intensity of the Bragg fiber is characterized in response to
different displacements (or bending curvatures). We note that the Bragg
reflector of the fiber acts as an efficient mode stripper for the wavelengths
near the edge of the fiber bandgap, which makes the sensor extremely sensitive
to bending or displacements at these wavelengths. Besides, by comparison of the
Bragg fiber sensor to a sensor based on a regular multimode fiber with similar
outer diameter and length, we find that the Bragg fiber sensor is more
sensitive to bending due to presence of mode stripper in the form of the
multilayer reflector. Experimental results show that the minimum detection
limit of the Bragg fiber sensor can be smaller than 5 um for displacement
sensing.
