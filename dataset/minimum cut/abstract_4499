This paper analyzes the diversity gain achieved by single-carrier
frequency-domain equalizer (SC-FDE) in frequency selective channels, and
uncovers the interplay between diversity gain $d$, channel memory length $\nu$,
transmission block length $L$, and the spectral efficiency $R$. We specifically
show that for the class of minimum means-square error (MMSE) SC-FDE receivers,
for rates $R\leq\log\frac{L}{\nu}$ full diversity of $d=\nu+1$ is achievable,
while for higher rates the diversity is given by $d=\lfloor2^{-R}L\rfloor+1$.
In other words, the achievable diversity gain depends not only on the channel
memory length, but also on the desired spectral efficiency and the transmission
block length. A similar analysis reveals that for zero forcing SC-FDE, the
diversity order is always one irrespective of channel memory length and
spectral efficiency. These results are supported by simulations.
