This paper investigates the hypothesis that the lensing objects towards the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are brown dwarfs by analysing the effects of
velocity anisotropy on the inferred microlensing masses. To reduce the masses,
the transverse velocity of the lenses with respect to the microlensing tube
must be minimised. In the outer halo, radial anisotropy is best for doing this;
closer to the solar circle, azimuthal anisotropy is best. By using a constraint
on the total kinetic energy of the tracer population from the Jeans equations,
the microlensing mass is minimised over orientations of the velocity dispersion
tensor. This minimum mass is about a tenth of a solar mass, which lies above
the hydrogen burning limit. This demonstrates explicitly that populations of
brown dwarfs with smoothly decreasing densities and dynamically mixed velocity
distributions cannot be responsible for the microlensing events. Brown dwarfs
are no white knights! There is one caveat. If there are demons sitting on the
microlensing tube, they can drop brown dwarfs so as to reproduce the
microlensing data-set exactly. Such a distribution is not smooth and does not
give well-mixed velocities in phase space. It is a permissible solution only if
the outer halo is dynamically young and lumpy. In such a case, theorists cannot
rule out brown dwarfs. Only exorcists can!
