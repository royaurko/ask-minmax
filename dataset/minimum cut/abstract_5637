The main contribution of this paper is an efficient and generalized
decentralized monitoring algorithm allowing to detect satisfaction or violation
of any regular specification by local monitors alone in a system without
central observation point. Our algorithm does not assume any form of
synchronization between system events and communication of monitors, uses state
machines as underlying mechanism for efficiency, and tries to keep the number
and size of messages exchanged between monitors to a minimum. We provide a full
implementation of the algorithm with an open-source benchmark to evaluate its
efficiency in terms of number, size of exchanged messages, and delay induced by
communication between monitors. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm which outperforms the previous most general one
along several (new) monitoring metrics.
