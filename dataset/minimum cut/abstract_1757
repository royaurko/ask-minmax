A small fixed-mirror Michelson interferometer has been built in Frascati to
experimentally study the alignment method that has been suggested for VIRGO.
The experimental results fully confirm the adequacy of the method. The minimum
angular misalignment that can be detected in the present set-up is 10
nrad/sqrt{Hz}
