This paper is concerned with the minimum distance computation for higher
dimensional toric codes defined by lattice polytopes. We show that the minimum
distance is multiplicative with respect to taking the product of polytopes, and
behaves in a simple way when one builds a k-dilate of a pyramid over a
polytope. This allows us to construct a large class of examples of higher
dimensional toric codes where we can compute the minimum distance explicitly.
