We address high dimensional covariance estimation for elliptical distributed
samples, which are also known as spherically invariant random vectors (SIRV) or
compound-Gaussian processes. Specifically we consider shrinkage methods that
are suitable for high dimensional problems with a small number of samples
(large $p$ small $n$). We start from a classical robust covariance estimator
[Tyler(1987)], which is distribution-free within the family of elliptical
distribution but inapplicable when $n<p$. Using a shrinkage coefficient, we
regularize Tyler's fixed point iterations. We prove that, for all $n$ and $p$,
the proposed fixed point iterations converge to a unique limit regardless of
the initial condition. Next, we propose a simple, closed-form and data
dependent choice for the shrinkage coefficient, which is based on a minimum
mean squared error framework. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves low estimation error and is robust to heavy-tailed samples. Finally,
as a real world application we demonstrate the performance of the proposed
technique in the context of activity/intrusion detection using a wireless
sensor network.
