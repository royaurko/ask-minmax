The charge-phase Josephson qubit based on a superconducting single charge
transistor inserted in a low-inductance superconducting loop is considered. The
loop is inductively coupled to a radio-frequency driven tank circuit enabling
the readout of the qubit states by measuring the effective Josephson inductance
of the transistor. The effect of qubit dephasing and relaxation due to electric
and magnetic control lines as well as the measuring system is evaluated.
Recommendations for operation of the qubit in magic points producing minimum
decoherence are given.
