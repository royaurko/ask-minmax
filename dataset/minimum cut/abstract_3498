It is shown that the fraction f of imaginary frequency instantaneous normal
modes (INM) may be defined and calculated in a random energy model(REM) of
liquids. The configurational entropy S and the averaged hopping rate among the
states R are also obtained and related to f, with the results R~f and
S=a+b*ln(f). The proportionality between R and f is the basis of existing INM
theories of diffusion, so the REM further confirms their validity. A link to S
opens new avenues for introducing INM into dynamical theories. Liquid 'states'
are usually defined by assigning a configuration to the minimum to which it
will drain, but the REM naturally treats saddle-barriers on the same footing as
minima, which may be a better mapping of the continuum of configurations to
discrete states. Requirements of a detailed REM description of liquids are
discussed.
