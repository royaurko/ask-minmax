A \textit{locally identifying coloring} ($lid$-coloring) of a graph is a
proper coloring such that the sets of colors appearing in the closed
neighborhoods of any pair of adjacent vertices having distinct neighborhoods
are distinct. Our goal is to study a \textit{relaxed locally identifying
coloring} ($rlid$-coloring) of a graph that is similar to locally identifying
coloring for which the coloring is not necessary proper.We denote by
$\chi_{rlid}(G)$ the minimum number of colors used in a relaxed locally
identifying coloring of a graph $G$
  In this paper, we prove that the problem of deciding that $\chi_{rlid}(G)=3$
for a $2$-degenerate planar graph $G$ is $NP$-complete. We give several bounds
of $\chi_{rlid}(G)$ and construct graphs for which some of these bounds are
tightened. Studying some families of graphs allows us to compare this parameter
with the minimum number of colors used in a locally identifying coloring of a
graph $G$ ($\chi_{lid}(G)$), the size of a minimum identifying code of $G$
($\gamma_{id}(G)$) and the chromatic number of $G$ ($\chi(G)$).
