During the solar minimum STEREO observations show that the three-dimensional
structure of the solar corona can be described well by a tilted bi-polar
magnetic configuration. The slow solar wind is modeled using three-fluid model
that includes heavy ions, such as He II and O VI. The model is initialized with
dipole magnetic field and spherically symmetric density. The resulting steady
state non-potential and non-uniform streamer configuration calculated with this
model is compared to STEREO observations of the streamer density structure.
SOHO/UVCS observations are used to compare the O VI emission to model results.
We discuss the unique properties of the solar wind produced in this
configuration.
