Spurious velocities are unphysical currents that appear close to curved
interfaces in diffuse interface methods. We analyse the causes of these
spurious velocities in the free energy lattice Boltzmann algorithm. By making a
suitable choice of the equilibrium distribution, and by finding the best way to
numerically calculate derivatives, we show that these velocities may be
decreased by an order of magnitude compared to previous models. Furthermore, we
propose a momentum conserving forcing method that reduces spurious velocities
by another factor of ~5. In three dimensions we find that 19 velocity vectors
is the minimum number necessary.
