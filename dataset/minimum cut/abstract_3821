This paper presents new measurements in a case study of the minimal SUGRA
model with m_0=100 GeV, mhalf=300 GeV, A_0=0, tan(beta)=2.1, and mu=+1 based on
four-body distributions from three-step decays and on minimum masses in such
decays. These measurements allow masses of supersymmetric particles to be
determined without relying on a model. The feasibility of testing slepton
universality at the ~0.1% level at high luminosity is discussed. In addition,
the effect of enlarging the parameter space of the minimal SUGRA model is
discussed. The direct production of left handed sleptons and the
non-observation of additional structure in the dilepton invariant mass
distributions is shown to provide additional constraints.
