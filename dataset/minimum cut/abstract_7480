To bridge the gap between the sequences and 3-dimensional (3D) structures of
RNAs, some computational models have been proposed for predicting RNA 3D
structures. However, the existed models seldom consider the conditions
departing from the room/body temperature and high salt (1M NaCl), and thus
generally hardly predict the thermodynamics and salt effect. In this study, we
propose a coarse-grained model with implicit salt for RNAs to predict 3D
structures, stability and salt effect. Combined with Monte Carlo simulated
annealing algorithm and a coarse-grained force field, the model folds 46 tested
RNAs (less than or equal to 45 nt) including pseudoknots into their native-like
structures from their sequences, with an overall mean RMSD of 3.5 {\AA} and an
overall minimum RMSD of 1.9 {\AA} from the experimental structures. For 30 RNA
hairpins, the present model also gives the reliable predictions for the
stability and salt effect with the mean deviation ~ 1.0 degrees Celsius of
melting temperatures, as compared with the extensive experimental data. In
addition, the model could provide the ensemble of possible 3D structures for a
short RNA at a given temperature/salt condition.
