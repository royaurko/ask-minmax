Two measurements related to the proton and anti-proton production near
midrapidity in center of mass energies of 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200
GeV Au+Au collisions using the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) are discussed. At intermediate impact parameters the slope
parameter of the directed flow versus rapidity (dv1/dy) for the net-protons
shows a non-monotonic variation as a function of the beam energy. This
non-monotonic variation is characterized by the presence of a minimum in dv1/dy
between 11.5 and 19.6 GeV and a change in the sign of dv1/dy twice between 7.7
and 39 GeV. At small impact parameters the product of the moments of net-proton
distribution, kurtosis x variance and skewness x standard deviation are
observed to be significantly below the corresponding measurements at large
impact parameter collisions for 19.6 and 27 GeV. The kurtosis x variance and
skewness x standard deviation at these beam energies deviate from the
expectations from Poisson statistics and that from a Hadron Resonance Gas
model. Both these measurements have implications towards the understanding of
the QCD phase structures, the first order phase transition and the critical
point in the high baryonic chemical potential region of the phase diagram.
