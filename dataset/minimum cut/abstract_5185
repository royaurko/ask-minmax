We study the Minkowski length L(P) of a lattice polytope P, which is defined
to be the largest number of non-trivial primitive segments whose Minkowski sum
lies in P. The Minkowski length represents the largest possible number of
factors in a factorization of polynomials with exponent vectors in P, and shows
up in lower bounds for the minimum distance of toric codes. In this paper we
give a polytime algorithm for computing L(P) where P is a 3D lattice polytope.
We next study 3D lattice polytopes of Minkowski length 1. In particular, we
show that if Q, a subpolytope of P, is the Minkowski sum of L = L(P) lattice
polytopes Qi, each of Minkowski length 1, then the total number of interior
lattice points of the polytopes Q1,..., QL is at most 4. Both results extend
previously known results for lattice polygons. Our methods differ substantially
from those used in the two-dimensional case.
