We argue, based on general principles, that topological order is essential to
realize fractionalization in gapped insulating phases in dimensions $d \geq 2$.
In $d=2$ with genus $g$, we derive the existence of the minimum topological
degeneracy $q^g$ if the charge is fractionalized in unit of $1/q$, irrespective
of microscopic model or of effective theory. Furthermore, if the quasiparticle
is either boson or fermion, it must be at least $q^{2g}$.
