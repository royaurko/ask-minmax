Meridional circulation is an important ingredient in flux transport dynamo
models. We have studied its importance on the period, the amplitude of the
solar cycle, and also in producing Maunder-like grand minima in these models.
First, we model the periods of the last 23 sunspot cycles by varying the
meridional circulation speed. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime,
then we find that most of the cycle amplitudes also get modeled up to some
extent when we model the periods. Next, we propose that at the beginning of the
Maunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value
and then after a few years it increased again. Several independent studies also
favor this assumption. With this assumption, a diffusion-dominated dynamo is
able to reproduce many important features of the Maunder minimum remarkably
well. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then a slower
meridional circulation means that the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse
during its transport through the convection zone, making the dynamo weaker.
This consequence helps to model both the cycle amplitudes and the Maunder-like
minima. We, however, fail to reproduce these results if the dynamo is in an
advection-dominated regime.
