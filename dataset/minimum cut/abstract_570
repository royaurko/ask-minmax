We point out that the potential of Goldberger and Wise for stabilizing the
distance between two 3-branes, separated from each other along an extra
dimension with a warp factor, has a metastable minimum when the branes are
infinitely separated. The classical evolution of the radion (brane separation)
will place it in this false minimum for generic initial conditions. In
particular, inflation could do this if the expansion rate is sufficiently
large. We present a simplified version of the Goldberger-Wise mechanism in
which the radion potential can be computed exactly, and we calculate the rate
of thermal transitions to the true minimum, showing that model parameters can
be chosen to ensure that the universe reaches the desired final state.
Finiteness of bulk scalar field brane potentials can have an important impact
on the nucleation rate, and it can also significantly increase the predicted
mass of the radion.
