What is the minimum number of edges that have to be added to the random graph
$G=G_{n,0.5}$ in order to increase its chromatic number $\chi=\chi(G)$ by one
percent ? One possibility is to add all missing edges on a set of $1.01 \chi$
vertices, thus creating a clique of chromatic number $1.01 \chi$. This
requires, with high probability, the addition of $\Omega(n^2/\log^2 n)$ edges.
We show that this is tight up to a constant factor, consider the question for
more general random graphs $G_{n,p}$ with $p=p(n)$, and study a local version
of the question as well.
  The question is motivated by the study of the resilience of graph properties,
initiated by the second contributor and Vu, and improves one of their results.
