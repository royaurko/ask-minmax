We present two conjectures concerning the diameter of a direct power of a
finite group. The first conjecture states that the diameter of G^n with respect
to any generating set is at most n(|G|-rank(G)); and the second one states that
there exists a generating set A, of minimum size, for G^n such that the
diameter of G^n with respect to A is at most n(|G|-rank(G)). We will establish
evidence for each of the above mentioned conjectures.
