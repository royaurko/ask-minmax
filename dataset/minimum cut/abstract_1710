The effective potential between charged colloids trapped at water interfaces
is analyzed. It consists of a repulsive electrostatic and an attractive
capillary part which asymptotically both show dipole--like behavior. For
sufficiently large colloid charges, the capillary attraction dominates at large
separations.
 The total effective potential exhibits a minimum at intermediate separations
if the Debye screening length of water and the colloid radius are of comparable
size.
