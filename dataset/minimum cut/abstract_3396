We present here the detection of a planet orbiting around the F6V star HD
33564. The radial velocity measurements, obtained with the ELODIE echelle
spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory, show a variation with a period
of 388 days. Assuming a primary mass of 1.25 Mo, the best Keplerian fit to the
data leads to a minimum mass of 9.1 MJup for the companion.
