We show that each pseudoconvex domain $\Omega\subset {\mathbb C}^n$ admits a
holomorphic map $F$ to ${\mathbb C}^m$ with $|F|\le C_1 e^{C_2
\hat{\delta}^{-6}}$, where $\hat{\delta}$ is the minimum of the boundary
distance and $(1+|z|^2)^{-1/2}$, such that every boundary point is a
Casorati-Weierstrass point of $F$. Based on this fact, we introduce a new
anti-hyperbolic concept --- universal dominability. We also show that for each
$\alpha>6$ and each pseudoconvex domain $\Omega\subset {\mathbb C}^n$, there is
a holomorphic function $f$ on ${\Omega}$ with $|f|\le C_\alpha e^{C_\alpha'
\hat{\delta}^{-\alpha}}$, such that every boundary point is a Picard point of
$F$. Applications to the construction of holomorphic maps of a given domain
onto some ${\mathbb C}^m$ are given.
