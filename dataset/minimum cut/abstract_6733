A graph G on n vertices is Hamiltonian if it contains a cycle of length n and
pancyclic if it contains cycles of length $\ell$ for all $3 \le \ell \le n$.
Write $\alpha(G)$ for the independence number of $G$, i.e. the size of the
largest subset of the vertex set that does not contain an edge, and $\kappa(G)$
for the (vertex) connectivity, i.e. the size of the smallest subset of the
vertex set that can be deleted to obtain a disconnected graph. A celebrated
theorem of Chv\'atal and Erd\H{o}s says that $G$ is Hamiltonian if $\kappa(G)
\ge \alpha(G)$. Moreover, Bondy suggested that almost any non-trivial
conditions for Hamiltonicity of a graph should also imply pancyclicity.
Motivated by this, we prove that if $\kappa(G) \ge 600\alpha(G)$ then G is
pancyclic. This establishes a conjecture of Jackson and Ordaz up to a constant
factor. Moreover, we obtain the more general result that if G is Hamiltonian
with minimum degree $\delta(G) \ge 600\alpha(G)$ then G is pancyclic. Improving
an old result of Erd\H{o}s, we also show that G is pancyclic if it is
Hamiltonian and $n \ge 150\alpha(G)^3$. Our arguments use the following theorem
of independent interest on cycle lengths in graphs: if $\delta(G) \ge
300\alpha(G)$ then G contains a cycle of length $\ell$ for all $3 \le \ell \le
\delta(G)/81$.
