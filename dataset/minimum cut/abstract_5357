In Euclidean space there is a trivial upper bound on the maximum length of a
compound "walk" built up of variable-length jumps, and a considerably less
trivial lower bound on its minimum length. The existence of this non-trivial
lower bound is intimately connected to the triangle inequalities, and the more
general "polygon inequalities". Moving beyond Euclidean space, when a modified
version of these bounds is applied in "rapidity space" they provide upper and
lower bounds on the relativistic composition of velocities. Similarly, when
applied to "transfer matrices" these bounds place constraints either (in a
scattering context) on transmission and reflection coefficients, or (in a
parametric excitation context) on particle production. Physically these are
very different contexts, but mathematically there are intimate relations
between these superficially very distinct systems.
