We study variational wave functions of the product form, factorizing
according to the wave vectors k, for the ground state of a system of bosons
interacting via positive pair interactions with a positive Fourier transform.
Our trial functions are members of different orthonormal bases in Fock space.
Each basis contains a quasiparticle vacuum state and states with an arbitrary
finite number of quasiparticles. One of the bases is that of Valatin and Butler
(VB), introduced fifty years ago and parametrized by an infinite set of
variables determining Bogoliubov's canonical transformation for each k. In
another case, inspired by Nozi\`eres and Saint James the canonical
transformation for k=0 is replaced by a shift in the creation/annihilation
operators. For the VB basis we prove that the lowest energy is obtained in a
state with ~sqrt{volume} quasiparticles in the zero mode. The number of k=0
physical particles is of the order of the volume and its fluctuation is
anomalously large, resulting in an excess energy. The same fluctuation is
normal in the second type of optimized bases, the minimum energy is smaller and
is attained in a vacuum state. Associated quasiparticle theories and questions
about the gap in their spectrum are also discussed.
