An argument is given showing that Coulomb attraction between conduction
electrons and impurity ions in a dilute magnetic alloy (DMA) can be
disregarded, provided the system's inverse temperature beta is replaced by an
effective inverse temperature t < beta. This replacement allows to remove the
singularity in Kondo's expression for DMA impurity resistivity and extend his
theory to 0 K. The extended Kondo formula agrees with experimental data on
resistivity of CuFe in the range of low temperatures and in the neighbourhood
of the resistivity minimum.
  Using an asymptotic solution of the thermodynamics of a dilute s-d system at
inverse temperature t, the impurity thermodynamic functions are derived and
shown to provide good agreement with experimental data on CuFe, CuCr and
(LaCe)Al_2 alloys in the low-temperature range. The magnitude of these
functions agrees with experiment and does not require rescaling as in previous
s-d theories. Nonlinear dependence of CuFe heat capacity on impurity
concentration has been accounted for the first time.
