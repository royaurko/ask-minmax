A new algorithm is presented for computing a direct solution to a system of
consistent linear equations. It produces a minimum norm particular solution, a
generalized inverse (of type {124}), and a null space projection operator. In
addition, the algorithm permits an online formulation so that computations may
proceed as the data become available. The algorithm does not require the
solution of a triangular system of equations, nor does it rely on block
partitioned matrices.
