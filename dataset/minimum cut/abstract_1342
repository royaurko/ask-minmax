We perform 3D hydrodynamical numerical simulations of the winds interaction
process in the massive binary system $\eta$ Carinae, and find the secondary
star to accrete mass from the dense primary wind close to periastron passage.
This accretion is thought to result in the spectroscopic event and X-ray
minimum observed in the system every revolution. In this study we limit
ourselves to explore the role of clumps in the primary wind in triggering the
accretion process. We include the gravity of the secondary star and the orbital
motion starting 19 days (90 degrees) before periastron passage. The accretion
process is triggered by dense clumps that cannot be decelerated by the ram
pressure of the secondary wind. The dense clumps are formed by instabilities in
the thin dense shell formed by the shocked primary wind gas. We explore the
role of the numerical viscosity and some physical parameters on the initiation
of the accretion process, and explain the unique properties of $\eta$ Car that
allow for the periastron accretion process to occur. The accretion starts about
a week before periastron passage, as is required to explain the several weeks
long X-ray minimum.
