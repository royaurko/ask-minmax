EPOS is a Monte-Carlo event generator for minimum bias hadronic interactions,
used for both heavy ion interactions and cosmic ray air shower simulations.
Since the last public release in 2009, the LHC experiments have provided a
number of very interesting data sets comprising minimum bias p-p, p-Pb and
Pb-Pb interactions. We describe the changes required to the model to reproduce
in detail the new data available from LHC and the consequences in the
interpretation of these data. In particular we discuss the effect of the
collective hadronization in p-p scattering. A different parametrization of flow
has been introduced in the case of a small volume with high density of
thermalized matter (core) reached in p-p compared to large volume produced in
heavy ion collisions. Both parametrizations depend only on the geometry and the
amount of secondary particles entering in the core and not on the beam mass or
energy. The transition between the two flow regimes can be tested with p-Pb
data. EPOS LHC is able to reproduce all minimum bias
