We consider a multidimensional diffusion X with drift coefficient
b({\alpha},X(t)) and diffusion coefficient {\epsilon}{\sigma}({\beta},X(t)).
The diffusion is discretely observed at times t_k=k{\Delta} for k=1..n on a
fixed interval [0,T]. We study minimum contrast estimators derived from the
Gaussian process approximating X for small {\epsilon}. We obtain consistent and
asymptotically normal estimators of {\alpha} for fixed {\Delta} and
{\epsilon}\rightarrow0 and of ({\alpha},{\beta}) for {\Delta}\rightarrow0 and
{\epsilon}\rightarrow0. We compare the estimators obtained with various methods
and for various magnitudes of {\Delta} and {\epsilon} based on simulation
studies. Finally, we investigate the interest of using such methods in an
epidemiological framework.
