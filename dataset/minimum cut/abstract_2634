In this paper, we propose a fast distributed solver for linear equations
given by symmetric diagonally dominant M-Matrices. Our approach is based on a
distributed implementation of the parallel solver of Spielman and Peng by
considering a specific approximated inverse chain which can be computed
efficiently in a distributed fashion. Representing the system of equations by a
graph $\mathbb{G}$, the proposed distributed algorithm is capable of attaining
$\epsilon$-close solutions (for arbitrary $\epsilon$) in time proportional to
$n^{3}$ (number of nodes in $\mathbb{G}$), ${\alpha}$ (upper bound on the size
of the R-Hop neighborhood), and $\frac{{W}_{max}}{{W}_{min}}$ (maximum and
minimum weight of edges in $\mathbb{G}$).
