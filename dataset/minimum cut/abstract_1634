We perform a comprehensive survey of the potential energy landscapes of
13-atom Morse clusters, and describe how they can be characterized and
visualized. Our aim is to detail how the global features of the funnel-like
surface change with the range of the potential, and to relate these changes to
the dynamics of structural relaxation. We find that the landscape becomes
rougher and less steep as the range of the potential decreases, and that
relaxation paths to the global minimum become more complicated.
