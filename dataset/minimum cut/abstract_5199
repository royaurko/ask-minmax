The k-core of a graph is its maximal subgraph with minimum degree at least k.
In this paper, we address robustness questions about k-cores. Given a k-core,
remove one edge uniformly at random and find its new k-core. We are interested
in how many vertices are deleted from the original k-core to find the new one.
This can be seem as a measure of robustness of the original k-core. We prove
that, if the initial k-core is chosen uniformly at random from the k-cores with
n vertices and m edges, its robustness depends essentially on its average
degree c. We prove that, if c converges to k, then the new k-core is empty with
probability 1+o(1). We define a constant c(k)' such that when k+epsilon < c <
c(k)'- epsilon, the new k-core is empty with probability bounded away from zero
and, if c > c(k)'+ psi with psi = omega(n^{-1/4}), psi(n) > 0 and c is bounded,
then the probability that the new k-core has less than n-h(n) vertices goes to
zero, for every h(n) = omega(1/psi).
