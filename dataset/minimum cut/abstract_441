We compute the basic parameters (dimension, length, minimum distance) of
affine evaluation codes defined on a cartesian product of finite sets. Given a
sequence of positive integers, we construct an evaluation code, over a
degenerate torus, with prescribed parameters. As an application of our results,
we recover the formulas for the minimum distance of various families of
evaluation codes.
