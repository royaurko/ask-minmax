We present Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet and optical STIS spectroscopy
of the [WCL] planetary nebula central star CPD-568032, obtained during its
latest lightcurve minimum. The UV spectrum shows the central star's continuum
light distribution to be split into two bright peaks separated by 0.10 arcsec.
We interpret this finding as due to an edge-on disk or torus structure that
obscures direct light from the star, which is seen primarily via its light
scattered from the disk's rims or lobes. CPD-568032 is an archetype of dual
dust chemistry [WCL] planetary nebulae, which exhibit strong infrared emission
features from both carbon-rich and oxygen-rich materials, and for which the
presence of a disk harboring the O-rich grains had been suggested. Our direct
observation of an edge-on occulting dust structure around CPD-568032 provides
strong support for such a model and for binary interactions being responsible
for the correlation between the dual dust chemistry phenomenon in planetary
nebulae and the presence of a hydrogen-deficient [WCL] Wolf-Rayet central star.
