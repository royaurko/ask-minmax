We have carried out an analysis of the radio and optical properties of a
statistical sample of 45 Seyfert galaxies from the Palomar spectroscopic survey
of nearby galaxies. We find that the space density of bright galaxies (-22 mag
<= M_{B_T} <= -18 mag) showing Seyfert activity is (1.25 +/- 0.38) X 10^{-3}
Mpc^{-3}, considerably higher than found in other Seyfert samples. Host galaxy
types, radio spectra, and radio source sizes are uncorrelated with Seyfert
type, as predicted by the unified schemes for active galaxies. Approximately
half of the detected galaxies have flat or inverted radio spectra, more than
expected based on previous samples. Surprisingly, Seyfert 1 galaxies are found
to have somewhat stronger radio sources than Seyfert 2 galaxies at 6 and 20 cm,
particularly among the galaxies with the weakest nuclear activity. We suggest
that this difference can be accommodated in the unified schemes if a minimum
level of Seyfert activity is required for a radio source to emerge from the
vicinity of the active nucleus. Below this level, Seyfert radio sources might
be suppressed by free-free absorption associated with the nuclear torus or a
compact narrow-line region, thus accounting for both the weakness of the radio
emission and the preponderance of flat spectra. Alternatively, the flat spectra
and weak radio sources might indicate that the weak active nuclei are fed by
advection-dominated accretion disks.
