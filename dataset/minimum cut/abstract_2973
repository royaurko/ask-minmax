By a generalized inverse of a given matrix, we mean a matrix that exists for
a larger class of matrices than the nonsingular matrices, that has some of the
properties of the usual inverse, and that agrees with inverse when given matrix
happens to be nonsingular. In theory, there are many different generalized
inverses that exist. We shall consider the Moore Penrose, weighted
Moore-Penrose, Drazin and weighted Drazin inverses.
  New determinantal representations of these generalized inverse based on their
limit representations are introduced in this paper. Application of this new
method allows us to obtain analogues classical adjoint matrix. Using the
obtained analogues of the adjoint matrix, we get Cramer's rules for the least
squares solution with the minimum norm and for the Drazin inverse solution of
singular linear systems. Cramer's rules for the minimum norm least squares
solutions and the Drazin inverse solutions of the matrix equations ${\rm {\bf
A}}{\rm {\bf X}} = {\rm {\bf D}}$, ${\rm {\bf X}}{\rm {\bf B}} = {\rm {\bf D}}$
and ${\rm {\bf A}}{\rm {\bf X}}{\rm {\bf B}} ={\rm {\bf D}} $ are also
obtained, where ${\rm {\bf A}}$, ${\rm {\bf B}}$ can be singular matrices of
appropriate size. Finally, we derive determinantal representations of solutions
of the differential matrix equations, ${\bf X}'+ {\bf A}{\bf X}={\bf B}$ and
${\bf X}'+{\bf X}{\bf A}={\bf B}$, where the matrix ${\bf A}$ is singular.
