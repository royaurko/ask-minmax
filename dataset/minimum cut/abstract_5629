We present a study of delta ($\delta$) doping at LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$
(LTO/STO) interface with iso-structural antiferromagnetic perovskite LaCrO$_3$
(LCO) that dramatically alters the properties of the two dimensional electron
gas (2-DEG) at the interface. The effects include a reduction in sheet-carrier
density, prominence of the low temperature resistivity minimum, enhancement of
weak antilocalization below 10 K and observation of a strong anisotropic
magnetoresistance (MR). The positive and negative MR for out-of-plane and
in-plane field respectively and the field and temperature dependencies of MR
suggest Kondo scattering by localized Ti$^{3+}$ moments renormalized by
spin-orbit interaction at T $<$ 10 K, with the increased $\delta$-layer
thickness. Electron energy loss spectroscopy and density functional
calculations provide convincing evidence for blocking of electron transfer from
LTO to STO by the $\delta$-layer.
