The objective of this study is to verify the consistency of the prescription
of alternative minimum coupling (connection) proposed by the Teleparallel
Equivalent to General Relativity (TEGR) for the Dirac equation. With this aim,
we studied the problem of neutrino oscillations in Weitzenbock space-time in
the Schwarzschild metric. In particular, we calculate the phase dynamics of
neutrinos. The relation of spin of the neutrino with the space-time torsion is
clarified through the determination of the phase differences between spin
eigenstates of the neutrinos.
