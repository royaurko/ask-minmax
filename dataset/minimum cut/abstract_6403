We analyze the dynamics and the geometric properties of the Potential Energy
Surfaces (PES) of the k-Trigonometric Model (kTM), defined by a fully-connected
k-body interaction. This model has no thermodynamic transition for k=1, a
second order one for k=2, and a first order one for k>2. In this paper we i)
show that the single particle dynamics can be traced back to an effective
dynamical system (with only one degree of freedom); ii) compute the diffusion
constant analytically; iii) determine analytically several properties of the
self correlation functions apart from the relaxation times which we calculate
numerically; iv) relate the collective correlation functions to the ones of the
effective degree of freedom using an exact Dyson-like equation; v) using two
analytical methods, calculate the saddles of the PES that are visited by the
system evolving at fixed temperature. On the one hand we minimize |grad V|^2,
as usually done in the numerical study of supercooled liquids and, on the other
hand, we compute the saddles with minimum distance (in configuration space)
from initial equilibrium configurations. We find the same result from the two
calculations and we speculate that the coincidence might go beyond the specific
model investigated here.
