The discrete shell structure of vortex matter strongly influences the flux
dynamics in mesoscopic superconducting Corbino disks. While the dynamical
behavior is well understood in large and in very small disks, in the
intermediate-size regime it occurs to be much more complex and unusual, due to
(in)commensurability between the vortex shells. We demonstrate unconventional
vortex dynamics (inversion of shell velocities with respect to the gradient
driving force) and angular melting (propagating from the boundary where the
shear stress is minimum, towards the center) in mesoscopic Corbino disks.
