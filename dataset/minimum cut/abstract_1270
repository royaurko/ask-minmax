We investigate the transport properties of itinerant electrons interacting
with a background of localized spins in a correlated paramagnetic phase of the
pyrochlore lattice. We find a residual resistivity at zero temperature due to
the scattering of electrons by the static dipolar spin-spin correlation that
characterizes the metallic Coulomb phase. As temperature increases, thermally
excited topological defects, also known as magnetic monopoles, reduce the spin
correlation, hence suppressing electron scattering. Combined with the usual
scattering processes in metals at higher temperatures, this mechanism yields a
non-monotonic resistivity, displaying a minimum at temperature scales
associated with the magnetic monopole excitation energy. Our calculations agree
quantitatively with resistivity measurements in Nd2Ir2O7, shedding light on the
origin of the resistivity minimum observed in metallic spin-ice compounds.
