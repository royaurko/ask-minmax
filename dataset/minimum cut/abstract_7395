A graph $G=(V,E)$ is word-representable if there exists a word $w$ over the
alphabet $V$ such that letters $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$ if and only if
$(x,y)$ is an edge in $E$. A graph is word-representable if and only if it is
$k$-word-representable for some $k$, that is, if there exists a word containing
$k$ copies of each letter that represents the graph. Also, being
$k$-word-representable implies being $(k+1)$-word-representable. The minimum
$k$ such that a word-representable graph is $k$-word-representable, is called
graph's representation number.
  Graphs with representation number 1 are complete graphs, while graphs with
representation number 2 are circle graphs. The only fact known before this
paper on the class of graphs with representation number 3, denoted by
$\mathcal{R}_3$, is that the Petersen graph and triangular prism belong to this
class. In this paper, we show that any prism belongs to $\mathcal{R}_3$, and
that two particular operations of extending graphs preserve the property of
being in $\mathcal{R}_3$. Further, we show that $\mathcal{R}_3$ is not included
in a class of $c$-colorable graphs for a constant $c$. To this end, we extend
three known results related to operations on graphs.
  We also show that ladder graphs used in the study of prisms are
$2$-word-representable, and thus each ladder graph is a circle graph. Finally,
we discuss $k$-word-representing comparability graphs via consideration of
crown graphs, where we state some problems for further research.
