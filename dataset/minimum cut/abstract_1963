Time of flight of a minimum ionizing particle along a fixed base has been
measured with a 100 ps accuracy by means of a Dielectric Resistive Plate
Chamber (DRPC) with 4 x 0.3 mm gas gaps. DRPC timing characteristics have been
studied with different applied voltages, discriminating thresholds and beam
intensities. It may be stated that the time-of-flight resolution of gaseous
detectors developed within the ALICE experiment has reached the level of the
best known scintillation counters.
