We give upper bounds on the size of the gap between a non-zero constant term
and the next non-zero Fourier coefficient of an entire level two modular form.
We give upper bounds for the minimum positive integer represented by a level
two even positive-definite quadratic form. These bounds extend partial results
in part I.
