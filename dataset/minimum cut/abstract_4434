We present 7 new tunes of the pT-ordered shower and underlying-event model in
Pythia 6.4. These "Perugia" tunes update and supersede the older "S0" family.
The new tunes include the updated LEP fragmentation and flavour parameters
reported on by H. Hoeth at this workshop. The hadron-collider specific
parameters were then retuned (manually) using Tevatron min-bias data from 630,
1800, and 1960 GeV, Tevatron Drell-Yan data at 1800 and 1960 GeV, as well as
SPS min-bias data at 200, 540, and 900 GeV. In addition to the central
parameter set, related tunes exploring systematically soft, hard, parton
density, and color structure variations are included. Based on these
variations, a best-guess prediction of the charged track multiplicity in
inelastic, nondiffractive minimum-bias events at the LHC is made.
