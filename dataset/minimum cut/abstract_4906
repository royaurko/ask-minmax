We report the discovery of planets orbiting two bright, nearby early K dwarf
stars, HD 97658 and Gl 785. These planets were detected by Keplerian modelling
of radial velocities measured with Keck-HIRES for the NASA-UC Eta-Earth Survey.
HD 97658 b is a close-in super-Earth with minimum mass Msini = 8.2 +/- 1.2
M_Earth, orbital period P = 9.494 +/- 0.005 d, and an orbit that is consistent
with circular. Gl 785 b is a Neptune-mass planet with Msini = 21.6 +/- 2.0
M_Earth, P = 74.39 +/- 0.12 d, and orbital eccentricity 0.30 +/- 0.09.
Photometric observations with the T12 0.8 m automatic photometric telescope at
Fairborn Observatory show that HD 97658 is photometrically constant at the
radial velocity period to 0.09 mmag, supporting the existence of the planet.
