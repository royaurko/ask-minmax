We examine LDPC codes decoded using linear programming (LP). Four
contributions to the LP framework are presented. First, a new method of
tightening the LP relaxation, and thus improving the LP decoder, is proposed.
Second, we present an algorithm which calculates a lower bound on the minimum
distance of a specific code. This algorithm exhibits complexity which scales
quadratically with the block length. Third, we propose a method to obtain a
tight lower bound on the fractional distance, also with quadratic complexity,
and thus less than previously-existing methods. Finally, we show how the
fundamental LP polytope for generalized LDPC codes and nonbinary LDPC codes can
be obtained.
