A graph $G$ is called \textit{super edge-magic} if there exists a bijective
function $f$ from $V(G) \cup E(G)$ to $\{1, 2, \ldots, |V(G) \cup E(G)|\}$ such
that $f(V(G)) = \{1, 2, \ldots, |V(G)|\}$ and $f(x) + f(xy) + f(y)$ is a
constant $k$ for every edge $xy$ of $G$. Furthermore, the \textit{super
edge-magic deficiency} of a graph $G$ is either the minimum nonnegative integer
$n$ such that $G \cup nK_1$ is super edge-magic or $+\infty$ if there exists no
such integer.
  \emph{Join product} of two graphs is their graph union with additional edges
that connect all vertices of the first graph to each vertex of the second
graph. In this paper, we study the super edge-magic deficiencies of a wheel
minus an edge and join products of a path, a star, and a cycle, respectively,
with isolated vertices.
