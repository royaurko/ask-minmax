Possibilistic conditional independence is investigated: we propose a
definition of this notion similar to the one used in probability theory. The
links between independence and non-interactivity are investigated, and
properties of these relations are given. The influence of the conjunction used
to define a conditional measure of possibility is also highlighted: we examine
three types of conjunctions: Lukasiewicz - like T-norms, product-like T-norms
and the minimum operator.
