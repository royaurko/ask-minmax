TX Cnc is a member of the young open cluster NGC 2632. In the present paper,
four CCD epochs of light minimum and a complete V light curve of TX Cnc are
presented. A period investigation based on all available photoelectric or CCD
data showed that it is found to be superimposed on a long-term increase
($dP/dt=+3.97\times{10^{-8}}$\,days/year), and a weak evidence suggests that it
includes a small-amplitude period oscillation ($A_3=0.^{d}0028$;
$T_3=26.6\,years$). The light curves in the V band obtained in 2004 were
analyzed with the 2003 version of the W-D code. It was shown that TX Cnc is an
overcontact binary system with a degree of contact factor $f=24.8%(\pm0.9%)$.
The absolute parameters of the system were calculated:
$M_1=1.319\pm0.007M_{\odot}$, $M_2=0.600\pm0.01M_{\odot}$;
$R_1=1.28\pm0.19R_{\odot}$, $R_2=0.91\pm0.13R_{\odot}$. TX Cnc may be on the
TRO-controlled stage of the evolutionary scheme proposed by Qian (2001a, b;
2003a), and may contains an invisible tertiary component
($m_3\approx0.097M_{\odot}$). If this is true, the tertiary component has
played an important role in the formation and evolution of TX Cnc by removing
angular momentum from the central system(Pribulla & Rucinski, 2006). In this
way the contact binary configuration can be formed in the short life time of a
young open cluster via AML.
