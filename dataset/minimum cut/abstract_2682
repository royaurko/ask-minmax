We formulate a minimum requirement for CFT operators to be localized in the
dual AdS. In any spacetime dimensions, we show that a general solution to the
requirement is a linear superposition of operators creating spherical
boundaries in CFT, with the dilatation by the imaginary unit from their
centers. This generalizes the recent proposal by Miyaji et al. for bulk local
operators in the three dimensional AdS. We show that Ishibashi states for the
global conformal symmetry in any dimensions and with the imaginary dilatation
obey free field equations in AdS and that incorporating bulk interactions
require their superpositions. We also comment on the recent proposals by Kabat
et al., and by H. Verlinde.
