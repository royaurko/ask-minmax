For a given curve X and divisor class C, we give lower bounds on the degree
of a divisor A such that A and A-C belong to specified semigroups of divisors.
For suitable choices of the semigroups we obtain (1) lower bounds for the size
of a party A that can recover the secret in an algebraic geometric linear
secret sharing scheme with adversary threshold C, and (2) lower bounds for the
support A of a codeword in a geometric Goppa code with designed minimum support
C. Our bounds include and improve both the order bound and the floor bound. The
bounds are illustrated for two-point codes on general Hermitian and Suzuki
curves.
