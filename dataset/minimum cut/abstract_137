Bipartite graph tiling was studied by Zhao who gave the best possible minimum
degree conditions for a balanced bipartite graph on 2ms vertices to contain m
vertex disjoint copies of K_{s,s}. Let s<t be fixed positive integers. Hladk\'y
and Schacht gave minimum degree conditions for a balanced bipartite graph on
2m(s+t) vertices to contain m vertex disjoint copies of K_{s,t}. Their results
were best possible, except in the case when m is odd and t> 2s+1. We give the
best possible minimum degree condition in this case.
