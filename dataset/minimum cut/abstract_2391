We consider a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator $H^h=(-ih\nabla-\vec{A})^2$
with the Dirichlet boundary conditions in an open set $\Omega \subset {\mathbb
R}^3$, where $h>0$ is a small parameter. We suppose that the minimal value
$b_0$ of the module $|\vec{B}|$ of the vector magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is
strictly positive, and there exists a unique minimum point of $|\vec{B}|$,
which is non-degenerate. The main result of the paper is upper estimates for
the low-lying eigenvalues of the operator $H^h$ in the semiclassical limit. We
also prove the existence of an arbitrary large number of spectral gaps in the
semiclassical limit in the corresponding periodic setting.
