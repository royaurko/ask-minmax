In the heavy quark and large Nc limits, ordinary (exotic) heavy baryons can
be considered as bound states of heavy mesons (anti-mesons)and chiral solitons.
In these limits, the heavy mesons (or anti-mesons) and the chiral solitons are
extremely heavy and are presumed to fall to the bottom of the effective
potential. Previous studies have approximated the effective potential as
harmonic about the minimum. However, when realistic masses for the heavy meson
and chiral soliton are considered, longer range parts of the effective
potential can become relevant. In this paper, we show that these longer-ranged
effects yield effective wave functions which are qualitatively very different
from those expected from the combined large Nc and heavy quark limits. These
potentials can support bound heavy pentaquarks under some conditions. The
consequence of these new energy states and wave functions on the Isgur-Wise
function for the semileptonic decay of heavy baryons is also considered.
