We report on the structural, thermodynamic and transport properties of
high-quality single crystals of YbNiSi3 grown by the flux method. This compound
crystallizes in the SmNiGe3 layered structure type of the Cmmm space group. The
general physical behavior is that of a Kondo lattice showing an
antiferromagnetic ground state below T_N = 5.1 K. This is among the highest
ordering temperatures for a Yb-based intermetallic, indicating strong exchange
interaction between the Yb ions, which are close to +3 valency based on the
effective moment of 4.45 mu_B/f.u. The compound has moderately heavy-electron
behavior with Sommerfeld coefficient 190 mJ/mol K^2. Resistivity is highly
anisotropic and exhibits the signature logarithmic increase below a local
minimum, followed by a sharp decrease in the coherent/magnetically ordered
state, resulting in residual resistivity of 1.5 micro Ohm cm and RRR = 40.
Fermi-liquid behavior consistent with a ground-state doublet is clearly
observed below 1 K.
