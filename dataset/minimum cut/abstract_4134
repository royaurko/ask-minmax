In models of triggered seismicity and in their inversion with empirical data,
the detection threshold m_d is commonly equated to the magnitude m_0 of the
smallest triggering earthquake. This unjustified assumption neglects the
possibility of shocks below the detection threshold triggering observable
events. We introduce a formalism that distinguishes between the detection
threshold m_d and the minimum triggering earthquake m_0 < m_d. By considering
the branching structure of one complete cascade of triggered events, we derive
the apparent branching ratio n_a (which is the apparent fraction of aftershocks
in a given catalog) and the apparent background source S_a that are observed
when only the structure above the detection threshold m_d is known due to the
presence of smaller undetected events that are capable of triggering larger
events. If earthquake triggering is controlled in large part by the smallest
magnitudes as several recent analyses have shown, this implies that previous
estimates of the clustering parameters may significantly underestimate the true
values: for instance, an observed fraction of 55% of aftershocks is
renormalized into a true value of 75% of triggered events.
