Developing further Stein's recent notion of relative end degrees in infinite
graphs, we investigate which degree assumptions can force a locally finite
graph to contain a given finite minor, or a finite subgraph of given minimum
degree. This is part of a wider project which seeks to develop an extremal
theory of sparse infinite graphs.
