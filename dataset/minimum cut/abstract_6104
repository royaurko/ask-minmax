The physical characteristics of Cepheus E (Cep E) `embedded' outflow are
analyzed using ISOCAM images in the v=0-0 S(5) 6.91 um and S(3) 9.66 um
molecular hydrogen lines. We find that the morphology of the Cep E outflow in
the ground vibrational H2 lines is similar to that of the near infrared v=1-0
2.12 um line. At these mid-IR wavelengths, we do not detect the second H2
outflow which is almost perpendicular to Cep E 2.121 um flow or traces of H2
emission along the second 12CO J = 2-1 outflow at 52 degrees angle, down to a
surface brightness of 12 - 46 uJy/arcsec square.
  We do detect at 6.91 um the likely source of the main H2 and CO outflows,
IRAS 23011+6126, and show that the source is easily seen in all IRAS bands
using HiRes images. The source is not detected at 9.66 um, but we think this
agrees with the interstellar extinction curve which has a minimum at 7 um, but
rises a 9.7 um due to the strong absorption silicate feature, enhanced in this
case by a cocoon surrounding the Class 0 object. This idea is supported by our
models of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the central object. The
models assume that the main source of opacity is due to bare silicates and our
best fit for the SED yields a total mass of envelope of 17 solar masses and a
dust temperature of 18 K.
