It is well known that a tachyonic mode appears in the spectrum of Yang--Mills
theory with a static uniform magnetic field, and that the free energy has an
(unstable) minimum at finite magnetic field. It is argued that spontaneous
generation of magnetic field does not take place at high temperature due to
nonperturbative magnetic screening. Furthermore, the dispersion relation for
gauge field fluctuations in an external magnetic field at high temperature is
solved. The lowest energy mode is stable against spontaneous generation of
magnetic fields since it acquires a thermal mass. However, the resummed free
energy (by necessity computed in the imaginary time formalism) still shows an
instability, unaffected by the resummation, since the self-energy is vanishing
at static Matsubara frequency.
