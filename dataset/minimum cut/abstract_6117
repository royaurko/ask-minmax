We present here the first infrared spectra of meteoritic SiC grains. The
mid-infrared transmission spectra of meteoritic SiC grains isolated from the
Murchison meteorite were measured in the wavelength range 2.5--16.5 micron, in
order to make available the optical properties of presolar SiC grains. These
grains are most likely stellar condensates with an origin predominately in
carbon stars. Measurements were performed on two different extractions of
presolar SiC from the Murchison meteorite. The two samples show very different
spectral appearance due to different grain size distributions. The spectral
feature of the smaller meteoritic SiC grains is a relatively broad absorption
band found between the longitudinal and transverse lattice vibration modes
around 11.3 micron, supporting the current interpretation about the presence of
SiC grains in carbon stars. In contrast to this, the spectral feature of the
large (> 5 micron) grains has an extinction minimum around 10 micron. The
obtained spectra are compared with commercially available SiC grains and the
differences are discussed. This comparison shows that the crystal structure
(e.g., beta-SiC versus alpha-SiC) of SiC grains plays a minor role on the
optical signature of SiC grains compared to e.g. grain size.
