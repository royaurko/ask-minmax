We propose a method to detect the geometric phase produced by the Dirac-type
band structure of a triangular-lattice photonic crystal. The spectrum is known
to have a conical singularity (= Dirac point) with a pair of nearly degenerate
modes near that singularity described by a spin-1/2 degree of freedom (=
pseudospin). The geometric Berry phase acquired upon rotation of the pseudospin
is in general obscured by a large and unspecified dynamical phase. We use the
analogy with graphene to show how complementary media can eliminate the
dynamical phase. A transmission minimum results as a direct consequence of the
geometric phase shift of pi acquired by rotation of the pseudospin over 360
degrees around a perpendicular axis. We support our analytical theory based on
the Dirac equation by a numerical solution of the full Maxwell equations.
