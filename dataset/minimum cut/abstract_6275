We use a multiannulus planetesimal accretion code to investigate the growth
of icy planets in the outer regions of a planetesimal disk. In a quiescent
minimum mass solar nebula, icy planets grow to sizes of 1000--3000 km on a
timescale t = 15-20 Myr (a/30 AU)^3 where a is the distance from the central
star. Planets form faster in more massive nebulae. Newly-formed planets stir up
leftover planetesimals along their orbits and produce a collisional cascade
where icy planetesimals are slowly ground to dust.
  The dusty debris of planet formation has physical characteristics similar to
those observed in beta Pic, HR 4796A, and other debris disks. We derive dust
masses for small particles, 1 mm and smaller, and large particles, 1 mm and
larger, as a function of the initial conditions in the planetesimal disk. The
dust luminosities derived from these masses are similar to those observed in
Vega, HR 4796A, and other debris disks. The calculations produce bright rings
and dark gaps. Bright rings occur where 1000 km and larger planets have
recently formed. Dark gaps are regions where planets have cleared out dust or
shadows where planets have yet to form.
