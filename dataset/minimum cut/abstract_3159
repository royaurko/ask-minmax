We examine the possibility that an epoch of inflationary expansion induces
high-frequency oscillations of Newton's constant, $G$. The effect occurs
because inflation can shift the expectation value of a non-minimally coupled,
Brans-Dicke-like field away from the minimum of its effective potential. At
some time after inflation ends, the field begins to oscillate, resulting in
periodic variations in $G$. We find conditions for which the oscillation energy
would be sufficient to close the universe, consistent with all known
constraints from cosmology and local tests of general relativity.
