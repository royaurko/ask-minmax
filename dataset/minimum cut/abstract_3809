We consider the possibility that higher-curvature corrections could drive
inflation after the compactification to four dimensions. Assuming that the
low-energy limit of the fundamental theory is eleven-dimensional supergravity
to the lowest order, including curvature corrections and taking the descent
from eleven dimensions to four via an intermediate five-dimensional theory, as
favored by recent considerations of unification at some scale around $\sim
10^{16}$ GeV, we may obtain a simple model of inflation in four dimensions. The
effective degrees of freedom are two scalar fields and the metric. The scalars
arise as the large five-dimensional modulus and the self-interacting conformal
mode of the metric. The effective potential has a local maximum in addition to
the more usual minimum. However, the potential is quite flat at the top, and
admits topological inflation. We show that the model can resolve cosmological
problems and provide a mechanism for structure formation with very little fine
tuning.
