In this talk, we present NLO pQCD predictions for inclusive pion and direct
photon nuclear modifications in p+Pb collisions at mid- and forward rapidities
at the LHC. In addition to the minimum bias predictions, we also address the
centrality dependence with spatially dependent nuclear PDFs. To understand
which regions of the nuclear momentum fraction $x_2$ these observables
predominantly probe, we present also the underlying $x_2$ distributions at
different rapidities. We are led to conclude that the isolated photons at
forward rapidities are more sensitive to the small-$x_2$ dynamics than the
inclusive pions.
