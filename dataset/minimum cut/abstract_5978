We investigate the dynamics of dust grains with various sizes in
protoplanetary disk winds driven by magnetorotational turbulence, by simulating
the time evolution of the dust grain distribution in the vertical direction.
Small dust grains, which are well coupled to the gas, are dragged upward with
the upflowing gas, while large grains remain near the midplane of a disk.
Intermediate--size grains float at several scale heights from the midplane in
time-averated force balance between the downward gravity and the upward gas
drag. For the minimum mass solar nebula at 1 AU, dust grains with size of 20 --
40 $\mu m$ float at 5-10 scale heights from the midplane. Considering the
dependence on the distance from the central star, smaller-size grains remain
only in an outer region of the disk, while larger-size grains are distributed
in a broader region. This implies that the dust depletion is expected to take
place in small-to-large and inside-out manners. We also discuss the implication
of our result to the observation of dusty material around young stellar
objects.
