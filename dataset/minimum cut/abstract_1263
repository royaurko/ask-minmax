We investigate the tachyon condensation process in the effective theory with
non-vanishing minimum potential and its implications to cosmology. It is shown
that the tachyon condensation on an unstable three-brane described by this
modified tachyon field theory leads to lower-dimensional branes (defects)
forming within a stable three-brane. Thus, in the cosmological background, we
can get well-behaved tachyon matter after tachyon inflation, (partially)
avoiding difficulties encountered in the original tachyon cosmological models.
This feature also implies that the tachyon inflated and reheated universe is
followed by a Chaplygin gas dark matter and dark energy universe. Hence, such
an unstable three-brane behaves quite like our universe, reproducing the key
features of the whole evolutionary history of the universe and providing a
unified description of inflaton, dark matter and dark energy in a very simple
single-scalar field model.
