We show that the interaction of polar alkali dimers in the quintet spin state
leads to the formation of a deeply bound reaction complex. The reaction complex
can decompose adiabatically into homonuclear alkali dimers (for all molecules
except KRb) and into alkali trimers (for all molecules). We show that there are
no barriers for these chemical reactions. This means that all alkali dimers in
the $a^3\Sigma^+$ state are chemically unstable at ultracold temperature, and
the use of an optical lattice to segregate the molecules and suppress losses
may be necessary. In addition, we calculate the minimum energy path for the
chemical reactions of alkali hydrides. We find that the reaction of two
molecules is accelerated by a strong attraction between the alkali atoms,
leading to a barrierless process that produces hydrogen atoms with large
kinetic energy. We discuss the unique features of the chemical reactions of
ultracold alkali dimers in the $a^3\Sigma^+$ electronic state.
