We prove that for any vacuum, maximal, asymptotically flat, axisymmetric
initial data for Einstein equations close to extreme Kerr data, the inequality
$\sqrt{J} \leq m$ is satisfied, where $m$ and $J$ are the total mass and
angular momentum of the data. The proof consists in showing that extreme Kerr
is a local minimum of the mass.
