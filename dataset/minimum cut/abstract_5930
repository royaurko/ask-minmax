We consider the problem of constructing fast and small binary adder circuits.
Among widely-used adders, the Kogge-Stone adder is often considered the
fastest, because it computes the carry bits for two $n$-bit numbers (where $n$
is a power of two) with a depth of $2\log_2 n$ logic gates, size $4 n\log_2 n$,
and all fan-outs bounded by two. Fan-outs of more than two are avoided, because
they lead to the insertion of repeaters for repowering the signal and
additional depth in the physical implementation. However, the depth bound of
the Kogge-Stone adder is off by a factor of two from the lower bound of $\log_2
n$. This bound is achieved asymptotically in two separate constructions by
Brent and Krapchenko. Brent's construction gives neither a bound on the fan-out
nor the size, while Krapchenko's adder has linear size, but can have up to
linear fan-out. In this paper we introduce the first family of adders with an
asymptotically optimum depth of $\log_2 n + o(\log_2 n)$, linear size $\mathcal
{O}(n)$, and a fan-out bound of two.
