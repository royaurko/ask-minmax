We examine the structure of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio
eta/s in holographic theories of gravity coupled to a scalar field, in the
presence of higher derivative corrections. Thanks to a non-trivial scalar field
profile, eta/s in this setup generically runs as a function of temperature. In
particular, its temperature behavior is dictated by the shape of the scalar
potential and of the scalar couplings to the higher derivative terms. We
consider a number of dilatonic setups, but focus mostly on phenomenological
models that are QCD-like. We determine the geometric conditions needed to
identify local and global minima for eta/s as a function of temperature, which
translate to restrictions on the signs and ranges of the higher derivative
couplings. Finally, such restrictions lead to an holographic argument for the
existence of a global minimum for eta/s in these models, at or above the
deconfinement transition.
