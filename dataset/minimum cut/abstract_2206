We present a class of solutions of the CPN model in (3+1) dimensions. We
suggest that they represent vortex-like configurations. We also discuss some of
their properties. We show that some configurations of vortices have a divergent
energy per unit length while for the others such an energy has a minimum for a
very special orientation of vortices. We also discuss the Noether charge
densities of these vortices.
