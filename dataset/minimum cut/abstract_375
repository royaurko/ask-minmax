We enumerate the small-volume manifolds that can be obtained by Dehn filling
on Mom-2 and Mom-3 manifolds as defined by Gabai, Meyerhoff, and the contributor. In
so doing we complete the proof that the Weeks manifold is the minimum-volume
compact hyperbolic 3-manifold, as well as enumerating the 10 smallest
one-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
