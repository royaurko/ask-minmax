Weak shear maps of the outer regions of clusters have been successfully used
to map the distribution of mass at large radii from the cluster center. The
typical smoothing lengths employed thus far preclude the systematic study of
the effects of galactic-scale substructure on the measured weak lensing signal.
In this paper, we present two methods to infer the possible existence and
extent of dark halos around bright cluster galaxies by quantifying the `local'
weak lensing induced by them. The proposed methods are: direct radial averaging
of the shear field in the vicinity of bright cluster members and a
maximum-likelihood method to extract fiducial parameters characterizing galaxy
halos. We demonstrate using simulations that these observed local weak-shear
effects on galaxy scales within the cluster can be used to statistically
constrain the mean mass-to-light ratio, and fiducial parameters like the halo
size, velocity dispersion and hence mass of cluster galaxies. We compare the
two methods and investigate their relative drawbacks and merits in the context
of feasibility of application to HST cluster data, whereby we find that the
prospects are promising for detection on stacking a minimum of 20 WFPC2 deep
cluster fields.
