This article is written for the Proceedings of the Conference on Current
Developments in Mathematics in Harvard University, November 16-17, 2007. It is
an exposition of the analytic proof of the finite generation of the canonical
ring for a compact complex algebraic manifold of general type. It lists and
discusses the main techniques and explains how they are put together in the
proof. Of the various main techniques some special attention is given to (i)
the technique of discrepancy subspaces and (ii) the technique of subspaces of
minimum additional vanishing.
