A ballistic strip of graphene (width W>> length L) connecting two normal
metal contacts is known to have a minimum conductivity of 4e^{2}/pi h at the
Dirac point of charge neutrality. We calculate what happens if one of the two
contacts becomes superconducting. While the ballistic conductance away from the
Dirac point is increased by Andreev reflection at the normal-superconductor
(NS) interface, we find that the minimum conductivity stays the same. This is
explained as a manifestation of pseudo-diffusive conduction at the Dirac point.
As a generalization of our results for a ballistic system, we provide a
relation between the conductance G_NS of an arbitrarily disordered
normal-superconductor junction in graphene and its value G_N when both contacts
are in the normal state.
