We use Metropolis Monte Carlo and umbrella sampling to calculate the free
energies of interaction of two methane molecules and their charged derivatives
in cylindrical water-filled pores. Confinement strongly alters the interactions
between the nonpolar solutes, and completely eliminates the solvent separated
minimum (SSM) that is seen in bulk water. The free energy profiles show that
the methane molecules are either in contact or at separations corresponding to
the diameter and the length of the cylindrical pore. Analytic calculations that
estimate the entropy of the solutes, which are solvated at the pore surface,
qualitatively explain the shape of the free energy profiles. Adding charges of
opposite sign and magnitude $0.4e$ or $e$ (where $e$ is the electronic charge)
to the methane molecules decreases their tendency for surface solvation and
restores the SSM. We show that confinement induced ion-pair formation occurs
whenever $l_B/D \sim O(1)$, where $l_B$ is the Bjerrum length, and $D$ is the
pore diameter. The extent of stabilization of the SSM increases with ion charge
density as long as $l_B/D < 1$. In pores with $D \le 1.2$ nm, in which the
water is strongly layered, increasing the charge magnitude from $0.4e$ to $e$
reduces the stability of the SSM. As a result, ion-pair formation which occurs
with negligible probability in the bulk, is promoted. In larger diameter pores
that can accomodate a complete hydration layer around the solutes, the
stability of the SSM is enhanced.
