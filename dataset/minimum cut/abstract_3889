Boson boson scattering and Higgs production in boson boson fusion will be
actively investigated at the LHC. We have performed a parton level study of all
processes of the type $q_1 q_2 \to q_3 q_4 q_5 q_6 l^+l^-$ using for the first
time a full fledged six fermion Monte Carlo event generator which employs exact
matrix elements at $\O(\alpha_{em}^6)$. We have examined Higgs production in
vector boson fusion followed by the decay chain $H\to ZZ\to l^+l^-jj$,
including exactly all electroweak irreducible backgrounds. In the high mass
region we have compared the case of a relatively light Higgs with the no-Higgs
case. The integrated cross section for the latter case is more than twice that
in the former for a minimum invariant mass of the $ZV$ pair of about 800 \GeV.
We find, in a preliminary anlysis at parton level that, summing up the muon and
the electron channels, about 30 events are expected in the light Higgs case for
L=100 $fb^{-1}$.
