General arguments as well as different approximations for the in-medium quark
propagator in a quark-gluon plasma lead to quark dispersion relations that
exhibit a minimum in one branch (plasmino). This minimum causes Van Hove
singularities in the dilepton production rate and mesonic correlators, which
might have observable consequences.
