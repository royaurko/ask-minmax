The limited number of active pixels in a Geiger-mode Avalanche Photodiode
(G-APD) results not only in a non-linearity but also in an additional
fluctuation of its response. Both these effects are taken into account to
calculate the amplitude resolution of an ideal G-APD, which is shown to be
finite. As one of the consequences, the energy resolution of a scintillation
detector based on a G-APD is shown to be limited to some minimum value defined
by the number of pixels in the G-APD.
