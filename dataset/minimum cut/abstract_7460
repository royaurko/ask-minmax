Optical and Hall-effect measurements have been performed on single crystals
of Pb$_{0.77}$Sn$_{0.23}$Se, a IV-VI mixed chalcogenide. The temperature
dependent (10--300 K) reflectance was measured over 40--7000 cm$^{-1}$ (5--870
meV) with an extension to 15,500 cm$^{-1}$ (1.92 eV) at room temperature. The
reflectance was fit to the Drude-Lorentz model using a single Drude component
and several Lorentz oscillators. The optical properties at the measured
temperatures were estimated via Kramers-Kronig analysis as well as by the
Drude-Lorentz fit. The carriers were p-type with the carrier density determined
by Hall measurements. A signature of valence intraband transition is found in
the low-energy optical spectra. It is found that the valence-conduction band
transition energy as well as the free carrier effective mass reach minimum
values at 100 K, suggesting temperature-driven band inversion in the material.
Density function theory calculation for the electronic band structure also make
similar predictions.
