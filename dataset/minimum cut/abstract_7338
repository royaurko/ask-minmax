Proteins are biomolecules of life. They fold into a great variety of
three-dimensional (3D) shapes. Underlying these folding patterns are many
recurrent structural fragments or building blocks (analogous to `LEGO bricks').
This paper reports an innovative statistical inference approach to discover a
comprehensive dictionary of protein structural building blocks from a large
corpus of experimentally determined protein structures. Our approach is built
on the Bayesian and information-theoretic criterion of minimum message length.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first systematic and rigorous
treatment of a very important data mining problem that arises in the
cross-disciplinary area of structural bioinformatics. The quality of the
dictionary we find is demonstrated by its explanatory power -- any protein
within the corpus of known 3D structures can be dissected into successive
regions assigned to fragments from this dictionary. This induces a novel
one-dimensional representation of three-dimensional protein folding patterns,
suitable for application of the rich repertoire of character-string processing
algorithms, for rapid identification of folding patterns of newly-determined
structures. This paper presents the details of the methodology used to infer
the dictionary of building blocks, and is supported by illustrative examples to
demonstrate its effectiveness and utility.
