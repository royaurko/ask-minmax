The D0 preshower detector consists of scintillator strips with embedded
wavelength-shifting fibers, and a readout using Visible Light Photon Counters.
The response to minimum ionizing particles has been tested with cosmic ray
muons. We report results on the gain calibration and light-yield distributions.
The spatial resolution is investigated taking into account the light sharing
between strips, the effects of multiple scattering and various systematic
uncertainties. The detection efficiency and noise contamination are also
investigated.
