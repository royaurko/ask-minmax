We consider a thickness of stellar disks of late-type galaxies by analyzing
the R and K_s band photometric profiles for two independent samples of edge-on
galaxies. The main goal is to verify a hypotesis that a thickness of old
stellar disks is related to the relative masses of the spherical and disk
components of galaxies. We confirm that the radial-to-vertical scale length
ratio for galactic disks increases (the disks become thinner) with the
increasing of total mass-to-light ratio of the galaxies, which characterize the
contribution of dark halo to the total mass, and with the decreasing of central
deprojected disk brightness (surface density). Our results are in good
agreement with numerical models of collisionless disks evolved from subcritical
velocity dispersion state to a marginally stable equilibrium state. This
suggests that in most galaxies the vertical stellar velocity dispersion, which
determine the equilibrium disk thickness, is close to the minimum value, that
ensures disk stability. The thinnest edge-on disks appear to be low brightness
galaxies (after deprojection) in which a dark halo mass far exceeds a mass of
the stellar disk.
