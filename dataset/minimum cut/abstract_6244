Images of the trans-Neptunian objects 1997 CQ29 and 2000 CF105 obtained with
the Hubble Space Telescope's WFPC2 camera show them to be binary. The two
components of 1997 CQ29 were separated in our images by 0.20 arcsec in November
2001 and by 0.33 arcsec in June/July 2002. The corresponding minimum physical
distances are 6100 km and 10,200 km. The companion to 2000 CF105 was 0.78
arcsec from the primary, at least 23,400 km. Six other objects in the
trans-Neptunian region, including Pluto and its moon Charon, are known to be
binaries; 1997 CQ29 and 2000 CF105 are the seventh and eighth known pair.
Binarity appears to be a not-uncommon characteristic in this region of the
solar system, with detectable companions present in 4% of the objects we have
examined.
