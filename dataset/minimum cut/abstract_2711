In this paper the jet model for the supermassive black hole candidate Sgr A*
in the Center of the Galaxy is reviewed. The most recent model, with a reduced
set of parameters, is able to account for all major radio properties of the
source: size, structure, flux density, and spectrum. The model requires a
minimum jet power of ~10^39 erg/sec and in a symbiotic jet/disk system implies
a minimum accretion rate of a few times 10^-8 M_sun/yr for a radio loud jet or
\~10^-5 M_sun/yr for a radio quiet jet. Low near-infrared limits on the Sgr A*
flux then imply that the accretion flow onto the central black hole must be
radiatively deficient, but most likely has a high viscosity. Within the jet
model the high-frequency part of the Sgr A* spectrum is self-consistently
explained as the nozzle of the outflow. In a symbiotic model this innermost
region of the jet could possibly be identified with the innermost region of an
advection dominated accretion disk, a Bondi-Hoyle accretion flow, or any other
type of under-luminous accretion process. The compact nozzle region is of
particular importance since it can be used as a background photon source
against which the central black hole could be directly imaged with future
mm-VLBI experiments.
