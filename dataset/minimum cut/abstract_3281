We present a study of optical spectra of the Wolf--Rayet star AzV 336a (= SMC
WR7) in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Our study is based on data obtained at
several Observatories between 1988 and 2001. We find SMC WR7 to be a double
lined WN+O6 spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 19.56 days. The
radial velocities of the He absorption lines of the O6 component and the strong
He{\sc ii} emission at $\lambda$4686\AA of the WN component describe antiphased
orbital motions. However, they show a small phase shift of $\sim$ 1 day. We
discuss possible explanations for this phase shift. The amplitude of the radial
velocity variations of He {\sc ii} emission is twice that of the absorption
lines. The binary components have fairly high minimum masses, $\sim$ 18
$\modot$ and 34 $\modot$ for the WN and O6 components, respectively.
