This paper is the second in a series whose goal is to understand the
structure of low-volume complete orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Using Mom
technology, we prove that any one-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold with volume <=
2.848 can be obtained by a Dehn filling on one of 21 cusped hyperbolic
3-manifolds. We also show how this result can be used to construct a complete
list of all one-cusped hyperbolic three-manifolds with volume <= 2.848 and all
closed hyperbolic three-manifolds with volume <= 0.943. In particular, the
Weeks manifold is the unique smallest volume closed orientable hyperbolic
3-manifold.
