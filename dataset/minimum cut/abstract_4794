We study theoretically the capillary-gravity waves created at the water-air
interface by an external surface pressure distribution symmetrical about a
point and moving at constant velocity along a linear trajectory. Within the
framework of linear wave theory and assuming the fluid to be inviscid, we
calculate the wave resistance experienced by the perturbation as a function of
its size (compared to the capillary length). In particular, we analyze how the
amplitude of the jump occurring at the minimum phase speed $c_{{\rm min}}=(4 g
\gamma /\rho)^{1/4}$ depends on the size of the pressure distribution ($\rho$
is the liquid density, $\gamma$ is the water-air surface tension, and $g$ is
the acceleration due to gravity). We also show how for pressure distributions
broader than a few capillary lengths, the result obtained by Havelock for the
wave resistance in the particular case of pure gravity waves (i.e., $\gamma =
0$) is progressively recovered.
