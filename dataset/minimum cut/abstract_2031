The binary phase diagram CaF$_2$--SrF$_2$ was investigated by differential
thermal analysis (DTA). Both substances exhibit unlimited mutual solubility
with an azeotropic point showing a minimum melting temperature of
T_\mathrm{min}=1373^{\circ}$C for the composition
Ca$_{0.582}$Sr$_{0.418}$F$_2$. Close to this composition, homogeneous single
crystals up to 30 mm diameter without remarkable segregation could be grown by
the Czochralski method.
