We attempt to verify recent claims (made using semi-analytic models) that for
the collapse of spherical homogeneous molecular clouds, fragmentation of the
self-gravitating disc that subsequently forms can be predicted using the
cloud's initial angular momentum alone. In effect, this condition is equivalent
to requiring the resulting disc be sufficiently extended in order to fragment,
in line with studies of isolated discs. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics
with hybrid radiative transfer to investigate this claim, confirming that in
general, homogeneous spherical molecular clouds will produce fragmenting
self-gravitating discs if the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to
gravitational potential energy is greater than ~ 5e-3, where this result is
relatively insensitive to the initial thermal energy. This condition begins to
fail at higher cloud masses, suggesting that sufficient mass at large radii
governs fragmentation. While these results are based on highly idealised
initial conditions, and may not hold if the disc's accretion from the
surrounding envelope is sufficiently asymmetric, or if the density structure is
perturbed, they provide a sensible lower limit for the minimum angular momentum
required to fragment a disc in the absence of significant external turbulence.
