In this work, we study the performance of random isometric precoders over
quasi-static and correlated fading channels. We derive deterministic
approximations of the mutual information and the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the
minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) receiver and provide simple provably
converging fixed-point algorithms for their computation. Although these
approximations are only proven exact in the asymptotic regime with infinitely
many antennas at the transmitters and receivers, simulations suggest that they
closely match the performance of small-dimensional systems. We exemplarily
apply our results to the performance analysis of multi-cellular communication
systems, multiple-input multiple-output multiple-access channels (MIMO-MAC),
and MIMO interference channels. The mathematical analysis is based on the
Stieltjes transform method. This enables the derivation of deterministic
equivalents of functionals of large-dimensional random matrices. In contrast to
previous works, our analysis does not rely on arguments from free probability
theory which enables the consideration of random matrix models for which
asymptotic freeness does not hold. Thus, the results of this work are also a
novel contribution to the field of random matrix theory and applicable to a
wide spectrum of practical systems.
