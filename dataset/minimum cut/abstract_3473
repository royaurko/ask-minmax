We study electron transport between capped carbon nanotubes and a substrate,
and relate the transmission probability to the local density of states in the
cap. Our results show that the transmission probability mimics the behavior of
the density of states at all energies except those that correspond to localized
states in the cap. Close proximity of a substrate causes hybridization of the
localized state. As a result, new transmission paths open from the substrate to
nanotube continuum states via the localized states in the cap. Interference
between various transmission paths gives rise to antiresonances in the
transmission probability, with the minimum transmission equal to zero at
energies of the localized states. Defects in the nanotube that are placed close
to the cap cause resonances in the transmission probability, instead of
antiresonances, near the localized energy levels. Depending on the spatial
position of defects, these resonant states are capable of carrying a large
current. These results are relevant to carbon nanotube based studies of
molecular electronics and probe tip applications.
