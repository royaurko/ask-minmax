A possible solution of the well known paradox of chiral molecules is based on
the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking. At low pressure the molecules are
delocalized between the two minima of a given molecular potential while at
higher pressure they become localized in one minimum due to the intermolecular
dipole-dipole interactions. Evidence for such a phase transition is provided by
measurements of the inversion spectrum of ammonia and deuterated ammonia at
different pressures. In particular, at pressure greater than a critical value
no inversion line is observed. These data are well accounted for by a model
previously developed and recently extended to mixtures. In the present paper,
we discuss the variation of the critical pressure in binary mixtures as a
function of the fractions of the constituents.
