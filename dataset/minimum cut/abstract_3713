This paper presents a method for jointly designing the transmitter-receiver
pair in a block-by-block communication system that employs (intra-block)
decision feedback detection. We provide closed-form expressions for
transmitter-receiver pairs that simultaneously minimize the arithmetic mean
squared error (MSE) at the decision point (assuming perfect feedback), the
geometric MSE, and the bit error rate of a uniformly bit-loaded system at
moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios. Separate expressions apply for the
``zero-forcing'' and ``minimum MSE'' (MMSE) decision feedback structures. In
the MMSE case, the proposed design also maximizes the Gaussian mutual
information and suggests that one can approach the capacity of the block
transmission system using (independent instances of) the same (Gaussian) code
for each element of the block. Our simulation studies indicate that the
proposed transceivers perform significantly better than standard transceivers,
and that they retain their performance advantages in the presence of error
propagation.
