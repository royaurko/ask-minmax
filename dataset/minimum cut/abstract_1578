The accurate simulation of collapsed objects requires that a huge range of
spatial scales be well resolved if the result is not to be contaminated by
numerically induced fragmentation. In this context, `insufficient resolution'
means comparable to the local instability wavelength in the system. I define a
minimum resolution criterion for simulations of disk systems, using the
critical wavelength appropriate for disks.
