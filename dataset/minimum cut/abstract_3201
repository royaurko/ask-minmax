The excitation mechanism of low degree acoustic modes is investigated through
the analysis of the stochastic time variations of their energy. The correlation
between the energies of two different modes is interpreted as the signature of
the occurrence rate of their excitation source. The different correlations
determined by Foglizzo et al. (1998) constrain the physical properties of an
hypothetical source of excitation, which would act in addition to the classical
excitation by the turbulent convection. Particular attention is drawn to the
effect of coronal mass ejections. The variability of their occurrence rate with
the solar cycle could account for the variation of the correlation between
IPHIR and GOLF data. Such an interpretation would suggest that the mean
correlation between low degree acoustic modes is at least 0.2 % at solar
minimum.
