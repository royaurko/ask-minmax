In 2002, Cookie Monster appeared in The Inquisitive Problem Solver. The
hungry monster wants to empty a set of jars filled with various numbers of
cookies. On each of his moves, he may choose any subset of jars and take the
same number of cookies from each of those jars.
  The Cookie Monster number is the minimum number of moves Cookie Monster must
use to empty all of the jars. This number depends on the initial distribution
of cookies in the jars.
  We discuss bounds of the Cookie Monster number and explicitly find the Cookie
Monster number for Fibonacci, Tribonacci and other nacci sequences.
