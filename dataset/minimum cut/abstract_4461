The carrier density and temperature dependence of the Hall mobility in mono-,
bi- and tri-layer graphene has been systematically studied. We found that as
the carrier density increases, the mobility decreases for mono-layer graphene,
while it increases for bi-layer/tri-layer graphene. This can be explained by
the different density of states in mono-layer and bi-layer/tri-layer graphenes.
In mono-layer, the mobility also decreases with increasing temperature
primarily due to surface polar substrate phonon scattering. In
bi-layer/tri-layer graphene, on the other hand, the mobility increases with
temperature because the field of the substrate surface phonons is effectively
screened by the additional graphene layer(s) and the mobility is dominated by
Coulomb scattering.
  We also find that the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient in
mono-, bi- and tri-layer graphene can be explained by the formation of electron
and hole puddles in graphene. This model also explains the temperature
dependence of the minimum conductance of mono-, bi- and tri-layer graphene. The
electrostatic potential variations across the different graphene samples are
extracted.
