We estimate the effective heavy quark and antiquark potential in the quark
gluon plasma using the gravity dual theory. Two models are considered:
$AdS_{5}$ and Sakai-Sugimoto model. The effective potential, obtained by using
the rotating fundamental open-string configurations, has the angular momentum
dependence which generalizes the static central potential. Motivated by the
asymptotic form for zero angular momentum state, we fit the effective potential
for $J=1,2$ states in the binding region. The fitting parameters are found to
be functions of temperature. Finally, we discuss the differences and
similarities of the effective potential between the two gravity dual models. An
interesting result is that position of the minimum of potential is determined
only by angular momentum and independent of the temperature.
