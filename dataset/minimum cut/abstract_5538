Emerging applications in multiview streaming look for providing interactive
navigation services to video players. The user can ask for information from any
viewpoint with a minimum transmission delay. The purpose is to provide user
with as much information as possible with least number of redundancies. The
recent concept of navigation segment representation consists of regrouping a
given number of viewpoints in one signal and transmitting them to the users
according to their navigation path. The question of the best description
strategy of these navigation segments is however still open. In this paper, we
propose to represent and code navigation segments by a method that extends the
recent layered depth image (LDI) format. It consists of describing the scene
from a viewpoint with multiple images organized in layers corresponding to the
different levels of occluded objects. The notion of extended LDI comes from the
fact that the size of this image is adapted to take into account the sides of
the scene also, in contrary to classical LDI. The obtained results show a
significant rate-distortion gain compared to classical multiview compression
approaches in navigation scenario.
