We revisit N_f=N_c SQCD and its non-supersymmetric minima conjectured by
Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih (ISS). We argue that the existence of such
minima depends on the signs of three non-calculable parameters and that no
evidence can be inferred by deforming the theory. We demonstrate this by
studying a deformation of the theory which involves additional gauge singlets.
In this case, the conjectured minimum is destabilized. We comment on the
consequences of such singlets in models of direct mediation and in particular
in the Pentagon model.
