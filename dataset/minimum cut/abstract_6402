We present a statistical method for complex energy landscape exploration
which provides information on the metastable states--or valleys--actually
explored by an unperturbed aging process following a quench. Energy
fluctuations of record size are identified as the events which move the system
from one valley to the next. This allows for a semi-analytical description in
terms of log-Poisson statistics, whose main features are briefly explained. The
bulk of the paper is devoted to thorough investigations of Ising spin glasses
with Gaussian interactions of both short and long range, a well established
paradigm for glassy dynamics. Simple scaling expressions with universal
exponents for (a) barrier energies, (b) energy minima, and (c) the Hamming
distance as a function of the valley index are found. The distribution of
residence time inside valleys entered at age $t_w$ is investigated, along with
the distribution of time at which the global minimum inside a valley is hit.
Finally, the correlations between the minima of the landscape are presented.
  The results fit well into the framework of available knowledge about spin
glass aging. At the same time they support a novel interpretation of thermal
relaxation in complex landscapes with multiple metastable states. The marginal
stability of the attractors selected is emphasized and explained in terms of
geometrical properties of the landscape.
