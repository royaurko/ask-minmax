We use the phase-field method to study the martensitic transformation at the
nanoscale. For nanosystems such as nanowires and nanograins embedded in a stiff
matrix, the geometric constraints and boundary conditions have an impact on
martensite formation, leading to new microstructures --such as dots aligned on
a square lattice with axes along <01>-- or preventing martensite formation
altogether. We also perform tension tests on the nanowires. The stress-strain
curves are very different from bulk results. Moreover, they are weakly affected
by microstructures -- the mechanical response of nanowires with different
microstructures may be similar, while nanowires with the same microstructure
may have a different mechanical behavior. We also observe that at the
transition temperature, or slightly below it, the narrowest wires behave
pseudoelastically whereas wider wires are in the memory-shape regime. Moreover
the yield stress does not change monotonically with width: it has a minimum
value at intermediate width.
