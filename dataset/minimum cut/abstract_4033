We report on new numerical computations of the set of self-contacts in
tightly knotted tubes of uniform circular cross-section. Such contact sets have
been obtained before for the trefoil and figure eight knots by simulated
annealing -- we use constrained gradient-descent to provide new self-contact
sets for those and 48 other knot and link types. The minimum length of all unit
diameter tubes in a given knot or link type is called the ropelength of that
class of curves. Our computations yield improved upper bounds for the
ropelength of all knots and links with 9 or fewer crossings except the trefoil.
