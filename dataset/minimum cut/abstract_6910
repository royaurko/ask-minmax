The flat spectrum radio quasar 3C~454.3 underwent an extraordinary outburst
in December 2009 when it became the brightest gamma-ray source in the sky for
over one week. Its daily flux measured with the Fermi Large Area Telescope at
photon energies E>100 MeV reached F = 22+/-1 x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1,
representing the highest daily flux of any blazar ever recorded in high-energy
gamma-rays. It again became the brightest source in the sky in 2010 April,
triggering a pointed-mode observation by Fermi. The correlated gamma-ray
temporal and spectral properties during these exceptional events are presented
and discussed. The main results show flux variability over time scales less
than 3 h and very mild spectral variability with an indication of gradual
hardening preceding major flares. No consistent loop pattern emerged in the
gamma-ray spectral index vs flux plane. A minimum Doppler factor of ~ 15 is
derived, and the maximum energy of a photon from 3C 454.3 is ~ 20 GeV. The
spectral break at a few GeV is inconsistent with Klein-Nishina softening from
power-law electrons scattering Ly_alpha line radiation, and a break in the
underlying electron spectrum in blazar leptonic models is implied.
