Including the Haar measure we show that the effective potential of the
regularized SU(2) Yang-Mills theory has a minimum at vanishing Wilson-line
$W=0$ for strong coupling, whereas it develops two degenerate minima close to
$W=\pm 1$ for weak coupling. This suggests that the non-abelian character of
$SU(2)$ as contained in the Haar measure might be responsible for confinement.
