In this paper, we have proposed a new smartphone based system for health
care, monitoring and diagnosis, which is specially designed to efficiently
increase the public health care system in the distant, rural, unreached areas
of the underdeveloped and developing countries. In this all-in-one system, we
have digitized the health monitoring and diagnostic devices in a way so that
each device works as a minimum `plug and play' sensor module of the total
system, reducing the cost radically. Besides, the easy-to-use smartphone
application for operating the whole system reduces the necessity of skilled and
trained manpower, making it a perfect toolbox for the government health workers
in the unreached rural areas.
