NGC 1514 is a complex planetary nebula with a peculiar binary central star
(BD+30$^{\circ}$623) consisting of a cool star and a hot companion. To date,
the parameters of the two stars have not been firmly stablished. We present a
detailed spectral analysis of BD+30$^{\circ}$623 based on
intermediate-resolution CAFOS optical spectra and IUE ultraviolet spectra with
the goal of deriving the parameters of the two stars. For this purpose, we used
an extensive composite grid of Kurucz and T\"ubingen NLTE Model-Atmosphere
spectra. From the fitting procedure, in terms of the minimum $\chi^{2}$ method,
the best models obtained correspond to an Horizontal-Branch A0 star with
$T_{\rm eff}$ = 9850$\pm$150 K, log g = 3.50$\pm$0.25, and a hot companion with
$T_{\rm eff}$ between 80000 K and 95000K and a log g $\simeq$ 5.5. To our
knowledge, this is the first time that the parameters of both stars have been
determined accurately through a detailed spectroscopic analysis.
