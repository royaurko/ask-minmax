We have studied the possibility of using Geiger mode multi-pixel photodiodes
to read out long scintillator bars with a single wavelength-shifting fiber
embedded along the bar. This detector configuration can be used in large volume
detectors in future long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. Prototype
bars of 0.7 cm thickness and different widths have been produced and tested
using two types of multi-pixel photodiodes: MRS APD (CPTA, Moscow) and MPPC
(Hamamatsu). A minimum light yield of 7.2 p.e./MeV was obtained for a 4 cm wide
bar.
