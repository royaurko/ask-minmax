The HARP system of resistive plate chambers (RPCs) was designed to perform
particle identification by the measurement of the difference in the
time-of-flight of different particles. In previous papers an apparent
discrepancy was shown between the response of the RPCs to minimum ionizing
pions and heavily ionizing protons. Using the kinematics of elastic scattering
off a hydrogen target a controlled beam of low momentum recoil protons was
directed onto the chambers. With this method the trajectory and momentum, and
hence the time-of-flight of the protons can be precisely predicted without need
for a measurement of momentum of the protons. It is demonstrated that the
measurement of the time-of-arrival of particles by the thin gas-gap glass RPC
system of the HARP experiment depends on the primary ionization deposited by
the particle in the detector.
