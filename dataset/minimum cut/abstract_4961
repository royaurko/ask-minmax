We analyse how the structure of the inner curst is influenced by the pairing
correlations. The inner-crust matter, formed by nuclear clusters immersed in a
superfluid neutron gas and ultra-relativistic electrons, is treated in the
Wigner-Seitz approximation. The properties of the Wigner-Seitz cells, i.e.,
their neutron to proton ratio and their radius at a given baryonic density, are
obtained from the energy minimization at beta equilibrium. To obtain the
binding energy of baryonic matter we perform Skyrme-HFB calculations with
zero-range density-dependent pairing forces of various intensities. We find
that the Wigner-Seitz cells have much smaller numbers of protons compared to
previous calculations. For the dense cells the binding energy of the
configurations with small proton numbers do not converge to a well-defined
minimum value which precludes the determination of their structure. We show
that for these cells there is a significant underestimation of the binding
energy due to the boundary conditions at the border of the cells imposed
through the Wigner-Seitz approximation.
