Within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) the production and
decay of superpartners can give rise to backgrounds for Higgs boson searches.
Here MSSM background processes to the vector boson fusion channel with the
Higgs boson decaying into two tau leptons or two W-bosons are investigated,
giving rise to dilepton plus missing transverse momentum signals of the Higgs
boson. Starting from a scenario with relatively small masses of the
supersymmetric (SUSY) particles, with concomitant large cross section of the
background processes, one obtains a first conservative estimate of the
background. Light chargino pair production plus two jets, lightest and
next-to-lightest neutralino production plus two jets as well as slepton pair
production plus two jets are identified as important contributions to the
irreducible SUSY background. Light chargino and next-to-lightest neutralino
production plus two jets and next-to-lightest neutralino pair production plus
two jets give rise to reducible backgrounds, which can be larger than the
irreducible ones in some scenarios. The relevant distributions are shown and
additional cuts for MSSM background reduction are discussed. Extrapolation to
larger squark masses is performed and shows that MSSM backgrounds are quite
small for squark masses at the current exclusion limits.
