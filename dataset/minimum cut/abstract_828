Recent development in noncommutative geometry generalization of gauge theory
is reviewed. The mathematical apparatus is reduced to minimum in order to allow
the non-mathematically oriented physicists to follow the development in the
interesting field of research. (Lectures presented at the Silesian School of
Theoretical Physics: Standard Model and Beyond'93, Szczyrk (Poland), September
1993.)
