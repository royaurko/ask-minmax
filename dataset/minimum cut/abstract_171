We provide the first minimum light spectroscopic observations for 21
previously known or suspected faint cataclysmic variable candidates. The
sources were selected from the Downes et al. (2001) living edition catalog and
the identified candidates have minimum light magnitudes of V~18-22. We confirm
15 of the candidates to be cataclysmic variables.
