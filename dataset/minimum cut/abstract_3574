The influence of an external magnetic field on the liquid-gas phase
transition in Ising, XY, and Heisenberg spin fluid models is studied using a
modified mean field theory and Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. It is
demonstrated that the theory is able to reproduce quantitatively all
characteristic features of the field dependence of the critical temperature
T_c(H) for all the three models. These features include a monotonic decrease of
T_c with rising H in the case of the Ising fluid as well as a more complicated
nonmonotonic behavior for the XY and Heisenberg models. The nonmonotonicity
consists in a decrease of T_c with increasing H at weak external fields, an
increase of T_c with rising H in the strong field regime, and the existence of
a minimum in T_c(H) at intermediate values of H. Analytical expressions for
T_c(H) in the large field limit are presented as well. The magnetic para-ferro
phase transition is also considered in simulations and described within the
mean field theory.
