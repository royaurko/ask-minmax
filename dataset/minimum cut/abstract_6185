The radio components associated with the LMXB Sco X-1 have been monitored
with extensive VLBI imaging at 1.7 and 5.0 GHz over four years, including a
56-hour continuous VLBI observation in 1999 June. We often detected one strong
and one weak compact radio component, moving in opposite directions from the
radio core. We suggest that the moving components are radio lobes generated by
the disruption of energy flow in a twin-beam from the binary system. The
average lifetime of a lobe-pair, the space motion of the lobes and the measured
energy flow in the beam are discussed in arXiv:astro-ph/0104325. The lobe has a
flux density that is variable over a time-scale of one hour, a measured minimum
size of 1 mas (2.8 au), and is extended perpendicular to its motion. This short
electron radiative lifetime may be caused by synchrotron losses if the lobe
magnetic field is 300 G, or by adiabatic expansion of the electrons as soon as
they are produced at the working surface. The lobes also show periods of slow
expansion and a steepening radio spectrum, perhaps related to the
characteristics of the beam energy flow. The radio morphology for Sco X-1 is
more simple than for most other Galactic jet sources. The lobes of Sco X-1 are
similar to hot-spots found in many extragalactic double sources. Scaling the
phenomena observed in Sco X-1 to extragalactic sources implies hot-spot
variability time-scales of 10^4 yr and hot-spot lifetimes of 10^5 yr. The
recurrent formation of lobes in Sco X-1 probably does not occur for
extragalactic radio sources.
