A search for Z bosons in the mu^+mu^- decay channel has been performed in
PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre of mass energy = 2.76 TeV with the
CMS detector at the LHC, in a 7.2 inverse microbarn data sample. The number of
opposite-sign muon pairs observed in the 60--120 GeV/c^2 invariant mass range
is 39, corresponding to a yield per unit of rapidity (y) and per minimum bias
event of (33.8 +/- 5.5 (stat) +/- 4.4 (syst)) 10^{-8}, in the |y|<2.0 range.
Rapidity, transverse momentum, and centrality dependencies are also measured.
The results agree with next-to-leading order QCD calculations, scaled by the
number of incoherent nucleon-nucleon collisions.
