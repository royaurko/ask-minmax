At a critical point of a second order phase transition the intrinsic energy
surface is flat and there is no stable minimum value of the deformation.
However, for a finite system, we show that there is an effective deformation
which can describe the dynamics at the critical point. This effective
deformation is determined by minimizing the energy surface after projection
onto the appropriate symmetries. We derive analytic expressions for energies
and quadrupole rates which provide good estimates for these observables at the
critical point.
