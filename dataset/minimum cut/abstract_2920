Effects of strong longitudinal colour electric fields (SCF), shadowing, and
quenching on the open prompt charm mesons (D$^0$, D$^+$, D$^{*+}$, D${_s}{^+}$)
production in central Pb + Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV are
investigated within the framework of the {\small HIJING/B\=B v2.0} model. We
compute the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm PbPb}^{\rm D}$, and show that
the above nuclear effects constitute important dynamical mechanisms in the
description of experimental data. The strength of colour fields (as
characterized by the string tension $\kappa$), partonic energy loss and jet
quenching process lead to a suppression factor consistent with recent published
data. Predictions for future beauty mesons measurements have been included.
Ratios of strange to non-strange prompt charm mesons in central Pb + Pb and
minimum bias (MB) $ p + p$ collisions at 2.76 TeV are also discussed. Minimum
bias $p + p$ collisions which constitute theoretical baseline in our
calculations are studied at the centre of mass energies $\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 TeV
and 7 TeV.
