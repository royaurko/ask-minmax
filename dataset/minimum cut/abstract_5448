We study the factorial moments (Fq), the factorial cumulants (Kq) and the
ratio of Kq to Fq (Hq = Kq=Fq) in pp/pp collisions using an updated approach,
in which the multiplicity distribution is related to the eikonal function. The
QCD inspired eikonal model adopted contains contributions of quark-quark,
quark-gluon and gluon-gluon interactions. Our work shows that the approach can
reproduce the collision energy dependence of the Fq moments, correctly predicts
that the first minimum of the Hq lies around q = 5 and qualitatively reproduces
the oscillations of the Hq moments, as shown in the experimental data and
predicted by QCD at preasymptotic energy. The result of this study seems to
indicate that the Hq oscillations are manifestation of semihard component in
the multiparticle production process. Predictions for multiplicity distribution
and Hq moments at the LHC energy of 14 TeV are presented.
