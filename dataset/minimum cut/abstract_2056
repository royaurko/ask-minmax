We analyse deformation mechanism in neutron-rich Cr, Fe and Ti isotopes with
N=32-44 by means of a Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean-field code employing
a two-dimensional mesh representation in the cylindrical coordinate system.
Evaluating systematically the quadrupole deformation energy, we show that the
Skyrme parameter set SkM* gives a quadrupole instability around the neutron
number N$\sim$38-42 in Cr isotopes, where the deformation energy curve suggests
a transitional behavior with a shallow minimum extending to a large prolate
deformation. Roles of a deformed N=38 gap and the position of the neutron g9/2
orbit are analysed in detail.
