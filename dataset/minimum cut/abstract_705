In the planted bisection model a random graph $G(n,p_+,p_- )$ with $n$
vertices is created by partitioning the vertices randomly into two classes of
equal size (up to $\pm1$). Any two vertices that belong to the same class are
linked by an edge with probability $p_+$ and any two that belong to different
classes with probability $p_- <p_+$ independently. The planted bisection model
has been used extensively to benchmark graph partitioning algorithms. If
$p_{\pm} =2d_{\pm} /n$ for numbers $0\leq d_- <d_+ $ that remain fixed as
$n\to\infty$, then w.h.p. the ``planted'' bisection (the one used to construct
the graph) will not be a minimum bisection. In this paper we derive an
asymptotic formula for the minimum bisection width under the assumption that
$d_+ -d_- >c\sqrt{d_+ \ln d_+ }$ for a certain constant $c>0$.
