For atoms with large scattering length, the dependence of the 3-body
recombination rate on the collision energy is determined by the scattering
length and the Efimov 3-body parameters and can be expressed in terms of
universal functions of a single scaling variable. We use published results on
the 3-body recombination rate for 4He atoms to constrain the universal
functions. We then use those universal functions to calculate the 3-body
recombination rate for other atoms with large scattering length at nonzero
temperature. The constraints from the 4He results are strong if the scattering
length is near the minimum of the 3-body recombination rate at threshold. We
apply our results to 133Cs atoms with a large positive scattering length, and
compare them with experimental results from the Innsbruck group.
