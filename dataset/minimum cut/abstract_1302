In this paper we will estimate the main parameters of some evaluation codes
which are known as projective parameterized codes. We will find the length of
these codes and we will give a formula for the dimension in terms of the
Hilbert function associated to two ideals, one of them being the vanishing
ideal of the projective torus. Also we will find an upper bound for the minimum
distance and, in some cases, we will give some lower bounds for the regularity
index and the minimum distance. These lower bounds work in several cases,
particularly for any projective parameterized code associated to the incidence
matrix of uniform clutters and then they work in the case of graphs.
