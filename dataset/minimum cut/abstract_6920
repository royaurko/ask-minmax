Dengue is one of the major international public health concerns. Although
progress is underway, developing a vaccine against the disease is challenging.
Thus, the main approach to fight the disease is vector control. A model for the
transmission of Dengue disease is presented. It consists of eight mutually
exclusive compartments representing the human and vector dynamics. It also
includes a control parameter (insecticide) in order to fight the mosquito. The
model presents three possible equilibria: two disease-free equilibria (DFE) and
another endemic equilibrium. It has been proved that a DFE is locally
asymptotically stable, whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as
the basic reproduction number, is less than one. We show that if we apply a
minimum level of insecticide, it is possible to maintain the basic reproduction
number below unity. A case study, using data of the outbreak that occurred in
2009 in Cape Verde, is presented.
