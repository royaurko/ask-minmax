We construct an effective potential for the complex Langevin equation on a
lattice. We show that the minimum of this effective potential gives the
space-time and Langevin time average of the complex Langevin field. The loop
expansion of the effective potential is matched with the derivative expansion
of the associated Schwinger-Dyson equation to predict the stationary
distribution to which the complex Langevin equation converges.
