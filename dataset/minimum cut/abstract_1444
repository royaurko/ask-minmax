Lehel conjectured that in every $2$-coloring of the edges of $K_n$, there is
a vertex disjoint red and blue cycle which span $V(K_n)$. \L uczak, R\"odl, and
Szemer\'edi proved Lehel's conjecture for large $n$, Allen gave a different
proof for large $n$, and finally Bessy and Thomass\'e gave a proof for all $n$.
  Balogh, Bar\'at, Gerbner, Gy\'arf\'as, and S\'ark\"ozy proposed a significant
strengthening of Lehel's conjecture where $K_n$ is replaced by any graph $G$
with $\delta(G)> 3n/4$; if true, this minimum degree condition is essentially
best possible. We prove that their conjecture holds when
$\delta(G)>(3/4+o(1))n$. Our proof makes use of the regularity--blow-up method
along with notions such as robust expansion and absorbing.
