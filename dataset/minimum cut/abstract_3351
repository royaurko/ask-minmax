We have successfully ported under GNU Linux ATLAS 9, the widely used stellar
atmosphere modeling code, as well as both the SYNTHE suite of programs, its
``companion'' for spectral synthesis, and WIDTH, used to derive chemical
abundances from equivalent widths of spectral lines. The porting has been
realized by using the Intel Fortran Compiler. Our aim was to port the codes
with the minimum possible amount of modifications: full compatibility with the
VMS version has been maintained, along with all the codes functionalities.
Dramatic improvement in calculation speed with respect to the VMS version has
been achieved. The full suite of codes is intended to be freely available to
anyone.
