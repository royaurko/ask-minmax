We present a nondeterministic model of computation based on reversing edge
directions in weighted directed graphs with minimum in-flow constraints on
vertices. Deciding whether this simple graph model can be manipulated in order
to reverse the direction of a particular edge is shown to be PSPACE-complete by
a reduction from Quantified Boolean Formulas. We prove this result in a variety
of special cases including planar graphs and highly restricted vertex
configurations, some of which correspond to a kind of passive constraint logic.
Our framework is inspired by (and indeed a generalization of) the ``Generalized
Rush Hour Logic'' developed by Flake and Baum.
  We illustrate the importance of our model of computation by giving simple
reductions to show that several motion-planning problems are PSPACE-hard. Our
main result along these lines is that classic unrestricted sliding-block
puzzles are PSPACE-hard, even if the pieces are restricted to be all dominoes
(1x2 blocks) and the goal is simply to move a particular piece. No prior
complexity results were known about these puzzles. This result can be seen as a
strengthening of the existing result that the restricted Rush Hour puzzles are
PSPACE-complete, of which we also give a simpler proof. Finally, we strengthen
the existing result that the pushing-blocks puzzle Sokoban is PSPACE-complete,
by showing that it is PSPACE-complete even if no barriers are allowed.
