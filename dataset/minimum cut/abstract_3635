We calculate the mean end-to-end distance ($R$) of a self-avoiding polymer
encapsulated in an infinitely long cylinder with radius $D$. A self-consistent
perturbation theory is used to calculate $R$ as a function of $D$ for
impenetrable hard walls and soft walls. In both cases, $R$ obeys the predicted
scaling behavior in the limit of large and small $D$. The crossover from the
three dimensional behavior ($D\to\infty$) to the fully stretched one
dimensional case ($D\to 0$) is non-monotonic. The minimum value of $R$ is found
at $D\sim 0.46 R_F$, where $R_F$ is the Flory radius of $R$ at $D \to \infty$.
The results for soft walls map onto the hard wall case with a larger cylinder
radius.
