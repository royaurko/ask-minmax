We report on recent progress with the gauge-fixing approach to lattice chiral
gauge theories. The bosonic sector of the gauge-fixing approach is studied with
fully dynamical U(1) gauge fields. We demonstrate that it is important to
formulate the Lorentz gauge-fixing action such that the dense set of lattice
Gribov copies is removed, and the gauge-fixing action has a unique absolute
minimum. We then show that the spectrum in the continuum limit contains only
the desired massless photon, as expected.
