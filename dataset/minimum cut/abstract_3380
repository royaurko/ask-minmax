The viability of using a Bubble Chamber for rare event searches and in
particular for the detection of dark matter particle candidates is considered.
Techniques leading to the deactivation of inhomogeneous nucleation centers and
subsequent enhanced stability in such a detector are described. Results from
prototype trials indicate that sensitivity to low-energy nuclear recoils like
those expected from Weakly Interacting Massive Particles can be obtained in
conditions of near total insensitivity to minimum ionizing backgrounds. An
understanding of the response of superheated heavy refrigerants to these
recoils is demonstrated within the context of existing theoretical models. We
comment on the prospects for the detection of supersymmetric dark matter
particles with a large $CF_{3}I$ chamber.
