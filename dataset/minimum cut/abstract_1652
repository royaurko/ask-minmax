We study a recently introduced ladder model which undergoes a transition
between an active and an infinitely degenerate absorbing phase. In some cases
the critical behaviour of the model is the same as that of the branching
annihilating random walk with $N\geq 2$ species both with and without hard-core
interaction. We show that certain static characteristics of the so-called
natural absorbing states develop power law singularities which signal the
approach of the critical point. These results are also explained using random
walk arguments. In addition to that we show that when dynamics of our model is
considered as a minimum finding procedure, it has the best efficiency very
close to the critical point.
