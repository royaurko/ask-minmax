In this paper we focus in the analysis of the FSO link performance under
sandstorms conditions. The sandstorms are characterized by the size of the
particles and the necessary wind speed in order to blowing them up during a
minimum period of time. Sandstorm is a well know problem in many parts of the
world and different reports has been presented regarding the impairments that
sandstorms produces on outdoor link communications. The paper first focuses on
the indoor laboratory sandstorms chamber and that is being used to investigate
the performance on an FSO link. We propose an improvement to chamber with a
dedicated customised structure where wind speed, sand blowing and turbulence
can be generated, controlled and maintained over a much longer time period.
This study would help in the deployment of a stable state of the art sandstorm
environment for assessing FSO communication links.
