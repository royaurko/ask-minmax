We study the algebraic geometry of a family of evaluation codes from plane
smooth curves defined over any field. In particular, we provide a cohomological
characterization of their dual minimum distance. After having discussed some
general results on zero-dimensional subschemes of the plane, we focus on the
interesting case of Hermitian $s$-point codes, describing the geometry of their
dual minimum-weight codewords.
