Using explicit solutions of the QCD transport equations, we construct an
effective potential for an anisotropic quark-gluon plasma which under plausible
assumptions holds beyond the Hard Loop approximation. The configurations, which
are unstable in the linear response approach, are characterized by a negative
quadratic term of the effective potential. The signs of higher order terms can
be either negative or positive, depending on the parton momentum distribution.
In the case of a Gaussian momentum distribution, the potential is negative and
unbound from below. Therefore, the modes, which are unstable for gauge fields
of small amplitude, remain unstable for arbitrary large amplitudes. We also
present an example of a momentum distribution which gives a negative quadratic
term of the effective potential but the whole potential has a minimum and it
grows for sufficiently large gauge fields. Then, the system is weakly unstable.
The character of the instability is important for the dynamical evolution of
the plasma system.
