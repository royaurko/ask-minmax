About 0.2 solar mass is absorbed by the millisecond pulsar (MSP) at the
binary accretion phase, while the polar magnetic field of MSP is diluted to a
magnitude of order 108.5 Gauss, which is proportionally related to the mass
accretion rate. It is found that the minimum magnetic field of MSP can be as
low as 107 Gauss if the accretion rate of the binary system reaches its the
minimum value of 1015 g/s. This bottom field has nothing to do with the MSP
initial field. Some questions on MPSs are proposed and answered.
