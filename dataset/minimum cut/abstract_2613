Erd\H{o}s and Pach (1983) asked if there is some constant $C >0$ such that
for any graph $G$ on $Ck\ln k$ vertices either $G$ or its complement $\bar{G}$
has an induced subgraph on $k$ vertices with minimum degree at least
$\frac12(k-1)$. They showed that the above statement holds with $Ck^2$ in place
of $Ck\ln k$ but that it does not hold with $Ck\ln k/\ln\ln k$. We show that it
holds with $Ck\ln^2 k$, answering their question up to a $\ln k$ factor.
