A subring pair B < A has right depth 2n if the n+1'st relative Hochschild bar
resolution group is isomorphic to a direct summand of a multiple of the n'th
relative Hochschild bar resolution group as A-B-bimodules; depth 2n+1 if the
same condition holds only as B-B-bimodules. It is then natural to ask what is
defined if this same condition should hold as A-A-bimodules, the so-called
H-depth 2n-1 condition. In particular, the H-depth 1 condition coincides with A
being an H-separable extension of B. In this paper the H-depth of semisimple
subalgebra pairs is derived from the transpose inclusion matrix, and for QF
extensions it is derived from the odd depth of the endomorphism ring extension.
For general extensions characterizations of H-depth are possible using the
H-equivalence generalization of Morita theory. In certain nice categories of
bimodules the minimum depth and H-depth of certain types of ring extensions are
always finite.
