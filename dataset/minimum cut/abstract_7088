The performance of linear receivers in the presence of co-channel
interference in Rayleigh channels is a fundamental problem in wireless
communications. Performance evaluation for these systems is well-known for
receive arrays where the antennas are close enough to experience equal average
SNRs from a source. In contrast, almost no analytical results are available for
macrodiversity systems where both the sources and receive antennas are widely
separated. Here, receive antennas experience unequal average SNRs from a source
and a single receive antenna receives a different average SNR from each source.
Although this is an extremely difficult problem, progress is possible for the
two-user scenario. In this paper, we derive closed form results for the
probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf)
of the output signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and signal to
noise ratio (SNR) of minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and zero forcing (ZF)
receivers in independent Rayleigh channels with arbitrary numbers of receive
antennas. The results are verified by Monte Carlo simulations and high SNR
approximations are also derived. The results enable further system analysis
such as the evaluation of outage probability, bit error rate (BER) and
capacity.
