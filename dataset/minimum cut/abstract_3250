We evaluate the minimum energy input rate that starbursts require for
expelling their newly processed matter from their host galaxies. Special
attention is given to the pressure caused by the environment in which a galaxy
is situated, as well as to the intrinsic rotation of the gaseous component. We
account for these factors and for a massive dark matter distribution, and
develop a self-consistent solution for the interstellar matter gas
distribution. Our results are in excellent agreement with the results of Mac
Low & Ferrara (1999) for galaxies with a flattened disk-like ISM density
distribution and a low intergalactic gas pressure ($P_{IGM}/k$ $\leq $ 1
cm$^{-3}$ K). However, our solution also requires a much larger energy input
rate threshold when one takes into consideration both a larger intergalactic
pressure and the possible existence of a low-density, non-rotating, extended
gaseous halo component.
