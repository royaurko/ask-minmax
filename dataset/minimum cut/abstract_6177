Using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope we have obtained deep
high-resolution CCD images in V and I of a 28'x28' field in the outer disk of M
31 at ~ 116' from the center along the major axis to the south-west, and
covering a range of projected galactocentric distance from about 23 to 33 kpc.
The field was chosen to correspond with extended HI features recorded near the
HI edge of the galaxy.
  The many tens of thousands of objects detected in this large field have been
classified using an automatic algorithm which distinguishes unresolved from
resolved structures and provides photometry on them. For the most part the
unresolved objects are stars in M 31. The V-I colors of these stars are highly
correlated with the column density of HI in the field. Assuming a Galactic
extinction law, this yields a minimum extinction/atomic-gas ratio about 1/3 of
that in the Solar neighbourhood. The ISM in this outer disk of M 31 therefore
contains substantial amounts of dust.
  We have identified a population of B stars in the field whose distribution is
also well correlated with the extended HI distribution. Evidently, star
formation is both ongoing and wide spread in the outer disk of M 31. According
to the current view of the star formation process, molecular gas is therefore
also expected to be present.
