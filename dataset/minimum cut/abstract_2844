We describe the simulation method of modelling the population evolution using
Monte Carlo based on the Penna model. Individuals in the populations are
represented by their diploid genomes. Genes expressed after the minimum
reproduction age are under a weaker selection pressure and accumulate more
mutations than those expressed before the minimum reproduction age. The
generated gradient of defective genes determines the ageing of individuals and
age-structured populations are very similar to the natural, sexually
reproducing populations. The genetic structure of a population depends on the
way how the random death affects the population. The improvement of the medical
care and healthier life styles are responsible for the increasing of the life
expectancy of humans during the last century. Introducing a noise into the
relations between the genotype, phenotype, and environment, it is possible to
simulate some other effects, like the role of immunological systems and a
mother care. One of the most interesting results was the evolution of sex
chromosomes. Placing the male sex determinants on one chromosome of a pair of
sex chromosomes is enough to condemn it for shrinking if the population is
panmictic (random-mating is assumed). If males are indispensable for taking
care of their offspring and have to be faithful to their females, the male sex
chromosome does not shrink.
