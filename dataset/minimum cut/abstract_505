Suppose we have a signal y which we wish to represent using a linear
combination of a number of basis atoms a_i, y=sum_i x_i a_i = Ax. The problem
of finding the minimum L0 norm representation for y is a hard problem. The
Basis Pursuit (BP) approach proposes to find the minimum L1 norm representation
instead, which corresponds to a linear program (LP) that can be solved using
modern LP techniques, and several recent contributors have given conditions for the
BP (minimum L1 norm) and sparse (minimum L0 solutions) representations to be
identical. In this paper, we explore this sparse representation problem} using
the geometry of convex polytopes, as recently introduced into the field by
Donoho. By considering the dual LP we find that the so-called polar polytope P
of the centrally-symmetric polytope P whose vertices are the atom pairs +-a_i
is particularly helpful in providing us with geometrical insight into
optimality conditions given by Fuchs and Tropp for non-unit-norm atom sets. In
exploring this geometry we are able to tighten some of these earlier results,
showing for example that the Fuchs condition is both necessary and sufficient
for L1-unique-optimality, and that there are situations where Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit (OMP) can eventually find all L1-unique-optimal solutions with
m nonzeros even if ERC fails for m, if allowed to run for more than m steps.
