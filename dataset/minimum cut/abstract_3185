The magnetic structure of neutron vortices in the superfluid cores of neutron
stars is determined assuming that the proton condensate forms a type I
superconductor. It is shown that the entrainment currents induced by the
neutron vortex circulation cause the proton superconductor to break into
successive domains of normal and superconducting regions. The Gibbs free-energy
is found in the case in which the normal domains form cylindrical tubes coaxial
with the neutron vortex. The minimum of the energy functional corresponds to a
tube radius $a\sim 0.1-0.5 ~b$, where $b$ is the outer radius of the neutron
vortex. The magnetic field within the tube is of the order of $ 5 \times
10^{14}$ G.
