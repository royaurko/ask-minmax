We have measured the current-phase relationship (CPR) of symmetric 45 degree
YBaCuO grain boundary Josephson junctions. Substantial deviations of the CPR
from conventional tunnel-junction behavior have been observed: (i) The critical
current exhibits, as a function of temperature T, a local minimum at a
temperature T*. (ii) At T approximately equal to T*, the first harmonic of the
CPR changes sign. (iii) For T<T*, the second harmonic of the CPR is comparable
to the first harmonic, and (iv) the ground state of the junction becomes
degenerate. The results are in good agreement with a microscopic model of
Josephson junctions between d-wave superconductors.
