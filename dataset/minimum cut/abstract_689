The minimum timings of eclipsing binaries V418 Aql, SU Boo, RV CVn, CR Cas,
GV Cyg, V432 Per, and BD+42 2782 were collected and analyzed. Their long-term
behavior was studied via period analysis, revealing a periodic term in eclipse
times. We derived 576 new times of minimum. Hence, to describe the periodic
variation, a thirdbody hypothesis was proposed and the resulting orbital
periods are as follows: 70, 7.4, 53, 37, 27, 53, and 18 yr, respectively. For
the system V432 Per an additional 9.5 yr variation was also found. The
predicted minimum masses of these distant bodies were calculated and their
detectability discussed. The light curves of SU Boo and RV CVn were analyzed
using the PHOEBE program, resulting in physical parameters of the components.
New variable stars in the field of V418 Aql were discovered.
