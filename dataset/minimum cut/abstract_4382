This paper is devoted to the performance study of the Linear Minimum Mean
Squared Error estimator for multidimensional signals in the large dimension
regime. Such an estimator is frequently encountered in wireless communications
and in array processing, and the Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR)
at its output is a popular performance index. The SINR can be modeled as a
random quadratic form which can be studied with the help of large random matrix
theory, if one assumes that the dimension of the received and transmitted
signals go to infinity at the same pace. This paper considers the asymptotic
behavior of the SINR for a wide class of multidimensional signal models that
includes general multi-antenna as well as spread spectrum transmission models.
  The expression of the deterministic approximation of the SINR in the large
dimension regime is recalled and the SINR fluctuations around this
deterministic approximation are studied. These fluctuations are shown to
converge in distribution to the Gaussian law in the large dimension regime, and
their variance is shown to decrease as the inverse of the signal dimension.
