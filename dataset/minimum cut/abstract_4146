We present a further theoretical extension to the kinetic theory based
formulation of the lattice Boltzmann method of Shan et al (2006). In addition
to the higher order projection of the equilibrium distribution function and a
sufficiently accurate Gauss-Hermite quadrature in the original formulation, a
new regularization procedure is introduced in this paper. This procedure
ensures a consistent order of accuracy control over the non-equilibrium
contributions in the Galerkin sense. Using this formulation, we construct a
specific lattice Boltzmann model that accurately incorporates up to the third
order hydrodynamic moments. Numerical evidences demonstrate that the extended
model overcomes some major defects existed in the conventionally known lattice
Boltzmann models, so that fluid flows at finite Knudsen number (Kn) can be more
quantitatively simulated. Results from force-driven Poiseuille flow simulations
predict the Knudsen's minimum and the asymptotic behavior of flow flux at large
Kn.
