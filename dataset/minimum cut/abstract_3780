The variation of radii, lifetimes, correlation lengths and the chaoticity
parameter of particle sources with the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ is studied
by analysing and comparing two-particle Bose-Einstein correlation data obtained
by the NA22 Collaboration at $\sqrt{s}=22\ GeV$ and by the UA1-Minimum-Bias
Collaboration at $\sqrt{s}=630\ GeV$. The UA1-data are found to be inconsistent
with a static source, whereas both the data at $\sqrt{s}=22\ GeV$ and at $630\
GeV$ can be described in an expanding source model. In the latter model, the
$s$-dependence of the data implies an increase of the transverse radius with
$s$ and a decrease of the correlation lengths in longitudinal and in transverse
direction. The chaoticity parameter increases or remains approximately constant
as a function of the CM energy.
