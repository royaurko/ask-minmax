Application of filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) as an effective method for
signaling over massive MIMO channels has been recently proposed. This paper
further expands the application of FBMC to massive MIMO by applying frequency
spreading equalization (FSE) to these channels. FSE allows us to achieve a more
accurate equalization. Hence, higher number of bits per symbol can be
transmitted and the bandwidth of each subcarrier can be widened. Widening the
bandwidth of each subcarrier leads to (i) higher bandwidth efficiency; (ii)
lower complexity; (iii) lower sensitivity to carrier frequency offset (CFO);
(iv) reduced peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR); and (iv) reduced latency. All
these appealing advantages have a direct impact on the digital as well as
analog circuitry that is needed for the system implementation. In this paper,
we develop the mathematical formulation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE)
FSE for massive MIMO systems. This analysis guides us to decide on the number
of subcarriers that will be sufficient for practical channel models.
