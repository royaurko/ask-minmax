The minimum of solar cycle 24 is significantly different from most other
minima in terms of its duration as well as its abnormally low levels of
activity. Using available helioseismic data that cover epochs from the minimum
of cycle 23 to now, we study the differences in the nature of the solar
rotation between the minima of cycles 23 and 24. We find that there are
significant differences between the rotation rates during the two minima. There
are differences in the zonal-flow pattern too. We find that the band of fast
rotating region close to the equator bifurcated around 2005 and recombined by
2008. This behavior is different from that during the cycle 23 minimum. By
auto-correlating the zonal-flow pattern with a time shift, we find that in
terms of solar dynamics, solar cycle 23 lasted for a period of 11.7 years,
consistent with the result of Howe et al. (2009). The autocorrelation
coefficient also confirms that the zonal-flow pattern penetrates through the
convection zone.
