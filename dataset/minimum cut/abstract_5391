We argue that a generic instability afflicts vacua that arise in theories
whose moduli space has large dimension. Specifically, by studying theories with
multiple scalar fields we provide numerical evidence that for a generic local
minimum of the potential the usual semiclassical bubble nucleation rate, Gamma
= A e^{-B}, increases rapidly as function of the number of fields in the
theory. As a consequence, the fraction of vacua with tunneling rates low enough
to maintain metastability appears to fall exponentially as a function of the
moduli space dimension. We discuss possible implications for the landscape of
string theory. Notably, if our results prove applicable to string theory, the
landscape of metastable vacua may not contain sufficient diversity to offer a
natural explanation of dark energy.
