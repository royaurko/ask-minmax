We study a system of periodic Bose condensed atoms coupled to cavity photons
using the input-output formalism. We show that the cavity will either act as a
through pass Lorentzian filter when the superfluid fraction of the condensate
is minimum or completely reflect the input field when the superfluid fraction
is maximum. We show that by monitoring the ratio between the transmitted field
and the reflected field, one can estimate the superfluid fraction.
