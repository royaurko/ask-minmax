Grains configuration snapshots of Brazil-nut effect (BNE) in two-dimension
are physically modeled using disk-formed objects, e.g., buttons and magnetic
pin. These BNE configurations are artificially designed to mimic the real ones
observed in experiments. A computer scanner is used to capture the
configurations. Obtained images are then digitized using web browser running a
HTML equipped with a JavaScript code, which is built mainly only for this work.
From digitization process all grains positions (granular bed and intruder) are
obtained, which is later analyzed using the simplest model, i.e., potential
energy. Since the minimum energy principle (MEP) suggests that a closed system
should go to its state with minimum internal energy, our BNE system must also
obey it. Evolution of only the intruder seems to violate MEP but not for the
whole system. Grains compaction plays important role, so that the system can
achieve its configuration with minimum potential energy.
