We present a streaming model for large-scale classification (in the context
of $\ell_2$-SVM) by leveraging connections between learning and computational
geometry. The streaming model imposes the constraint that only a single pass
over the data is allowed. The $\ell_2$-SVM is known to have an equivalent
formulation in terms of the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem, and an
efficient algorithm based on the idea of \emph{core sets} exists (Core Vector
Machine, CVM). CVM learns a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate MEB for a set of
points and yields an approximate solution to corresponding SVM instance.
However CVM works in batch mode requiring multiple passes over the data. This
paper presents a single-pass SVM which is based on the minimum enclosing ball
of streaming data. We show that the MEB updates for the streaming case can be
easily adapted to learn the SVM weight vector in a way similar to using online
stochastic gradient updates. Our algorithm performs polylogarithmic computation
at each example, and requires very small and constant storage. Experimental
results show that, even in such restrictive settings, we can learn efficiently
in just one pass and get accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art SVM
solvers (batch and online). We also give an analysis of the algorithm, and
discuss some open issues and possible extensions.
