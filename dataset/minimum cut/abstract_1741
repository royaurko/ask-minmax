In this paper, we introduce the notion of perfect space-time block codes
(STBC). These codes have full rate, full diversity, non-vanishing constant
minimum determinant for increasing spectral efficiency, uniform average
transmitted energy per antenna and good shaping. We present algebraic
constructions of perfect STBCs for 2, 3, 4 and 6 antennas.
