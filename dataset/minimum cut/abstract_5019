We perform a linear stability analysis of a dust layer in a turbulent gas
disk. Youdin (2011) investigated the secular gravitational instability of a
dust layer using hydrodynamic equations with a turbulent diffusion term. We
obtain essentially the same result independently of Youdin (2011). In the
present analysis, we restrict the area of interest to small dust particles,
while investigating the secular gravitational instability in a more rigorous
manner. We discuss the time evolution of the dust surface density distribution
using a stochastic model and derive the advection-diffusion equation. The
validity of the analysis by Youdin (2011) is confirmed in the strong drag
limit. We demonstrate quantitatively that the finite thickness of a dust layer
weakens the secular gravitational instability and that the density-dependent
diffusion coefficient changes the growth rate. We apply the obtained results to
the turbulence driven by the shear instability and find that the secular
gravitational instability is faster than the radial drift when the gas density
is three times as large as that in the minimum-mass disk model. If the dust
particles are larger than chondrules, the secular gravitational instability
grows within the lifetime of a protoplanetary disk.
