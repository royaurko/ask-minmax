The paper builds upon a recent approach to find the approximate bounds of a
real function using Polynomial Chaos expansions. Given a function of random
variables with compact support probability distributions, the intuition is to
quantify the uncertainty in the response using Polynomial Chaos expansion and
discard all the information provided about the randomness of the output and
extract only the bounds of its compact support. To solve for the bounding range
of polynomials, we transform the Polynomial Chaos expansion in the Bernstein
form, and use the range enclosure property of Bernstein polynomials to find the
minimum and maximum value of the response. This procedure is used to propagate
Dempster-Shafer structures on closed intervals through nonlinear functions and
it is applied on an algebraic challenge problem.
