We apply two variations of the principle of Minimum Cross Entropy (the
Kullback information measure) to fit parameterized probability density models
to observed data densities. For an array beamforming problem with P incident
narrowband point sources, N > P sensors, and colored noise, both approaches
yield eigenvector fitting methods similar to that of the MUSIC algorithm[1].
Furthermore, the corresponding cross-entropies are related to the MDL model
order selection criterion[2].
