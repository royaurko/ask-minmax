We report observations of 15 high redshift (z = 1-5) galaxies at 350 microns
using the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory and SHARC-II array detector.
Emission was detected from eight galaxies, for which far-infrared luminosities,
star formation rates, total dust masses, and minimum source size estimates are
derived. These galaxies have star formation rates and star formation
efficiencies comparable to other high redshift molecular emission line
galaxies. The results are used to test the idea that star formation in these
galaxies occurs in a large number of basic units, the units being similar to
star-forming clumps in the Milky Way. The luminosity of these extreme galaxies
can be reproduced in a simple model with (0.9-30) *10^6 dense clumps, each with
a luminosity of 5 *10^5 Lsun, the mean value for such clumps in the Milky Way.
Radiative transfer models of such clumps can provide reasonable matches to the
overall SEDs of the galaxies. They indicate that the individual clumps are
quite opaque in the far-infrared. Luminosity to mass ratios vary over two
orders of magnitude, correlating strongly with the dust temperature derived
from simple fits to the SED. The gas masses derived from the dust modeling are
in remarkable agreement with those from CO luminosities, suggesting that the
assumptions going into both calculations are reasonable.
