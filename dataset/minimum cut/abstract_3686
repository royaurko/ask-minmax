Homogeneous current states in thin films and Josephson current in
superconducting microbridges are studied within the frame of a two-band
Ginzburg-Landau theory. By solving the coupled system of equations for two
order parameters the depairing current curves and Josephson current-phase
relation are calculated for different values of phenomenological parameters
gamma and eta. Coefficients gamma and eta describe the coupling of order
parameters (proximity effect) and their gradients (drag effect) respectively.
For definite values of parameters the dependence of current j on superfluid
momentum contains local minimum and corresponding bi-stable states. It is shown
that the Josephson microbridge from two-band superconductor can demonstrate
pi-junction behaviour.
