We consider a code to be a subset of the vertex set of a Hamming graph. The
set of $s$-neighbours of a code is the set of vertices, not in the code, at
distance $s$ from some codeword, but not distance less than $s$ from any
codeword. A $2$-neighbour transitive code is a code which admits a group $X$ of
automorphisms which is transitive on the $s$-neighbours, for $s=1,2$, and
transitive on the code itself. We give a classification of $2$-neighbour
transitive codes, with minimum distance $\delta\geq 5$, for which $X$ acts
faithfully on the set of entries of the Hamming graph.
