We show that the minimum $h_{\text{min}}$ of the stable Faltings height on
elliptic curves found by Deligne is followed by a gap. This means that there is
a constant $C >0$ such that for every elliptic curve $E/K$ with everywhere
semistable reduction over a number field $K$, we either have
$h(E/K)=h_{\text{min}}$ or $h(E/K)\geq h_{\text{min}} +C$. We determine such an
absolute constant explicitly. On the contrary, we show that there is no such
gap for elliptic curves with unstable reduction.
