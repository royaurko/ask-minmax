We present optical photometry of the eclipsing supersoft source, CAL87. These
observations comprise long term data accumulated as a by-product of the MACHO
Project, and high speed white light photometry of a single eclipse. We (i)
derive an improved ephemeris of To = HJD 2450111.5144(3) + 0.44267714(6)E for
the time of minimum light, (ii) find the eclipse structure to be stable over a
period of 4 years, and (iii) investigate the colour variation as a function of
orbital phase. The resolution afforded by the high speed nature of the white
light observations enables us to see new structure in the light curve
morphology.
