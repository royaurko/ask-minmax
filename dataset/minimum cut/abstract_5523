The optimal conversion of a continuous inter-particle potential to a discrete
equivalent is considered here. Existing and novel algorithms are evaluated to
determine the best technique for creating accurate discrete forms using the
minimum number of discontinuities. This allows the event-driven molecular
dynamics technique to be efficiently applied to the wide range of continuous
force models available in the literature, and facilitates a direct comparison
of event-driven and time-driven molecular dynamics. The performance of the
proposed conversion techniques are evaluated through application to the
Lennard-Jones model. A surprising linear dependence of the computational cost
on the number of discontinuities is found, allowing accuracy to be traded for
speed in a controlled manner. Excellent agreement is found for static and
dynamic properties using a relatively low number of discontinuities. For the
Lennard-Jones potential, the optimized discrete form outperforms the original
continuous form at gas densities but is significantly slower at higher
densities.
