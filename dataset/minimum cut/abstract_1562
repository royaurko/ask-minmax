We describe planetesimal accretion calculations for the dusty ring observed
in the nearby A0 star HR 4796A. Models with initial masses of 10-20 times the
minimum mass solar nebula produce a ring of width 7-15 AU and height 0.3-0.6 AU
at 70 AU in roughly 10 Myr. The ring has a radial optical depth of 1. These
results agree with limits derived from infrared images and from the excess
infrared luminosity.
