Given a stream of items each associated with a numerical value, its edit
distance to monotonicity is the minimum number of items to remove so that the
remaining items are non-decreasing with respect to the numerical value. The
space complexity of estimating the edit distance to monotonicity of a data
stream is becoming well-understood over the past few years. Motivated by
applications on network quality monitoring, we extend the study to estimating
the edit distance to monotonicity of a sliding window covering the $w$ most
recent items in the stream for any $w \ge 1$. We give a deterministic algorithm
which can return an estimate within a factor of $(4+\eps)$ using
$O(\frac{1}{\eps^2} \log^2(\eps w))$ space.
  We also extend the study in two directions. First, we consider a stream where
each item is associated with a value from a partial ordered set. We give a
randomized $(4+\epsilon)$-approximate algorithm using $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}
\log \epsilon^2 w \log w)$ space. Second, we consider an out-of-order stream
where each item is associated with a creation time and a numerical value, and
items may be out of order with respect to their creation times. The goal is to
estimate the edit distance to monotonicity with respect to the numerical value
of items arranged in the order of creation times. We show that any randomized
constant-approximate algorithm requires linear space.
