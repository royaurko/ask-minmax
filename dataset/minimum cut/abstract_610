In this paper we give an approximate answer to a question of Nash-Williams
from 1970: we show that for every \alpha > 0, every sufficiently large graph on
n vertices with minimum degree at least (1/2 + \alpha)n contains at least n/8
edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles. More generally, we give an asymptotically best
possible answer for the number of edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles that a graph G
with minimum degree \delta must have. We also prove an approximate version of
another long-standing conjecture of Nash-Williams: we show that for every
\alpha > 0, every (almost) regular and sufficiently large graph on n vertices
with minimum degree at least $(1/2 + \alpha)n$ can be almost decomposed into
edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles.
