In this article we take up the calculation of the minimum number of colors
needed to produce a non-trivial coloring of a knot. This is a knot invariant
and we use the torus knots of type (2, n) as our case study. We calculate the
minima in some cases. In other cases we estimate upper bounds for these minima
leaning on the features of modular arithmetic. We introduce a sequence of
transformations on colored diagrams called Teneva Transformations. Each of
these Transformations reduces the number of colors in the diagrams by one (up
to a point). This allows us to further decrease the upper bounds on these
minima. We conjecture on the value of these minima. We apply these
Transformations to rational knots.
