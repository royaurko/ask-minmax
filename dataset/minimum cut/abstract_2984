We study a dyadic branching Brownian motion on the real line with absorption
at 0, drift $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ and started from a single particle at position
$x>0.$ When $\mu$ is large enough so that the process has a positive
probability of survival, we consider $K(t),$ the number of individuals absorbed
at 0 by time $t$ and for $s\ge 0$ the functions $\omega_s(x):=
\mathbb{E}^x[s^{K(\infty)}].$ We show that $\omega_s<\infty$ if and only of
$s\in[0,s_0]$ for some $s_0>1$ and we study the properties of these functions.
Furthermore, for $s=0, \omega(x) := \omega_0(x) =\mathbb{P}^x(K(\infty)=0)$ is
the cumulative distribution function of the all time minimum of the branching
Brownian motion with drift started at 0 without absorption.
  We give three descriptions of the family $\omega_s, s\in [0,s_0]$ through a
single pair of functions, as the two extremal solutions of the
Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov (KPP) traveling wave equation on the half-line,
through a martingale representation and as an explicit series expansion. We
also obtain a precise result concerning the tail behavior of $K(\infty)$. In
addition, in the regime where $K(\infty)>0$ almost surely, we show that $u(x,t)
:= \mathbb{P}^x(K(t)=0)$ suitably centered converges to the KPP critical
travelling wave on the whole real line.
