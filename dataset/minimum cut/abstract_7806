In a previous paper we were able to measure the abundance of uranium and
thorium in the very-metal poor halo giant BPS CS 31082-001, but only obtained
an upper limit for the abundance of lead (Pb). We have got from ESO 17 hours of
additional exposure on this star in order to secure a detection of the minimum
amount of lead expected to be present in CS 31082-001, the amount arising from
the decay of the original content of Th and U in the star. We report here this
successful detection. We find an LTE abundance log(Pb/H)+12=-0.55 \pm 0.15 dex,
one dex below the upper limits given by other contributors for the similar stars CS
22892-052 and BD +17d3248, also enhanced in r-process elements. From the
observed present abundances of Th and U in the star, the expected amount of Pb
produced by the decay of 232Th, and 238U alone, over 12-15 Gyr is -0.73\pm 0.17
dex. The decay of 235U is more difficult to estimate, but is probably slightly
below the contribution of 238U, making the contribution of the 3 actinides only
slightly below, or even equal to, the measured abundance. The contribution from
the decay of 234U has was not included, for lack of published data. In this
sense our determination is a lower limit to the contribution of actinides to
lead production. We comment this result, and we note that if a NLTE analysis,
not yet possible, doubles our observed abundance, the decay of the 3 actinides
will still represent 50 per cent of the total lead, a proportion higher than
the values considered so far in the literature.
