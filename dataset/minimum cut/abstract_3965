We study supersymmetric models with double gaugino condensations in the
hidden sector, where the gauge couplings depend on two light moduli of
superstring theory. We perform a detailed analysis of this class of model and
show that there is no stable supersymmetric minimum with finite vacuum values
of moduli fields. Instead, we find that the supersymmetry breaking occurs with
moduli stabilized and negative vacuum energy. That yields moduli-dominated soft
supersymmetry breaking terms. To realize slightly positive (or vanishing)
vacuum energy, we add uplifting potential. We discuss uplifting does not change
qualitatively the vacuum expectation values of moduli and the above feature of
supersymmetry breaking.
