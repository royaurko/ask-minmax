In this paper, we describe the properties of the $i$-components of Hamming
codes. We suggest constructions of the admissible families of components of
Hamming codes. It is shown that every $q$-ary code of length $m$ and minimum
distance 5 (for $q = 3$ the minimum distance is 3) can be embedded in a $q$-ary
1-perfect code of length $n = (q^{m}-1)/(q-1)$. It is also shown that every
binary code of length $m + k$ and minimum distance $3k + 3$ can be embedded in
a binary 1-perfect code of length $n = 2^{m}-1$.
