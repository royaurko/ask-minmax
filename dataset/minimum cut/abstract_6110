We present timing and spectral analysis of the data collected by the Extreme
Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite (EUVE) for the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 during
1996. NGC 4051 was observed twice in May 1996 and again in December 1996 for a
total of more than 200 ks. The observations were always simultaneous with hard
X-ray observations conducted with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The
EUVE light curves are extremely variable during each observation, with the
maximum variability of more than a factor of 15 from peak to minimum. We
detected signal in the EUVE spectrograph in the 75-100 A range which is well
fitted by absorbed power law models. We illustrate the results of our spectral
and detailed power spectrum analysis performed on EUVE data and the comparison
with RXTE lightcurves and discuss the constraint we can place on the mass of
the central object and on the size of the emitting region.
