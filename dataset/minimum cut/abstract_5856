Heating of polar coronal holes during solar minimum and acceleration of the
fast solar wind issuing therefrom lack comprehensive theoretical understanding.
Wave particle interactions are considered to have crucial effects on the
extreme properties of heavy ions in the collision-less region of the polar
coronal holes. In this article, we have presented a novel sensitivity analysis
to investigate plasma heating by radio waves at lower hybrid frequencies. We
have employed a three fluid Maxwell model comprising electrons, protons, and
alpha particles at around two solar radius heliocentric distance in the polar
coronal holes and derived a dispersion relation as a thirteenth order
polynomial for the frequency. Our model provides indications of preferential
heating of alpha particles in comparison with protons by means of lower hybrid
instabilities. We have employed the electron velocity and spatial charge
distribution as our basic study tools so as to show the effects of alpha proton
differential mass and differential perpendicular velocity on the preferential
heating of alpha particles.
