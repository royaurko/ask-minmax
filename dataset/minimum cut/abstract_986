The frequency dependence of the imaginary part of the infrared conductivity
is calculated for a superconductor. Sharp structure, characteristic of
superconductivity with an order parameter with s-wave symmetry, appears in the
BCS limit as a minimum at a frequency equal to twice the gap value. This
structure scales with temperature but gets progressively smeared and shifted as
impurity scattering is increased. The relationship between low frequency
results and the zero frequency limit is investigated. Experimental results on
$\BKBO$ are also presented. The low frequency imaginary part of the
conductivity displays a minimum at $2\Delta \approx 12$ meV, and provides
unequivocal evidence of an s-wave superconducting order parameter. Strong
coupling (Eliashberg) results show similar trends. Using this formulation we
find that the electron-phonon coupling in $\BKBO$ must necessarily be small,
with coupling constant $\lambda \approx 0.2$, in agreement with conclusions
drawn from measurements of the real part of the conductivity. Thus $\BKBO$ is
an s-wave superconductor that is not driven by the electron-phonon interaction.
