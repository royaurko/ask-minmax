We develop a coarse-grained protein model with a simplified amino acid
interaction potential. We perform discrete molecular dynamics folding
simulations of a small 20 residue protein - Trp-cage - from a fully extended
conformation. We demonstrate the ability of the Trp-cage model to consistently
reach conformations within 2angstrom backbone root-mean-square distance (RMSD)
from the corresponding NMR structures. The minimum RMSD of Trp-cage
conformations in the simulation can be smaller than 1.00angstrom. Our findings
suggest that, at least for the case of Trp-cage, a detailed all-atom protein
model with a physical molecular mechanics force field is not necessary to reach
the native state of a protein. Our results also suggest that the success
folding Trp-cage in our simulations and in the reported all-atom molecular
mechanics simulations studies may be mainly due to the special stabilizing
features specific to this miniprotein.
