Empirical observations indicate striking similarities among locomotion in
terrestrial animals, birds, and fish, but unifying physical grounds are
lacking. When applied to efficient locomotion, the analytical mechanics
principle of minimum action yields two patterns of mechanical similarity via
two explicit spatiotemporal coherent states. In steady locomotory modes, the
slow muscles determining maximal optimum speeds maintain universal intrinsic
muscular pressure. Otherwise, maximal speeds are due to constant mass-dependent
stiffness of fast muscles generating a uniform force field, exceeding
gravitation. Being coherent in displacements, velocities and forces, the body
appendages of animals are tuned to natural propagation frequency through the
state-dependent elastic muscle moduli.
