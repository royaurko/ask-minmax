A modified version of PQCD considered in previous works is investigated here
in the case of retaining only the quark condensate. The Green functions
generating functional is expressed in a form in which Dirac's delta functions
are now absent from the free propagators. The new expansion implements the
dimensional transmutation effect through a single interaction vertex in
addition to the standard ones in mass less QCD. The new vertex suggests a way
for constructing an alternative to the SM in which the mass and CKM matrices
could be generated by the instability of masslesss QCD under the production of
the top quark and other fermions condensates, in a kind of generalized Nambu
Jona Lasinio mechanism. The results of a two loop evaluation of the vacuum
energy indicate that the quark condensate is dynamically generated. However,
the energy as a function of the condensate parameter is again unbounded from
below in this approximation. Assuming the existence of a minimum of the vacuum
energy at the experimental value of the top quark mass mq=173 GeV, we evaluate
the two particle propagator in the quark anti-quark channel in zero order in
the coupling and a ladder approximation in the condensate vertex. Adopting the
notion from the former top quark models, in which the Higgs field corresponds
to the quark condensate, the results suggest that the Higgs particle could be
represented by a meson which might appear at energies around two times the top
quark mass.
