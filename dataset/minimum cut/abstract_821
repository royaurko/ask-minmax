In a gauge theory at nonzero temperature the eigenvalues of the Wilson line
form a set of gauge invariant observables. By constructing the corresponding
partition function for the phases of these eigenvalues, we prove that the
trivial vacuum, where the phases vanish, is a minimum of the free energy.
