Consider communication over the binary erasure channel BEC using random
low-density parity-check codes with finite-blocklength n from `standard'
ensembles. We show that large error events is conveniently described within a
scaling theory, and explain how to estimate heuristically their effect. Among
other quantities, we consider the finite length threshold e(n), defined by
requiring a block error probability P_B = 1/2. For ensembles with minimum
variable degree larger than two, the following expression is argued to hold
e(n) = e -e_1 n^{-2/3} +\Theta(n^{-1}) with a calculable shift} parameter
e_1>0.
