We report the observation of a metal-insulator transition in a
two-dimensional electron gas in silicon. By applying substrate bias, we have
varied the mobility of our samples, and observed the creation of the metallic
phase when the mobility was high enough ($\mu ~> 1 m^2/Vs$), consistent with
the assertion that this transition is driven by electron-electron interactions.
In a perpendicular magnetic field, the magnetoconductance is positive in the
vicinity of the transition, but negative elsewhere. Our experiment suggests
that such behavior results from a decrease of the spin-dependent part of the
interaction in the vicinity of the transition.
