Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a colouring $f:E\mapsto \mathbb N$, the induced
colour of a vertex $v$ is the sum of the colours at the edges incident with
$v$. If all the induced colours of vertices of $G$ are distinct, the colouring
is called antimagic. If $G$ has a bijective antimagic colouring $f:E\mapsto
\{1,\dots,|E|\}$, the graph $G$ is called antimagic. A conjecture of Hartsfield
and Ringel states that all connected graphs other than $K_2$ are antimagic.
Alon, Kaplan, Lev, Roddity and Yuster proved this conjecture for graphs with
minimum degree at least $c \log |V|$ for some constant $c$; we improve on this
result, proving the conjecture for graphs with average degree at least some
constant $d_0$.
