The CALICE collaboration has constructed highly granular electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeter prototypes to evaluate technologies for the use in
detector systems at the future International Linear Collider. These
calorimeters have been tested extensively in particle beams at CERN and at
Fermilab. We present analysis results for hadronic events recorded at CERN with
a SiW ECAL, a scintillator tile HCAL and a scintillator strip tail catcher, the
latter two with SiPM readout, focusing both on the HCAL alone and on the
complete calorimeter setup. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of the
linearity of the detector response and on the single particle energy
resolution. The high granularity of the detectors was used to perform first
studies of software compensation based on the local shower energy density,
yielding significant improvements in the energy resolution. The required
calibration precision to achieve this resolution, and the effect of calibration
uncertainties, for the CALICE HCAL as well as for a complete hadron calorimeter
at ILC, has been studied in detail. The prospects of using minimum-ionizing
track segments within hadronic showers for calibration are also discussed.
