We scan the landscape of flux compactifications for the Calabi-Yau manifold
$\mathbb{P}^4_{[1,1,1,6,9]}$ with two K\" ahler moduli by varying the value of
the flux superpotential $W_0$ over a large range of values. We do not include
uplift terms. We find a rich phase structure of AdS and dS vacua. Starting with
$W_0\sim 1$ we reproduce the exponentially large volume scenario, but as $W_0$
is reduced new classes of minima appear. One of them corresponds to the
supersymmetric KKLT vacuum while the other is a new, deeper non-supersymmetric
minimum. We study how the bare cosmological constant and the soft supersymmetry
breaking parameters for matter on D7 branes depend on $W_0$, for these classes
of minima. We discuss potential applications of our results.
