For two graphs S and T, the constrained Ramsey number f(S, T) is the minimum
n such that every edge coloring of the complete graph on n vertices, with any
number of colors, has a monochromatic subgraph isomorphic to S or a rainbow
(all edges differently colored) subgraph isomorphic to T. The Erdos-Rado
Canonical Ramsey Theorem implies that f(S, T) exists if and only if S is a star
or T is acyclic, and much work has been done to determine the rate of growth of
f(S, T) for various types of parameters. When S and T are both trees having s
and t edges respectively, Jamison, Jiang, and Ling showed that f(S, T) <=
O(st^2) and conjectured that it is always at most O(st). They also mentioned
that one of the most interesting open special cases is when T is a path. In
this work, we study this case and show that f(S, P_t) = O(st log t), which
differs only by a logarithmic factor from the conjecture. This substantially
improves the previous bounds for most values of s and t.
