We present the first polytope volume formulas for the multiplicities of
affine fusion, the fusion in Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theories, for
example. Thus, we characterise fusion multiplicities as discretised volumes of
certain convex polytopes, and write them explicitly as multiple sums measuring
those volumes. We focus on su(2), but discuss higher-point (N>3) and
higher-genus fusion in a general way. The method follows that of our previous
work on tensor product multiplicities, and so is based on the concepts of
generalised Berenstein-Zelevinsky diagrams, and virtual couplings. As a
by-product, we also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for
non-vanishing higher-point fusion multiplicities. In the limit of large level,
these inequalities reduce to very simple non-vanishing conditions for the
corresponding tensor product multiplicities. Finally, we find the minimum level
at which the higher-point fusion and tensor product multiplicities coincide.
