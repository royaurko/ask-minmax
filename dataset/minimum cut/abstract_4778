A dominating set $D$ for a graph $G$ is a subset of $V(G)$ such that any
vertex not in $D$ has at least one neighbor in $D$. The domination number
$\gamma(G)$ is the size of a minimum dominating set in $G$. Vizing's conjecture
from 1968 states that for the Cartesian product of graphs $G$ and $H$,
$\gamma(G) \gamma(H) \leq \gamma(G \Box H)$, and Clark and Suen (2000) proved
that $\gamma(G) \gamma(H) \leq 2\gamma(G \Box H)$. In this paper, we modify the
approach of Clark and Suen to prove a variety of similar bounds related to
total and paired domination, and also extend these bounds to the $n$-Cartesian
product of graphs $A^1$ through $A^n$.
