We investigate the stability of dark solitons (DSs) in an effectively
one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of the magnetic
parabolic trap and an optical lattice (OL). The analysis is based on both the
full Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its tight-binding approximation counterpart
(discrete nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation). We find that DSs are subject to
weak instabilities with an onset of instability mainly governed by the period
and amplitude of the OL. The instability, if present, sets in at large times
and it is characterized by quasi-periodic oscillations of the DS about the
minimum of the parabolic trap.
