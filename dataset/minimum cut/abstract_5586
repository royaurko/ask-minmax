This paper presents a design technique for obtaining regular time-invariant
low-density parity-check convolutional (RTI-LDPCC) codes with low complexity
and good performance. We start from previous approaches which unwrap a
low-density parity-check (LDPC) block code into an RTI-LDPCC code, and we
obtain a new method to design RTI-LDPCC codes with better performance and
shorter constraint length. Differently from previous techniques, we start the
design from an array LDPC block code. We show that, for codes with high rate, a
performance gain and a reduction in the constraint length are achieved with
respect to previous proposals. Additionally, an increase in the minimum
distance is observed.
