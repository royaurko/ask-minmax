This paper presents the characterization of power control in WCDMA systems.
We know that CDMA is an interference limited system. It is shown that the
unbalance scheme is reliable and successful for both 2-way and 3-way soft
handover. Unbalance scheme minimizes interference and speed up the soft
handover algorithm to support more users quickly. Furthermore it requires
minimum time to make decision for proper power control in soft handover status.
