SU(N) gauge theories, extended with adjoint fermions having periodic boundary
conditions, are confining at high temperature for sufficiently light fermion
mass $m$. In the high temperature confining region, the one-loop effective
potential for Polyakov loops has a Z(N)-symmetric confining minimum. String
tensions associated with Polyakov loops are calculable in perturbation theory,
and display a novel scaling behavior in which higher representations have
smaller string tensions than the fundamental representation. In the magnetic
sector, the Polyakov loop plays a role similar to a Higgs field, leading to an
apparent breaking of SU(N) to $U(1)^{N-1}$. This is turn yields a dual
effective theory where magnetic monopoles give rise to string tensions for
spatial Wilson loops. The spatial string tensions are calculable
semiclassically from kink solutions of the dual system. We show that the
spatial string tensions $\sigma^{(s)}_k$ associated with each $N$-ality $k$
obey a variant of Casimir scaling $\sigma^{(s)}_k /\sigma^{(s)}_1 \leq
\sqrt{k(N-k)/(N-1)} $. Although lattice simulations indicate that the high
temperature confining region is smoothly connected to the confining region of
low-temperature pure SU(N) gauge theory, the electric and magnetic string
tension scaling laws are different and readily distinguishable.
