Cosmological inflation is studied in the case where the inflaton is the
overall modulus $T$ for an orbifold. General forms of the (non-perturbative)
superpotential are considered to ensure that $G=K+{\rm ln}|W|^2$ is modular
invariant. We find generically that these models do not produce a potential
flat enough for slow roll to a supersymmetric minimum, although we do find a
model which produces up to 20 e-folds of inflation to a non-supersymmetric
minimum.
