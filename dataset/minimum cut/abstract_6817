We perform a comprehensive study of the Higgs sector in the framework of the
next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model with CP-violating parameters in
the superpotential and in the soft-supersymmetry-breaking sector. Since the CP
is no longer a good symmetry, the two CP-odd and the three CP-even Higgs bosons
of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model in the CP-conserving limit
will mix. We show explicitly how the mass spectrum and couplings to gauge
bosons of the various Higgs bosons change when the CP-violating phases take on
nonzero values. We include full one-loop and the logarithmically enhanced
two-loop effects employing the renormalization-group (RG) improved approach. In
addition, the LEP limits, the global minimum condition, and the positivity of
the square of the Higgs-boson mass have been imposed. We demonstrate the
effects on the Higgs-mass spectrum and the couplings to gauge bosons with and
without the RG-improved corrections. Substantial modifications to the allowed
parameter space happen because of the changes to the Higgs-boson spectrum and
their couplings with the RG-improved corrections. Finally, we calculate the
mass spectrum and couplings of the few selected scenarios and compare to the
previous results in literature where possible; in particular, we illustrate a
scenario motivated by electroweak baryogenesis.
