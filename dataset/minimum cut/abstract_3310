We present results from our survey for planetary transits in the field of the
intermediate age (~2.5 Gyr), metal-rich ([Fe/H]~+0.07) open cluster NGC 6819.
We have obtained high-precision time-series photometry for over 38,000 stars in
this field and have developed an effective matched-filter algorithm to search
for photometric transits. This algorithm identified 8 candidate stars showing
multiple transit-like events, plus 3 stars with single eclipses. On closer
inspection, while most are shown to be low mass stellar binaries, some of these
events could be due to brown dwarf companions. The data for one of the
single-transit candidates indicates a minimum radius for the companion similar
to that of HD 209458b.
