The segmentation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a longstanding
yet challenging task, not only because of the presence of speckle, but also due
to the variations of surface backscattering properties in the images.
Tremendous investigations have been made to eliminate the speckle effects for
the segmentation of SAR images, while few work devotes to dealing with the
variations of backscattering coefficients in the images. In order to overcome
both the two difficulties, this paper presents a novel SAR image segmentation
method by exploiting a multi-scale active contour model based on the non-local
processing principle. More precisely, we first formulize the SAR segmentation
problem with an active contour model by integrating the non-local interactions
between pairs of patches inside and outside the segmented regions. Secondly, a
multi-scale strategy is proposed to speed up the non-local active contour
segmentation procedure and to avoid falling into local minimum for achieving
more accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on simulated and real
SAR images demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method:
it can not only achieve precise segmentations for images with heavy speckles
and non-local intensity variations, but also can be used for SAR images from
different types of sensors.
