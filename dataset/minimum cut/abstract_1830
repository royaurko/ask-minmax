In the framework of irreversible thermodynamics, we studied the transport
properties of QGP. Shear viscosity and non-equilibrium entropy density related
to viscous process at finite density has been investigated in weakly coupled
limit by using kinetic theory. The results show that the chemical potential
increases viscosityyet decreases the non-equilibrium entropy density and thus
contributes positively to their ratio compared to the pure temperature case. As
to the temperature dependence of the ratio, the ratio first decreases rapidly
and then increases in the physical region, presenting a minimum value of 0.4 at
the temperature around 182MeV.
