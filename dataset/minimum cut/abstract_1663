We present exact and asymptotic results for clusters in the one-dimensional
totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) with two different dynamics. The
expected length of the largest cluster is shown to diverge logarithmically with
increasing system size for ordinary TASEP dynamics and as a logarithm divided
by a double logarithm for generalized dynamics, where the hopping probability
of a particle depends on the size of the cluster it belongs to. The connection
with the asymptotic theory of extreme order statistics is discussed in detail.
We also consider a related model of interface growth, where the deposited
particles are allowed to relax to the local gravitational minimum.
