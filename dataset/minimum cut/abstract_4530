Quasi-topological gravity is a new gravitational theory including
curvature-cubed interactions and for which exact black hole solutions were
constructed. In a holographic framework, classical quasi-topological gravity
can be thought to be dual to the large $N_c$ limit of some non-supersymmetric
but conformal gauge theory. We establish various elements of the AdS/CFT
dictionary for this duality. This allows us to infer physical constraints on
the couplings in the gravitational theory. Further we use holography to
investigate hydrodynamic aspects of the dual gauge theory. In particular, we
find that the minimum value of the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio for
this model is $\eta/s \simeq 0.4140/(4\pi)$.
