We measure an anomalous magnetoresistance peak within the lowest Landau level
(nu = 1) minimum of a two-dimensional hole system on (110) GaAs.
Self-consistent calculations of the valence band mixing show that the two
lowest spin-index Landau levels anticross in a perpendicular magnetic field B
consistent with where the experimental peak is measured, Bp. The temperature
dependence of the anomalous peak height is interpreted as an activated behavior
across this anticrossing gap. Calculations of the spin polarization in the
lowest Landau levels predict a rapid switch from about -3/2 to +3/2 spin at the
anticrossing. The peak position Bp is shown to be affected by the confinement
electrostatics, and the utility of a tunable anticrossing position for
spintronics applications is discussed.
