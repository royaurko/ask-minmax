The object of the present paper is to extend the third-order iterative method
for solving nonlinear equations into systems of nonlinear equations. Since our
motive is to develop the method which improve the order of convergence of
Newton's method with minimum number of functional evaluations.To achieve this
goal,we have used weighted method. Computational efficiency is compared not
only traditional way but also recently introduced flops-like based concept.
Finally numerical results are given to confirm theoretical order of
convergence.
