The atmospheric activity of the Sun and solar-type stars is analysed
involving observations from HK-project at the Mount Wilson Observatory, the
California and Carnegie Planet Search Program at the Keck and Lick
Observatories, and the Magellan Planet Search Program at the Las Campanas
Observatory. We show that for stars of F, G and K spectral classes, the cyclic
activity, similar to the 11-yr Solar cycles, is different: it becomes more
prominent in K-stars. Comparative study of solar-type stars with different
levels of the chromospheric and coronal activity confirms that the Sun belongs
to stars with the low level of the chromospheric activity and stands apart
among these stars by the minimum level of the coronal radiation and minimum
flux variations of the photospheric radiation.
