The applications of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) have recently been
extended by the development of counters with time resolution below 100 ps sigma
for minimum ionising particles. Applications to HEP experiments have already
taken place and many further applications are under study. In this work we
address the operating principles of such counters along with some present
challenges, with emphasis on counter aging.
