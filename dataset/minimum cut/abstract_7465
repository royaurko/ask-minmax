Observations of debris disks allow for the study of planetary systems, even
where planets have not been detected. However, debris disks are often only
characterized by unresolved infrared excesses that resemble featureless
blackbodies, and the location of the emitting dust is uncertain due to a
degeneracy with the dust grain properties. Here we characterize the Spitzer IRS
spectra of 22 debris disks exhibiting 10 micron silicate emission features.
Such features arise from small warm dust grains, and their presence can
significantly constrain the orbital location of the emitting debris. We find
that these features can be explained by the presence of an additional dust
component in the terrestrial zones of the planetary systems, i.e. an
exozodiacal belt. Aside from possessing exozodiacal dust, these debris disks
are not particularly unique; their minimum grain sizes are consistent with the
blowout sizes of their systems, and their brightnesses are comparable to those
of featureless warm debris disks. These disks are in systems with a range of
ages, although the older systems with features are found only around A-type
stars. The features in young systems may be signatures of terrestrial planet
formation. Analyzing the spectra of unresolved debris disks with emission
features may be one of the simplest and most accessible ways to study the
terrestrial regions of planetary systems.
