A beautiful conjecture of Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits and Sidorenko states that if H
is a bipartite graph, then the random graph with edge density p has in
expectation asymptotically the minimum number of copies of H over all graphs of
the same order and edge density. This conjecture also has an equivalent
analytic form and has connections to a broad range of topics, such as matrix
theory, Markov chains, graph limits, and quasirandomness. Here we prove the
conjecture if H has a vertex complete to the other part, and deduce an
approximate version of the conjecture for all H. Furthermore, for a large class
of bipartite graphs, we prove a stronger stability result which answers a
question of Chung, Graham, and Wilson on quasirandomness for these graphs.
