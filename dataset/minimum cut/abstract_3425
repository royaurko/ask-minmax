Treating the motion of a dust particle suspended in a liquid as a random
walk, Einstein in 1905 derived an equation describing the diffusion of the
particle's probability distribution in configuration space. Fokker and Planck
extended this work to describe the velocity distribution of the particles.
Their equation and its solutions have been applied to many problems in nature
starting with the motion of Brownian particles in a liquid. Chandrasekhar
derived the Fokker-Planck equation for stars and showed that long-range
gravitational encounters provide a drag force, dynamical friction, which is
important in the evolution of star clusters and the formation of galaxies. In
certain circumstances, Fokker-Planck evolution also describes the evolution of
dark (invisible) matter in the universe. In the early universe, the thermal
decoupling of weakly interacting massive particles from the plasma of
relativistic leptons and photons is governed by Fokker-Planck evolution. The
resulting dissipation imprints a minimum length scale for cosmic density
fluctuations. Still later, these density fluctuations produce stochastic
gravitational forces on the dark matter as it begins to cluster under gravity.
The latter example provides an exact derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation
without the usual assumption of Markovian dynamics.
