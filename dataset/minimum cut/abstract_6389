We consider a lattice gas with general short range interactions and a Kac
potential $J_\gamma({r})$ of range $\gamma^{-1}$, $\gamma>0$, evolving via
particles hopping to nearest neighbor empty sites with rates which satisfy
detailed balance with respect to the equilibrium measure. Scaling space like
$\gamma^{-1}$ and time like $\gamma^{-2}$, we prove that in the limit $\gamma
\to 0$ the macroscopic density profile $\rho({r},t)$ satisfies a
integro-differential equation which is in the form of the gradient flux of the
energy functional $\cal F$, with a mobility given by the Einstein relation
Beside a regularity condition on J, the only requirement for this result is
that the reference system satisfy the hypotheses of the Varadhan--Yau Theorem
leading to the equation for $J\equiv 0$. Therefore the equation holds also if
$\cal F$ achieves its minimum on non constant density profiles and this
includes the cases in which {\sl phase segregation} occurs. Using the same
techniques we also derive hydrodynamic equations for the densities of a two
component A-B mixture with long range repulsive interactions between A and B
particles. The equations for the densities $\rho_A$ and $\rho_B$ are again in
the form of the gradient flux. They describe, at low temperatures, the demixing
transition in which segregation takes place via vacancies, i.e. jumps to empty
sites. In the limit of very few vacancies the problem becomes similar to phase
segregation in a continuum system in the so called incompressible limit.
