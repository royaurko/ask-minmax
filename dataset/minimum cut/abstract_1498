In this paper, we address the problem of placing sensor probes in the brain
such that the system dynamics' are generically observable. The system dynamics
whose states can encode for instance the fire-rating of the neurons or their
ensemble following a neural-topological (structural) approach, and the sensors
are assumed to be dedicated, i.e., can only measure a state at each time. Even
though the mathematical description of brain dynamics is (yet) to be
discovered, we build on its observed fractal characteristics and assume that
the model of the brain activity satisfies fractional-order dynamics.
  Although the sensor placement explored in this paper is particularly
considering the observability of brain dynamics, the proposed methodology
applies to any fractional-order linear system. Thus, the main contribution of
this paper is to show how to place the minimum number of dedicated sensors,
i.e., sensors measuring only a state variable, to ensure generic observability
in discrete-time fractional-order systems for a specified finite interval of
time. Finally, an illustrative example of the main results is provided using
electroencephalogram (EEG) data.
