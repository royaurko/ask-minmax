Since the discovery of the original millisecond pulsar, no pulsars with a
shorter spin period (P<1.56 ms) were found. However, according to the most
popular equations of state, the theoretical limiting spin period of a neutron
star can be much shorter. On the other hand, most of the large scale searches
for millisecond pulsars carried out so far were strongly biased against the
detection of ultrashort periodicities. In this paper we describe a new large
scale pulsar survey with a minimum detectable period much shorter than previous
searches.
