In this paper, STAR's measurement of clan multiplicity is presented for AuAu
collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200
GeV, for a variety of centrality classes. The mean number of particles per clan
is found to decrease with decreasing centrality. Within the same centrality
class, the mean number of particles per clan exhibits a reduction between 19.6
GeV and 62 GeV, with the minimum around 27 GeV. The structure is visible for
most centralities, and most prominent for central collisions.
