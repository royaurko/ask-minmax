The Internet has been ascribed a prominent role in collective action,
particularly with widespread use of social media. But most mobilisations fail.
We investigate the characteristics of those few mobilisations that succeed and
hypothesise that the presence of 'starters' with low thresholds for joining
will determine whether a mobilisation achieves success, as suggested by
threshold models. We use experimental data from public good games to identify
personality types associated with willingness to start in collective action. We
find a significant association between both extraversion and internal locus of
control, and willingness to start, while agreeableness is associated with a
tendency to follow. Rounds without at least a minimum level of extraversion
among the participants are unlikely to be funded, providing some support for
the hypothesis.
