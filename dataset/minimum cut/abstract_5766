We describe a hybrid axion-monodromy inflation model motivated by the Dante's
Inferno scenario. In Dante's Inferno, a two-field potential features a stable
trench along which a linear combination of the two fields slowly rolls,
rendering the dynamics essentially identical to that of single-field chaotic
inflation. A shift symmetry allows for the Lyth bound to be effectively evaded
as in other axion-monodromy models. In our proposal, the potential is concave
downward near the origin and the inflaton trajectory is a gradual downward
spiral, ending at a point where the trench becomes unstable. There, the fields
begin falling rapidly towards the minimum of the potential and inflation
terminates as in a hybrid model. We find parameter choices that reproduce
observed features of the cosmic microwave background, and discuss our model in
light of recent results from the BICEP2 and Planck experiments.
