The software industry is successful, if it can draw the complete attention of
the customers towards it. This is achievable if the organization can produce a
high quality product. To identify a product to be of high quality, it should be
free of defects, should be capable of producing expected results. It should be
delivered in an estimated cost, time and be maintainable with minimum effort.
Defect Prevention is the most critical but often neglected component of the
software quality assurance in any project. If applied at all stages of software
development, it can reduce the time, cost and resources required to engineer a
high quality product.
