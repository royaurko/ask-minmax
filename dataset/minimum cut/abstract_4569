Angular correlations measured in heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) include a same-side (SS) 2D peak which is strongly
elongated on pseudorapidity $\eta$ in more-central \auau collisions. The
elongated peak has been referred to as a ``soft ridge.'' The SS peak is
consistent with expected jet correlations in peripheral \aa and p-p collisions.
A saturation-scale argument has been proposed to explain the origin of the
elongated SS peak in terms of correlations from Glasma flux tubes interacting
with radial flow. In this analysis we review the details of the proposed
argument in comparison to perturbative QCD predictions of jet yields and
correlations. We find that the proposal is inconsistent with several features
of measured spectra and correlations.
