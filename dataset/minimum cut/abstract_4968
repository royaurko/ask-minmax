We consider, in a $D-$dimensional cylinder, a non--local evolution equation
that describes the evolution of the local magnetization in a continuum limit of
an Ising spin system with Kawasaki dynamics and Kac potentials.
  We consider sub--critical temperatures, for which there are two local
spatially homogeneous equilibria, and show a local nonlinear stability result
for the minimum free energy profiles for the magnetization at the interface
between regions of these two different local equilibrium; i.e., the planar
fronts: We show that an initial perturbation of a front that is sufficiently
small in $L^2$ norm, and sufficiently localized yields a solution that relaxes
to another front, selected by a conservation law, in the $L^1$ norm at an
algebraic rate that we explicitly estimate. We also obtain rates for the
relaxation in the $L^2$ norm and the rate of decrease of the excess free
energy.
