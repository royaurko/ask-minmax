We report the discovery of a substellar companion around the intermediatemass
giant HD 175679. Precise radial velocity data of the star from Xinglong Station
and Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO) revealed a Keplerian velocity
variation with an orbital period of 1366.8 \pm 5.7 days, a semiamplitude of
380.2 \pm 3.2m s.1, and an eccentricity of 0.378 \pm 0.008. Adopting a stellar
mass of 2.7 \pm 0.3 M\odot, we obtain the minimum mass of the HD 175679 b is
37.3 \pm 2.8 MJ, and the semimajor axis is 3.36 \pm 0.12 AU. This discovery is
the second brown dwarf companion candidate from a joint planet-search program
between China and Japan.
