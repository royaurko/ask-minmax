We compute in next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD the transverse
energy carried into the central rapidity unit of hadron or nuclear collisions
by the partons freed in the few-GeV subcollisions. The formulation is based on
a rapidity window and a measurement function of a new type. The behaviour of
the NLO results as a function of the minimum transverse momentum and as a
function of the scale choice is studied. The NLO results are found to be stable
relative to the leading-order ones even in the few-GeV domain.
