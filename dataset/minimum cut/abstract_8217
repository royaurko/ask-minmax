For a two-qubit system under local depolarizing channels, the most robust and
most fragile states are derived for a given concurrence or negativity. For the
one-sided channel, the pure states are proved to be the most robust ones, with
the aid of the evolution equation for entanglement given by Konrad et al. [Nat.
Phys. 4, 99 (2008)]. Based on a generalization of the evolution equation for
entanglement, we classify the ansatz states in our investigation by the amount
of robustness, and consequently derive the most fragile states. For the
two-sided channel, the pure states are the most robust for a fixed concurrence.
Under the uniform channel, the most fragile states have the minimal negativity
when the concurrence is given in the region [1/2,1]. For a given negativity,
the most robust states are the ones with the maximal concurrence, and the most
fragile ones are the pure states with minimum of concurrence. When the
entanglement approaches zero, the most fragile states under general nonuniform
channels tend to the ones in the uniform channel. Influences on robustness by
entanglement, degree of mixture, and asymmetry between the two qubits are
discussed through numerical calculations. It turns out that the concurrence and
negativity are major factors for the robustness. When they are fixed, the
impact of the mixedness becomes obvious. In the nonuniform channels, the most
fragile states are closely correlated with the asymmetry, while the most robust
ones with the degree of mixture.
