Raman Spectroscopy is able to probe disorder in graphene through
defect-activated peaks. It is of great interest to link these features to the
nature of disorder. Here we present a detailed analysis of the Raman spectra of
graphene containing different type of defects. We found that the intensity
ratio of the D and D' peak is maximum (~ 13) for sp3-defects, it decreases for
vacancy-like defects (~ 7) and reaches a minimum for boundaries in graphite
(~3.5).
