We present measurements of the spatial clustering of ultraluminous infrared
galaxies in two redshift intervals, 1.5<z<2.0 and 2<z<3. Both samples cluster
strongly, with r_0=14.40+/-1.99 h^-1 Mpc for the 2<z<3 sample, and
r_0=9.40+/-2.24 h^-1 Mpc for the 1.5<z<2.0 sample, making them among the most
biased galaxies at these epochs. These clustering amplitudes are consistent
with both populations residing in dark matter haloes with masses of ~6x10^13
solar masses. We infer that a minimum dark matter halo mass is an important
factor for all forms of luminous, obscured activity in galaxies at z>1.
Adopting plausible models for the growth of DM haloes with redshift, then the
haloes hosting the 2<z<3 sample will likely host the richest clusters of
galaxies at z=0, whereas the haloes hosting the 1.5<z<2.0 sample will likely
host poor to rich clusters at z=0.
