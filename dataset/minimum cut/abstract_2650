We present a robust test for composite null hypothesis based on the general
$S$-divergence family. This requires a non-trivial extension of the results of
Ghosh et al.~(2015). We derive the asymptotic and theoretical robustness
properties of the resulting test along with the properties of the minimum
$S$-divergence estimators under parameter restrictions imposed by the null
hypothesis. An illustration in the context of the normal model is also
presented.
