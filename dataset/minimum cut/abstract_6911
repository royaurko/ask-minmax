We present a method for computing the net transmission of X-rays emitted by
shock-heated plasma distributed throughout a partially optically thick stellar
wind from a massive star. We find the transmission by an exact integration of
the formal solution, assuming that the emitting plasma and absorbing plasma are
mixed at a constant mass ratio above some minimum radius, below which there is
assumed to be no emission. This model is more realistic than either the slab
absorption associated with a corona at the base of the wind or the exospheric
approximation that assumes that all observed X-rays are emitted without
attenuation from above the radius of optical depth unity. Our model is
implemented in XSPEC as a pre-calculated table that can be coupled to a
user-defined table of the wavelength dependent wind opacity. We provide a
default wind opacity model that is more representative of real wind opacities
than the commonly used neutral interstellar medium (ISM) tabulation.
Preliminary modeling of \textit{Chandra} grating data indicates that the X-ray
hardness trend of OB stars with spectral subtype can largely be understood as a
wind absorption effect.
