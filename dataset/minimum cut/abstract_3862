We generalize the pull approach to define the $\chi^2$ function to the
analysis of the data with correlated statistical errors. We apply this method
to the analysis of the Sudbury Neutrino Collaboration data obtained in the
salt-phase. In the global analysis of all the solar neutrino and KamLAND data
we find the best fit (minimum $\chi^2$) values of neutrino parameters to be
$\tan^2 \theta_{12} \sim 0.42$ and $\delta m_{12}^2 \sim 7.1 \times 10^{-5}$
eV$^2$. We confirm that the maximal mixing is strongly disfavored while the
bounds on $\delta m_{12}^2$ are significantly strengthened.
