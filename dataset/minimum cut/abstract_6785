Medical Informatics and the application of modern signal processing in the
assistance of the diagnostic process in medical imaging is one of the more
recent and active research areas today. This thesis addresses a variety of
issues related to the general problem of medical image analysis, specifically
in mammography, and presents a series of algorithms and design approaches for
all the intermediate levels of a modern system for computer-aided diagnosis
(CAD). The diagnostic problem is analyzed with a systematic approach, first
defining the imaging characteristics and features that are relevant to probable
pathology in mammo-grams. Next, these features are quantified and fused into
new, integrated radio-logical systems that exhibit embedded digital signal
processing, in order to improve the final result and minimize the radiological
dose for the patient. In a higher level, special algorithms are designed for
detecting and encoding these clinically interest-ing imaging features, in order
to be used as input to advanced pattern classifiers and machine learning
models. Finally, these approaches are extended in multi-classifier models under
the scope of Game Theory and optimum collective deci-sion, in order to produce
efficient solutions for combining classifiers with minimum computational costs
for advanced diagnostic systems. The material covered in this thesis is related
to a total of 18 published papers, 6 in scientific journals and 12 in
international conferences.
