We investigate the structure of the currencies (systems of coins) for which
the greedy change-making algorithm always finds an optimal solution (that is, a
one with minimum number of coins). We present a series of necessary conditions
that must be satisfied by the values of coins in such systems. We also uncover
some relations between such currencies and their sub-currencies.
