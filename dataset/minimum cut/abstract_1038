We study quintessence models using low energy supergravity inspired from
string theory. We consider effective supergravity with two scales m_S, the
string scale, and m_PL, the Planck scale and show that quintessence naturally
arises from a supersymmetry breaking hidden sector. As long as supersymmetry is
broken by the $F$-term of a Polonyi-like field coupled to the quintessence
field in the K\"ahler potential we find that the Ratra-Peebles potential and
its supergravity version are generic predictions. This requires that the string
scale decouples from the Planck scale, m_S << m_PL. In the context of
supergravity, the potential possesses a minimum induced by the supergravity
corrections to the Ratra-Peebles potential at low redshifts. We study the
physical consequences of the presence of this minimum.
