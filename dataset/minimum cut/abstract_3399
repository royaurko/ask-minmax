We consider the effects of inhomogeneous reionization on the distribution of
galaxies at high redshifts. Modulation of the formation process of the ionizing
sources by large scale density modes makes reionization inhomogeneous and
introduces a spread to the reionization times of different regions with the
same size. After sources photo-ionize and heat these regions to a temperature
$\ga 10^4$K at different times, their temperatures evolve as the ionized
intergalactic medium (IGM) expands. The varying IGM temperature makes the
minimum mass of galaxies spatially non-uniform with a fluctuation amplitude
that increases towards small scales. These scale-dependent fluctuations modify
the shape of the power spectrum of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts in a way
that depends on the history of reionization. The resulting distortion of the
primordial power spectrum is significantly larger than changes associated with
uncertainties in the inflationary parameters, such as the spectral index of the
scalar power spectrum or the running of the spectral index. Future surveys of
high-redshift galaxies will offer a new probe of the thermal history of the IGM
but might have a more limited scope in constraining inflation.
