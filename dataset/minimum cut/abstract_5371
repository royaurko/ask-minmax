A single bit memory system is made with a brownian particle held by an
optical tweezer in a double-well potential and the work necessary to erase the
memory is measured. We show that the minimum of this work is close to the
Landauer's bound only for very slow erasure procedure. Instead a detailed
Jarzynski equality allows us to retrieve the Landauer's bound independently on
the speed of this erasure procedure. For the two separated subprocesses, i.e.
the transition from state 1 to state 0 and the transition from state 0 to state
0, the Jarzynski equality does not hold but the generalized version links the
work done on the system to the probability that it returns to its initial state
under the time-reversed procedure.
