We consider a new class of linear codes, called affine Grassmann codes. These
can be viewed as a variant of generalized Reed-Muller codes and are closely
related to Grassmann codes. We determine the length, dimension, and the minimum
distance of any affine Grassmann code. Moreover, we show that affine Grassmann
codes have a large automorphism group and determine the number of minimum
weight codewords.
