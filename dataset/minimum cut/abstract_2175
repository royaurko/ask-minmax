Completely regular codes with covering radius $\rho=1$ must have minimum
distance $d\leq 3$. For $d=3$, such codes are perfect and their parameters are
well known. In this paper, the cases $d=1$ and $d=2$ are studied and completely
characterized when the codes are linear. Moreover, it is proven that all these
codes are completely transitive.
