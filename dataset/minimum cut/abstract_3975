We consider the anisotropic evolution of spatial dimensions and the
stabilization of internal dimensions in the framework of brane gas cosmology.
We observe that the bulk RR field can give an effective potential which
prevents the internal subvolume from collapsing. For a combination of
$(D-3)$-brane gas wrapping the extra dimensions and 4-form RR flux in the
unwrapped dimensions, it is possible that the wrapped subvolume has an
oscillating solution around the minimum of the effective potential while the
unwrapped subvolume expands monotonically. The flux gives a logarithmic bounce
to the effective potential of the internal dimensions.
