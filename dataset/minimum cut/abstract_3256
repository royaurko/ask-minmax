We report the results of a study of the radio surroundings of the
superluminal microquasar GRO J1655-40. We have searched for extended continuum
structures that might be indicative of the presence of a supernova remnant
(SNR) associated with the formation of the compact object in the binary system.
We also carried out HI-line observations of the region looking for a local
minimum created by an explosive event. Our results indicate that there is, in
fact, a bubble in the large-scale HI distribution around GRO J1655-40. We
suggest that this structure might be created by the original supernova
explosion occurred a few hundred thousand years ago and whose signatures can be
traced by the overabundance of alpha-elements recently found by Israelian et
al. (1999) in the companion star.
