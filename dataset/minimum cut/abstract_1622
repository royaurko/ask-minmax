We consider both disorder and interaction effects on the magnetoresistance
and Hall constant of composite fermions in the vicinity of half filled Landau
level. By contrast to the standard case of Coulomb interacting two-dimensional
electron gas we find logarithmic temperature corrections to the Hall
conductivity and the magnetoresistance of composite fermions whereas the Hall
constant acquires no such correction in the lowest order. The theory provides a
possible explanation of the resistivity minimum at filling factor $\nu=1/2$.
