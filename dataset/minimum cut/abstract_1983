We have analysed the possibility of scaling the sexual Penna ageing model.
Assuming that the number of genes expressed before the reproduction age grows
linearly with the genome size and that the mutation rate per genome and
generation is constant, we have found that the fraction of defective genes
expressed before the minimum reproduction age drops with the genome size, while
the number of defective genes eliminated by the genetic death grows with genome
size. Thus, the evolutionary costs decrease with enlarging the genome. After
rescaling the time scale according to the mutational clock, age distributions
of populations do not depend on the genome size. Nevertheless, enlarging the
genome increases the reproduction potential of populations.
