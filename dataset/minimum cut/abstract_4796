Solving the Euler equation which corresponds to the energy minimum of a
density functional expressed in orbital-free form involves related but distinct
computational challenges. One is the choice between all-electron and
pseudo-potential calculations and, if the latter, construction of the
pseudo-potential. Another is the stability, speed, and accuracy of solution
algorithms. Underlying both is the fundamental issue of satisfactory quality of
the approximate functionals (kinetic energy and exchange-correlation). We
address both computational issues and illustrate them by some comparative
performance testing of our recently developed modified-conjoint generalized
gradient approximation kinetic energy functionals. Comparisons are given for
atoms, diatomic molecules, and some simple solids.
