Medical diagnosis process involves many levels and considerable amount of
time and money are invariably spent for the first level of diagnosis usually
made by the physician for all the patients every time. Hence there is a need
for a computer based system which not only asks relevant questions to the
patients but also aids the physician by giving a set of possible diseases from
the symptoms obtained using logic at inference. In this work, an ICD10 based
Medical Expert System that provides advice, information and recommendation to
the physician using fuzzy temporal logic. The knowledge base used in this
system consists of facts of symptoms and rules on diseases. It also provides
fuzzy severity scale and weight factor for symptom and disease and can vary
with respect to time. The system generates the possible disease conditions
based on modified Euclidean metric using Elders algorithm for effective
clustering. The minimum similarity value is used as the decision parameter to
identify a disease.
