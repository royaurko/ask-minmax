We examine generalized O'Raifeartaigh models that feature multiple tree-level
flat directions and only contain fields with R-charges 0 or 2. We show that
spontaneous R-breaking at up to one-loop order is impossible in such theories.
Specifically, we prove that the R-symmetric origin of field space is always a
local minimum of the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg potential, generalizing an
earlier result for the case of a single flat direction. This result has
consequences for phenomenology and helps elucidate the behavior of various
models of dynamical SUSY breaking.
