I present two catalogs. The first one contains the observed and infered data
of all of 133 stars wich harbor confirmed extrasolar planets. For these 133
stars I report the following data: stellar mass; spectral type; luminosity
class; stellar rotation period; stellar metalicity, [Fe/H]; absolute
luminosity; stellar radius; stellar temperature; age and number of planets host
by the star. The second catalogue lists data for 156 confirmed extrasolar
planets orbiting around the 133 stars. This catalogue contains the following
extrasolar planet data: minimum mass and orbital elements; inclinations; planet
radius; average distance to its parent star; tidal torque sign (if the stellar
rotation period is reported); total irradiance assuming zero albedo. The
usefulness of these catalogs is that they contain in a single paper all of the
available data of the extrasolar planets, and their parent stars. Several
planets whose orbits are completely contained inside the star's syncronous
orbit, are reported.
