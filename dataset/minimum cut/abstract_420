In this paper, a new voltage-mode first order all-pass filter using minimum
active and passive components is presented. The proposed circuit employs one
fully differential second generation current conveyor (FDCCII), one grounded
capacitor, one resistor and offers the following advantages: the use of only
grounded capacitor which is attractive for integrated circuit implementation,
low active and passive sensitivities, providing inverting and non-inverting
voltage-mode all-pass responses simultaneously from the single circuit and no
requirement for component matching conditions. The theory is validated through
PSPICE simulation using TSMC 0.35micrometer CMOS process parameters.
