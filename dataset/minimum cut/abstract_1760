We study stability of a circular orbit of a spinning test particle in a Kerr
spacetime. We find that some of the circular orbits become unstable in the
direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane, although the orbits are still
stable in the radial direction. Then for the large spin case ($S < \sim O(1)),
the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) appears before the minimum of the
effective potential in the equatorial plane disappears. This changes the radius
of ISCO and then the frequency of the last circular orbit.
