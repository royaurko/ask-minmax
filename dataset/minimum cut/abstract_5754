In this work, we study long-time wave transport in correlated and
uncorrelated disordered 2D arrays. When a separation of dimensions is applied
to the model, we find that the predicted 1D random dimer phenomenology also
appears in so-called pseudo-2D arrays. Therefore, a threshold behavior is
observed in terms of the effective size for eigenmodes, as well as in long-time
dynam- ics. For this threshold behavior to be observed a minimum system size is
required, what is very important when considering a possible experimental
realization. For the long-time evolution, we find that for short-range
correlated lattices a super-diffusive long-range transport is observed, while
for completely uncorrelated disorder in 2D transport becomes sub-diffusive
within the localization length and random binary pseudo-2D arrays show
localization.
