The observation that the $b \rightarrow s\gamma $ decay rate is close to the
Standard Model value implies a large mass for the charged-Higgs boson in the
Minimum Supersymmetric Standard Model, that nearly closes the $t \rightarrow b
H^+$ decay channel. For $m_t = 150$ GeV, the parameter region $m_A \ltap 130$
GeV is excluded; this largely pre-empts LEP II searches and also partially
excludes a region that would be inaccessible to MSSM Higgs boson searches both
at LEP II and at SSC/LHC.
