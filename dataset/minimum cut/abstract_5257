The measurement of charged-particle event shape variables is presented in
inclusive inelastic pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV using the
ATLAS detector at the LHC. The observables studied are the transverse thrust,
thrust minor and transverse sphericity, each defined using the final-state
charged particles' momentum components perpendicular to the beam direction.
Events with at least six charged particles are selected by a minimum-bias
trigger. In addition to the differential distributions, the evolution of each
event shape variable as a function of the leading charged particle transverse
momentum, charged particle multiplicity and summed transverse momentum is
presented. Predictions from several Monte Carlo models show significant
deviations from data.
