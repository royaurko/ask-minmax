We investigate dynamical systems with time-dependent mass and frequency, with
particular attention on models attaining the minimum value of uncertainty
formula. A criterium of minimum uncertainty is presented and illustrated by
means of explicit and exactly solved examples. The role of the Bogolubov
coefficients, in general and in the context of minimum uncertainty case, is
discussed.
