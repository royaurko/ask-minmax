We present evidence supporting a SNR origin for the radio source G337.2+0.1,
which was discovered along the line of sight to the Norma spiral arm in the
MOST 843-MHz radio survey. The radio source is spatially superposed to the
unidentified ASCA source AX J1635.9-4719. An analysis of this latter source
reveals that its X-ray spectrum, extended nature, and non-variable flux are
consistent with what is expected for a SNR. In addition, we have used HI-line
observations of the region to look for any effect of the presumed remnant on
the ISM. We have found a well-defined minimum centered at the position of the
radio source in the velocity range of ~ -25 to -19 km/s. This feature appears
as a sharp absorption dip in the spectrum that might be produced when the
continuum emission from the SNR candidate is absorbed by foreground gas. Hence
we have used it to constrain the distance to the source, which seems to be a
young (age ~ a few 10^3 yr) and distant (d ~ 14 kpc) SNR. G337.2+0.1 and AX
J1635.9-4719 would be the radio/X-ray manifestations of this remnant.
