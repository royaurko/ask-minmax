We report the observation by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory of a
spectacular flare of radio source PKS 1622-297. A peak flux of 17E-6 cm^-2 s^-1
(E > 100 MeV) was observed. The corresponding isotropic luminosity is 2.9E49
erg/s. We find that PKS 1622-297 exhibits gamma-ray intra-day variability. A
flux increase by a factor of at least 3.6 was observed to occur in less than
7.1 hours (with 99% confidence). Assuming an exponential rise, the
corresponding doubling time is less than 3.8 hours. A significant flux decrease
by a factor of ~2 in 9.7 hours was also observed. Without beaming, the rapid
flux change and large isotropic luminosity are inconsistent with the
Elliot-Shapiro condition (assuming that gas accretion is the immediate source
of power for the gamma-rays). This inconsistency suggests that the gamma-ray
emission is beamed. A minimum Doppler factor of 8.1 is implied by the observed
lack of pair-production opacity (assuming x-rays are emitted co-spatially with
the gamma-rays). Simultaneous observation by EGRET and OSSE finds a spectrum
adequately fit by a power law with photon index of -1.9. Although the
significance is not sufficient to establish this beyond doubt, the high-energy
gamma-ray spectrum appears to evolve from hard to soft as a flare progresses.
