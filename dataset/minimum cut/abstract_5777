We present a compact and robust transportable ultra-stable laser system with
minimum fractional frequency instability of $1\times10^{-15}$ at integration
times between 1 to 10 s. The system was conceived as a prototype of a subsystem
of a microwave-optical local oscillator to be used on the satellite mission
STE-QUEST (Space-Time Explorer and QUantum Equivalence Principle Space Test,
http://sci.esa.int/ste-quest/). It was therefore designed to be compact, to
sustain accelerations occurring during rocket launch, to exhibit low vibration
sensitivity, and to reach a low frequency instability. Overall dimensions of
the optical system are $40\textrm{ cm}\times20\textrm{ cm}\times30\textrm{
cm}$. The acceleration sensitivities of the optical frequency in the three
directions were measured to be $1.7\times10^{-11}/g$, $8.0\times10^{-11}/g$,
and $3.9\times10^{-10}/g$, and the absolute frequency instability was
determined via a three-cornered hat measurement. The design is also appropriate
and useful for terrestrial applications.
