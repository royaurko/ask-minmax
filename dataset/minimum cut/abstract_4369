The holographic indeterminacy resulting from the quantization of spacetime
leads to an inherent uncertainty (lpL)1/2 in the relative positions of two
events, separated by a distance L, in a direction transverse to a null ray
connecting the events, where lP is the Planck length. The new indeterminacy
principle leads to a critical condition in which the holographic uncertainty in
the relative transverse positions of two diametrically opposed particles on the
surface a body becomes greater than the average distance between particles in
the body. The Chandrasekhar mass and the characteristic nuclear density emerge
as the minimum mass and density of a baryonic body that could meet the critical
criteria. Neutron stars are therefore identified as a class of bodies in which
holographic indeterminacy may have physical consequences.
