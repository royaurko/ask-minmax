In this web note, we reply to a recent paper, gr-qc/0404126, confirming a
previous work of ours in which a cosmological bouncing phase was shown to have
the ability of modifying the spectrum of primordial perturbations (PRD 68,
103517 2003), but challenging its physical conditions of validity. Explicitly,
Ref. gr-qc/0404126, besides pretending our Taylor series expansion of the scale
factor close to the bounce amounts to choosing a family of polynomial scale
factors, also claims that the bounce affects the spectrum only if the mass
scale of the scalar field driving the dynamics is of the order of the Planck
mass. We show that these objections are either misleading or incorrect since
the minimum size of the Universe a_0 (value of the scale factor at the bounce)
is either not physically specified, as required in a closed Universe, or
implicitly assumed to be the Planck mass. We calculate this mass and obtain
that, unsurprisingly, for a reasonable value of a_0, i.e. much larger than the
Planck length, the scalar field mass is smaller than the Planck mass.
