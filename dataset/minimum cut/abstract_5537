In view of the LHC upgrade for the High Luminosity Phase (HL-LHC), the ATLAS
experiment is planning to replace the Inner Detector with an all-Silicon
system. The n-in-p bulk technology represents a valid solution for the modules
of most of the layers, given the significant radiation hardness of this option
and the reduced cost. The large area necessary to instrument the outer layers
will demand to tile the sensors, a solution for which the inefficient region at
the border of each sensor needs to be reduced to the minimum size. This paper
reports on a joint R&D project by the ATLAS LPNHE Paris group and FBK Trento on
a novel n-in-p edgeless planar pixel design, based on the deep-trench process
available at FTK.
