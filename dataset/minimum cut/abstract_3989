We study the arithmetic codings of hyperbolic automorphisms of the 2-torus,
i.e. the continuous mappings acting from a certain symbolic space of sequences
with a finite alphabet endowed with an appropriate structure of additive group
onto the torus which preserve this structure and turn the two-sided shift into
a given automorphism of the torus. This group is uniquely defined by an
automorphism, and such an arithmetic coding is a homomorphism of that group
onto the 2-torus. The necessary and sufficient condition of the existence of a
bijective arithmetic coding is obtained; it is formulated in terms of a certain
binary quadratic form constructed by means of a given automorphism.
Furthermore, we describe all bijective arithmetic codings in terms the
Dirichlet group of the corresponding quadratic field. The minimum of that
quadratic form over the nonzero elements of the lattice coincides with the
minimal possible order of the kernel of a homomorphism described above.
