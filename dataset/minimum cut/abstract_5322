TileCal is the hadronic calorimeter covering the most central region of the
ATLAS experiment at the LHC. This sampling calorimeter uses iron plates as
absorber and plastic scintillating tiles as the active material. A
multi-faceted calibration system allows to monitor and equalize the calorimeter
response at each stage of the signal production, from scintillation light to
digitization. This calibration system is based on signal generation from
different sources: a Cs radioactive source, laser light, charge injection and
minimum bias events produced in proton-proton collisions. A brief description
of the different TileCal calibration systems is given and the latest results on
their performance in terms of calibration factors, linearity and stability are
presented.
