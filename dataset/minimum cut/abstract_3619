We theoretically investigate under what conditions the director field in a
spindle-shaped nematic droplet or tactoid obtains a twisted, parity-broken
structure. By minimizing the sum of the bulk elastic and surface energies, we
show that a twisted director field is stable if the twist and bend elastic
constants are small enough compared to the splay elastic constant, but only if
the droplet volume is larger than some minimum value. We furthermore show that
the transition from an untwisted to a twisted director-field structure is a
sharp function of the various control parameters. We predict that suspensions
of rigid, rod-like particles cannot support droplets with a parity broken
structure, whereas they could possibly occur in those of semi-flexible,
worm-like particles.
