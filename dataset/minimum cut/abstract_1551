We outline a new method for estimating the cosmic infrared background using
the spatial and spectral correlation properties of infrared maps. The cosmic
infrared background from galaxies should have a minimum fluctuation of the
order of 10\% on angular scales of the order of 1\deg. We show that a linear
combination of maps at different wavelengths can greatly reduce the
fluctuations produced by foreground stars, while not eliminating the
fluctuations of the background from high redshift galaxies. The method is
potentially very powerful, especially at wavelengths where the foreground is
bright but smooth.
