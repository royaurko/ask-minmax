The CALICE collaboration has constructed a highly granular hadronic
calorimeter based on small scintillator tiles read out with silicon
photomultipliers. With this detector, data was taken at CERN and at Fermilab.
The high granularity of the detector allows the identification of
minimum-ionizing track segments within hadronic showers, demonstrating the
imaging capabilities of particle flow calorimeters. These tracks can be used
for the cell-by-cell calibration of such a calorimeter. The possibility to
calibrate a complete ILC calorimeter with such track segments in the absence of
muons is also investigated.
