This paper considers the Linear Minimum Variance recursive state estimation
for the linear discrete time dynamic system with random state transition and
measurement matrices, i.e., random parameter matrices Kalman filtering. It is
shown that such system can be converted to a linear dynamic system with
deterministic parameter matrices but state-dependent process and measurement
noises. It is proved that under mild conditions, the recursive state estimation
of this system is still of the form of a modified Kalman filtering. More
importantly, this result can be applied to Kalman filtering with intermittent
and partial observations as well as randomly variant dynamic systems.
