We develop a statistical model for a confined chain molecule based on a
monomer grand canonical ensemble. The molecule is subject to an external
chemical potential, a backbone interaction, and an attractive interaction
between all monomers. Using a Gaussian variable formalism and a mean field
approximation, we analytically derive a minimum principle from which we can
obtain relevant physical quantities, such as the monomer density, and we
explore the limit in which the chain is subject to a tight confinement. Through
a numerical implementation of the minimization process we show how we can
obtain density profiles in three dimensions for arbitraty potentials, and we
test the limits of validity of the theory.
