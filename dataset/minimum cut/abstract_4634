We present new precision radial velocities and a three-planet Keplerian orbit
fit for the V = 8.5, G5 V star HIP 14810. We began observing this star at Keck
Observatory as part of the N2K Planet Search Project. Wright et al. (2007)
announced the inner two planets to this system, and subsequent observations
have revealed the outer planet planet and the proper orbital solution for the
middle planet. The planets have minimum masses of 3.9, 1.3, and 0.6 M_Jup and
orbital periods of 6.67, 147.7, and 952 d, respectively. We have numerically
integrated the family of orbital solutions consistent with the data and find
that they are stable for at least 10^6 yr. Our photometric search shows that
the inner planet does not transit.
