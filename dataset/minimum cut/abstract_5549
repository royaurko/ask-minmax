At least two different notions have been published under the name "majority
domination in graphs": Majority dominating functions and majority dominating
sets. In this work we extend the former concept to digraphs. Given a digraph
$D=(V,A),$ a function $f : V \rightarrow \{-1,1\}$ such that $f(N^+[v])\geq1$
for at least half of the vertices $v$ in $V$ is a majority out-dominating
function (MODF) of $D.$ The weight of a MODF $f$ is $w(f)=\sum\limits_{v\in
V}f(v),$ and the minimum weight of a MODF in $D$ is the majority out-domination
number of $D,$ denoted $\gamma^+_{maj}(D).$ In this work we introduce these
concepts and prove some results regarding them, among which the fact that the
decision problem of finding a majority out-dominating function of a given
weight is NP-complete.
