The purpose of this work is to establish a counterpart for the Navier-Stokes
equation of Brenier's generalized flows for the Euler equation. We introduce a
class of semi-martingales on a compact Riemannian manifold which will be
generalized solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation. We prove that these
semimartingales are critical points to the corresponding kinetic energy and
that classical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation realize the minimum of
the kinetic energy in a suitable class.
