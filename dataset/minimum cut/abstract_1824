The article contains general formulas for the production of J=3/2 resonances
by neutrinos and antineutrinos. It specializes to the P_{33}(1232) resonance
whose form factors are determined by theory and experiment and then are
compared with experimental results at low and high energies. It is shown that
the minimum in the low Q^2 region is a consequence of a combined effect from
the vanishing of the vector form factors, the muon mass and Pauli blocking.
Several improvements for the future investigations are suggested.
