We find de Sitter and flat space solutions with all moduli stabilized in four
dimensional supergravity theories derived from the heterotic and type II string
theories, and explain how all the previously known obstacles to finding such
solutions can be removed. Further, we argue that if the compact manifold allows
a large enough space of discrete topological choices then it is possible to
tune the parameters of the four dimensional supergravity such that a hierarchy
is created and the solutions lie in the outer region of moduli space in which
the compact volume is large in string units, the string coupling is weak, and
string perturbation theory is valid. We show that at least two light chiral
superfields are required for this scenario to work, however, one field is
sufficient to obtain a minimum with an acceptably small and negative
cosmological constant. We discuss cosmological issues of the scenario and the
possible role of anthropic considerations in choosing the vacuum of the theory.
We conclude that the most likely stable vacuua are in or near the central
region of moduli space where string perturbation theory is not strictly valid,
and that anthropic considerations cannot help much in choosing a vacuum.
