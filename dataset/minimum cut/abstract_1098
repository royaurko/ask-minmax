The deformation barriers standing in the quasi-molecular shape path have been
determined in the actinide region within a macroscopic-microscopic energy
derived from a generalized liquid drop model, the algebraic droplet model shell
corrections and analytic expressions for the pairing energies. Double and
triple-humped fission barriers appear. The second barrier corresponds to the
transition from one-body shapes to two touching ellipsoids. The third minimum
and third peak, when they exist, come from shell rearrangements in the deformed
fragment. The shape of the other almost magic one is close to the sphere. The
barrier heights agreewith the experimental results, the energy of the second
minimum being a little too high. The predicted half-lives follow the
experimental data trend.
