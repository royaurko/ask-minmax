At the LHC Multiple Parton Interactions will represent an important feature
of the minimum bias and of the underlying event and will give important
contributions in many channels of interest for the search of new physics.
Different numbers of multiple collision may contribute to the production of a
given final state and one should expect important interference effects in the
regime where different contributions have similar rates. We show, on the
contrary, that, once multiple parton interactions are identified by their
different topologies, terms with different numbers of multiple parton
interactions do not interfere in the final cross section.
