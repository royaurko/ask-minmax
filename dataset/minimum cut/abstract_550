X-ray observations indicate that non-gravitational processes play a key role
in determining the distribution of the diffuse, X-ray emitting gas in clusters
of galaxies (ICM). The effect of non-gravitational processes is imprinted in
the ICM as an entropy minimum. Preheating models assume that the entropy
minimum is present in the cosmic baryons well before collapse. On the other
hand, observations of baryons in Ly_alpha clouds show only a modest extra
heating, ruling out the presence of such an entropy plateau in the majority of
low-density baryons at high z. The problem is avoided in the internal heating
scenario, where the heating occurs only inside virialized structures. However,
for internal heating the energy needed to build the entropy minimum is in
excess of 1 keV per particle. It is not clear which kind of source can heat the
baryons: SNae seem to be inefficient by a factor of 3 or more. This energy
crisis must be solved by other sources (like AGNs), unless we are missing some
key aspect of the heating mechanism. The main questions for the next years will
be: when and where is the excess entropy produced, and by which mechanism?
