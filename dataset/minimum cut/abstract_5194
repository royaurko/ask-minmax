The spectrum of possible parameters of symmetric configurations is
investigated. We both survey known constructions and results, and propose some
new construction methods. Many new parameters are obtained, in particular for
cyclic symmetric configurations, which are equivalent to deficient cyclic
difference sets. Both Golomb rulers and modular Golomb rulers are a key tool in
our investigation. Several new upper bounds on the minimum integer E(k) such
that for each v >= E(k) there exists a symmetric configuration v_{k} are
obtained. Upper bounds of the same type are provided for cyclic symmetric
configurations. From the standpoint of applications, it should be noted that
our results extend the range of possible parameters of LDPC codes, generalized
LDPC codes, and quasi-cyclic LDPC codes.
