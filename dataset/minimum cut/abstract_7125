ArDM-1t is the prototype for a next generation WIMP detector measuring both
the scintillation light and the ionization charge from nuclear recoils in a
1-ton liquid argon target. The goal is to reach a minimum recoil energy of
30\,keVr to detect recoiling nuclei. In this paper we describe the experimental
concept and present results on the light detection system, tested for the first
time in ArDM on the surface at CERN. With a preliminary and incomplete set of
PMTs, the light yield at zero electric field is found to be between 0.3-0.5
phe/keVee depending on the position within the detector volume, confirming our
expectations based on smaller detector setups.
