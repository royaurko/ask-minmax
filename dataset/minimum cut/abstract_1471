A graph G is r-Ramsey for a graph H, denoted by G\rightarrow (H)_r, if every
r-colouring of the edges of G contains a monochromatic copy of H. The graph G
is called r-Ramsey-minimal for H if it is r-Ramsey for H but no proper subgraph
of G possesses this property. Let s_r(H) denote the smallest minimum degree of
G over all graphs G that are r-Ramsey-minimal for H. The study of the parameter
s_2 was initiated by Burr, Erd\H{o}s, and Lov\'{a}sz in 1976 when they showed
that for the clique s_2(K_k)=(k-1)^2. In this paper, we study the dependency of
s_r(K_k) on r and show that, under the condition that k is constant, s_r(K_k) =
r^2 polylog r. We also give an upper bound on s_r(K_k) which is polynomial in
both r and k, and we determine s_r(K_3) up to a factor of log r.
