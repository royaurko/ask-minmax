We study the use of very sparse random projections for compressed sensing
(sparse signal recovery) when the signal entries can be either positive or
negative. In our setting, the entries of a Gaussian design matrix are randomly
sparsified so that only a very small fraction of the entries are nonzero. Our
proposed decoding algorithm is simple and efficient in that the major cost is
one linear scan of the coordinates. We have developed two estimators: (i) the
{\em tie estimator}, and (ii) the {\em absolute minimum estimator}. Using only
the tie estimator, we are able to recover a $K$-sparse signal of length $N$
using $1.551 eK \log K/\delta$ measurements (where $\delta\leq 0.05$ is the
confidence). Using only the absolute minimum estimator, we can detect the
support of the signal using $eK\log N/\delta$ measurements. For a particular
coordinate, the absolute minimum estimator requires fewer measurements (i.e.,
with a constant $e$ instead of $1.551e$). Thus, the two estimators can be
combined to form an even more practical decoding framework.
  Prior studies have shown that existing one-scan (or roughly one-scan)
recovery algorithms using sparse matrices would require substantially more
(e.g., one order of magnitude) measurements than L1 decoding by linear
programming, when the nonzero entries of signals can be either negative or
positive. In this paper, following a known experimental setup, we show that, at
the same number of measurements, the recovery accuracies of our proposed method
are (at least) similar to the standard L1 decoding.
