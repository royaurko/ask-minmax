We first apply the WT-MFDFA, MFDFA, and WTMM multifractal methods to binomial
multifractal time series of three different binomial parameters and find that
the WTMM method indicates an enhanced difference between the fractal components
than the known theoretical result. Next, we make use of the same methods for
the time series of the row sum signals of the two complementary ECA pairs of
rules (90,165) and (150,105) for ten initial conditions going from a single 1
in the central position up to a set of ten 1's covering the ten central
positions in the first row. Since the members of the pairs are actually similar
from the statistical point of view, we can check which method is the most
stable numerically by recording the differences provided by the methods between
the two members of the pairs for various important quantities of the scaling
analyses, such as the multifractal support, the most frequent Holder exponent,
and the Hurst exponent and considering as the better one the method that
provides the minimum differences. According to this criterion, our results show
that the MFDFA performs better than WT-MFDFA and WTMM in the case of the
multifractal support, while for the other two scaling parameters the WT-MFDFA
is the best. The employed set of initial conditions does not generate any
specific trend in the values of the multifractal parameters
