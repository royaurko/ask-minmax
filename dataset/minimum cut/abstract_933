In this paper, locally repairable codes with all-symbol locality are studied.
Methods to modify already existing codes are presented. Also, it is shown that
with high probability, a random matrix with a few extra columns guaranteeing
the locality property, is a generator matrix for a locally repairable code with
a good minimum distance. The proof of this gives also a constructive method to
find locally repairable codes.
