The spatial distribution and the population nature of subdwarf B type stars
in the galaxy is investigated based on the kinematics of these stars. The
orbits of 41 stars have been calculated using a galactic mass model. These are
well behaved and 10 stars reach to |z| > 2 kpc. Many orbits are very eccentric,
reaching in to just 2 kpc from the galactic centre, or veering out to beyond 20
kpc. None of the stars can be identified uniquely as classical Population II
objects. The average eccentricity ECC of the orbits of our sample is 0.24, the
average normalised z-extent NZE of the orbits is 0.16, and the asymmetric drift
of our sample is -36 km s^-1. The distribution in z shows a relative minimum
near z=0 pc and has maxima near z=300 pc. This reflects the smaller probability
to find the stars IN the disk than away from the disk.
