This paper considers a dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying system
where the relay is equipped with multiple antennas, while the source and the
destination are equipped with a single antenna. Assuming that the relay is
subjected to co-channel interference (CCI) and additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) while the destination is corrupted by AWGN only, we propose three
heuristic relay precoding schemes to combat the CCI, namely, 1) Maximum ratio
combining/maximal ratio transmission (MRC/MRT), 2) Zero-forcing/MRT (ZF/MRT),
3) Minimum mean-square error/MRT (MMSE/MRT). We derive new exact outage
expressions as well as simple high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage
approximations for all three schemes. Our findings suggest that both the
MRC/MRT and the MMSE/MRT schemes achieve a full diversity of N, while the
ZF/MRT scheme achieves a diversity order of N-M, where N is the number of relay
antennas and M is the number of interferers. In addition, we show that the
MMSE/MRT scheme always achieves the best outage performance, and the ZF/MRT
scheme outperforms the MRC/MRT scheme in the low SNR regime, while becomes
inferior to the MRC/MRT scheme in the high SNR regime. Finally, in the large N
regime, we show that both the ZF/MRT and MMSE/MRT schemes are capable of
completely eliminating the CCI, while perfect interference cancelation is not
possible with the MRC/MRT scheme.
