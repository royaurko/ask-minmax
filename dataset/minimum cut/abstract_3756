The PHENIX experiment at RHIC measured the omega-meson production in the
range of pT from 2.5 GeV/c to 9.5 GeV/c in p+p and d+Au collision systems at
sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV. We present the consistent results of two independent
measurements in decay channels omega-->pi^{0}pi^{+}pi^{-}$ and
omega-->pi^{0}gamma. The omega/pi^{0} ratio was found to be 0.90+/-0.06. The
Nuclear Modification Factor R_{dA} is 1.3+/-0.2 both in the Minimum Biased and
(0%-20%) central event samples. The mass of the omega-meson was measured to be
consistent with the PDG value within the errors of the measurement. We also
measured the K_{S}^{0}-meson production in K_{S}^{0}-->pi^{0}pi^{0} in the same
collision systems.
