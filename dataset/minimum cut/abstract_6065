We utilise the method of Wiener reconstruction with spherical harmonics and
Bessel functions to recover the density and velocity fields from the IRAS 1.2Jy
redshift survey. The results are robust to changes in prior parameters and the
number of expansion coefficients. Maps of these fields are presented in a
variety of projections. Many known structures are observed, including clear
confirmations of the clusters N1600 and A3627. The Perseus-Pisces supercluster
appears to extend out to roughly 9000km/s, and the reconstruction shows
`backside infall' to the Centaurus/Great Attractor region. A qualitative
comparison of the reconstructed IRAS gravity field with that from Tully-Fisher
peculiar velocity measurements (Mark III) shows reasonable agreement. The
Wiener reconstruction of the density field is also the optimal reconstruction
(in the minimum variance sense) of any quantity which is linear in the density
contrast. We show reconstructions of three such quantities. The misalignment
angle between the IRAS and CMB Local Group dipoles is only 13 degrees out to
5000km/s, but increases to 25 degrees out to 20,000km/s. The reconstructed IRAS
bulk flow out to 5000km/s is roughly 300km/s, which agrees in amplitude with
that derived from the Mark III peculiar velocities (370km/s). However, the two
bulk flow vectors deviate by 70 degrees. Finally, moment of inertia analysis
shows that the Wiener reconstructed Supergalactic Plane is aligned within 30
degrees of that defined by de Vaucouleurs.
