The Web initially emerged as an "antidote" to accumulated scientific
knowledge since it enables global representation and communication with minimum
costs. Its gigantic scale and interdependence incommode our ability to find
relevant information and develop trustworthy contexts. It is time for science
to compensate by providing an epistemological "antidote" to Web issues.
Philosophy should be in the front line by forming the salient questions and
analysis. The scope of our research is to provide a theory about the Web being
that will bridge philosophical thinking and engineering. We analyze existence
and spatiotemporality in the Web and how it transforms the traditional
actualities. The Web space is specified by incoming and outgoing links. The
primordial role of visiting durations in Web's existence is approximated by
Bergsonian time. The physical space becomes more discoverable. The human
activity can be asynchronous, synchronous and continuous. Networked individuals
operate in a flexible and spatially dispersed environment. The resulting issues
concern the self-determination of a being and the way in which the Web could be
a free and open platform for innovation and participation.
