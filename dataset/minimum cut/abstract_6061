We have examined consequences of strong tidal encounters between a neutron
star and a normal star using SPH as a possible formation mechanism of isolated
recycled pulsars in globular clusters. We have made a number of SPH simulations
for close encounters between a main-sequence star of mass ranging from 0.2 to
0.7 Solar masses represented by an n=3/2 polytrope and a neutron star
represented by a point mass. The outcomes of the first encounters are found to
be dependent only on the dimensionless parameter eta' = (m/(m+M))^(1/2)
(r_min/R_MS)^(3/2) (m/M)^(1/6), where m and M are the masses of the
main-sequence star and the neutron star, respectively, r_min the minimum
separation between two stars, and R_MS the size of the main-sequence star. The
material from the (at least partially) disrupted star forms a disk around the
neutron star. If all material in the disk is to be acctreted onto the neutron
star's surface, the mass of the disk is enough to spin up the neutron star to
spin period of 1 ms.
