Following my previous proposal that two-particle correlation functions can be
used to resolve the minijet contribution to particle production in minimum
biased events of high energy hadronic interactions, I study the $p_T$ and
energy dependence of the correlation. Using HIJING Monte Carlo model, it is
found that the correlation $c(\phi_1,\phi_2)$ in azimuthal angle $\phi$ between
two particles with $p_T>p_T^{cut}$ resembles much like two back-to-back jets as
$p_T^{cut}$ increases at high colliding energies due to minijet production. It
is shown that $c(0,0)-c(0,\pi)$, which is related to the relative fraction of
particles from minijets, increases with energy. The background of the
correlation for fixed $p_T^{cut}$ also grows with energy due to the increase of
multiple minijet production. Application of this analysis to the study of jet
quenching in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is also discussed.
