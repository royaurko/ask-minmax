We present time resolved photometry of the cataclysmic variable SDSS
J081610.84+453010.2 and have established for the first time that it is an
eclipsing dwarf nova. We observed an outburst of the system which lasted about
11 days and had an amplitude of 3.4 magnitudes above mean quiescence. From an
analysis of the eclipse times of minimum during the outburst, we determined the
orbital period as Porb = 0.2096(4) d or 5.030(10) h. The orbital period places
it above the period gap in the distribution of orbital periods of dwarf novae.
The eclipses are of short duration (average FWHM = 10.7 min or 0.036 of the
orbital period) and shallow (average 0.4 mag during outburst and 0.6 magnitude
in quiescence), suggesting a grazing eclipse.
