In general, minimum-bias triggers planned for experiments at the LHC miss a
considerable fraction of the total number of events. We exemplify the rejection
rate using the Durham model of soft high-energy interactions to obtain
quantitative estimates of the signals arising from the ATLAS scintillation
counters positioned in the rapidity intervals 2<|eta|<4, and also from TOTEM
detectors covering the intervals 3.1<|eta|<6.5. Typically we find that the
expected signal is about half of the total cross section, sigma(tot). We also
calculate the cross section for the so-called zero-bias measurement planned by
CMS in the extended rapidity interval -5<eta<7. We emphasize that only models
which give satisfactory predictions for the measured minimum-bias or zero-bias
cross sections can be used to obtain the value of the total inelastic cross
section.
