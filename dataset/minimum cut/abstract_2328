We explore the importance of meridional circulation variations in modelling
the irregularities of the solar cycle by using the flux transport dynamo model.
We show that a fluctuating meridional circulation can reproduce some features
of the solar cycle like the Waldmeier effect and the grand minimum. However, we
get all these results only if the value of the turbulent diffusivity in the
convection zone is reasonably high.
