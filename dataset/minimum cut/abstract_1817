Chiral meson masses at the critical point is investigated using QCD in the
improved ladder approximation. We calculate the effective potential at finite
temperature $T$ and quark chemical potential $\mu$ and find the critical point
at $T \simeq 95$ MeV, $\mu \simeq 290$ MeV. The chiral meson masses are
determined from the second derivative of the effective potential at its
minimum. We find that the sigma goes to massless at the critical point while
pion remains massive. Our results are consistent with that of the linear sigma
model in contrast to the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model.
