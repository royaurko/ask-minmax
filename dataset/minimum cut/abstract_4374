In this paper we present a selfcontained analysis and description of the
novel {\it ab initio} folding algorithm {\sf cross}, which generates the
minimum free energy (mfe), 3-noncrossing, $\sigma$-canonical RNA structure.
Here an RNA structure is 3-noncrossing if it does not contain more than three
mutually crossing arcs and $\sigma$-canonical, if each of its stacks has size
greater or equal than $\sigma$. Our notion of mfe-structure is based on a
specific concept of pseudoknots and respective loop-based energy parameters.
The algorithm decomposes into three parts: the first is the inductive
construction of motifs and shadows, the second is the generation of the
skeleta-trees rooted in irreducible shadows and the third is the saturation of
skeleta via context dependent dynamic programming routines.
