Some critical remarks are made regarding a series of works by V.K. Mukhomorov
dealing with polarons and oscillatory and rotational spectrum of a large-radius
bipolaron near a subsidiary minimum corresponding to its two-center
configuration. It is shown that V.K. Mukhomorov's conclusion that by varying
the bipolaron functional one should look for a constrained rather than absolute
minimum is erroneous. Consideration of interelectronic correlations
corresponding to a direct dependence of the wave function of the studied system
on the distance between the electrons does not break the virial theorem. In the
strong coupling limit the virial theorem holds true for both one-center and
two-center bipolaron states, the latter representing a subsidiary minimum which
arises due to a choice of an insufficiently versatile variation function.
