The solar astrolabe at Observatorio Nacional has been doing a series of solar
semidiameter measurements, extending from 1998 up to 2009, to a total of 21640
observations of the Sun. Using the data series it was established the solar
radius variation along that period, as well as determining results about the
change of the solar ellipticity.
  To the work in perspective, the measurements of the solar radius in the past
four centuries are reviewed, followed by a more detailed account of the
contemporaneous measurements.
  The deviations of the observed values from the true values caused by
observational and instrumental effects are studied and the strategies used to
derive the corresponding corrections are shown. The relationships linking the
variation of the semidiameter and the relevant indexes of the solar activity
are analyzed.
  Finally, the time series from Observatorio Nacional was enchained to all the
other similar astrolabe series, from which the data were graciously confided to
this work. Using such much longer combined data set it was established the long
term behavior of the solar semidiameter along the last three solar cycles. The
outcome is a strong correlation to the long period features of the solar
activity described by the annual mean of sunspots count. Putting together the
long term semidiameter variation and other solar evidences we point out the
near approach of a deep minimum of sunspots.
