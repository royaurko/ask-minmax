From the many-body T-matrix the condition for a medium-dependent bound state
and its binding energy is derived for a homogeneous interacting Bose gas. This
condition provides the critical line in the phase diagram in terms of the
medium-dependent scattering length. Separating the Bose pole from the
distribution function the influence of a Bose condensate is discussed and a
thermal minimum of the critical scattering length is found.
