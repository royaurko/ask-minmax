We investigate properties of a channel coding scheme leading to the
minimum-possible frame error ratio when transmitting over a memoryless channel
with rate R>C. The results are compared to the well-known properties of a
channel coding scheme leading to minimum bit error ratio. It is concluded that
these two optimization requests are contradicting. A valuable application of
the derived results is presented.
