The formation of nano-hillocks on CaF2 crystal surfaces by individual ion
impact has been studied using medium energy (3 and 5 MeV) highly charged ions
(Xe19+ to Xe30+) as well as swift (kinetic energies between 12 and 58 MeV)
heavy ions. For very slow highly charged ions the appearance of hillocks is
known to be linked to a threshold in potential energy while for swift heavy
ions a minimum electronic energy loss is necessary. With our results we bridge
the gap between these two extreme cases and demonstrate, that with increasing
energy deposition via electronic energy loss the potential energy threshold for
hillock production can be substantially lowered. Surprisingly, both mechanisms
of energy deposition in the target surface seem to contribute in an additive
way, as demonstrated when plotting the results in a phase diagram. We show that
the inelastic thermal spike model, originally developed to describe such
material modifications for swift heavy ions, can be extended to case where
kinetic and potential energies are deposited into the surface.
