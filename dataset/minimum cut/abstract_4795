A set $D \subseteq V(G)$ is a \emph{dominating set} of $G$ if every vertex
not in $D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. A dominating set of $G$
of minimum cardinality is called a $\gamma(G)$-set. For each vertex $v \in
V(G)$, we define the \emph{domination value} of $v$ to be the number of
$\gamma(G)$-sets to which $v$ belongs. In this paper, we study some basic
properties of the domination value function, thus initiating \emph{a local
study of domination} in graphs. Further, we characterize domination value for
the Petersen graph, complete $n$-partite graphs, cycles, and paths.
