A growing number of people are changing the way they consume news, replacing
the traditional physical newspapers and magazines by their virtual online
versions or/and weblogs. The interactivity and immediacy present in online news
are changing the way news are being produced and exposed by media corporations.
News websites have to create effective strategies to catch people's attention
and attract their clicks. In this paper we investigate possible strategies used
by online news corporations in the design of their news headlines. We analyze
the content of 69,907 headlines produced by four major global media
corporations during a minimum of eight consecutive months in 2014. In order to
discover strategies that could be used to attract clicks, we extracted features
from the text of the news headlines related to the sentiment polarity of the
headline. We discovered that the sentiment of the headline is strongly related
to the popularity of the news and also with the dynamics of the posted comments
on that particular news.
