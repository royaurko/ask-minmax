A group in which every element commutes with its endomorphic images is called
an $E$-group. If $p$ is a prime number, a $p$-group $G$ which is an $E$-group
is called a $pE$-group. Every abelian group is obviously an $E$-group. We prove
that every 2-generator $E$-group is abelian and that all 3-generator $E$-groups
are nilpotent of class at most 2. It is also proved that every infinite
3-generator $E$-group is abelian. We conjecture that every finite 3-generator
$E$-group should be abelian. Moreover we show that the minimum order of a
non-abelian $pE$-group is $p^8$ for any odd prime number $p$ and this order is
$2^7$ for $p=2$. Some of these results are proved for a class wider than the
class of $E$-groups.
