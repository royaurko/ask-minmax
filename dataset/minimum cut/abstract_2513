In this article we study the existence and concentration behavior of bound
states for a nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a parameter
$\varepsilon>0$. Under some suitable conditions on the potential functions, we
prove that for $\varepsilon$ small the system has a positive solution that
concentrates at a point which is a global minimum of the minimax function
associated to the related autonomous problem.
