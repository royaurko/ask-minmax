The homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation of a Lennard-Jones liquid is
investigated using the umbrella sampling method. The free energy cost of
forming a nucleating droplet is determined as a function of the quench depth,
and the saddle point nature of the droplets is verified using an intervention
technique. The structure and symmetry of the nucleating droplets is found for a
range of temperatures. We find that for deep quenches the nucleating droplets
become more anisotropic and diffuse with no well defined core or surface. The
environment of the nucleating droplets form randomly stacked hexagonal planes.
This behavior is consistent with a spinodal nucleation interpretation. We also
find that the free energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation is a minimum
when the lattice spacing of the impurity equals the lattice spacing of the
equilibrium crystalline phase. If the lattice spacing of the impurity is
different, the crystal grows into the bulk instead of wetting the impurity.
