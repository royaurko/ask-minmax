We review the evidence for the argument that Rudolf Wolf's calibration of the
Sunspot Number is likely to be correct and that Max Waldmeier introduced an
upwards jump in the sunspot number in 1945. The combined effect of these
adjustments suggests that there has been no secular change in the sunspot
number since coming out of the Maunder Minimum ~1700.
