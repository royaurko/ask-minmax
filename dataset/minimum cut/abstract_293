We present and analyze quiescent UBVRI light curves of the classical
symbiotic binary YY Her. We show that the secondary minimum, which is clearly
visible only in the quiescent VRI light curves, is due to ellipsoidal
variability of the red giant component. Our simple light curve analysis, by
fitting of the Fourier cosine series, resulted in a self-consistent
phenomenological model of YY Her, in which the periodic changes can be
described by a combination of the ellipsoidal changes and a sinusoidal changes
of the nebular continuum and line emission.
