We study the statistics of the condition number
$\kappa=\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}/\lambda_{\mathrm{min}}$ (the ratio between
largest and smallest squared singular values) of $N\times M$ Gaussian random
matrices. Using a Coulomb fluid technique, we derive analytically and for large
$N$ the cumulative $\mathcal{P}[\kappa<x]$ and tail-cumulative
$\mathcal{P}[\kappa>x]$ distributions of $\kappa$. We find that these
distributions decay as $\mathcal{P}[\kappa<x]\approx\exp\left(-\beta N^2
\Phi_{-}(x)\right)$ and $\mathcal{P}[\kappa>x]\approx\exp\left(-\beta N
\Phi_{+}(x)\right)$, where $\beta$ is the Dyson index of the ensemble. The left
and right rate functions $\Phi_{\pm}(x)$ are independent of $\beta$ and
calculated exactly for any choice of the rectangularity parameter
$\alpha=M/N-1>0$. Interestingly, they show a weak non-analytic behavior at
their minimum $\langle\kappa\rangle$ (corresponding to the average condition
number), a direct consequence of a phase transition in the associated Coulomb
fluid problem. Matching the behavior of the rate functions around
$\langle\kappa\rangle$, we determine exactly the scale of typical fluctuations
$\sim\mathcal{O}(N^{-2/3})$ and the tails of the limiting distribution of
$\kappa$. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical
simulations.
