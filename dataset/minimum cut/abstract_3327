Micron size extrasolar dust particles have been convincingly detected by
satellites. Larger extrasolar meteoroids (5-35 microns) have most likely been
detected by ground based radar at Arecibo and New Zealand. We present estimates
of the minimum detectable particle sizes and collecting areas for both radar
systems. We show that particles larger than about 10 microns can propagate for
tens of parsecs through the interstellar medium, opening up the possibility
that ground based radar systems can detect AGB stars, young stellar objects
such as T Tauri stars, and debris disks around Vega-like stars. We provide
analytical and numerical estimates of the ejection velocity in the case of a
debris disk interacting with a Jupiter mass planet. We provide rough estimates
of the flux of large micrometeoroids from all three classes of sources. Current
radar systems are unlikely to detect significant numbers of meteors from debris
disks such as Beta Pictoris. However, we suggest improvements to radar systems
that should allow for the detection of multiple examples of all three classes.
