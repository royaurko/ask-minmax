Consider a bivariate Geometric random variable where the first component has
parameter $p_1$ and the second parameter $p_2$. It is not possible to make the
correlation between the marginals equal to -1. Here the properties of this
minimum correlation are studied both numerically and analytically. It is shown
that the minimum correlation can be computed exactly in time $O(p_1^{-1}
\ln(p_2^{-1}) + p_2^{-1} \ln(p_1^{-1}))$. The minimum correlation is shown to
be nonmonotonic in $p_1$ and $p_2$, moreover, the partial derivatives are not
continuous. For $p_1 = p_2$, these discontinuities are characterized completely
and shown to lie near (1- roots of 1/2). In addition, we construct analytical
bounds on the minimum correlation.
