We consider the chiral condensate in the baryonic dense medium using the
generalized Sakai-Sugimoto model. It is defined as the vacuum expectation value
of open Wilson line that is proposed to be calculated by use of the area of
world-sheet instanton. We evaluate it in confined as well as deconfined phase.
In both phases, the chiral condensate has a minimum as a function of baryon
density. In the deconfined phase, taking into account the chiral symmetry
restoration, we classify the behavior of chiral condensate into three types.
One can set the parameter of the theory such that the results, in low but
sufficiently higher density, is in agreement with the expectation from QCD.
