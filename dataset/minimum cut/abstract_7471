Synchrotron emission has recently been detected in the jet of a massive
protostar, providing further evidence that certain jet formation
characteristics for young stars are similar to those found for highly
relativistic jets from AGN. We present data at 325 and 610 MHz taken with the
GMRT of the young, low-mass star DG Tau, an analog of the Sun soon after its
birth. This is the first investigation of a low-mass YSO at at such low
frequencies. We detect emission with a synchrotron spectral index in the
proximity of the DG Tau jet and interpret this emission as a prominent bow
shock associated with this outflow. This result provides tentative evidence for
the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies due to the shock impact
of this otherwise very low-power jet against the ambient medium. We calculate
the equipartition magnetic field strength (0.11 mG) and particle energy
(4x10^40 erg), which are the minimum requirements to account for the
synchrotron emission of the DG Tau bow shock. These results suggest the
possibility of low energy cosmic rays being generated by young Sun-like stars.
