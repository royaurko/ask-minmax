The theoretical description of the correlations between observables in two
separated rapidity intervals in relativistic nuclear collisions is presented.
It is shown, that the event-by-event pt-pt correlation defined as the
correlation between event mean values of transverse momenta of all particles
emitted in two different rapidity intervals does not decrease to zero with the
increase of the number of strings in contrast with two particle pt-pt
correlation - the correlation between the transverse momenta of single
particles produced in these two rapidity windows.
  In the idealized case with the homogeneous string distribution in the
transverse plane in the framework of the cellular analog of string fusion model
(SFM) the asymptotic of pt-pt correlation coefficient is analytically
calculated and compared with the results of the Monte-Carlo (MC) calculations
fulfilled both in the framework of the original SFM and in the framework of its
cellular analog, which enables to control the MC algorithms.
  In the case with the realistic nucleon distribution density of colliding
nuclei the results of the MC calculations of the pt-pt correlation function for
minimum bias nuclear collisions at SPS, RHIC and LHC energies are presented and
analysed.
