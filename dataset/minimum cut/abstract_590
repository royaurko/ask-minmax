We call a CNF formula linear if any two clauses have at most one variable in
common. Let Linear k-SAT be the problem of deciding whether a given linear
k-CNF formula is satisfiable. Here, a k-CNF formula is a CNF formula in which
every clause has size exactly k. It was known that for k >= 3, Linear k-SAT is
NP-complete if and only if an unsatisfiable linear k-CNF formula exists, and
that they do exist for k >= 4. We prove that unsatisfiable linear k-CNF
formulas exist for every k. Let f(k) be the minimum number of clauses in an
unsatisfiable linear k-CNF formula. We show that f(k) is Omega(k2^k) and
O(4^k*k^4), i.e., minimum size unsatisfiable linear k-CNF formulas are
significantly larger than minimum size unsatisfiable k-CNF formulas. Finally,
we prove that, surprisingly, linear k-CNF formulas do not allow for a larger
fraction of clauses to be satisfied than general k-CNF formulas.
