We present a local density estimator based on first order statistics. To
estimate the density at a point, $x$, the original sample is divided into
subsets and the average minimum sample distance to $x$ over all such subsets is
used to define the density estimate at $x$. The tuning parameter is thus the
number of subsets instead of the typical bandwidth of kernel or histogram-based
density estimators. The proposed method is similar to nearest-neighbor density
estimators but it provides smoother estimates. We derive the asymptotic
distribution of this minimum sample distance statistic to study globally
optimal values for the number and size of the subsets. Simulations are used to
illustrate and compare the convergence properties of the estimator. The results
show that the method provides good estimates of a wide variety of densities
without changes of the tuning parameter, and that it offers competitive
convergence performance.
