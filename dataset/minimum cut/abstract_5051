Smart grid is a modified form of electrical grid where generation,
transmission, distribution and customers are not only connected electrically
but also through strong communication network with each other as well as with
market, operation and service provider. For achieving good communication link
among them, it is very necessary to find suitable protocol. In this paper, we
discuss different hardware techniques for power monitoring, power management
and remote power controlling at home and transmission side and also discuss the
suitability of Zigbee for required communication link. Zigbee has major role in
monitoring and direct load controlling for efficient power utilization. It
covers enough area needed for communication and it works on low data rate of
20Kbps to 250Kbps with minimum power consumption. This paper describes the user
friendly control home appliances, power on/off through the internet, PDA using
Graphical User Interface (GUI) and through GSM cellular mobile phone.
