Various strange and charmed hadrons were reconstructed with the ATLAS
detector in pp collisions at sqrt{s}=7 TeV. The data sample was collected in
March-May of 2010 using a minimum-bias trigger. The K^0_S and Lambda^0
kinematic distributions were studied using data corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 190 mub^{-1}. The Xi-+ and Omega-+ baryons were reconstructed in
their cascade decays in data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 250
mub^{-1}. The D*+-, D+- and D_s+- charmed mesons were reconstructed in the
range of transverse momentum pT(D^(*))>3.5 GeV and pseudorapidity
|eta(D^(*))|<2.1 in data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.4
nb^{-1}. The fitted mass values were found to be in agreement with their world
averages while the observed invariant mass resolutions agree with Monte Carlo
expectations. This study confirms the high performance of the ATLAS detector
for precision tracking measurements.
