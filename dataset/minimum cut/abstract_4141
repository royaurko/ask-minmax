We consider a model that demonstrates the crucial role of inertia and
stickiness in multi-agent systems, based on the Minority Game (MG). The inertia
of an agent is introduced into the game model by allowing agents to apply
hypothesis testing when choosing their best strategies, thereby reducing their
reactivity towards changes in the environment. We find by extensive numerical
simulations that our game shows a remarkable improvement of global cooperation
throughout the whole phase space. In other words, the maladaptation behavior
due to over-reaction of agents is removed. These agents are also shown to be
advantageous over the standard ones, which are sometimes too sensitive to
attain a fair success rate. We also calculate analytically the minimum amount
of inertia needed to achieve the above improvement. Our calculation is
consistent with the numerical simulation results. Finally, we review some
related works in the field that show similar behaviors and compare them to our
work.
