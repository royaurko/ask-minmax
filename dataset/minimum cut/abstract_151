Binary switches are the basic element of modern digital computers. In this
paper we discuss the role of switching procedure with reference to the
fundamental limits in minimum energy dissipation. We show that the minimum
energy depends on the switching procedure and test this result with
micromagnetic simulations of a nanoscale switch realized with single
cylindrical element of permalloy (NiFe). Finally we establish a relation
between minimum energy and switching error probability.
