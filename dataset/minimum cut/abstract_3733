We discuss inflationary solutions of the coupled Einstein-Klein-Gordon
equations for a complex field in a five dimensional spacetime with a compact
$x^5$-dimension. As a new feature, the scalar field contains a dependence on
the extra dimension of the form $\exp(i m x^5) $, corresponding to Kaluza-Klein
excited modes. In a four dimensional picture, a nonzero $m$ implies the
presence of a new term in the scalar field potential. An interesting feature of
these solutions is the possible existence of several periods of oscillation of
the scalar field around the equilibrium value at the minimum of the potential.
These oscillations lead to cosmological periods of accelerated expansion of the
universe.
