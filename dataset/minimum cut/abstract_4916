Studies of forward processes are important tests of the standard model and
inputs for Monte Carlo tuning. A measurement of the energy flow in the forward
pseudorapidity region of CMS, $3.15 < \vert \eta \vert < 4.9$, is presented for
3 values of the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9 TeV, 2.36 TeV and 7 TeV.
The forward energy flow is measured for minimum bias events and for events with
a central dijet system the transverse energy of which provides a hard scale.
The energy flow is compared to various Monte Carlo models with different
multiparton interaction schemes. A study of forward jets in the pseudorapidity
range $3.2 < \vert \eta \vert < 4.7$ is presented for $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV.
