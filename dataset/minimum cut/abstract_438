Let G be an edge weighted undirected graph. For every pair of nodes consider
the shortest cycle containing these nodes in G. The cycle diameter of G is the
maximum length of a cycle in this set. Let H be a directed graph obtained by
directing the edges of G. The cycle diameter of H is similarly defined except
for that cycles are replaced by directed closed walks. Is there always an
orientation H of G whose cycle diameter is bounded by a constant times the
cycle diameter of G? We prove this property for planar graphs. These results
have implications on the problem of approximating an orientation with minimum
diameter
