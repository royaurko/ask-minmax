We studied previously the impact on light-element abundances of gravitinos
decaying during or after Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). We found regions of
the gravitino mass m_{3/2} and abundance zeta_{3/2} plane where its decays
could reconcile the calculated abundance of Li7 with observation without
perturbing the other light-element abundances unacceptably. Here we revisit
this issue in light of LHC measurements of the Higgs mass and constraints on
supersymmetric model parameters, as well as updates in the astrophysical
measurements of light-element abundances. In addition to the constrained
minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model with universal soft
supersymmetry-breaking masses at the GUT scale (the CMSSM) studied previously,
we also study models with universality imposed below the GUT scale and models
with non-universal Higgs masses (NUHM1). We calculate the total likelihood
function for the light-element abundances, taking into account the
observational uncertainties. We find that gravitino decays provide a robust
solution to the cosmological Li7 problem along strips in the (m_{3/2},
zeta_{3/2}) plane along which the abundances of deuterium, He4 and Li7 may be
fit with chi^2_min < 3, compared with chi^2 ~ 34 if the effects of gravitino
decays are unimportant. The minimum of the likelihood function is reduced to
chi^2 < 2 when the uncertainty on D/H is relaxed and < 1 when the lithium
abundance is taken from globular cluster data.
