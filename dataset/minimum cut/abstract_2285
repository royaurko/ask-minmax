In this note we consider a Landau Hamiltonian perturbed by a random magnetic
potential of Anderson type. For a given number of bands, we prove the existence
of both strongly localized states at the edges of the spectrum and dynamical
delocalization near the center of the bands in the sense that wave packets
travel at least at a given minimum speed. We provide explicit examples of
magnetic perturbations that split the Landau levels into full intervals of
spectrum.
