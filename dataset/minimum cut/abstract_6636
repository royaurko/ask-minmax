We investigate the exotic Peierls state in the one-dimensional organic
compound (EDO-TTF)_{2}X, wherein the Peierls transition is accompanied by the
bending of molecules and also by a fourfold periodic array of charge
disproportionation along the one-dimensional chain. Such a Peierls state,
wherein the interplay between the electron correlation and the electron-phonon
interaction takes an important role, is examined based on an extended
Peierls-Holstein-Hubbard model that includes the alternation of the elastic
energies for both the lattice distortion and the molecular deformation. The
model reproduces the experimentally observed pattern of the charge
disproportionation and there exists a metastable state wherein the energy takes
a local minimum with respect to the lattice distortion and/or molecular
deformation. Furthermore, we investigate the excited states for both the
Peierls ground state and the metastable state by considering the soliton
formation of electrons. It is shown that the soliton excitation from the
metastable state costs energy that is much smaller than that of the Peierls
state, where the former is followed only by the charge degree of freedom and
the latter is followed by that of spin and charge. Based on these results, we
discuss the exotic photoinduced phase found in (EDO-TTF)_{2}PF_{6}.
