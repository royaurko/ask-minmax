The present-day significance of Yang's quantized space-time algebra (YST) is
pointed out from the holographic viewpoint. One finds that the D-dimensional
YST and its modified version (MYST) have the background symmetry SO(D+1,1) and
SO(D,2), which are well known to underlie the dS/CFT and AdS/CFT
correspondences, respectively. This fact suggests a new possibility of dS/YST
and AdS/MYST in parallel with dS/CFT and AdS/CFT, respectively. The spatial
components of quantized space-time and momentum operators of YST have discrete
eigenvalues and their respective minimums, $a$ and 1/R, without contradiction
to Lorentz-covariance. With respect to MYST, the spatial components of
space-time operators and the time component (energy) of momentum operators have
discrete eigenvalues and their respective minimums, $a$ and 1/R, in contrast to
YST. This discrete structure of YST and MYST, which CFT lacks entirely, may
provide a theoretical ground for the unified regularization or cutoff of
ultraviolet and infrared divergences familiar in the UV/IR connection in the
holographic hypothesis.
