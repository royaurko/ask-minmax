Families of "asymptotically regular" LDPC block code ensembles can be formed
by terminating (J,K)-regular protograph-based LDPC convolutional codes. By
varying the termination length, we obtain a large selection of LDPC block code
ensembles with varying code rates and substantially better iterative decoding
thresholds than those of (J,K)-regular LDPC block code ensembles, despite the
fact that the terminated ensembles are almost regular. Also, by means of an
asymptotic weight enumerator analysis, we show that minimum distance grows
linearly with block length for all of the ensembles in these families, i.e.,
the ensembles are asymptotically good. We find that, as the termination length
increases, families of "asymptotically regular" codes with capacity approaching
iterative decoding thresholds and declining minimum distance growth rates are
obtained, allowing a code designer to trade-off between distance growth rate
and threshold. Further, we show that the thresholds and the distance growth
rates can be improved by carefully choosing the component protographs used in
the code construction.
