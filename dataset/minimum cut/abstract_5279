We propose a fast and efficient technique to create classes of highly
entangled states of trapped ions, such as arbitrary Dicke states and
superpositions of them, e.g. NOON states. The ions are initialized in the
phonon ground state and are addressed globally with a composite pulse that is
resonant with the first motional sideband. The technique operates on
comparatively short time scales, as resonant interactions allow one to use the
minimum laser pulse area. The number of single pulses from the composite
sequence is equal to the number of ions, thus the implementation complexity
grows only linearly with the size of the system. The approach does not require
individual addressing of the ions in the trap and can be applied both inside
and outside the Lamb-Dicke regime.
