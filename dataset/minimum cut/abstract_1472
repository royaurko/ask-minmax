The labeled stochastic block model is a random graph model representing
networks with community structure and interactions of multiple types. In its
simplest form, it consists of two communities of approximately equal size, and
the edges are drawn and labeled at random with probability depending on whether
their two endpoints belong to the same community or not.
  It has been conjectured in \cite{Heimlicher12} that correlated reconstruction
(i.e.\ identification of a partition correlated with the true partition into
the underlying communities) would be feasible if and only if a model parameter
exceeds a threshold. We prove one half of this conjecture, i.e., reconstruction
is impossible when below the threshold. In the positive direction, we introduce
a weighted graph to exploit the label information. With a suitable choice of
weight function, we show that when above the threshold by a specific constant,
reconstruction is achieved by (1) minimum bisection, (2) a semidefinite
relaxation of minimum bisection, and (3) a spectral method combined with
removal of edges incident to vertices of high degree. Furthermore, we show that
hypothesis testing between the labeled stochastic block model and the labeled
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph model exhibits a phase transition at the
conjectured reconstruction threshold.
