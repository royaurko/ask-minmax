We present the derivation of post-processing SNR for
Minimum-Mean-Squared-Error (MMSE) receivers with imperfect channel estimates,
and show that it is an accurate indicator of the error rate performance of MIMO
systems in the presence of channel estimation error. Simulation results show
the tightness of the analysis.
