No-Cloning and No-Deleting theorems are verified with the constraint on local
state transformations via the existence of incomparable states. Assuming the
existence of exact cloning or deleting operation defined on a minimum number of
two arbitrary states, an incomparable pair of states of the joint system
between two parties can be made to compare under deterministic LOCC. We have
restricted our proof with the assumption that the machine states of the cloning
or deleting operations do not keep any information about the input states. We
use the same setting to establish the no-cloning and no-deleting theorems via
incomparability that supports the reciprocity of the two operations in their
operational senses. The work associates the impossibility of operations with
the evolution of an entangled system by LOCC.
