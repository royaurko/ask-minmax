The explosion of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs via the double
detonation scenario is a potential explanation for type Ia supernovae. In this
scenario, a surface detonation in a helium layer initiates a detonation in the
underlying carbon/oxygen core leading to an explosion. For a given core mass, a
lower bound has been determined on the mass of the helium shell required for
dynamical burning during a helium flash, which is a necessary prerequisite for
detonation. For a range of core and corresponding minimum helium shell masses,
we investigate whether an assumed surface helium detonation is capable of
triggering a subsequent detonation in the core even for this limiting case. We
carried out hydrodynamic simulations on a co-expanding Eulerian grid in two
dimensions assuming rotational symmetry. The detonations are propagated using
the level-set approach and a simplified scheme for nuclear reactions that has
been calibrated with a large nuclear network. The same network is used to
determine detailed nucleosynthetic abundances in a post-processing step. Based
on approximate detonation initiation criteria in the literature, we find that
secondary core detonations are triggered for all of the simulated models,
ranging in core mass from 0.810 up to 1.385 M_solar with corresponding shell
masses from 0.126 down to 0.0035 M_solar. This implies that, as soon as a
detonation triggers in a helium shell covering a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, a
subsequent core detonation is virtually inevitable.
