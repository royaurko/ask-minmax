We report on the development and performance of a high-sensitivity
purity-analysis technique for gaseous xenon. The gas is sampled at macroscopic
pressure from the system of interest using a UHV leak valve. The xenon present
in the sample is removed with a liquid-nitrogen cold trap, and the remaining
impurities are observed with a standard vacuum mass-spectroscopy device. Using
calibrated samples of xenon gas spiked with known levels of impurities, we find
that the minimum detectable levels of N2, O2, and methane are 1 ppb, 160 ppt,
and 60 ppt respectively. This represents an improvement of about a factor of
10,000 compared to measurements performed without a coldtrap.
