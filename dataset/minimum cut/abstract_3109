We present the discovery of two giant planets orbiting stars in Praesepe
(also known as the Beehive Cluster). These are the first known hot Jupiters in
an open cluster and the only planets known to orbit Sun-like, main-sequence
stars in a cluster. The planets are detected from Doppler shifted radial
velocities; line bisector spans and activity indices show no correlation with
orbital phase, confirming the variations are caused by planetary companions.
Pr0201b orbits a V=10.52 late F dwarf with a period of 4.4264 +/- 0.0070 days
and has a minimum mass of 0.540 +/- 0.039 Mjup, and Pr0211b orbits a V=12.06
late G dwarf with a period of 2.1451 +/- 0.0012 days and has a minimum mass of
1.844 +/- 0.064 Mjup. The detection of 2 planets among 53 single members
surveyed establishes a lower limit on the hot Jupiter frequency of 3.8
(+5.0)(-2.4) % in this metal-rich open cluster. Given the precisely known age
of the cluster, this discovery also demonstrates that, in at least 2 cases,
giant planet migration occurred within 600 Myr after formation. As we endeavor
to learn more about the frequency and formation history of planets,
environments with well-determined properties -- such as open clusters like
Praesepe -- may provide essential clues to this end.
