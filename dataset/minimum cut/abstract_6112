We have derived simplified equations for a freely expanding, pressure driven
jet model as a function of jet power and applied it successfully to the radio
cores in the black hole candidates GRS 1915+105, NGC 4258, and M81 which are
observationally well defined systems, and to Sgr A*. By using equipartition
assumptions, the model has virtually no free parameters and can explain all
sources by just scaling the jet power. In GRS 1915+105 it also naturally
explains the jet velocity and the radio time delay. The jet powers we derive
for the radio cores of the first three sources are comparable to their
accretion disk luminosities, providing further evidence for the existence of
symbiotic jet/disk systems and a common engine mechanism also in low-luminosity
AGN and stellar mass black holes. With the exception of Sgr A* an advection
dominated accretion flow (ADAF) does not seem to be necessary to explain any of
the radio cores which span a large range in luminosity and size, as well as in
black hole masses and accretion rate---from Eddington to extreme sub-Eddington.
We suggest, however, that the jet model can be used to derive minimum accretion
rates and thus find that Sgr A* seems to be truly radiatively deficient---even
in a starved black hole model---and that a combination of jet and ADAF model
may be one possible solution.
