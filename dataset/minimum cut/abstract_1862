I have calculated the exponential suppression factor in the decay rate of the
false vacuum (per unit volume) for a real scalar field at finite temperature,
in the presence of gravity, in the thin-wall approximation. Temperatures are
assumed to be much greater than the inverse of the nucleation radius. The value
of a local minimum of the scalar potential is arbitrary. Thus, both true and
false vacuua may have arbitrary cosmological constants.
