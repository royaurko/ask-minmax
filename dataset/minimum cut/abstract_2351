We show that in the two-component Bose gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling an
arbitrarily small attractive interaction between bosons with opposite spin
induces spontaneous ferromagnetism below a finite critical temperature $T_c$.
In the ferromagnetic phase the single-particle spectrum exhibits a unique
minimum in momentum space in the direction of the magnetization. For
sufficiently small temperatures below $T_c$ the bosons eventually condense into
the unique state at the bottom of the spectrum, forming a ferromagnetic
Bose-Einstein condensate.
