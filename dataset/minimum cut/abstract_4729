A general method is presented for estimating the uncertainty in hybrid models
of gravitational waveforms from binary black-hole systems with arbitrary
physical parameters, and thence the highest allowable initial orbital frequency
for a numerical-relativity simulation such that the combined analytical and
numerical waveform meets some minimum desired accuracy. The key strength of
this estimate is that no prior numerical simulation in the relevant region of
parameter space is needed, which means that these techniques can be used to
direct future work. The method is demonstrated for a selection of extreme
physical parameters. It is shown that optimal initial orbital frequencies
depend roughly linearly on the mass of the binary, and therefore useful
accuracy criteria must depend explicitly on the mass. The results indicate that
accurate estimation of the parameters of stellar-mass black-hole binaries in
Advanced LIGO data or calibration of waveforms for detection will require much
longer numerical simulations than are currently available or more accurate
post-Newtonian approximations -- or both -- especially for comparable-mass
systems with high spin.
