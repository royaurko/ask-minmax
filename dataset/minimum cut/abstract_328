We show that, for the most generic model with two Higgs doublets possessing a
minimum that preserves the $U(1)_{em}$ symmetry, charge breaking (CB) cannot
occur. If CB does not occur, the potential could have two different minima, and
there is in principle no general argument to show which one is the deepest. The
depth of the potential at a stationary point that breaks CB or CP, relative to
the $U(1)_{em}$ preserving minimum, is proportional to the squared mass of the
charged or pseudoscalar Higgs, respectively.
