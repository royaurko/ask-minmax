The RESPER probe has been assembled, except the ferrules that must ensure the
contact, by insulating materials and more specifically in Tufnol, as regards
the support plates, and Teflon, as regards the standoffs. A series of holes has
been drilled on the surface of support plates in order to allow approaching
each other of the two central electrodes to external ones, from a minimum of
4.29 cm to a maximum of 10 cm. The dipole-dipole array defined by the integer
parameter n = 6 could not be implemented, as the positioning of suitable
"spring" shafts requires 6 mm holes and an adequate space could not be
available to carry out the drilling. The presence of these "spring" shafts
allows reaching a right prominence of the tip from the base and, at the same
time, a certain amount of pressure which ensures the proper adherence to the
artifact that must be tested. There is a brass screw within each shaft, which
edge has been turned to the measurement of 1.4 mm. Four metal spacers are
replaced of time in time depending on the configuration that is to be adopted.
The achievement of height l(n) from the plates is ensured by the presence of
metallic spacers. To complete the description, a copper cable, 1 m long and
with a 4.0 mm2 section area, has been welded to the head of each electrode. The
two transmitting or reading cables are kept at a fixed distance L(n) between
them by means of Teflon rods in which has been applied the same series of holes
existing on the Tufnol plates.
