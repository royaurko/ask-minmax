Eta Carinae is the nearest example of a supermassive, superluminous, unstable
star. Mass loss from the system is critical in shaping its circumstellar medium
and in determining its ultimate fate. Eta Car currently loses mass via a dense,
slow stellar wind and possesses one of the largest mass loss rates known. It is
prone to episodes of extreme mass ejection via eruptions from some as-yet
unspecified cause; the best examples of this are the large-scale eruptions
which occurred in 19th century. Eta Car is a colliding wind binary in which
strong variations in X-ray emission and in other wavebands are driven by the
violent collision of the wind of eta Car-A and the fast, less dense wind of an
otherwise hidden companion star. X-ray variations are the simplest diagnostic
we have to study the wind-wind collision and allow us to measure the state of
the stellar mass loss from both stars. We present the X-ray lightcurve over the
last 20 years from ROSAT observations and monitoring with the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer and the X-ray Telescope on the Swift satellite. We compare and
contrast the behavior of the X-ray emission from the system over that timespan,
including surprising variations during the 2014 X-ray minimum.
