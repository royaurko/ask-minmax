The lensing effect of curved space, which can cause the angular diameter of a
fixed reference length seen on the sky to reach a minimum and then increase
with redshift, depends sensitively on the value of the cosmological constant,
$\Lambda$, in a flat universe. The redshift of an observed minimum and the
asymptotic slope can in principle provide strong constraints on $\Lambda$. The
sensitivity to a non-zero cosmological constant in a flat universe is compared
to the sensitivity to $q_0$ in an open universe without a cosmological
constant, and to inherent ambiguities due to uncertainties in distance measures
and the possible effects of evolution. If evolutionary uncertainties can be
overcome, the reported observations of the angular diameter of compact radio
jets as a function of redshift, which appear to exhibit such a minimum, could
provide the strongest available limit on the cosmological constant in a flat
universe, and on $\Omega$ in an open universe.
