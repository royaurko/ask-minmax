In this paper, we have studied non stationary dust spherically symmetric
spacetime, in general covariant theory ($U(1)$ extension) of the
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with the minimum coupling and non-minimum coupling
with the matter, in the post-newtonian approximation (PPN) in the infrared
limit. The Newtonian prepotential $\varphi$ was assumed null. We have shown
that there is not an analogy of the dust solution in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz
Theory (HLT) with the minimum coupling, as we know in the General Relativity
Theory (GRT). However, when using non-minimum coupling with the matter, we have
shown that the solution admits a process of gravitational collapse, leaving a
singularity at the end. We have also found a second possible solution,
representing a bounce behavior that is not found in the GRT.
