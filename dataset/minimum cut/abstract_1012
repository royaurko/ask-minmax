We present a novel method, which we call dual minima hopping method (DMHM),
that allows us to find the global minimum of the potential energy surface (PES)
within density functional theory for systems where a fast but less accurate
calculation of the PES is possible. This method can rapidly find the ground
state configuration of clusters and other complex systems with present day
computer power by performing a systematic search. We apply the new method to
silicon clusters. Even though these systems have already been extensively
studied by other methods, we find new configurations that are lower in energy
than the previously found.
