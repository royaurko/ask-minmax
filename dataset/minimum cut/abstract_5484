This paper studies the mechanisms, implications, and potential applications
of the recently discovered class of Zero Determinant (ZD) strategies in
iterated 2x2 games. These strategies were reported to successfully extort pure
economic maximizers, and to mischievously determine the set of feasible
long-term payoffs in iterated Prisoners' Dilemma by enforcing linear
constraints on both players' expected average scores.
  These results are generalized for all symmetric 2x2 games and a general
Battle of the Sexes, exemplified by four common games. Additionally, a
comparison to conventional strategies is made and typical ZD gameplay
simulations are analyzed along with convergence speeds. Several response
strategies are discussed, including a glance on how time preferences change
previous results. Furthermore, a possibility of retaliation is presented: when
maximin scores exceed the minimum symmetric payoff, it is possible to extort
the extortioner.
  Finally, a summary of findings from evolutionary game theory shows that
mischief is limited by its own malice. Nevertheless, this does not challenge
the result that mindless economic maximization is subject to extortion: the
study of ZD strategies reveals exciting new perspectives and opportunities in
game theory, both evolutionary and classic.
