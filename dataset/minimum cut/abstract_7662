Variable-intensity astronomical sources are the result of complex and often
extreme physical processes. Abrupt changes in source intensity are typically
accompanied by equally sudden spectral shifts, i.e., sudden changes in the
wavelength distribution of the emission. This article develops a method for
modeling photon counts collected form observation of such sources. We embed
change points into a marked Poisson process, where photon wavelengths are
regarded as marks and both the Poisson intensity parameter and the distribution
of the marks are allowed to change. We believe this is the first effort to
embed change points into a marked Poisson process. Between the change points,
the spectrum is modeled non-parametrically using a mixture of a smooth radial
basis expansion and a number of local deviations from the smooth term
representing spectral emission lines. Because the model is over parameterized
we employ an $\ell_1$ penalty. The tuning parameter in the penalty and the
number of change points are determined via the minimum description length
principle. Our method is validated via a series of simulation studies and its
practical utility is illustrated in the analysis of the ultra-fast rotating
yellow giant star known as FK Com.
