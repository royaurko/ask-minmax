The flux of upward through-going muons of minimum (mean) threshold energy >
1.6 (3.0) GeV is measured, based on a total of 372 events observed by the
Kamiokande II+III detector during 2456 detector live days. The observed muon
flux was (1.94+-0.10(stat.)+0.07-0.06(sys.))*10^-13 /cm^2/s/sr, which is
compared to an expected value of (2.46+-0.54(theo.))*10^-13/cm^2/s/sr. The
observation is in agreement with the prediction within the errors. The zenith
angle dependence of the observed upward through-going muons supports the
previous indication of neutrino oscillations made by Kamiokande using sub- and
multi-GeV atmospheric neutrino events.
