Several methods of extracting the magnitude of the real parts of the elastic
hadron scattering amplitude - from the experimental data are presented. These
methods allows us to obtain the real parts at one definite point of the
transfer momentum and with a high accuracy without knowledge of the precise
values of the normalization coefficient and with minimum theoretical
assumptions.
