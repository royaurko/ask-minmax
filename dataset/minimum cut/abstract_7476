We report the discovery of a low-mass planet orbiting Gl 15 A based on radial
velocities from the Eta-Earth Survey using HIRES at Keck Observatory. Gl 15 Ab
is a planet with minimum mass Msini = 5.35 $\pm$ 0.75 M$_\oplus$, orbital
period P = 11.4433 $\pm$ 0.0016 days, and an orbit that is consistent with
circular. We characterize the host star using a variety of techniques.
Photometric observations at Fairborn Observatory show no evidence for
rotational modulation of spots at the orbital period to a limit of ~0.1 mmag,
thus supporting the existence of the planet. We detect a second RV signal with
a period of 44 days that we attribute to rotational modulation of stellar
surface features, as confirmed by optical photometry and the Ca II H & K
activity indicator. Using infrared spectroscopy from Palomar-TripleSpec, we
measure an M2 V spectral type and a sub-solar metallicity ([M/H] = -0.22,
[Fe/H] = -0.32). We measure a stellar radius of 0.3863 $\pm$ 0.0021 R$_\odot$
based on interferometry from CHARA.
