A class of surface hopping algorithms is studied comparing two recent
Landau-Zener (LZ) formulas for the probability of nonadiabatic transitions. One
of the formulas requires a diabatic representation of the potential matrix
while the other one depends only on the adiabatic potential energy surfaces.
For each classical trajectory, the nonadiabatic transitions take place only
when the surface gap attains a local minimum. Numerical experiments are
performed with deterministically branching trajectories and with probabilistic
surface hopping. The deterministic and the probabilistic approach confirm the
good agreement of both the LZ probabilities as well the good approximation of
the reference solution computed solving the Schroedinger equation via a grid
based pseudo-spectral method. Visualizations of position expectations and
superimposed surface hopping trajectories with reference position densities
illustrate the effective dynamics of the investigated algorithms.
