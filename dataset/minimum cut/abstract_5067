We present results for a time-dependent Dalitz plot measurement of
CP-violating asymmetries in the mode B^0 -> pi^+ pi^- pi^0. The dataset is
derived from the complete sample of 471 x 10^6 BBbar meson pairs collected with
the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e^+e^- collider at the SLAC
National Accelerator Laboratory operating on the Upsilon(4S) resonance. We
extract parameters describing the time-dependent B^0 -> rho pi decay
probabilities and CP asymmetries, including C = 0.016\pm0.059\pm0.036, DeltaC =
0.234\pm0.061\pm0.048, S = 0.053\pm0.081\pm0.034, and DeltaS =
0.054\pm0.082\pm0.039, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic,
respectively. We perform a two-dimensional likelihood scan of the direct
CP-violation asymmetry parameters for B^0 -> rho^\pm pi^\mp decays, finding the
change in chi^2 between the minimum and the origin (corresponding to no direct
CP violation) to be Delta(chi^2)=6.42. We present information on the
CP-violating parameter alpha in a likelihood scan that incorporates B^\pm ->
rho pi measurements.
