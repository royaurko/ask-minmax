Using the sunspot numbers reported during the Maunder minimum and the
empirical relations between the mode frequencies and solar activity indices,
the variations in the total solar irradiance and 10.7 cm radio flux for the
period 1645 to 1715 is estimated. We find that the total solar irradiance and
radio flux during the Maunder minimum decreased by 0.19% and 52% respectively,
as compared to the values for solar cycle 22.
