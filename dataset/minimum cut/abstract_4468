In previous papers we have shown that scattering of spacecraft nucleons from
dark matter gravitationally bound to the earth gives a possible explanation of
the flyby velocity anomalies. In addition to flyby velocity changes arising
from the average over the scattering cross section of the collision-induced
nucleon velocity change, there will be spacecraft temperature increases arising
from the mean squared fluctuation of the collision-induced velocity change. We
give here a quantitative treatment of this effect, and suggest that careful
calorimetry on spacecraft traversing the region below 70,000 km where the flyby
velocity changes take place could verify, or at a minimum place significant
constraints, on the dark matter scattering model.
