We propose an original analog method to perform instantaneous and
quantitative spectral analysis of microwave signals. An ensemble of
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers held in a diamond plate is pumped by a 532 nm
laser. Its photoluminescence is imaged through an optical microscope and
monitored by a digital camera. The microwave signal is converted to an
oscillating magnetic field in the area of the NV centers by a loop shaped
antenna. Induced magnetic resonances are detected through a decrease of the NV
centers photoluminescence. A magnetic field gradient induces a Zeeman shift of
the resonances and transforms the frequency information into spatial
information, which allows for the simultaneous analysis of the microwave signal
in the entire frequency bandwidth of the device. The time dependent spectral
analysis of an amplitude modulated microwave signal is demonstrated over a
bandwidth of 600 MHz, associated to a frequency resolution of 7 MHz and a
refresh rate of 4 ms. With such integration time, a field of a few hundreds of
{\mu}W can be detected. Since the optical properties of NV centers can be
maintained even in high magnetic field, we estimate that an optimized device
could allow frequency analysis in a range of 30 GHz, only limited by the
amplitude of the magnetic field gradient. In addition, an increase of the NV
centers quantity could lead both to an increase of the microwave sensitivity
and to a decrease of the minimum refresh rate down to a few {\mu}s.
