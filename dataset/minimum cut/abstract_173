In this article we prove several important properties of 2^{k-p} minimum
aberration (MA) designs with k>2, where n=2^{k-p} is the number of runs. We
develop a simple method to build MA designs of resolution III. Furthermore, we
introduce a simple relationship, based on product of polynomials, for computing
their word-length patterns.
