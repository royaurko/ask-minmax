A topological constraint on the possible values of the universal quantization
parameter is revealed in the case of geometric quantization on (boundary)
curves diffeomorphic to $S^1$, analytically extended on a bounded domain in
$\mathbb{C}$, with $n \ge 2$ boundary components. Unlike the case of one
boundary component (such as the canonical Berezin quantization of the
Poincar\'e upper-half plane or the case of conformally-invariant 2D systems),
the more general case considered here leads to a strictly positive minimum
value for the quantization parameter, which depends on the geometrical data of
the domain (specifically, the total area and total perimeter in the smooth
case). It is proven that if the lower bound is attained, then $n=2$ and the
domain must be annular, with a direct interpretation in terms of the global
monodromy.
