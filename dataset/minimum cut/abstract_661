We introduce a class of dimension reduction estimators based on an ensemble
of the minimum average variance estimates of functions that characterize the
central subspace, such as the characteristic functions, the Box--Cox
transformations and wavelet basis. The ensemble estimators exhaustively
estimate the central subspace without imposing restrictive conditions on the
predictors, and have the same convergence rate as the minimum average variance
estimates. They are flexible and easy to implement, and allow repeated use of
the available sample, which enhances accuracy. They are applicable to both
univariate and multivariate responses in a unified form. We establish the
consistency and convergence rate of these estimators, and the consistency of a
cross validation criterion for order determination. We compare the ensemble
estimators with other estimators in a wide variety of models, and establish
their competent performance.
