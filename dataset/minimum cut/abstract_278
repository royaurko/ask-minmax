In 1989, Lescure and Meyniel proved, for $d=5, 6$, that every $d$-chromatic
graph contains an immersion of $K_d$, and in 2003 Abu-Khzam and Langston
conjectured that this holds for all $d$. In 2010, DeVos, Kawarabayashi, Mohar,
and Okamura proved this conjecture for $d = 7$. In each proof, the
$d$-chromatic assumption was not fully utilized, as the proofs only use the
fact that a $d$-critical graph has minimum degree at least $d - 1$. DeVos,
Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Fox, McDonald, Mohar, and Scheide show the stronger conjecture
that a graph with minimum degree $d-1$ has an immersion of $K_d$ fails for
$d=10$ and $d\geq 12$ with a finite number of examples for each value of $d$,
and small chromatic number relative to $d$, but it is shown that a minimum
degree of $200d$ does guarantee an immersion of $K_d$.
  In this paper we show that the stronger conjecture is false for $d=8,9,11$
and give infinite families of examples with minimum degree $d-1$ and chromatic
number $d-3$ or $d-2$ that do not contain an immersion of $K_d$. Our examples
can be up to $(d-2)$-edge-connected. We show, using Haj\'os' Construction, that
there is an infinite class of non-$(d-1)$-colorable graphs that contain an
immersion of $K_d$. We conclude with some open questions, and the conjecture
that a graph $G$ with minimum degree $d - 1$ and more than
$\frac{|V(G)|}{1+m(d+1)}$ vertices of degree at least $md$ has an immersion of
$K_d$.
