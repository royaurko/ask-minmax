We build analytical models of spherically symmetric stars in the brane-world,
in which the external space-time contains both an ADM mass and a tidal charge.
In order to determine the interior geometry, we apply the principle of minimal
geometric deformation, which allows one to map General Relativistic solutions
to solutions of the effective four-dimensional brane-world equations. We
further restrict our analysis to stars with a radius linearly related to the
total General Relativistic mass, and obtain a general relation between the
latter, the brane-world ADM mass and the tidal charge. In these models, the
value of the star's radius can then be taken to zero smoothly, thus obtaining
brane-world black hole metrics with a tidal charge solely determined by the
mass of the source and the brane tension. General conclusions regarding the
minimum mass for semiclassical black holes will also be drawn.
