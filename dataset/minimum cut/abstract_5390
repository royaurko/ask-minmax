An adaptive randomized distributed space-time coding (DSTC) scheme is
proposed for two-hop cooperative MIMO networks. Linear minimum mean square
error (MMSE) receiver filters and randomized matrices subject to a power
constraint are considered with an amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperation
strategy. In the proposed DSTC scheme, a randomized matrix obtained by a
feedback channel is employed to transform the space-time coded matrix at the
relay node. The effect of the limited feedback and feedback errors are
considered. Linear MMSE expressions are devised to compute the parameters of
the adaptive randomized matrix and the linear receive filters. A stochastic
gradient algorithm is also developed with reduced computational complexity. The
simulation results show that the proposed algorithms obtain significant
performance gains as compared to existing DSTC schemes.
