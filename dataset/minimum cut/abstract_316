Within the framework of the minimum quadratic Poincare gauge theory of
gravity in the Riemann-Cartan spacetime the dynamics of homogeneous anisotropic
Bianchi types I-IX spinning-fluid cosmological models is investigated. A basic
equation set for these models is obtained and analyzed. In particular, exact
solutions for the Bianchi type-I spinning-fluid and Bianchi type-V
perfect-fluid models are found in analytic form.
