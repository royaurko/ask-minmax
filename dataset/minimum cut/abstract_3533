A stationary Josephson effect in point contacts between triplet
superconductors is analyzed theoretically for most probable models of the order
parameter in UPt_{3} and Sr_{2}RuO_{4}. The consequence of misorientation of
crystals in superconducting banks on this effect is considered. We show that
different models for the order parameter lead to quite different current-phase
dependences. For certain angles of misorientation a boundary between
superconductors can generate the parallel to surface spontaneous current. In a
number of cases the state with a zero Josephson current and minimum of the free
energy corresponds to a spontaneous phase difference. This phase difference
depends on the misorientation angle and may possess any value. We conclude that
experimental investigations of the current-phase dependences of small junctions
can be used for determination of the order parameter symmetry in the mentioned
above superconductors.
