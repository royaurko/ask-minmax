We present a new class of sparse and easily invertible circulant matrices
that can have a sparse inverse though not being permutation matrices. Their
study is useful in the design of quasi-cyclic low-density generator matrix
codes, that are able to join the inner structure of quasi-cyclic codes with
sparse generator matrices, so limiting the number of elementary operations
needed for encoding. Circulant matrices of the proposed class permit to hit
both targets without resorting to identity or permutation matrices that may
penalize the code minimum distance and often cause significant error floors.
