We critically discuss the measure of very short time intervals. By means of a
"gedankenexperiment", we describe an ideal clock based on the occurrence of
completely random events. We show that the minimum time interval Delta t that
this clock can measure scales as the inverse of its size Delta r. This implies
an uncertainty relation between space and time: Delta r Delta t > G \hbar /
c^4, where G, \hbar, and c are the Gravitational constant, the reduced Planck
constant, and the speed of light, respectively. We outline and briefly discuss
the implications of this uncertainty principle.
