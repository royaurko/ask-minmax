We present an expression for the covariance matrix for the set of state
vectors describing a track fitted with a Kalman filter. We demonstrate that
this expression facilitates the use of a Kalman filter track model in a minimum
$\chi^2$ algorithm for the alignment of tracking detectors. We also show that
it allows to incorporate vertex constraints in such a procedure without
refitting the tracks.
