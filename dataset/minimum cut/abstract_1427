The precision measurements of the Higgs properties is crucial for a better
understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking. It can be first achieved at the
ILC\pcite{Behnke2013} at $\sqrt{s}=250\rm ~GeV$ via the Higgs-strahlung
production process $e^+e^-\rightarrow ZH$. The hadronic decay mode
$Z\rightarrow \bar{q}q$ constitutes more than $65%$ of the total, a factor 10
more than $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$. An analysis based solely on the $Z$ jet pair
information could thus lead to a high statistics and provide a minimum biased
Higgs sample. A study of the feasibility of such analysis is shown here, based
on $e^+e^-$ simulated collisions at $250\rm ~GeV$ in center of mass, for the
equivalent integrated luminosity of $500\rm ~fb^{-1}$ and using a fast
simulation of the ILD detector.
