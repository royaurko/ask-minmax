The PHENIX experiment, has recently acquired $\sim$ 1 billion minimum bias
Au+Au events at $\sqrt s = 200$GeV during the year-2004 run. This high
statistics data set, coupled with a state-of-the-art analysis technique, allows
for the extraction of 3D emission sources for various particle types. These 3D
sources lend fresh insight into the nature of a long-range source previously
reported by PHENIX. The new results indicate an anisotropic pion emission
source in the pair c.m. having an extended space-time extent oriented in the
outward direction. The two-proton emission source from the same data set is
essentially isotropic the pair c.m. frame. These results provide a "window" for
viewing the evolution dynamics of the high energy density nuclear matter
created at RHIC.
