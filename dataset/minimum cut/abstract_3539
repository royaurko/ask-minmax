As a probe to determine the pairing symmetry of quasi-two-dimensional
anisotropic superconductors, we propose tunneling spectroscopy in the presence
of magnetic field, where the magnetic field is parallel to the two dimensional
planes and rotated. As a case study, we apply this idea to the models of
high-$T_{C}$ cuprates and organic superconductors $\kappa$-(ET)$_2X$. The
surface density of states at the Fermi energy exhibits a characteristic
oscillation upon rotating the direction of the magnetic field due to the
Doppler shift of the energy of quasiparticles. The surface density of states
has a minimum when the applied magnetic field is parallel to the node direction
of the pair potential independent of the detailed shape of the Fermi surface.
The amplitude of the oscillation is sensitively affected by the shape of Fermi
surface.
