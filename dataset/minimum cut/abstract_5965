We study chemotaxis of a single {\sl E.coli} bacterium in a medium where the
nutrient chemical is also undergoing diffusion and its concentration has the
form of a Gaussian whose width increases with time. We measure the average
first passage time of the bacterium at a region of high nutrient concentration.
In the limit of very slow nutrient diffusion, the bacterium effectively
experiences a Gaussian concentration profile with a fixed width. In this case
we find that there exists an optimum width of the Gaussian when the average
first passage time is minimum, {\sl i.e.}, the search process is most
efficient. We verify the existence of the optimum width for the deterministic
initial position of the bacterium and also for the stochastic initial position,
drawn from uniform and steady state distributions. Our numerical simulation in
a model of a non-Markovian random walker agrees well with our analytical
calculations in a related coarse-grained model. We also present our simulation
results for the case when the nutrient diffusion and bacterial motion occur
over comparable time-scales and the bacterium senses a time-varying
concentration field.
