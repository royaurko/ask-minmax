The drawdown process of an one-dimensional regular diffusion process $X$ is
given by $X$ reflected at its running maximum. The drawup process is given by
$X$ reflected at its running minimum. We calculate the probability that a
drawdown proceeds a drawup in an exponential time-horizon. We then study the
law of the occupation times of the drawdown process and the drawup process.
These results are applied to address problems in risk analysis and for option
pricing of the drawdown process. Finally, we present examples of Brownian
motion with drift and three-dimensional Bessel processes, where we prove an
identity in law.
