We observe numerically the properties of the infinite-temperature inherent
structures of m-component vector spin glasses in three dimensions. An increase
of m implies a decrease of the amount of minima of the free energy, down to the
trivial presence of a unique minimum. For little m correlations are small and
the dynamics are quickly arrested, while for larger m low-temperature
correlations crop up and the convergence is slower, to a limit that appears to
be related with the system size.
