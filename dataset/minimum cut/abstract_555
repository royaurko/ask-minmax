Results on electrical resistivity, magnetoresistance, magnetic Results on
electrical resistivity, magnetoresistance, magnetic susceptibility, heat
capacity and Gd Mossbauer measurements on a Gd-based intermetallic compound,
Gd$_{2}$PdSi$_{3}$ are reported. A finding of interest is that the resistivity
unexpectedly shows a well-defined minimum at about 45 K, well above the long
range magnetic ordering temperature (21 K), a feature which gets suppressed by
the application of a magnetic field. This observation in a Gd alloy presents an
interesting scenario. On the basis of our results, we propose electron
localization induced by s-f (or d-f) exchange interaction prior to long range
magnetic order as a mechanism for the electrical resistance minimum.
