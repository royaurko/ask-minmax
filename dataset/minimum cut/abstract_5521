The phenomenology of most general quark mass matrices with minimum of three
texture zeros obtained through weak basis (WB) transformations has been
discussed within the framework of the standard Model (SM). The relationship of
textures, naturalness and weak basis transformations has also been studied.
Adopting a 'hierarchical' parametrization for the quark mass matrix, we have
detailed exact relations for the various elements of the quark mixing matrix
along with the CP asymmetry angle {\beta} illustrating the explicit
relationship between the observed hierarchies among the WB quark mass matrices
and the quark mixing matrix. Besides exploring the complete parameter space
available to the (Mq)11, (q = u, d) elements in these mass matrices, their
implications for quark mixing data and CP violation asymmetries have also been
explored.
