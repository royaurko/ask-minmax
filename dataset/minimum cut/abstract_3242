By fitting the classical Rotating Vector Model (RVM) to high quality
polarization data for selected radio pulsars, we find the inclination of the
magnetic axis to the spin axis, alpha, as well as the minimum angle between the
line of sight and the magnetic axis, beta, for ten objects. We give a full
treatment of statistical errors in the fitting process. We also present a
dictionary and conversion table of various investigators' geometric definitions
to facilitate future comparisons. We compare our results with other RVM fits
and with empirical/geometrical (E/G) approaches, and we examine the strengths
and weaknesses of RVM fits and E/G investigations for the determination of
pulsar emission beam geometry. Our fits to B0950+08 show that it is an
orthogonal rotator, contrary to previous findings. Finally, we find that RVM
fits are easily perturbed by systematic effects in polarized position angles,
and that the formal uncertainties significantly underestimate the actual
errors.
