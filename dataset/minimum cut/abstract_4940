Recently Yoffe {\it et al.} observed that the average distances between
$5'-3'$ ends of RNA molecules are very small and largely independent of
sequence length. This observation is based on numerical computations as well as
theoretical arguments maximizing certain entropy functionals. In this paper we
compute the exact distribution of $5'-3'$ distances of RNA secondary structures
for any finite $n$. We furthermore compute the limit distribution and show that
already for $n=30$ the exact distribution and the limit distribution are very
close. Our results show that the distances of random RNA secondary structures
are distinctively lower than those of minimum free energy structures of random
RNA sequences.
