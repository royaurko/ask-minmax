In order to mimic the phase changes in the primordial Big Bang, several
"cosmological" solid-state experiments have been conceived, during the last
decade, to investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors and
superfluids cooled through their transition temperature. In one of such
experiments the number of magnetic flux quanta spontaneously trapped in a
superconducting loop was measured by means of a long Josephson tunnel junction
built on top of the loop itself. We have analyzed this system and found a
number of interesting features not occurring in the conventional case with
simply connected electrodes. In particular, the fluxoid quantization results in
a frustration of the Josephson phase, which, in turn, reduces the junction
critical current. Further, the possible stable states of the system are
obtained by a self-consistent application of the principle of minimum energy.
