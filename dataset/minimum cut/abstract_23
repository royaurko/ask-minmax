Traditionally, solar physicists become anxious around solar minimum, as they
await the high-latitude sunspot groups of the new cycle. Now, we are in an
extended sunspot minimum with conditions not seen in recent memory, and
interest in the sunspot cycle has increased again. In this paper, I will
describe some of the characteristics of the current solar minimum, including
its great depth, its extended duration, its weak polar magnetic fields, and its
small amount of open flux. Flux-transport simulations suggest that these
characteristics are a consequence of temporal variations of the Sun's
large-scale meridional circulation.
