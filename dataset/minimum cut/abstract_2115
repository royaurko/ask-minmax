Previous results on multi-charged Baby Skyrmion solutions have pointed to a
modular structure, comprised of charge two rings and single charge one
Skyrmions, which combine to form higher charged structures. In this paper we
present numerical evidence which shows an alternative finite chain,
multi-charged global energy minimum Baby Skymion solution. We then proceed from
the infinite plane, to Baby Skyrmions on a cylinder and then a torus, to obtain
the solutions of periodic Baby Skyrmions, of which periodic segments will
correspond to sections of large charge Baby Skyrmions in the plane.
