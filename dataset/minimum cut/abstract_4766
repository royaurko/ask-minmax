The interaction between two spherical colloidal particles with degenerate
planar anchoring in a nematic media is studied by numerically minimizing the
bulk Landau-de Gennes and surface energy using a finite element method. We find
that the energy achieves its global minimum when the particles are in close
contact and making an angle $\theta = 28^\circ \pm 2$ with respect to the bulk
nematic director, in agreement with the experiments. Although the quadrupolar
structure of the director field is preserved in the majority of configurations,
we show that for smaller orientation angles and at smaller inter-particle
separations, the axial symmetry of the topological defect-pairs is continuously
broken, resulting in the emergence of an attractive interaction.
