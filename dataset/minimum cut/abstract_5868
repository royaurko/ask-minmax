A graph $G=(V,E)$ is a \emph{word-representable graph} if there exists a word
$W$ over the alphabet $V$ such that letters $x$ and $y$ alternate in $W$ if and
only if $(x,y)\in E$ for each $x\neq y$.
  In this paper we give an effective characterization of word-representable
graphs in terms of orientations. Namely, we show that a graph is
word-representable if and only if it admits a \emph{semi-transitive
orientation} defined in the paper. This allows us to prove a number of results
about word-representable graphs, in particular showing that the recognition
problem is in NP, and that word-representable graphs include all 3-colorable
graphs.
  We also explore bounds on the size of the word representing the graph. The
representation number of $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ is a
representable by a word, where each letter occurs $k$ times; such a $k$ exists
for any word-representable graph. We show that the representation number of a
word-representable graph on $n$ vertices is at most $2n$, while there exist
graphs for which it is $n/2$.
