This paper gives the minimum generating sets of three types of one generator
$(1+u)$-quasi twisted (QT) codes over $F_2+uF_2$, $u^2=0$. Moreover, it
discusses the generating sets and the lower bounds on the minimum Lee distance
of a special class of $A_2$ type one generator $(1+u)$-QT codes. Some good
(optimal or suboptimal) linear codes over $F_2$ are obtained by these types of
one generator $(1+u)$-QT codes.
