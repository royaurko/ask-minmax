Single-particle properties at superdeformation are investigated within the
Cranked Relativistic Mean Field (CRMF) theory on the example of superdeformed
rotational bands observed in the A~140-150 mass region. Applying the effective
alignment approach it is shown that CRMF theory provides a reasonable
description of the alignment properties of the single-particle orbitals. The
agreement with experiment is good in most of the cases. This suggests that many
features of the observed superdeformed bands can be well understood in terms of
an almost undisturbed single-particle motion. The stability of the results with
respect to the parameterizations used in Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) theory
is also investigated, employing some frequently used non-linear effective
forces. It turns out, with the exception of the single-particle ordering in
superdeformed minimum, that the dependence of the calculated observables on the
parameterization is rather small.
