This analysis considers our universe as a closed Friedmann universe,
dominated by vacuum energy in the form of a cosmological constant, with
cosmological parameters obtained from full mission Planck satellite
observations. A few simple assumptions lead to straightforward calculation of
general features of large scale structures in the universe and minimum stellar
mass as a function of redshift. Those assumptions also generate upper and lower
bounds on supermassive black hole mass in relation to total stellar mass of the
host galaxy, consistent with observations across four orders of magnitude of
black hole mass and five orders of magnitude of galactic stellar mass. The
results are based only on fundamental constants and measured cosmological
parameters. No arbitrary parameters are involved.
