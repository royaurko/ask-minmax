We compare a few variants of the recently proposed multicanonical method with
the well known simulated annealing for the effectiveness in search of the
energy global minimum of a biomolecular system. For this we study in detail
Met-enkephalin, one of the simplest peptides. We show that the new method not
only outperforms simulated annealing in the search of the energy groundstate
but also provides more statistical-mechanical information about the system.
