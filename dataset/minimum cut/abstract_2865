We present and discuss the strong correspondence between evolution of the
emission length scale in the lower transition region and in situ measurements
of the fast solar wind composition during this most recent solar minimum. We
combine recent analyses demonstrating the variance in the (supergranular)
network emission length scale measured by SOHO (and STEREO) with that of the
Helium abundance (from WIND) and the degree of Iron fractionation in the solar
wind (from the ACE and Ulysses). The net picture developing is one where a
decrease in the Helium abundance and the degree of Iron fractionation
(approaching values expected of the photosphere) in the fast wind indicate a
significant change in the process loading material into the fast solar wind
during the recent solar minimum. This result is compounded by a study of the
Helium abundance during the space age using the NASA OMNI database which shows
a slowly decaying amount of Helium being driven into the heliosphere over the
course of the several solar cycles.
