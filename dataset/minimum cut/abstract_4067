We show the preliminary charged-particle pair correlation analyses presented
in a poster session at the 2006 International Quark Matter Conference in
Shanghai China. The correlation analysis space of $\Delta \phi$ (azimuth) and
$\Delta \eta$ (pseudo-rapidity) are considered as a function of centrality for
minimum bias Au + Au collisions in the mid-transverse momentum range in the
STAR detector. The analyses involve unlike-sign charge pairs and like-sign
charge pairs, which are transformed into charge-dependent (CD) signals and
charge-independent (CI) signals. We use a multiplicity scale to compare the
different centralities. We find the signals increase with increasing
centrality. A model featuring dense gluonic hot spots as first proposed by van
Hove predicts that the observables under investigation would have sensitivity
to such a substructure should it occur. A blast wave model including multiple
hot spots motivates the selection of transverse momenta in the range 0.8 GeV/c$
< p_t < $4.0 GeV/c.
