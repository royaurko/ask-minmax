It is shown that in a single-axis antiferromagnetic semiconductor placed in a
strong magnetic field, dispersionless magnons start emitting at any arbitrarily
small velocity of an electron occurring in a spinpolaron state. If magnons are
dispersed they are generated when the spinpolaron velocity exceeds the minimum
phase velocity of magnons. The maximum power of magnon generation caused by the
drift of spinpolarons is estimated.
