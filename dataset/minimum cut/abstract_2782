The positive false discovery rate (pFDR) is a useful overall measure of
errors for multiple hypothesis testing, especially when the underlying goal is
to attain one or more discoveries. Control of pFDR critically depends on how
much evidence is available from data to distinguish between false and true
nulls. Oftentimes, as many aspects of the data distributions are unknown, one
may not be able to obtain strong enough evidence from the data for pFDR
control. This raises the question as to how much data are needed to attain a
target pFDR level. We study the asymptotics of the minimum number of
observations per null for the pFDR control associated with multiple Studentized
tests and $F$ tests, especially when the differences between false nulls and
true nulls are small. For Studentized tests, we consider tests on shifts or
other parameters associated with normal and general distributions. For $F$
tests, we also take into account the effect of the number of covariates in
linear regression. The results show that in determining the minimum sample size
per null for pFDR control, higher order statistical properties of data are
important, and the number of covariates is important in tests to detect
regression effects.
