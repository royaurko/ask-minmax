We present a refined and expanded analysis of the CDF $ee\gamma\gamma + \Et$
event as superpartner production, assuming the lightest neutralino is the
lightest supersymmetric particle. A general low-energy Lagrangian is
constrained by a minimum cross section times branching ratio into two electrons
and two photons, kinematics consistent with the event, and LEP1-LEP130 data. We
examine how the supersymmetric parameters depend on the kinematics, branching
ratios and experimental predictions with a selectron interpretation of the
event, and discuss to what extent these are modified by other interpretations.
Predictions for imminent CERN LEP upgrades and the present and future Fermilab
Tevatron are presented. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible connection to
other phenomena including a light stop, the neutralino relic density, the shift
in $R_b$ and the associated shift in $\alpha_s$, and implications for the form
of the theory.
