The recently published experimental dependence of the J/psi suppression
pattern in Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS on the energy of zero degree
calorimeter E_ZDC are analyzed. It is found that the data obtained within the
`minimum bias' analysis (using `theoretical Drell-Yan') are at variance with
the previously published experimental dependence of the same quantity on the
transversal energy of neutral hadrons E_T. The discrepancy is related to the
moderate centrality region: 100 < N_p < 200 (N_p is the number of nucleon
participants). This could result from systematic experimental errors in the
minimum bias sample. A possible source of the errors may be contamination of
the minimum bias sample by off-target interactions. The data obtained within
the standard analysis (using measured Drell-Yan multiplicity) are found to be
much less sensitive to the contamination.
