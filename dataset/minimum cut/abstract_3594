We have studied the collective short wavelength dynamics in deuterated DMPC
bilayers by inelastic neutron scattering. The corresponding dispersion relation
$\hbar\omega$(Q) is presented for the gel and fluid phase of this model system.
The temperature dependence of the inelastic excitations indicates a phase
coexistence between the two phases over a broad range and leads to a different
assignment of excitations than that reported in a preceding inelastic x-ray
scattering study [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 86}, 740 (2001)]. As a consequence, we
find that the minimum in the dispersion relation is actually deeper in the gel
than in the fluid phase. Finally, we can clearly identify an additional
non-dispersive (optical) mode predicted by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations
[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 87}, 238101 (2001)].
