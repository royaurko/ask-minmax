A generic nonaligned Josephson junction in the presence of an external
magnetic field is theoretically considered and an unusual flux-dependent
current-phase relation (CPR) is revealed. We explain the origin of the
anomalous CPR via the current density flow induced by the external field within
a two-dimensional quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel framework. In particular, it is
demonstrated that nonaligned Josephson junctions can be utilized to obtain a
ground-state other than 0 and \pi, corresponding to a so-called
\varphi-junction, which is tunable via the external magnetic flux. Furthermore,
we show that the standard Fraunhofer central peak of the critical supercurrent
may be inverted into a local minimum solely due to geometrical factors in
planar junctions. This yields good consistency with a recent experimental
measurement displaying such type of puzzling feature [R. S. Keizer et al,
Nature 439, 825 (2006)].
