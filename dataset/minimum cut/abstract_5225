We propose an extensive report on the simulation of electronic transport in
2D graphene in presence of structural defects. Amongst the large variety of
such defects in sp$^2$ carbon-based materials, we focus on the Stone-Wales
defect and on two divacancy-type reconstructed defects. First, based on ab
initio calculations, a tight-binding model is derived to describe the
electronic structure of these defects. Then, semiclassical transport properties
including the elastic mean free paths, mobilities and conductivities are
computed using an order-N real-space Kubo-Greenwood method. A plateau of
minimum conductivity ($\sigma^{min}_{sc}= 4e^2/\pi h$) is progressively
observed as the density of defects increases. This saturation of the decay of
conductivity to $\sigma^{min}_{sc}$ is associated with defect-dependent
resonant energies. Finally, localization phenomena are captured beyond the
semiclassical regime. An Anderson transition is predicted with localization
lengths of the order of tens of nanometers for defect densities around 1%.
