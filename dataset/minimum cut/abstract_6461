Future missions of gravitational-wave astronomy will be operated by
space-based interferometers, covering very wide range of frequency. Search for
stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (GWBs) is one of the main targets for
such missions, and we here discuss the prospects for direct measurement of
isotropic and anisotropic components of (primordial) GWBs around the frequency
0.1-10 Hz. After extending the theoretical basis for correlation analysis, we
evaluate the sensitivity and the signal-to-noise ratio for the proposed future
space interferometer missions, like Big-Bang Observer (BBO), Deci-Hertz
Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observer (DECIGO) and recently proposed
Fabry-Perot type DECIGO. The astrophysical foregrounds which are expected at
low frequency may be a big obstacle and significantly reduce the
signal-to-noise ratio of GWBs. As a result, minimum detectable amplitude may
reach h^2 \ogw = 10^{-15} \sim 10^{-16}, as long as foreground point sources
are properly subtracted. Based on correlation analysis, we also discuss
measurement of anisotropies of GWBs. As an example, the sensitivity level
required for detecting the dipole moment of GWB induced by the proper motion of
our local system is closely examined.
