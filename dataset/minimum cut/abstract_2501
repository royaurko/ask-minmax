We consider the new game of Cops and Attacking Robbers, which is identical to
the usual Cops and Robbers game except that if the robber moves to a vertex
containing a single cop, then that cop is removed from the game. We study the
minimum number of cops needed to capture a robber on a graph $G$, written
$cc(G)$. We give bounds on $cc(G)$ in terms of the cop number of $G$ in the
classes of bipartite graphs and diameter two, $K_{1,m}$-free graphs.
