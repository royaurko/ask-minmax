Minimizing the Higgs potential is an essential task in any model involving
Higgs bosons. Exact minimization methods proposed in the literature are based
on the polynomial form of the potential. These methods will in general no
longer work if loop contributions to the potential are taken into account. We
present a method to keep the tree level global minimum unchanged in passing to
the effective potential. We illustrate the method for the case of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Model (MSSM).
