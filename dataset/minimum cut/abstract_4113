Integration of a new Knob-Box in the PSI Control Systems ACS and Epics.
  Operation of the PSI cyclotrons has always relied heavily on manual control.
Tuning of our high intensity beams for minimum losses is an art still depending
on personal skill. An ergonomically good design of the knob box is therefore
essential for good operation. The age of the previous design, and the request,
to implement the ACS knob box in the SLS control system based on EPICS, was an
opportunity for a redesign. The new knob box is an autonomous node in the
system. It is based on industrial pc104 hardware with LINUX as the operating
system. CDEV and ACS-communication provide the interface to the respective
control systems.
