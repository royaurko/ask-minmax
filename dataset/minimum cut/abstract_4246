Motivated by multiple statistical hypothesis testing, we obtain the limit of
likelihood ratio of large deviations for self-normalized random variables,
specifically, the ratio of $P(\sqrt{n}(\bar X +d/n) \ge x_n V)$ to
$P(\sqrt{n}\bar X \ge x_n V)$, as $n\toi$, where $\bar X$ and $V$ are the
sample mean and standard deviation of iid $X_1, ..., X_n$, respectively, $d>0$
is a constant and $x_n \toi$. We show that the limit can have a simple form
$e^{d/z_0}$, where $z_0$ is the unique maximizer of $z f(x)$ with $f$ the
density of $X_i$. The result is applied to derive the minimum sample size per
test in order to control the error rate of multiple testing at a target level,
when real signals are different from noise signals only by a small shift.
