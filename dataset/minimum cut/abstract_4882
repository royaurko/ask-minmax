We show that the cosmological phase transition from the first accelerated
expansion in the early universe to the second accelerated expansion over the
intermediate decelerated expansion is possible in the HL gravity without the
``detailed balance'' condition if the dark scalar energy density is assumed to
be negative. Moreover, we obtain various evolutions depending on the scale
factor and the expansion rate. Finally, we discuss the existence of the minimum
scale in connection with the singularity free condition.
