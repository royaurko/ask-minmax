We study the optical cooling of the resonator mirror in a
cavity-optomechanical system that contains an optical gain medium. We find that
the optical damping rate is vanishingly small for an incoherently pumped laser
above threshold. In the presence of an external coherent drive however, the
optical damping rate can be enhanced substantially with respect to that of a
passive cavity. We show that the strength of the incoherent pump provides a
conduit to tune the damping rate and the minimum attainable phonon number with
the same radiation pressure force, and the latter can be lowered from that of a
passive cavity if the thermal contribution is nonnegligible. We also show that
the system can undergo a transition from the weak optomechanical coupling
regime to the strong optomechanical coupling regime as the incoherent pump
strength is varied.
