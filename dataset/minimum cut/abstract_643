Verlinde's heuristic argument for the interpretation of the standard
Newtonian gravitational force as an entropic force is generalized by the
introduction of a minimum temperature (or maximum wave length) for the
microscopic degrees of freedom on the holographic screen. With the simplest
possible setup, the resulting gravitational acceleration felt by a test mass m
from a point mass M at a distance R is found to be of the form of the modified
Newtonian dynamics (MOND) as suggested by Milgrom. The corresponding MOND-type
acceleration constant is proportional to the minimum temperature, which can be
interpreted as the Unruh temperature of an emerging de-Sitter space. This
provides a possible explanation of the connection between local MOND-type
two-body systems and cosmology.
