This paper presents optical UBVRI broadband photo-polarimetry of the EXPORT
sample obtained at the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope. The database consists of
multi-epoch photo-polarimetry of 68 pre-main-sequence and main-sequence stars.
An investigation of the polarization variability indicates that 22 objects are
variable at the 3sigma level in our data. All these objects are pre-main
sequence stars, consisting of both T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be objects while the
main sequence, Vega type and post-T Tauri type objects are not variable. The
polarization properties of the variable sources are mostly indicative of the
UXOR-type behaviour; the objects show highest polarization when the brightness
is at minimum. We add seven new objects to the class of UXOR variables (BH Cep,
VX Cas, DK Tau, HK Ori, LkHa 234, KK Oph and RY Ori). The main reason for their
discovery is the fact that our data-set is the largest in its kind, indicating
that many more young UXOR-type pre-main sequence stars remain to be discovered.
The set of Vega-like systems has been investigated for the presence of
intrinsic polarization. As they lack variability, this was done using indirect
methods, and apart from the known case of BD +31.643, the following stars were
found to be strong candidates to exhibit polarization due to the presence of
circumstellar disks: 51 Oph, BD +31.643C, HD 58647 and HD 233517.
