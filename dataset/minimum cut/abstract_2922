Using simulations of box/peanut- (B/P-) shaped bulges, we explore the nature
of the X-shape of the Milky Way's bulge. An X-shape can be associated with a
B/P-shaped bulge driven by a bar. By comparing in detail the simulations and
the observations we show that the principal kinematic imprint of the X-shape is
a minimum in the difference between the near and far side mean line-of-sight
velocity along the minor axis. This minimum occurs at around |b| = 4{\deg},
which is close to the lower limit at which the X-shape can be detected. No
coherent signature of an X-shape can be found in Galactocentric azimuthal
velocities, vertical velocities, or any of the dispersions. After scaling our
simulations, we find that a best fit to the BRAVA data leads to a bar angle of
15{\deg}. We also explore a purely geometric method for determining the
distance to the Galactic Centre by tracing the arms of the X-shape. We find
that we are able to determine this ill-known distance to an accuracy of about
5% per cent with sufficiently accurate distance measurements for the red clump
stars in the arms.
