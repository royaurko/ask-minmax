We address the production of strangelets inside neutron stars by means of
high-energy neutrino interactions (sparking). Requiring that neutron stars
remain as such along their lifetimes, we obtain a bound on the probability of a
strangelet in the final state and compare it with existing laboratory limits.
It turns out that this mechanism is not likely to drive a neutron $\to$ strange
stars conversion for realistic values of the minimum center-mass-energy
necessary to produce the quark-gluon plasma, a necessary precondition for the
formation of the strangelet.
