High harmonic generation (HHG) is used to measure the spectral phase of the
recombination dipole matrix element (RDM) in argon over a broad frequency range
that includes the 3p Cooper minimum (CM). The measured RDM phase agrees well
with predictions based on the scattering phases and amplitudes of the
interfering s- and d-channel contributions to the complementary photoionization
process. The reconstructed attosecond bursts that underlie the HHG process show
that the derivative of the RDM spectral phase, the group delay, does not have a
straight-forward interpretation as an emission time, in contrast to the usual
attochirp group delay. Instead, the rapid RDM phase variation caused by the CM
reshapes the attosecond bursts.
