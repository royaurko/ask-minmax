We generalize the higher-derivative F-terms introduced by Beasley and Witten
(hep-th/0409149) for SU(2) superQCD to Sp(N) gauge theories with fundamental
matter. We generate these terms by integrating out massive modes at tree level
from an effective superpotential on the chiral ring of the microscopic theory.
Though this superpotential is singular, its singularities are mild enough to
permit the unambiguous identification of its minima, and gives sensible answers
upon integrating out massive modes near any given minimum.
