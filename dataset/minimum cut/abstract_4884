The stability of the color flavor locked phase in the presence of a strong
magnetic field is investigated within the phenomenological MIT bag model,
taking into account the variation of the strange quark mass, the baryon
density, the magnetic field, as well as the bag and gap parameters. It is found
that the minimum value of the energy per baryon in a color flavor locked state
at vanishing pressure is lower than the corresponding one for unpaired
magnetized strange quark matter and, as the magnetic field increases, the
energy per baryon decreases. This implies that magnetized color flavor locked
matter is more stable and could become the ground state inside neutron stars.
The mass-radius relation for such stars is also studied.
