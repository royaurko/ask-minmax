Statistical analysis of occurrence rate of magnetic storms induced by
different types of interplanetary drivers is made on the basis of OMNI data for
period 1976-2000. Using our catalog of large scale types of solar wind streams
we study storms induced by interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME)
(separately magnetic clouds (MC) and Ejecta) and both types of compressed
regions: corotating interaction regions (CIR) and Sheaths. For these types of
drivers we calculate integral probabilities of storms with minimum Dst < -50,
-70, -100, -150, and -200 nT. The highest probability in this interval of Dst
is observed for MC, probabilities for other drivers are 3-10 times lower than
for MC. Extrapolation of obtained results to extreme storms shows that such a
magnetic storm as Carrington storm in 1859 with Dst = -1760 nT is observed on
the Earth with frequency 1 event during ~500 year.
