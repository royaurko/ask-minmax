We examine the role of the anisotropy of superconducting thermal critical
fluctuations in the opening of pseudogaps in quasi-two dimensions. When the
anisotropy of coherence or correlation lengths of the fluctuations is large
enough and critical temperatures T_c are high enough, the energy dependence of
the selfenergy deviates from that of Landau's normal Fermi liquid in critical
regions; its imaginary part has no minimum at the chemical potential. Prominent
pseudogaps open in such a non-Fermi liquid phase. Pseudogaps must be absent or
subtle in quasi-two dimensional superconductors with low T_c and almost
isotropic three dimensional superconductors.
