This paper focuses on the design and implementation of a high-quality and
high-throughput true-random number generator (TRNG) in FPGA. Various practical
issues which we encountered are highlighted and the influence of the various
parameters on the functioning of the TRNG are discussed. We also propose a few
values for the parameters which use the minimum amount of the resources but
still pass common random number generator test batteries such as DieHard and
TestU01.
