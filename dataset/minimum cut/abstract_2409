In this paper, Arnold diffusion is proved to be generic phenomenon in nearly
integrable convex Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom: $$
H(x,y)=h(y)+\epsilon P(x,y), \qquad x\in\mathbb{T}^3,\ y\in\mathbb{R}^3. $$
Under typical perturbation $\epsilon P$, the system admits "connecting" orbit
that passes through any two prescribed small balls in the same energy level
$H^{-1}(E)$ provided $E$ is bigger than the minimum of the average action,
namely, $E>\min\alpha$.
