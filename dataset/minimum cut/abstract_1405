Several reactivity control system design options are explored in order to
satisfy shutdown margin (SDM) requirements in a high conversion BWRs operating
in Th-233U fuel cycle (Th-RBWR). The studied has an axially heterogeneous fuel
assembly structure with a single fissile zone sandwiched between two fertile
blanket zones. The utilization of an originally suggested RBWR Y-shape control
rod in Th-RBWR is shown to be insufficient for maintaining adequate SDM to
balance the high negative reactivity feedbacks, while maintaining fuel breeding
potential, core power rating, and minimum Critical Power Ratio (CPR). Instead,
an alternative assembly design, also relying on heterogeneous fuel zoning, is
proposed for achieving fissile inventory ratio (FIR) above unity, adequate SDM
and meeting minimum CPR limit at thermal core output matching the ABWR power.
The new concept was modeled as a single 3-dimensional fuel assembly having
reflective radial boundaries, using the BGCore system, which consists of the
MCNP code coupled with fuel depletion and thermo-hydraulic feedback modules.
