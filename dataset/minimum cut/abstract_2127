A single four-level atom interacting with two-mode cavities is investigated.
Under large detuning condition, we obtain the effective Hamiltonian which is
unitary squeezing operator of two-mode fields. Employing the input-output
theory, we find that the entanglement and squeezing of the output fields can be
achieved. By analyzing the squeezing spectrum, we show that asymmetric detuning
and asymmetric atomic initial state split the squeezing spectrum from one
valley into two minimum values, and appropriate leakage of the cavity is needed
for obtaining output entangled fields.
