The readout chip for the CMS pixel detector has to deal with an enormous data
rate. On-chip zero suppression is inevitable and hit data must be buffered
locally during the latency of the first level trigger. Dead-time must be kept
at a minimum. It is dominated by contributions coming from the readout. To keep
it low an analog readout scheme has been adopted where pixel addresses are
analog coded. We present the architecture of the final CMS pixel detector
readout chip with special emphasis on the analog readout chain. Measurements of
its performance are discussed.
