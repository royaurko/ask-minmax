The composition of neutron stars is an issue that has been studied for
decades. Yet we do not know exactly what these very compact objects are made
of. At this stage of the technological development the best we can do is to
constrain the range of equations of state via the mass-radius diagram. From the
theoretical point of view the things are not easier. The theory of matter at
high density and temperature is not well established.
  Keeping this in mind we applied the Information Theory as a novel way to
restrict the range of possible equations of state for neutron stars.
  From our results, we conclude that if order costs energy, then nature should
favour exotic strange quark stars over the hadronic neutron stars and that
there is a trend for the types of compact stars of classified under the
nomenclature "neutrons stars" to be at a state of minimum complexity.
