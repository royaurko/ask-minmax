Turbulence driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI) affects planetesimal
formation by inducing diffusion and collisional fragmentation of dust
particles. We examine conditions preferred for planetesimal formation in
MRI-inactive "dead zones" using an analytic dead-zone model based on our recent
resistive MHD simulations. We argue that successful planetesimal formation
requires not only a sufficiently large dead zone (which can be produced by tiny
dust grains) but also a sufficiently small net vertical magnetic flux (NVF).
Although often ignored, the latter condition is indeed important since the NVF
strength determines the saturation level of turbulence in MRI-active layers. We
show that direct collisional formation of icy planetesimal across the
fragmentation barrier is possible when the NVF strength is lower than 10 mG
(for the minimum-mass solar nebula model). Formation of rocky planetesimals via
the secular gravitational instability is also possible within a similar range
of the NVF strength. Our results indicate that the fate of planet formation
largely depends on how the NVF is radially transported in the initial disk
formation and subsequent disk accretion processes.
