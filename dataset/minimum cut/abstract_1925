The initial production and dynamical expansion of hot spherical nuclei are
examined as the first stage in the projectile-multifragmentation process. The
initial temperatures, which are necessary for entering the adiabatic spinodal
region, as well as the minimum temperatures and densities, which are reached in
the expansion, significantly differ for hard and soft equations of state.
Additional initial compression, occurring in central collisions leads most
likely to a qualitatively different multifragmentation mechanism. Recent
experimental data are discussed in relation to the results of the proposed
model.
