In 1963, Corr\'adi and Hajnal proved that for all $k \ge 1$ and $n \ge 3k$,
every (simple) graph on n vertices with minimum degree at least 2k contains k
disjoint cycles. The same year, Dirac described the 3-connected multigraphs not
containing two disjoint cycles and asked the more general question: Which
(2k-1)-connected multigraphs do not contain k disjoint cycles? Recently, the
contributors characterized the simple graphs G with minimum degree $\delta(G) \ge
2k-1$ that do not contain k disjoint cycles. We use this result to answer
Dirac's question in full.
