The binding energy of A3C60, a conductor, is described well by an ionic solid
type calculation. This succeeds because there is little overlap between
molecular wave functions on neighbouring sites, so that electrons are
practically localized on-shell. This leads one to believe that even in A4C60
and A6C60 systems such calculation may suffice. However, for large charge on
the anion, there is a possibility for some electrons to delocalize and go into
the s-band. We calculate binding energy, keeping these delocalised electrons x,
as a parameter and minimize the energy w.r.t. it. We take the intermolecular
interaction to be arising out of a C-C potential of 6-exp form and a screened
Coulomb interaction between the anions and cations and among themselves. Model
calculations are presented for K1C60, K3C60, K4C60 and K6C60 for which the
minimum energy state shows no delocalisation. Cohesive Energy dependence on
Lattice constant is used to calculate Bulk Modulus for all systems. We have got
a reasonably good resemblance with experimental values. Further, we observe
that the cohesive energy shows poor resemblance with experimental values.
Further, delocalisation of a fraction of electron at the centre of double bond
show considerable increase in cohesive energy.
