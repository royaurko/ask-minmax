We present a new algorithm for the statistical model checking of Markov
chains with respect to unbounded temporal properties, such as reachability and
full linear temporal logic. The main idea is that we monitor each simulation
run on the fly, in order to detect quickly if a bottom strongly connected
component is entered with high probability, in which case the simulation run
can be terminated early. As a result, our simulation runs are often much
shorter than required by termination bounds that are computed a priori for a
desired level of confidence and size of the state space. In comparison to
previous algorithms for statistical model checking, for a given level of
confidence, our method is not only faster in many cases but also requires less
information about the system, namely, only the minimum transition probability
that occurs in the Markov chain, thus enabling almost complete black-box
verification. In addition, our method can be generalised to unbounded
quantitative properties such as mean-payoff bounds.
