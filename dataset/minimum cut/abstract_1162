Mining association rules is a popular and well researched method for
discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. A
practical problem is that at medium to low support values often a large number
of frequent itemsets and an even larger number of association rules are found
in a database. A widely used approach is to gradually increase minimum support
and minimum confidence or to filter the found rules using increasingly strict
constraints on additional measures of interestingness until the set of rules
found is reduced to a manageable size. In this paper we describe a different
approach which is based on the idea to first define a set of ``interesting''
itemsets (e.g., by a mixture of mining and expert knowledge) and then, in a
second step to selectively generate rules for only these itemsets. The main
advantage of this approach over increasing thresholds or filtering rules is
that the number of rules found is significantly reduced while at the same time
it is not necessary to increase the support and confidence thresholds which
might lead to missing important information in the database.
