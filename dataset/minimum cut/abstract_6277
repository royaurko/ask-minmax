The most intense monitoring observations yet made were carried out on the
Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151 in the optical and near-infrared wave-bands. A lag
from the optical light curve to the near-infrared light curve was measured. The
lag-time between the V and K light curves at the flux minimum in 2001 was
precisely 48+2-3 days, as determined by a cross-correlation analysis. The
correlation between the optical luminosity of an active galactic nucleus (AGN)
and the lag-time between the UV/optical and the near-infrared light curves is
presented for NGC 4151 in combination with previous lag-time measurements of
NGC 4151 and other AGNs in the literature. This correlation is interpreted as
thermal dust reverberation in an AGN, where the near-infrared emission from an
AGN is expected to be the thermal re-radiation from hot dust surrounding the
central engine at a radius where the temperature equals to that of the dust
sublimation temperature. We find that the inner radius of the dust torus in NGC
4151 is $\sim $ 0.04 pc corresponding to the measured lag-time, well outside
the broad line region (BLR) determined by other reverberation studies of the
emission lines.
