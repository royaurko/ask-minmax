Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field and $S=\mathbb{K}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be the
polynomial ring in $n$ variables over the field $\mathbb{K}$. Suppose that
$\mathcal{C}$ is a chordal clutter with $n$ vertices and assume that the
minimum edge cardinality of $\mathcal{C}$ is at least $d$. It is shown that
$S/I(c_d(\mathcal{C}))$ satisfies Stanley's conjecture, where
$I(c_d(\mathcal{C}))$ is the edge ideal of the $d$-complement of $\mathcal{C}$.
This, in particular shows that $S/I$ satisfies Stanley's conjecture, where $I$
is a quadratic monomial ideal with linear resolution. We also define the notion
of Schmitt--Vogel number of a monomial ideal $I$, denoted by ${\rm sv}(I)$ and
prove that for every squarefree monomial ideal $I$, the inequalities ${\rm
sdepth}(I)\geq n-{\rm sv}(I)+1$ and ${\rm sdepth}(S/I)\geq n-{\rm sv}(I)$ hold.
