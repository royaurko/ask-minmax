We calculate the wake in charge density and the wake potential due to the
passage of a fast parton in an anisotropic quark gluon plasma(AQGP). For the
sake of simplicity small $\xi$(anisotropic parameter) limit has been
considered. When the velocity($v$) of the jet is parallel to the anisotropy
direction(${\hat n}$) and remains below the phase velocity($v_p$), the wake in
induced charge density shows a little oscillatory behavior in AQGP, contrary to
the isotropic case. With the jet velocity greater than the phase velocity, the
oscillatory behavior increases with $\xi$. Also for $v>v_p$ one observes a
clear modification of the cone-like structure in presence of anisotropy. For
the parallel direction in the backward region, the depth of the wake potential
decreases with the increase of $\xi$ for $v<v_p$ and the potential becomes
modified Coulomb-like for higher values of $\xi$. In the forward region, the
potential remains modified Coulomb-like with the change in magnitude for
nonzero $\xi$, for both $v>v_p$ and $v<v_p$. In the perpendicular direction,
the wake potential is symmetric in the forward and backward regions. With the
increase of $\xi$, the depth of negative minimum is moving away from the origin
irrespective of the jet velocity. On the other hand when the jet velocity is
perpendicular to the anisotropy direction, we find significant changes in the
case of both wake charge density and potential in comparison to the isotropic
case.
