In the framework of percolation of strings, the transverse momentum
distributions in AA and hh collisions at all centralities and energies follow a
universal behavior. The width of these distributions is related to the width of
the distribution of the size of the clusters formed from the overlapping of the
produced strings. The difference between the distributions for baryons and
mesons originates in the fragmentation of clusters of several strings which
enhance the particles with higher number of constituents. The results agree
with SPS and RHIC data. The predictions for LHC show differences for baryons
compared with RHIC. At LHC energies we obtain also a high pt suppression for pp
high multiplicity events compared with pp minimum bias.
