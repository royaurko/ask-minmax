Magnetic data from GOES geosynchronous satellites were applied for
statistical study of the low-latitude dayside magnetopause under a strong
interplanetary magnetic field of southward orientation when the reconnection at
the magnetopause was saturated. From minimum variance analysis, we determined
the magnetopause orientation and compared it with predictions of a reference
model. The magnetopause shape was found to be substantially distorted by a
duskward shifting such that the nose region appeared in the postnoon sector. At
equatorial latitudes, the shape of magnetopause was characterized by a
prominent bluntness and by a trench formed in the postnoon sector. The origin
of distortions was regarded in the context of the storm-time magnetospheric
currents and the large-scale quasi-state reconnection at the dayside
magnetopause.
