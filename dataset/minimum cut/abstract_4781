A technique to compute the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) for a wireless link with a
multi-antenna, Linear, Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) receiver in the
presence of interferers distributed according to a non-homogenous Poisson point
process on the plane, and independent Rayleigh fading between antennas is
presented. This technique is used to compute the CDF of the SINR for several
different models of intensity functions, in particular, power-law intensity
functions, circular-symmetric Gaussian intensity functions and intensity
functions described by a polynomial in a bounded domain. Additionally it is
shown that if the number of receiver antennas is scaled linearly with the
intensity function, the SINR converges in probability to a limit determined by
the "shape" of the underlying intensity function. This work generalizes known
results for homogenous Poisson networks to non-homogenous Poisson networks.
