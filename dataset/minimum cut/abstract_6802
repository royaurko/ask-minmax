We present three new approximation algorithms with improved constant ratios
for selecting $n$ points in $n$ disks such that the minimum pairwise distance
among the points is maximized.
  (1) A very simple $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm with ratio $0.511$ for disjoint
unit disks.
  (2) An LP-based algorithm with ratio $0.707$ for disjoint disks of arbitrary
radii that uses a linear number of variables and constraints, and runs in
polynomial time.
  (3) A hybrid algorithm with ratio either $0.4487$ or $0.4674$ for (not
necessarily disjoint) unit disks that uses an algorithm of Cabello in
combination with either the simple $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm or the LP-based
algorithm.
  The LP algorithm can be extended for disjoint balls of arbitrary radii in
$\RR^d$, for any (fixed) dimension $d$, while preserving the features of the
planar algorithm. The algorithm introduces a novel technique which combines
linear programming and projections for approximating Euclidean distances. The
previous best approximation ratio for dispersion in disjoint disks, even when
all disks have the same radius, was $1/2$. Our results give a partial answer to
an open question raised by Cabello, who asked whether the ratio $1/2$ could be
improved.
