Recent work suggests that Heisenberg spin glasses may belong to the same
universality class than structural glasses. Indeed, finding a lattice
equivalent for supercooled liquids would probably allow easier numerical and
analytical studies, that may help to answer long-standing questions on the
glass transition. Supercooled liquids have many peculiar behaviors that should
be found in the paramagnetic phase of Heisenberg spin glasses if the analogy
between the two systems holds. It is with this motivation that we undertake a
study of the paramagnetic phase of Heisenberg spin glasses. We shall emphasize
the role of the energy landscape, with a detailed study of the properties of
the inherent structures (by analogy with supercooled liquids, we name inherent
structure the local minimum of the energy function which is closest to the
current spin configuration). Finding inherent structures will require the
development of a new search algorithm. We shall investigate as well the
existence of a dynamic transition in the paramagnetic phase. As a matter of
fact, both the existence of a complex energy landscape, as well as the
existence of a dynamic transition, are distinguished features of the Physics of
supercooled liquids.
