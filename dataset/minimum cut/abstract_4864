We report the detection of a double planetary system orbiting around the
evolved intermediate-mass star HD 4732 from precise Doppler measurements at
Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO) and Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO).
The star is a K0 subgiant with a mass of 1.7 M_sun and solar metallicity. The
planetary system is composed of two giant planets with minimum mass of
msini=2.4 M_J, orbital period of 360.2 d and 2732 d, and eccentricity of 0.13
and 0.23, respectively. Based on dynamical stability analysis for the system,
we set the upper limit on the mass of the planets to be about 28 M_J (i>5 deg)
in the case of coplanar prograde configuration.
