In this paper, we investigate a Bayesian sparse reconstruction algorithm
called compressive sensing via Bayesian support detection (CS-BSD). This
algorithm is quite robust against measurement noise and achieves the
performance of a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator that has support
knowledge beyond a certain SNR threshold. The key idea behind CS-BSD is that
reconstruction takes a detection-directed estimation structure consisting of
two parts: support detection and signal value estimation. Belief propagation
(BP) and a Bayesian hypothesis test perform support detection, and an MMSE
estimator finds the signal values belonging to the support set. CS-BSD
converges faster than other BP-based algorithms, and it can be converted to a
parallel architecture to become much faster. Numerical results are provided to
verify the superiority of CS-BSD compared to recent algorithms.
