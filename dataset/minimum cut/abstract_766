Regenerating codes and codes with locality are two schemes that have recently
been proposed to ensure data collection and reliability in a distributed
storage network. In a situation where one is attempting to repair a failed
node, regenerating codes seek to minimize the amount of data downloaded for
node repair, while codes with locality attempt to minimize the number of helper
nodes accessed. In this paper, we provide several constructions for a class of
vector codes with locality in which the local codes are regenerating codes,
that enjoy both advantages. We derive an upper bound on the minimum distance of
this class of codes and show that the proposed constructions achieve this
bound. The constructions include both the cases where the local regenerating
codes correspond to the MSR as well as the MBR point on the
storage-repair-bandwidth tradeoff curve of regenerating codes. Also included is
a performance comparison of various code constructions for fixed block length
and minimum distance.
