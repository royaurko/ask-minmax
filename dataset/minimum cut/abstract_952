We have obtained images of the eclipsing pulsar binary PSR~B1957+20 using the
Planetary Camera of the Hubble Space Telescope. The high spatial resolution of
this instrument has allowed us to separate the pulsar system from a nearby
background star which has confounded ground-based observations of this system
near optical minimum. Our images limit the temperature of the backside of the
companion to $T \simlt 2800$~K, about a factor of two less than the average
temperature of the side of the companion facing the pulsar, and provide a
marginal detection of the companion at optical minimum. The magnitude of this
detection is consistent with previous work which suggests that the companion
nearly fills its Roche lobe and is supported through tidal dissipation.
