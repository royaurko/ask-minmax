In this paper, we investigate secure and reliable transmission strategies for
multi-cell multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems
with a multi-antenna active eavesdropper. We consider a time-division duplex
system where uplink training is required and an active eavesdropper can attack
the training phase to cause pilot contamination at the transmitter. This forces
the precoder used in the subsequent downlink transmission phase to implicitly
beamform towards the eavesdropper, thus increasing its received signal power.
Assuming matched filter precoding and artificial noise (AN) generation at the
transmitter, we derive an asymptotic achievable secrecy rate when the number of
transmit antennas approaches infinity. For the case of a single-antenna active
eavesdropper, we obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal power
allocation policy for the transmit signal and the AN, and find the minimum
transmit power required to ensure reliable secure transmission. Furthermore,
for multi-antenna correlated fading channels, we show that the impact of an
active eavesdropper can be completely removed if the transmit correlation
matrices of the users and the eavesdropper are mutually orthogonal. Based on
this insight, we propose effective novel transmission strategies for combating
the pilot contamination attack.
