We present the identification of the progenitor of the Type IIP SN 2012ec in
archival pre-explosion HST WFPC2 and ACS/WFC F814W images. The properties of
the progenitor are further constrained by non-detections in pre-explosion WFPC2
F450W and F606W images. We report a series of early photometric and
spectroscopic observations of SN 2012ec. The r'-band light curve shows a
plateau with M(r')=-17.0. The early spectrum is similar to the Type IIP SN
1999em, with the expansion velocity measured at Halpha absorption minimum of
-11,700 km/s (at 1 day post-discovery). The photometric and spectroscopic
evolution of SN 2012ec shows it to be a Type IIP SN, discovered only a few days
post-explosion (<6d). We derive a luminosity for the progenitor, in comparison
with MARCS model SEDs, of log L/Lsun = 5.15+/-0.19, from which we infer an
initial mass range of 14-22Msun. This is the first SN with an identified
progenitor to be followed by the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient
Objects (PESSTO).
