A method is presented that can find the global minimum of very complex
condensed matter systems. It is based on the simple principle of exploring the
configurational space as fast as possible and of avoiding revisiting known
parts of this space. Even though it is not a genetic algorithm, it is not based
on thermodynamics. The efficiency of the method depends strongly on the type of
moves that are used to hop into new local minima. Moves that find low-barrier
escape-paths out of the present minimum lead generally into low energy minima.
