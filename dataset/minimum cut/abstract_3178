We report the discovery of near-sinusoidal radial velocity variations of the
G0V star rhoCrB, with period 39.6 days and amplitude 67 m/s. These variations
are consistent with the existence of an orbital companion in a circular orbit.
Adopting a mass of 1.0 M(Sun) for the primary, the companion has minimum mass
about 1.1 Jupiter masses, and orbital radius about 0.23 AU. Such an orbital
radius is too large for tidal circularization of an initially eccentric orbit
during the lifetime of the star, and hence we suggest that the low eccentricity
is primordial, as would be expected for a planet formed in a dissipative
circumstellar disk.
