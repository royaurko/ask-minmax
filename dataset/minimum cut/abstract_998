Recently Grassberger has shown that the correction to scaling for the
conductance of a bond percolation network on a square lattice is a nonmonotonic
function of the linear lattice dimension with a minimum at $L = 10$, while this
anomalous behavior is not present in the site percolation networks. We perform
a high precision numerical study of the bond percolation random resistor
networks on the square, triangular and honeycomb lattices to further examine
this result. We use the arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means to obtain the
conductance and find that the qualitative behavior does not change: it is not
related to the shape of the conductance distribution for small system sizes. We
show that the anomaly at small L is absent on the triangular and honeycomb
networks. We suggest that the nonmonotonic behavior is an artifact of
approximating the continuous system for which the theory is formulated by a
discrete one which can be simulated on a computer. We show that by slightly
changing the definition of the linear lattice size we can eliminate the minimum
at small L without significantly affecting the large L limit.
