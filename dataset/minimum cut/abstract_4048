Kullback-Leibler relative-entropy has unique properties in cases involving
distributions resulting from relative-entropy minimization. Tsallis
relative-entropy is a one parameter generalization of Kullback-Leibler
relative-entropy in the nonextensive thermostatistics. In this paper, we
present the properties of Tsallis relative-entropy minimization and present
some differences with the classical case. In the representation of such a
minimum relative-entropy distribution, we highlight the use of the q-product,
an operator that has been recently introduced to derive the mathematical
structure behind the Tsallis statistics. One of our main results is
generalization of triangle equality of relative-entropy minimization to the
nonextensive case.
