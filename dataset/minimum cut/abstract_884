For a subspace arrangement over a finite field we study the evaluation code
defined on the arrangement's set of points. The length of this code is given by
the subspace arrangement's characteristic polynomial. For coordinate subspace
arrangements, the dimension is bounded below by the face vector of the
corresponding simplicial complex. The minimum distance is determined for
coordinate subspace arrangements where the simplicial complex is a skeleton.
