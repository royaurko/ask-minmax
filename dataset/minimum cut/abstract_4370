The magnetic relaxation processes in disordered two-dimensional ensembles of
dipole-coupled magnetic nanoparticles are theoretically investigated by
performing numerical simulations. The energy landscape of the system is
explored by determining saddle points, adjacent local minima, energy barriers,
and the associated minimum energy paths (MEPs) as functions of the structural
disorder and particle density. The changes in the magnetic order of the
nanostructure along the MEPs connecting adjacent minima are analyzed from a
local perspective. In particular, we determine the extension of the correlated
region where the directions of the particle magnetic moments vary
significantly. It is shown that with increasing degree of disorder the magnetic
correlation range decreases, i.e., the elementary relaxation processes become
more localized. The distribution of the energy barriers, and their relation to
the changes in the magnetic configurations are quantified. Finally, some
implications for the long-time magnetic relaxation dynamics of nanostructures
are discussed.
