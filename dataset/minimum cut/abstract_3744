Deep-inelastic scattering data in the range 150 < Q^2 < 35000 GeV^2 are used
to investigate the minimum jet separation necessary to allow accurate
description of the rate of dijet production using next-to-leading order
perturbative QCD calculations. The required jet separation is found to be
small, allowing about 1/3 of DIS data to be classified as dijet, as opposed to
approximately 1/10 with more typical jet analyses. A number of precision
measurements made using this dijet sample are well described by the
calculations. The data are also described by the combination of leading order
matrix elements and parton showers, as implemented in the QCD based Monte Carlo
model RAPGAP.
