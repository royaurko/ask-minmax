It is shown that in bilayer conducting structures in crossed electric and
magnetic fields of a special configuration (the fields should have opposite
signs in the adjacent layers) the dependence of the energy of a pair of equally
charged carriers on the momentum of the pair has a local minimum. This minimum
corresponds to a bound state of the pair. The local minimum is separated from
the absolute minimum by a large energy barrier. That provides the stability of
the bound state with respect to different scattering processes. If the number
of the pairs is macroscopic, a phase transition into a metastable
superconducting state may take place.
