The diffusive motion of metal nanoparticles Au and Ag on monolayer and
between bilayer heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides and
graphene are investigated in the framework of density functional theory. We
found that the minimum energy barriers for diffusion and the possibility of
cluster formation depend strongly on both the type of nanoparticle and the type
of monolayers and bilayers. Moreover, the tendency to form clusters of Ag and
Au can be tuned by creating various bilayers. Tunability of the diffusion
characteristics of adatoms in van der Waals heterostructures holds promise for
controllable growth of nanostructures.
