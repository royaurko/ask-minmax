We set up a connection between the theory of spherical designs and the
question of minima of Epstein's zeta function. More precisely, we prove that a
Euclidean lattice, all layers of which hold a 4-design, achieves a local
minimum of the Epstein's zeta function, at least at any real s>n/2. We deduce
from this a new proof of Sarnak and Str\"ombergsson's theorem asserting that
the root lattices D4 and E8, as well as the Leech lattice, achieve a strict
local minimum of the Epstein's zeta function at any s>0. Furthermore, our
criterion enables us to extend their theorem to all the so-called extremal
modular lattices(up to certain restrictions) using a theorem of Bachoc and
Venkov, and to other classical families of lattices (e.g. the Barnes-Wall
lattices).
