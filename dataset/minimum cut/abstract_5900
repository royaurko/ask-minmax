We present a systematic study of the electronic, transport and optical
properties of disordered graphene including the next-nearest-neighbor hopping.
We show that this hopping has a non-negligible effect on resonant scattering
but is of minor importance for long-range disorder such as charged impurities,
random potentials or hoppings induced by strain fluctuations. Different types
of disorders can be recognized by their fingerprints appearing in the profiles
of dc conductivity, carrier mobility, optical spectroscopy and Landau level
spectrum. The minimum conductivity $4e^{2}/h$ found in the experiments is
dominated by long-range disorder and the value of $4e^{2}/\pi h$ is due to
resonant scatterers only.
