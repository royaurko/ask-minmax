The slicing number of a knot, $u_s(K)$, is the minimum number of crossing
changes required to convert $K$ to a slice knot. This invariant is bounded
above by the unknotting number and below by the slice genus $g_s(K)$. We show
that for many knots, previous bounds on unknotting number obtained by Ozsvath
and Szabo and by the contributor in fact give bounds on the slicing number.
Livingston defined another invariant $U_s(K)$ which takes into account signs of
crossings changed to get a slice knot, and which is bounded above by the
slicing number and below by the slice genus. We exhibit an infinite family of
knots $K_n$ with slice genus $n$ and Livingston invariant greater than $n$. Our
bounds are based on restrictions (using Donaldson's diagonalisation theorem or
Heegaard Floer homology) on the intersection forms of four-manifolds bounded by
the double branched cover of a knot.
