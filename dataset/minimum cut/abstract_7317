All airless bodies are subject to the space environment, and spectral
differences between asteroids and meteorites suggest many asteroids become
weathered on very short (<1My) timescales. The spectra of some asteroids,
particularly Q-types, indicate surfaces that appear young and fresh, implying
they have been recently been exposed. Previous work found that Earth encounters
were the dominant freshening mechanism and could be responsible for all
near-Earth object (NEO) Q-types. In this work we increase the known NEO Q-type
sample of by a factor of three. We present the orbital distributions of 64
Q-type near-Earth asteroids, and seek to determine the dominant mechanisms for
refreshing their surfaces. Our sample reveals two important results: i) the
relatively steady fraction of Q-types with increasing semi-major axis and ii)
the existence of Q-type near-Earth asteroids with Minimum Orbit Intersection
Distances (MOID) that do not have orbit solutions that cross Earth. Both of
these are evidence that Earth-crossing is not the only scenario by which NEO
Q-types are freshened. The high Earth-MOID asteroids represent 10% of the
Q-type population and all are in Amor orbits. While surface refreshing could
also be caused by Main Belt collisions or mass shedding from YORP spinup, all
high Earth-MOID Q-types have the possibility of encounters with Mars indicating
Mars could be responsible for a significant fraction of NEOs with fresh
surfaces.
