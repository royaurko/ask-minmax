This paper reviews coagulation models for planet formation in the Kuiper
Belt, emphasizing links to recent observations of our and other solar systems.
At heliocentric distances of 35-50 AU, single annulus and multiannulus
planetesimal accretion calculations produce several 1000 km or larger planets
and many 50-500 km objects on timescales of 10-30 Myr in a Minimum Mass Solar
Nebula. Planets form more rapidly in more massive nebulae. All models yield two
power law cumulative size distributions, N_C propto r^{-q} with q = 3.0-3.5 for
radii larger than 10 km and N_C propto r^{-2.5} for radii less than 1 km. These
size distributions are consistent with observations of Kuiper Belt objects
acquired during the past decade. Once large objects form at 35-50 AU,
gravitational stirring leads to a collisional cascade where 0.1-10 km objects
are ground to dust. The collisional cascade removes 80% to 90% of the initial
mass in the nebula in roughly 1 Gyr. This dust production rate is comparable to
rates inferred for alpha Lyr, beta Pic, and other extrasolar debris disk
systems.
