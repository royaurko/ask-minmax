We present population synthesis calculations of the Tidal Downsizing (TD)
hypothesis for planet formation. Our models address the following observations:
(i) most abundant planets being Super Earths; (ii) cores more massive than
$\sim 5-15 M_\oplus$ are enveloped by massive atmospheres; (iii) the frequency
of occurrence of close-in gas giant planets correlates strongly with
metallicity of the host star; (iv) no such correlation is found for sub-Neptune
planets; (v) presence of massive cores in giant planets; (vi) gas giant planets
are over-abundant in metals compared to their host stars; (vii) this
over-abundance decreases with planet's mass; (viii) a deep valley in the planet
mass function between masses of $\sim 10-20 M_\oplus$ and $\sim 100 M_\oplus$.
A number of observational predictions distinguish the model from Core
Accretion: (a) composition of the massive cores is always dominated by rocks
not ices; (b) the core mass function is smooth with no minimum at $\sim 3
M_\oplus$ and has no ice-dominated cores; (c) gas giants beyond 10 AU are
insensitive to the host star metallicity; (d) objects more massive than $\sim
10 M_{\rm Jup}$ do not correlate or even anti-correlate with metallicity. The
latter prediction is consistent with observations of low mass stellar
companions. TD can also explain formation of planets in close binary systems.
TD model is a viable alternative to the Core Accretion scenario in explaining
many features of the observed population of exoplanets.
