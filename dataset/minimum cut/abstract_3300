We have discovered an Ofpe/WN9 (WN11 following Smith et al.) star in the
Sculptor spiral galaxy NGC 300, the first object of this class found outside
the Local Group, during a recent spectroscopic survey of blue supergiant stars
obtained at the ESO VLT. The light curve over a five-month period in late 1999
displays a variability at the 0.1 mag level. The intermediate resolution
spectra (3800-7200 A) show a very close resemblance to the Galactic LBV AG Car
during minimum. We have performed a detailed non-LTE analysis of the stellar
spectrum, and have derived a chemical abundance pattern which includes H, He,
C, N, O, Al, Si and Fe, in addition to the stellar and wind parameters. The
derived stellar properties and the He and N surface enrichments are consistent
with those of other Local Group WN11 stars in the literature, suggesting a
similar quiescent or post-LBV evolutionary status.
