The present paper theoretically investigates magnetoresistance curves in
quasiperiodic magnetic multilayers for two different growth directions, namely
[110] and [100]. We considered identical ferromagnetic layers separated by
non-magnetic layers with two different thicknesses chosen based on the
Fibonacci sequence. Using parameters for Fe/Cr multilayers, four terms were
included in our description of the magnetic energy: Zeeman, cubic anisotropy,
bilinear and biquadratic couplings. The minimum energy was determined by the
gradient method and the equilibrium magnetization directions found were used to
calculate magnetoresistance curves. By choosing spacers with a thickness such
that biquadratic coupling is stronger than bilinear coupling, unusual behaviors
for the magnetoresistance were observed: (i) for the [110] case there is a
different behavior for structures based on even and odd Fibonacci generations;
and more interesting, (ii) for the [100] case we found magnetic field ranges
for which the magnetoresistance increases with magnetic field.
