The Gross-Pitaevskii equation - which describes interacting bosons in the
mean-field approximation - possesses solitonic solutions in dimension one. For
repulsively interacting particles, the stationary soliton is dark, i.e. is
represented by a local density minimum. Many-body effects may lead to filling
of the dark soliton. Using quasi-exact many-body simulations, we show that, in
single realizations, the soliton appears totally dark although the single
particle density tends to be uniform.
