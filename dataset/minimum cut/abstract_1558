Damour and Mukhanov have recently devised circumstances in which inflation
may continue during the oscillatory phase which ensues once the inflaton field
reaches the minimum of its potential. We confirm the existence of this
phenomenon by numerical integration. In such circumstances the quantification
of the amount of inflation requires particular care. We use a definition based
on the decrease of the comoving Hubble length, and show that Damour and
Mukhanov overestimated the amount of inflation occurring. We use the numerical
calculations to check the validity of analytic approximations.
