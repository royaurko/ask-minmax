We report the detections of planetary companions orbiting around three
evolved intermediate-mass stars from precise radial velocity measurements at
Okayama Astrophysical Observatory. HD 2952 (K0III, 2.5 M_sun) and omega Ser
(G8III, 2.2 M_sun) host a relatively low mass planet with minimum mass of
m_2sin i=1.6 M_J and 1.7 M_J in nearly circular orbits with period of P=312 and
277 d, respectively. HD 120084 (G7 III, 2.4 M_sun) hosts an eccentric planet
with m_2sin i=4.5 M_J in an orbit with P=2082 d and eccentricity of e=0.66. The
planet has one of the largest eccentricities among those ever discovered around
evolved intermediate-mass stars, almost all of which have eccentricity smaller
than 0.4. We also show that radial velocity variations of stellar oscillations
for G giants can be averaged out below a level of a few m/s at least in
timescale of a week by high cadence observations, which enables us to detect a
super-Earth and a Neptune-mass planet in short-period orbits even around such
giant stars.
