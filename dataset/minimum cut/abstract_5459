We study the descriptive complexity of parity games by taking into account
the coloring of their game graphs whilst ignoring their ownership structure.
Colored game graphs are identified if they determine the same winning regions
and strategies, for all ownership structures of nodes. The Rabin index of a
parity game is the minimum of the maximal color taken over all equivalent
coloring functions. We show that deciding whether the Rabin index is at least k
is in PTIME for k=1 but NP-hard for all fixed k > 1. We present an EXPTIME
algorithm that computes the Rabin index by simplifying its input coloring
function. When replacing simple cycle with cycle detection in that algorithm,
its output over-approximates the Rabin index in polynomial time. Experimental
results show that this approximation yields good values in practice.
