We continue our analysis of the general N-Higgs-doublet model and focus of
the Higgs potential description in the space of gauge orbits. We develop a
geometric technique that allows us to study the global minimum of the potential
without explicitly finding its position. We discuss symmetry patterns of the
NHDM potential, and illustrate the general discussion with various specific
variants of the three-Higgs-doublet model.
