The influence of central black holes on the dynamical evolution of bars in
disk galaxies is examined. In particular, we use numerical simulation to
estimate the minimum mass black hole (BH) needed to destroy a bar. Initially,
bars form in the disks via dynamical instability. Thereafter, once a bar is
fully developed, a BH is adiabatically added at the center of the disk. To
mitigate the global effects of gravitational softening, Poisson's equation for
the disk is solved by expanding the density and potential of the galaxy in a
set of basis functions.
  Our results indicate that a bar can be completely destroyed in a time much
smaller than a Hubble time if the central mass exceeds about 0.5% of the disk
mass. Since the implied minimum BH mass for bar destruction is of order
10^{8.5} solar masses for a typical disk galaxy, this process should not be a
rare phenomenon. The bar amplitude decreases gradually with time after the BH
is added, and the rate at which the bar is destroyed increases with increasing
BH mass. This suggests that bar destruction arises from scattering of stars
that support the bar as they pass close to the center.
