In this paper we present a method for simulating the response of microstrip
detectors to minimum ionizing particles, making use of a program for field
calculation, a program for carrier drift and SPICE for circuit response. A
knowledge of the electric field is essential for any further improvement of the
program. A simple model involving EL2 levels in the metastable state is
proposed to explain some measurements of electric field.
