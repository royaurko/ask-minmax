Thirty-four years of WSO (Wilcox Solar Observatory) and thirteen years of
SOHO/MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
magnetograms have been studied to measure the east-west inclination angle,
indicating the toroidal component of the photospheric magnetic field. This
analysis reveals that the large-scale toroidal component of the global magnetic
field is antisymmetric around the equator and reverses direction in regions
associated with flux from one solar cycle compared to the next. The toroidal
field revealed the first early signs of cycle 24 at high latitudes, especially
in the northern hemisphere, appearing as far back as 2003 in the WSO data and
2004 in MDI. As in previous cycles, the feature moves gradually equatorward.
Cycles overlap and the pattern associated with each cycle lasts about 17 years.
Even though the polar field at the current solar minimum is significantly lower
than the three previous minima, the toroidal field pattern is similar.
