An heuristic approach to compute strong Nash (Aumann) equilibria is
presented. The method is based on differential evolution and three variants of
a generative relation for strong Nash equilibria characterization. Numerical
experiments performed on the minimum effort game for up to 150 players
illustrate the efficiency of the approach. The advantages and disadvantages of
each variant is discussed in terms of precision and running time.
