In this work, we study the relationship between the superconducting phase and
pseudogap phase in a real-space picture. We suggest that the superconducting
ground states are guaranteed by the energy minimum charge structure of the
quasi-one-dimensional Peierls chains (static vortex lines). It is shown that
there is a charge ordering phase transition from the Peierls chains (the
superconducting ground state) to the periodic chains (the superconducting
excited state) in any superconductors. In our scenarios, all the
superconducting electrons can be considered as the "inertial electrons"at some
stable zero-force positions. Furthermore, we prove analytically that two
electrons, due to a short-range real space Coulomb confinement effect (the
nearest-neighbor electromagnetic interactions), can be in pairing inside a
single plaquette with four negative ions. This implies that the pseudogap
phenomenon can be found from a wide variety of materials, not just the cuprate
superconductors.
