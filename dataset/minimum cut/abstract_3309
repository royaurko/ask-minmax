A new determination of the orbit of the Hyades double-lined spectroscopic
binary HD 27149 is presented. The well-defined orbit provides the spectroscopic
basis for an extremely accurate orbital parallax for the system -- in
particular, the size of the relative orbit ($a\sin i = (a_1 + a_2)\sin i =
(67.075 \pm 0.045) \times 10^6$ km) is accurate to $\pm 0.07$ %. The minimum
masses for the primary and secondary -- $m_1\sin ^3i = 1.096 \pm 0.002 M_\odot$
and $m_2\sin ^3i = 1.010 \pm 0.002 M_\odot$ -- are unexpectedly large for the
spectral types thus suggesting the possibility of eclipses. Although the
probability of eclipses is not large, the system being composed of G3V and G6V
stars in a 75-day orbit, the possibility is of great interest. A rediscussion
of a search for eclipses made by J{\o}rgensen & Olsen$^1$ in 1972 shows that
central eclipses can be excluded, but that shorter duration off-centre eclipses
cannot be ruled out. Ephemerides for possible primary and secondary eclipses
are given.
