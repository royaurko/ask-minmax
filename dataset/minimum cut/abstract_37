A planar straight-line graph which causes the non-termination Ruppert's
algorithm for a minimum angle threshold larger than about 29.5 degrees is
given. The minimum input angle of this example is about 74.5 degrees meaning
that failure is not due to small input angles. Additionally, a similar
non-acute input is given for which Chew's second algorithm does not terminate
for a minimum angle threshold larger than about 30.7 degrees.
