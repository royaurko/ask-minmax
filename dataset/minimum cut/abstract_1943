The influence of exact angular-momentum projection and configuration mixing
on properties of a heavy, well-deformed nucleus is discussed for the example of
Pu240. Starting from a self-consistent model using Skyrme interactions, we
analyze the resulting modifications of the deformation energy, the fission
barrier height, the excitation energy of the superdeformed minimum associated
with the fission isomer, the structure of the lowest rotational bands with
normal deformation and superdeformation, and the corresponding quadrupole
moments and transition moments. We present results obtained with the Skyrme
interactions SLy4 and SLy6, which have slightly different surface tensions.
