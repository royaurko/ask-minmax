In the 50 years since the advent of X-ray astronomy there have been many
scientific advances due to the development of new experimental techniques for
detecting and characterising X-rays. Observations of X-ray polarisation have,
however, not undergone a similar development. This is a shortcoming since a
plethora of open questions related to the nature of X-ray sources could be
resolved through measurements of the linear polarisation of emitted X-rays. The
PoGOLite Pathfinder is a balloon-borne hard X-ray polarimeter operating in the
25 - 240 keV energy band from a stabilised observation platform. Polarisation
is determined using coincident energy deposits in a segmented array of plastic
scintillators surrounded by a BGO anticoincidence system and a polyethylene
neutron shield. The PoGOLite Pathfinder was launched from the SSC Esrange Space
Centre in July 2013. A near-circumpolar flight was achieved with a duration of
approximately two weeks. The flight performance of the Pathfinder design is
discussed for the three Crab observations conducted. The signal-to-background
ratio for the observations is shown to be 0.25$\pm$0.03 and the Minimum
Detectable Polarisation (99% C.L.) is (28.4$\pm$2.2)%. A strategy for the
continuation of the PoGOLite programme is outlined based on experience gained
during the 2013 maiden flight.
