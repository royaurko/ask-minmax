We propose a new data analyzing scheme, the method of minimum entropy
analysis (MEA), in this paper. New MEA provides a quantitative criterion to
select relevant variables for modeling the physical system interested. Such
method can be easily extended to various geophysical/geological data analysis,
where many relevant or irrelevant available measurements may obscure the
understanding of the highly complicated physical system like the triggering of
debris-flows. After demonstrating and testing the MEA method, we apply this
method to a dataset of debris-flow occurrences in Taiwan and successfully find
out three relevant variables, i.e. the hydrological form factor, numbers and
areas of landslides, to the triggering of observed debris-flow events due to
the 1996 Typhoon Herb.
