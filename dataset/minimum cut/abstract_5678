The standard perturbative effective potential suffers from two related
problems of principle involving the field-dependent Goldstone boson squared
mass, G. First, in general G can be negative, and it actually is negative in
the Standard Model; this leads to imaginary contributions to the effective
potential that are not associated with a physical instability, and therefore
spurious. Second, in the limit that G approaches zero, the effective potential
minimization condition is logarithmically divergent already at two-loop order,
and has increasingly severe power-law singularities at higher loop orders. I
resolve both issues by resumming the Goldstone boson contributions to the
effective potential. For the resulting resummed effective potential, the
minimum value and the minimization condition that gives the vacuum expectation
value are obtained in forms that do not involve G at all.
