We have demonstrated stabilization of a fiber-optic Mach-Zehnder
interferometer, with a centimeter-scale path difference, to the transmission
minimum for the carrier wave of a frequency-modulated laser beam. A
time-averaged extinction of 32 dB, limited by the bandwidth of the feedback,
was maintained over several hours. The interferometer was used to remove the
carrier wave from a 780 nm laser beam that had been phase modulated at 2.7 GHz.
