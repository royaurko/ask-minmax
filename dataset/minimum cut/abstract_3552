We study the effect of Aharonov-Bohm flux on the superconducting state in
metallic cylinders. Although Byers and Yang attributed flux quantization to the
flux-dependent minimum of kinetic energies of the Cooper pairs, it is shown
that kinetic energies do not produce any discernible oscillations in the free
energy of the superconducting state (relative to that of normal state) as a
function of the flux. This result is indeed anticipated by the observation of
persistent current in normal metal rings at low temperature. Instead, we have
found that pairing interaction depends on the flux, leading to flux
quantization. When the flux $(\Phi$) is given by $\Phi=n\times hc/2e$ (with
integer n), the pairing interaction and the free energy become unchanged (even
n) or almost unchanged (odd n), due to degenerate-state pairing resulting from
the energy level crossing. As a result, flux quantization and Little-Parks
oscillations follow.
