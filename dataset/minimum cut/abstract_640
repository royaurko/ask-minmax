Frequency separations used to infer global properties of stars through
asteroseismology can change depending on the strength and at what epoch of the
stellar cycle the p-mode frequencies are measured. In the Sun these variations
have been seen, even though the Sun is a low-activity star. In this paper, we
discuss these variations and their impact on the determination of the stellar
parameters (radius, mass and age) for the Sun. Using the data from maximum and
minimum activity, we fitted an age for the Sun that differs on average by 0.2
Gyr: slightly older during minimum activity. The fitted radius is also lower by
about 0.5% for the solar effective temperature during minimum.
