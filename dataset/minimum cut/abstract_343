Gnutzmann and Zyczkowski have proposed the Renyi-Wehrl entropy as a
generalization of the Wehrl entropy, and conjectured that its minimum is
obtained for coherent states. We prove this conjecture for the Renyi index
q=2,3,... in the cases of compact semisimple Lie groups. A general formula for
the minimum value is given.
