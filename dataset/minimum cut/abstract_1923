The ground state neutron spectroscopic factors for 80 nuclei ranging in Z
from 3 to 24 have been extracted by analyzing the past measurements of the
angular distributions from (d,p) and (p,d) reactions. We demonstrate an
approach that provides systematic and consistent values with minimum
assumptions. For the 61 nuclei that have been described by large-basis
shell-model calculations, most experimental spectroscopic factors are
reproduced to within 20%.
