We present a comparison of the SCUBA Half Degree Extragalactic Survey
(SHADES) at 450, 850 and 1100 microns with deep guaranteed time 15 microns
AKARI FU-HYU survey data and Spitzer guaranteed time data at 3.6-24 microns in
the Lockman Hole East. The AKARI data was analysed using bespoke software based
in part on the drizzling and minimum-variance matched filtering developed for
SHADES, and was cross calibrated against Infrared Space Observatory (ISO)
fluxes. Our stacking analyses find AKARI 15um galaxies with >~200 microJy
contribute >10% of the 450 micron background, but only <4% of the 1100 micron
background, suggesting that different populations contribute at mm-wavelengths.
We confirm our earlier result that the ultra-deep 450 micron SCUBA-2 Cosmology
Survey will be dominated by populations already detected by AKARI and Spitzer
mid-infrared surveys. The superb mid-infrared wavelength coverage afforded by
combining Spitzer and AKARI photometry is an excellent diagnostic of AGN
contributions, and we find that (23-52)% of submm-selected galaxies have AGN
bolometric fractions f_AGN>0.3.
