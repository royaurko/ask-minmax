We estimate the conditions for detectability of two planets in a 2/1
mean-motion resonance from radial velocity data, as a function of their masses,
number of observations and the signal-to-noise ratio. Even for a data set of
the order of 100 observations and standard deviations of the order of a few
meters per second, we find that Jovian-size resonant planets are difficult to
detect if the masses of the planets differ by a factor larger than $\sim 4$.
This is consistent with the present population of real exosystems in the 2/1
commensurability, most of which have resonant pairs with similar minimum
masses, and could indicate that many other resonant systems exist, but are
presently beyond the detectability limit.
  Furthermore, we analyze the error distribution in masses and orbital elements
of orbital fits from synthetic data sets for resonant planets in the 2/1
commensurability. For various mass ratios and number of data points we find
that the eccentricity of the outer planet is systematically over estimated,
although the inner planet's eccentricity suffers a much smaller effect. If the
initial conditions correspond to small amplitude oscillations around stable
apsidal corotation resonances (ACR), the amplitudes estimated from the orbital
fits are biased toward larger amplitudes, in accordance to results found in
real resonant extrasolar systems.
