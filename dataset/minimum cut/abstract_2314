We create two overlapping one-dimensional optical lattices using a single
laser beam, a spatial light modulator and a high numerical aperture lens. These
lattices have the potential to trap single atoms, and using the dynamic
capabilities of the spatial light modulator may shift and sort atoms to a
minimum atom-atom separation of $1.52 \mu$m. We show how a simple feedback
circuit can compensate for the spatial light modulator's intensity modulation.
