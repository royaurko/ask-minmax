We investigate theoretical approaches to pion--nucleus elastic scattering at
high energies (300 $\le T_\pi \le$ 1 GeV). A ``model--exact'' calculation of
the lowest--order microscopic optical model, carried out in momentum space and
including the full Fermi averaging integration, a realistic off--shell
pion--nucleon scattering amplitude and fully covariant kinematics, is used to
calibrate a much simpler theory. The simpler theory utilizes a local optical
potential with an eikonal propagator and includes the Coulomb interaction and
the first Wallace correction, both of which are found to be important.
Comparisons of differential cross sections out to beyond the second minimum are
made for light and heavy nuclei. Particularly for nuclei as heavy as $^{40}$Ca,
the eikonal theory is found to be an excellent approximation to the full
theory. (8 Figures available from contributors)
