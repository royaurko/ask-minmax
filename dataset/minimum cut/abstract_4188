We analyze in details a conditional measurement scheme based on linear
optical components, feed-forward loop and homodyne detection. The scheme may be
used to achieve two different tasks. On the one hand it allows the extraction
of information with minimum disturbance about a set of coherent states. On the
other hand, it represents a nondemolitive measurement scheme for the
annihilation operator, i.e. an indirect measurement of the Q-function. We
investigate the information/disturbance trade-off for state inference and
introduce the estimation/distortion trade-off to assess estimation of the
Q-function. For coherent states chosen from a Gaussian set we evaluate both
information/disturbance and estimation/distortion trade-offs and found that non
universal protocols may be optimized in order to achieve better performances
than universal ones. For Fock number states we prove that universal protocols
do not exist and evaluate the estimation/distortion trade-off for a thermal
distribution.
