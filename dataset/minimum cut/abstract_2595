An integral functional $I(w) = \int_{B} \left|\adj \nabla w
\frac{w}{|w|^{3}}\right|^{q}$ defined on suitable maps $w$ is studied. The
inequality $I(w) \geq I(\mathbf{id})$, where $\mathbf{id}$ is the identity map,
is established on a subclass of the admissible maps, and as such confirms in
these cases a criterion for the local minimality of the radial cavitating map
in 3 dimensional nonlinear elasticity. The criterion was first identified by J.
Sivaloganathan and S. Spector in, "Necessary conditions for a minimum at a
radial cavitating singularity in nonlinear elasticity. Ann. I. H. Poincare 25
(2008) no.1, 201-213".
