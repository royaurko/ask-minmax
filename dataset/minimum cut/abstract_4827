Minimal Flavour Violation can be realized in several ways in the lepton
sector due to the possibility of Majorana neutrino mass terms. We derive the
scalar potential for the fields whose background values are the Yukawa
couplings, for the simplest See-Saw model with just two right-handed neutrinos,
and explore its minima. The Majorana character plays a distinctive role: the
minimum of the potential allows for large mixing angles -in contrast to the
simplest quark case- and predicts a maximal Majorana phase. This points in turn
to a strong correlation between neutrino mass hierarchy and mixing pattern.
