Let $D$ be a digraph on $p\geq 5$ vertices with minimum degree at least $p-1$
and with minimum semi-degree at least $p/2-1$. For $D$ (unless some extremal
cases) we present a detailed proof of the following results [12]: (i) $D$
contains cycles of length 3, 4 and $p-1$; (ii) if $p=2n$, then $D$ is
hamiltonian.
