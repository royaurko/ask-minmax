We consider the form of the chiral symmetry breaking piece of the effective
potential in the linear sigma model. Surprisingly, it allows for a second local
minimum at both zero and finite temperature. Even though chiral symmetry is not
exact, and therefore is not restored in a true phase transition at finite
temperature, this second minimum can nevertheless mimic many of the effects of
a first order phase transition. We derive a lower limit on the height of the
second minimum relative to the global minimum based on cosmological
considerations; this limit is so weak as to be practically nonexistent. In high
energy nuclear collisions, it may lead to observable effects in Bose-Einstein
interferometry due to domain walls and to coherent pion emission.
