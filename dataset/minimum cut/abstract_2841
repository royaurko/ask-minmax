The rainbow connection number $rc(G)$ and the rainbow vertex-connection
number $rvc(G)$ of a graph $G$ were introduced by Chartrand et al. and
Krivelevich and Yuster, respectively. Good upper bounds in terms of minimum
degree $\delta$ were reported by Chandran et al., Krivelevich and Yuster, and
Li and Shi. However, if a graph has a small minimum degree $\delta$ and a large
number of vertices $n$, these upper bounds are very large, linear in $n$.
Hence, one may think to look for a good parameter to replace $\delta$ and
decrease the upper bounds significantly. Such a natural parameter is
$\sigma_k$. In this paper, for the rainbow connection number we prove that if
$G$ is a connected graph of order $n$ with $k$ independent vertices, then
$rc(G)\leq 3k\frac{n-2}{\sigma_k+k}+6k-4$. For the rainbow vertex-connection
number, we prove that $rvc(G)\leq \frac{(4k+2k^{2})n}{\sigma_k+k}+5k $ if
$\sigma_k\leq 7k$ and $\sigma_k\geq 8k$, and $rvc(G)\leq
\frac{(\frac{38k}{9}+2k^{2})n}{\sigma_k+k}+5k$ if $7k<\sigma_k< 8k$. Examples
are given showing that our bounds are much better than the existing ones, i.e.,
for the examples $\delta$ is very small but $\sigma_k$ is very large, and the
bounds are $rc(G)< 9k-3$ and $rvc(G)\leq 9k+2k^{2}$ or
$rvc(G)\leq\frac{83k}{9}+2k^{2}$, which imply that both $rc(G)$ and $rvc(G)$
can be upper bounded by constants from our upper bounds, but linear in $n$ from
the existing ones.
