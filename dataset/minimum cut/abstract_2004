We discuss a method to select the velocities of ultra-cold atoms with a
modified Fabry-Perot type of device made of two effective barriers and a well
created, respectively, by blue and red detuned lasers. The laser parameters may
be used to select the peak and width of the transmitted velocity window. In
particular, lowering the central well provides a peak arbitrarily close to zero
velocity having a minimum but finite width. The low-energy atomic scattering
off this laser device is parameterized and approximate formulae are found to
describe and explain its behaviour.
