We discuss the physical meaning and significance of statistical forces on
quasi--static probes in first order around detailed balance for driven media.
Exploiting the quasi--static energetics and the structure of (McLennan) steady
nonequilibrium ensembles, we find that the work of the statistical force on the
probe equals the excess work of the medium in its relaxation after probe
displacement. This proposes an operational tool for accessing some excess
quantities in steady state thermodynamics. We also suggest a method to measure
the relative dynamical activity through equilibrium channels and we give a
minimum entropy production principle for attractors of the effective probe
motion.
