There is enormous potential to advance cosmology from statistical
characterizations of cosmic microwave background sky maps. The angular power
spectrum of the microwave anisotropy is a particularly important statistic.
Existing algorithms for computing the angular power spectrum of a pixelized map
typically require O(N^3) operations and O(N^2) storage, where N is the number
of independent pixels in the map. The MAP and Planck satellites will produce
megapixel maps of the cosmic microwave background temperature at multiple
frequencies; thus, existing algorithms are not computationally feasible. In
this article, we introduce an algorithm that requires O(N^2) operations and
O(N^1.5) storage that can find the minimum variance power spectrum from sky map
data roughly one million times faster than was previously possible. This makes
feasible an analysis that was hitherto intractable.
