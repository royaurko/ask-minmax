Based on results in finite geometry we prove the existence of MRD codes in
(F_q)_(n,n) with minimum distance $n$ which are essentially different from
Gabidulin codes. The construction results from algebraic structures which are
closely related to those of finite fields. Furthermore we show that an analogue
of MacWilliams' extension theorem does not exist for linear rank metric codes.
