Roton excitations constitute a key feature of dipolar gases, connecting these
gases with superfluid helium. We show that the density dependence of the roton
minimum results in a spatial roton confinement, particularly relevant in
pancake dipolar condensates with large aspect ratios. We show that roton
confinement plays a crucial role in the dynamics after roton instability, and
that arresting the instability may create a trapped roton gas revealed by
confined density modulations. We discuss the local susceptibility against
density perturbations, which we illustrate for the case of vortices. Roton
confinement is expected to play a key role in experiments.
