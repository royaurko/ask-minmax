The occurrence of grand minima like the Maunder minimum is an intriguing
aspect of the sunspot cycle. We use the flux transport dynamo model to explain
the grand minima, showing that they arise when either the poloidal field or the
meridional circulation falls to a sufficiently low value due to fluctuations.
Assuming these fluctuations to be Gaussian and determining the various
parameters from the data of the last 28 cycles, we carry on a dynamo simulation
with both these fluctuations. The results are remarkably close to the
observational data.
