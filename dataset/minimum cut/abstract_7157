In this paper, we give several results on area minimizing surfaces in
strictly mean convex 3-manifolds. First, we study the genus of absolutely area
minimizing surfaces in a compact, orientable, strictly mean convex 3-manifold M
bounded by a simple closed curve in the boundary of M. Our main result is that
for any g>=0, the space of simple closed curves in the boundary of M where all
the absolutely area minimizing surfaces they bound in M has genus >=g is open
and dense in the space A of nullhomologous simple closed curves in the boundary
of M. For showing this we prove a bridge principle for absolutely area
minimizing surfaces. Moreover, we show that for any g>=0, there exists a curve
in A such that the minimum genus of the absolutely area minimizing surfaces it
bounds is exactly g.
  As an application of these results, we further prove that the simple closed
curves in the boundary of M bounding more than one minimal surface in M is an
open and dense subset of A. We also show that there are disjoint simple closed
curves in the boundary of M bounding minimal surfaces in M which are not
disjoint. This allows us to answer a question of Meeks, by showing that for any
strictly mean convex 3-manifold M, there exists a simple closed curve \Gamma in
the boundary of M which bounds a stable minimal surface which is not embedded.
