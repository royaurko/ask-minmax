Results of an international campaign to photometrically monitor the unique
pre-main sequence eclipsing object KH 15D are reported. An updated ephemeris
for the eclipse is derived that incorporates a slightly revised period of 48.36
d. There is some evidence that the orbital period is actually twice that value,
with two eclipses occurring per cycle. The extraordinary depth (~3.5 mag) and
duration (~18 days) of the eclipse indicate that it is caused by circumstellar
matter, presumably the inner portion of a disk. The eclipse has continued to
lengthen with time and the central brightness reversals are not as extreme as
they once were. V-R and V-I colors indicate that the system is slightly bluer
near minimum light. Ingress and egress are remarkably well modeled by the
passage of a knife-edge across a limb-darkened star. Possible models for the
system are briefly discussed.
