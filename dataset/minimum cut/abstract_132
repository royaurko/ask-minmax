The role of the auxiliary su(2)-algebra proposed by the present contributors in
the latest paper is extended. Its aim is to determine the minimum weight states
completely. With the aid of scalar operators for the auxiliary algebra, new
aspects are added to the minimum weight states in the aligned scheme discussed
in the latest paper. Some simple examples are shown.
