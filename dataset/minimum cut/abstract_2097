We experimentally demonstrate the in situ tunability of the minimum energy
splitting (gap) of a superconducting flux qubit by means of an additional flux
loop. Pulses applied via a local control line allow us to tune the gap over a
range of several GHz on a nanosecond timescale. The strong flux sensitivity of
the gap (up to 0.7 GHz/mPhi_0) opens up the possibility to create different
types of tunable couplings that are effective at the degeneracy point of the
qubit. We investigate the dependence of the relaxation time and the Rabi
frequency on the qubit gap.
