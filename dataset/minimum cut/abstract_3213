The sensitivity of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) in TeV
gamma-ray observations reachs its maximum at small zenith angles (< 30 degree)
which provide the minimum attainable energy threshold of an instrument.
However, for a specific telescope site a number of gamma-ray sources, or source
candidates, can only be observed at much larger zenith angles (< 60 degree).
Moreover the observations at large zenith angles allow to extend the
observation time window for any object seen at small zenith angles, as well as
to enlarge the dynamic energy range of an instrument towards the highest
observable energies of gamma-rays. Based on Monte Carlo simulations we present
here the results on the sensitivity of a stereoscopic system of 5 IACTs in
observations at large zenith angles. We point out some important parameters of
the telescope design which could substantially improve the efficiency of such
observations with forthcoming IACT arrays like CANGAROO III, HESS and VERITAS.
