A simple superasymmetric fission model using microscopically calculated
nuclear potentials has shown itself to be outstandingly successful in
describing highly asymmetric spontaneous disintegration of nuclei into two
composite nuclear fragments. The nuclear interaction potentials required to
describe these nuclear decay processes have been calculated by double folding
the density distribution functions of the two fragments with a realistic
effective interaction. The microscopic nucleus-nucleus potential thus obtained,
along with the Coulomb interaction potential and the minimum centrifugal
barrier required for the spin-parity conservation, has been used successfully
for the lifetime calculations of these nuclear disintegration processes.
