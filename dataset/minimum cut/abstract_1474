Motivated by an application in wireless telecommunication networks, we
consider a two-type continuum-percolation problem involving a homogeneous
Poisson point process of users and a stationary and ergodic point process of
base stations. Starting from a randomly chosen point of the Poisson point
process, we investigate distribution of the minimum number of hops that are
needed to reach some point of the second point process. In the supercritical
regime of continuum percolation, we use the close relationship between
Euclidean and chemical distance to identify the distributional limit of the
rescaled minimum number of hops that are needed to connect a typical Poisson
point to a point of the second point process as its intensity tends to
infinity. In particular, we obtain an explicit expression for the asymptotic
probability that a typical Poisson point connects to a point of the second
point process in a given number of hops.
