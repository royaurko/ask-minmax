The three-dimensional bimodal random-field Ising model is studied via a new
finite temperature numerical approach. The methods of Wang-Landau sampling and
broad histogram are implemented in a unified algorithm by using the N-fold
version of the Wang-Landau algorithm. The simulations are performed in dominant
energy subspaces, determined by the recently developed critical minimum energy
subspace technique. The random fields are obtained from a bimodal distribution,
that is we consider the discrete $(\pm\Delta)$ case and the model is studied on
cubic lattices with sizes $4\leq L \leq 20$. In order to extract information
for the relevant probability distributions of the specific heat and
susceptibility peaks, large samples of random field realizations are generated.
The general aspects of the model's scaling behavior are discussed and the
process of averaging finite-size anomalies in random systems is re-examined
under the prism of the lack of self-averaging of the specific heat and
susceptibility of the model.
