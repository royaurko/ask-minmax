RR Lyrae stars pulsating in the fundamental mode have long been used to
measure interstellar reddening, based on their observed uniformity of $B-V$
color at minimum light after small corrections for metallicity and period are
applied. However, little attention has been paid to the first overtone
pulsators (RRc or RR1). We present new $V-I$ observations of field RRc stars,
supplemented with published data from uncrowded RRc in globular clusters.
Preliminary results indicate the RRc colors are correlated with period, but
appear to be independent of the stars' metallicity. The scatter around the
period-color relation is slightly larger than a comparable relation for RRab.
Thus, RRc can be useful indicators of line of sight reddening toward old
stellar systems, particularly when multiple stars are available as in
Oosterhoff II globular clusters and metal-poor galaxies.
