We report ROSAT PSPC spatial and spectral analysis of the eight B2 radio
galaxies NGC 315, NGC 326, 4C 35.03, B2 0326+39, NGC 2484, B2 1040+31, B2
1855+37, and 3C 449, expected to be representative of the class of low-power
radio galaxies. Multiple X-ray components are present in each, and the gas
components have a wide range of linear sizes and follow an extrapolation of the
cluster X-ray luminosity/temperature correlation, implying that there is no
relationship between the presence of a radio galaxy and the gas fraction of the
environment. No large-scale cooling flows are found. There is no correlation of
radio-galaxy size with the scale or density of the X-ray atmosphere. This
suggests that it is processes on scales less than those of the overall gaseous
environments which are the major influence on radio-source dynamics. The
intergalactic medium is usually sufficient to confine the outer parts of the
radio structures, in some cases even to within 5 kpc of the core. In the case
of NGC 315, an extrapolation suggests that the pressure of the atmosphere may
match the minimum pressure in the radio source over a factor of about 40 in
linear size (a factor of about 1600 in pressure).
