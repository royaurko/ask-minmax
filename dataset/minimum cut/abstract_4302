Numerical calculations of the effect of organophosphorous inhibitor
(CF3CH2O)3P and its mixtures with carbon dioxide on propane flames are carried
out using the three dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)
equations in the low Mach number approximation. The k-e model of turbulence,
the EDC combustion model and the weighted-sum-of-gray-gases model of radiation
are used. The Westbrook global-kinetic scheme with fractional order of reaction
was used for the calculation of chemical reaction rate of propane combustion.
The empirical expression for the correction factor for the chemical reaction
rate was used to model the effect of organophosphorous inhibitor no the
reaction. Two series of test calculations for different values of the
correction factor are carried out. Dependences of the minimum extinguishing
concentration of the inhibitor per carbon dioxide volume concentration in the
extinguishing mixtures were obtained. The results of test calculations are
shown to agree reasonably with the experimental data. A calculation of the
compartment fire extinguishment was carried out using the result of test
calculations. Temperature and inhibitor volume concentration fields at the
moment of fire extinguishment are obtained. The results of calculation are used
to find out the optimum position of the extinguish mixture source.
