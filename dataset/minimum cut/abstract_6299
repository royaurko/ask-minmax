Sky spectra were obtained from archival science frames taken with DoLoRes at
the 3.58m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo with a wavelength range ~3800 - 8000Ang
and resolution of 2.8Ang/pix and 3.6Ang/pix. Our spectra include all the
important Sodium and Mercury light pollution lines and span a wide interval of
azimuth and observing conditions, essential to disentangle environmental and
seasonal effects. New sodium and mercury lines were also detected for the first
time at the observatory. Light pollution from NaD_{5892-8} emitted by the LPS
lamps increased by a factor of 1.5 - 2 with respect to the average values of
1998. At the same time, light pollution from Hg lines decreased by ~40% and
reaches the 1998 levels only when observing toward the towns. The contribution
of NaD_{5892-8} from LPS lamps to sky background is 0.05-0.10mag at V-band and
0.07-0.12mag at R-band. Synthetic sky brightness measures calculated from our
spectra at V, B and R bands are in good agreement with those of Benn &
Ellison(1998) if we take into account that our observations were done during
2003, seven years after the last sunspot minimum. The effects of the
application of the Canary Sky Law are directly visible in the spectra as a 50%
dimming of the Hg light-polluting lines in the spectra taken after local
midnight.
