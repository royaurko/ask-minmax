It is shown how pair production itself would prevent the astrophysical
formation of dyadospheres, hypothetical regions where the electric field
exceeds the critical value for rapid Schwinger pair production. Pair production
is a self-regulating process that would discharge a growing electric field, in
the example of a hypothetical collapsing charged stellar core, before it
reached 6% of the minimum dyadosphere value, keeping the pair production rate
more than 26 orders of magnitude below the dyadosphere value, and keeping the
efficiency below 0.0002(M/M_sun)^{1/2}.
