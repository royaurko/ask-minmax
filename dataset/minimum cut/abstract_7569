The 6 billion solar mass supermassive black hole at the center of the giant
elliptical galaxy M87 powers a relativistic jet. Observations at millimeter
wavelengths with the Event Horizon Telescope have localized the emission from
the base of this jet to angular scales comparable to the putative black hole
horizon. The jet might be powered directly by an accretion disk or by
electromagnetic extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole. However,
even the latter mechanism requires a confining thick accretion disk to maintain
the required magnetic flux near the black hole. Therefore, regardless of the
jet mechanism, the observed jet power in M87 implies a certain minimum mass
accretion rate. If the central compact object in M87 were not a black hole but
had a surface, this accretion would result in considerable thermal
near-infrared and optical emission from the surface. Current flux limits on the
nucleus of M87 strongly constrain any such surface emission. This rules out the
presence of a surface and thereby provides indirect evidence for an event
horizon.
