During the total solar eclipse at Akademgorodok, Siberia, Russia, in 1 August
2008, we imaged the flash spectrum with a slitless spectrograph. We have
spectroscopically determined the duration of totality, the epoch of the 2nd and
3rd contacts and the duration of the flash spectrum (63 s during ingress and 48
s during egress). Here we compare the 2008 flash spectra with those that we
similarly obtained from the total solar eclipse of 29 March 2006, at
Kastellorizo, Greece. Any changes of the intensity of the corona emission
lines, in particularly those of [Fe X] and [Fe XIV], could give us valuable
information about the energy content of the solar corona and the temperature
distribution of the corona. The results show that the high-ionization state,
the [Fe XIV] emission line, was much weaker during the 2008 eclipse, indicating
that following the long, inactive period during the solar minimum, there was a
drop in the overall temperature of the solar corona.
