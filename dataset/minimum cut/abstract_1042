We consider the curvaton scenario in the context of supersymmetry (SUSY) with
gravity-mediated SUSY breaking. In the case of a large initial curvaton
amplitude during inflation and a negative order H^2 correction to the mass
squared term after inflation, the curvaton will be close to the minimum of its
potential at the end of inflation. In this case the curvaton amplitude
fluctuations will be damped due to oscillations around the effective minimum of
the curvaton potential, requiring a large expansion rate during inflation in
order to account for the observed energy density perturbations, in conflict
with cosmic microwave background constraints. Here we introduce a new curvaton
scenario, the phase-induced curvaton scenario, in which de Sitter fluctuations
of the phase of a complex SUSY curvaton field induce an amplitude fluctuation
which is unsuppressed even in the presence of a negative order H^2 correction
and large initial curvaton amplitude. This scenario is closely related to the
Affleck-Dine mechanism and a curvaton asymmetry is naturally generated in
conjunction with the energy density perturbations. Cosmological energy density
perturbations can be explained with an expansion rate H ~ 10^12 GeV during
inflation.
