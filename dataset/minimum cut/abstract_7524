A locating-dominating set a of graph $G$ is a dominating set $D$ of $G$ with
the additional property that every two distinct vertices outside $D$ have
distinct neighbors in $D$; that is, for distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ outside
$D$, $N(u) \cap D \ne N(v) \cap D$ where $N(u)$ denotes the open neighborhood
of $u$. A graph is twin-free if every two distinct vertices have distinct open
and closed neighborhoods. The location-domination number of $G$, denoted
$\gamma_L(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a locating-dominating set in $G$.
It is conjectured [D. Garijo, A. Gonz\'alez and A. M\'arquez. Resolving sets
for breaking symmetries of graphs. arXiv pre-print:1401.3686, 2014] that if $G$
is a twin-free graph $G$ of order $n$ without isolated vertices, then
$\gamma_L(G)\le \frac{n}{2}$. We prove the general bound $\gamma_L(G)\le
\frac{2n}{3}$, slightly improving over the $\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\rfloor+1$ bound
of Garijo et al. We then prove the conjecture for split graphs and co-bipartite
graphs. We also provide constructions of graphs reaching the $\frac{n}{2}$
bound, showing that if the conjecture is true, the family of extremal graphs is
a very rich one. Finally, we characterize the trees $G$ that are extremal for
this bound.
