This paper presents a method to merge Generalized Minimum Distance decoding
of Reed-Solomon codes with the extended Euclidean algorithm. By merge, we mean
that the steps taken to perform the Generalized Minimum Distance decoding are
similar to those performed by the extended Euclidean algorithm. The resulting
algorithm has a complexity of O(n^2).
