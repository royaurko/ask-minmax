This paper investigates a general class of viscous regularizations of the
compressible Euler equations. A unique regularization is identified that is
compatible with all the generalized entropies a la Harten and satisfies the
minimum entropy principle. A connection with a recently proposed
phenomenological model by H. Brenner is made.
