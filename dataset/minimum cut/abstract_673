The double-humped structure of many actinide fission barriers is well
established both experimentally and theoretically. There is also evidence, both
experimental and theoretical, that some actinide nuclei have barriers with a
third minimum, outside the second, fission-isomeric minimum. We perform a
large-scale, systematic calculation of actinide fission barriers to identify
which actinide nuclei exhibit third minima. We find that only a relatively few
nuclei accessible to experiment exhibit third minima in their barriers,
approximately nuclei with proton number $Z$ in the range $88 \leq Z \leq 94$
and nucleon number $A$ in the range $230 \leq A \leq 236 $. We find that the
third minimum is less than 1 MeV deep for light Th and U isotopes. This is
consistent with some previous experimental and theoretical results, but differs
from some others. We discuss possible origins of these incompatible results and
what are the most realistic predictions of where third minima are observable.
