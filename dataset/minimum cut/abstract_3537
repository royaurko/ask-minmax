KCuCl$_3$ is a three-dimensional coupled spin-dimer system and has a singlet
ground state with an excitation gap ${\Delta}/k_{\rm B}=31$ K. High-field
magnetization measurements for KCuCl$_3$ have been performed in static magnetic
fields of up to 30 T and in pulsed magnetic fields of up to 60 T. The entire
magnetization curve including the saturation region was obtained at $T=1.3$ K.
  From the analysis of the magnetization curve, it was found that the exchange
parameters determined from the dispersion relations of the magnetic excitations
should be reduced, which suggests the importance of the renormalization effect
in the magnetic excitations. The field-induced magnetic ordering accompanied by
the cusplike minimum of the magnetization was observed as in the isomorphous
compound TlCuCl$_3$. The phase boundary was almost independent of the field
direction, and is represented by the power law. These results are consistent
with the magnon Bose-Einstein condensation picture for field-induced magnetic
ordering.
