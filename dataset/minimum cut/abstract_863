We give a characterization theorem for non-degenerated plane foliations of
degree different from 1 having a rational first integral. Moreover, we prove
that the degree $r$ of a non-degenerated foliation as above provides the
minimum number, $r+1$, of points in the projective plane through which
infinitely many algebraic leaves of the foliation go.
