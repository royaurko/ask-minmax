We consider a supersymmetric model of dark energy coupled to cold dark
matter: the supersymmetron. In the absence of cold dark matter, the
supersymmetron converges to a supersymmetric minimum with a vanishing
cosmological constant. When cold dark matter is present, the supersymmetron
evolves to a matter dependent minimum where its energy density does not vanish.
In the early universe until the recent past of the Universe, the energy density
of the supersymmetron is negligible compared to the cold dark matter energy
density. Away from the supersymmetric minimum, the equation of state of the
supersymmetron is constant and negative. When the supersymmetron reaches the
neighbourhood of the supersymmetric minimum, its equation of state vanishes
rapidly. This leads to an acceleration of the universe which is transient
unless supersymmetry breaking induces a pure cosmological constant and
acceleration of the Universe does not end. Moreover, we find that the mass of
supersymmetron is always greater than the gravitino mass. As a result, the
supersymmetron generates a short ranged fifth force which evades gravitational
tests. On the other hand, we find that the supersymmetron may lead to relevant
effects on large scale structures.
