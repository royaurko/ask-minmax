The minimum skew rank of a simple graph G over the field of real numbers, is
the smallest possible rank among all real skew-symmetric matrices whose
(i,j)-entry (for i not equal to j) is nonzero whenever {i, j} is an edge in G
and is zero otherwise. In this paper we give an algorithm for computing the
minimum skew rank of a connected unicyclic graph, and classify all connected
acyclic and connected unicyclic graphs G, for which the minimum skew rank of G
is equal to the minimum skew rank of P, where P is a diametrical path of G.
