I describe a dynamical mechanism for solving the fine-tuning problem of
brane-antibrane inflation. By inflating with stacks of branes and antibranes,
the branes can naturally be trapped at a metastable minimum of the potential.
As branes tunnel out of this minimum, the shape of the potential changes to
make the minimum shallower. Eventually the minimum disappears and the remaining
branes roll slowly because the potential is nearly flat. I show that even with
a small number of branes, there is a good chance of getting enough inflation.
Running of the spectral index is correlated with the tilt in such a way as to
provide a test of the model by future CMB experiments.
