We study the effectiveness of recovery strategies for a dynamic model of
failure spreading in networks. These strategies control the distribution of
resources based on information about the current network state and network
topology. In order to assess their success, we have performed a series of
simulation experiments. The considered parameters of these experiments are the
network topology, the response time delay and the overall disposition of
resources. Our investigations are focused on the comparison of strategies for
different scenarios and the determination of the most appropriate strategy. The
importance of prompt response and the minimum sufficient quantity of resources
are discussed as well.
