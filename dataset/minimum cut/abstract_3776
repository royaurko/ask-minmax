It is suggested that a large deep underocean neutrino detector, given the
presence of significant numbers of neutrinos in the PeV range as predicted by
various models of Active Galactic Nuclei, can make unique measurements of the
properties of neutrinos. It will be possible to observe the existence of the
nu_tau, measure its mixing with other flavors, in fact test the mixing pattern
for all three flavors based upon the mixing parameters suggested by the
atmospheric and solar neutrino data, and measure the nu_tau cross section. The
key signature is the charged current nu_tau interaction, which produces a
double cascade, one at either end of a minimum ionizing track. At a few PeV
these cascades would be separated by roughly 100 m, and thus be easily
resolvable in DUMAND and similar detectors. Future applications are precise
neutrino astronomy and earth tomography.
