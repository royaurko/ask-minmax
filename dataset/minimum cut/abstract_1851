We calculate the scalar potential of supersymmetric QCD (in the regime N_f <
N_c) coupled to N=1 supergravity with moduli-dependent gauge kinetic function
and masses. The gauge dynamics are described by the
Taylor-Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential for composite effective fields.
The potential can be expanded about the ``truncated'' point in the gaugino and
matter condensate directions in order to find corrections to the globally
supersymmetric minimum. The results are relevant to the phenomenology of
supersymmetry-breaking in string-inspired supergravity models, and also to
recent work on domain walls in SQCD.
