Clan structure analysis in rapidity intervals is generalized from negative
binomial multiplicity distribution to the wide class of compound Poisson
distributions. The link of generalized clan structure analysis with correlation
functions is also established. These theoretical results are then applied to
minimum bias events and evidentiate new interesting features, which can be
inspiring and useful in order to discuss data on rapidity gap probability at
TEVATRON and HERA.
