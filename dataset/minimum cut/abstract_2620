We determine the minimum dimension at which divergences first occur in
half-maximal 16-supercharge supergravity at three loops. For the four-point
amplitudes, we find that the critical dimension is D=14/3 and give the explicit
form of the divergence. We also give the divergence of an additional piece that
gives us access to theories with higher degrees of supersymmetry, in particular
20- and 32-supercharge supergravities. We give the divergences of half-maximal
supergravity when matter vector multiplets are included as well. Explicit forms
of various divergences at one and two loops are also given.
