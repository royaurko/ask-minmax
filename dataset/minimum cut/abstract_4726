UBVI CCD photometry of NGC 2353 is obtained as part of the "Sejong Open
cluster Survey" (SOS). Using the photometric membership criteria we selelct
probable members of the cluster. We derive the reddening and distance to the
cluster, i.e. E(B-V) = 0.10 +/- 0.02 mag and 1.17 +/- 0.04 kpc, respectively.
We find that the projected distribution of the probable members on the sky is
elliptical in shape rather than circular. The age of the cluster is estimated
to be log(age)=8.1 +/- 0.1, older than what was found in previous studies. The
minimum value of binary fraction is estimated to be about 48 +/- 5 percent from
a Gaussian function fit to the distribution of the distance moduli of the
photometric members. Finally, we also obtain the luminosity function and the
initial mass function (IMF). The slope of the IMF is Gamma = -1.3 +/- 0.2.
