Dipolar bilayers with antiparallel polarization, i.e. opposite polarization
in the two layers, exhibit liquid-like rather than gas-like behavior. In
particular, even without external pressure a self-bound liquid puddle of
constant density will form. We investigate the symmetric case of two identical
layers, corresponding to a two-component Bose system with equal partial
densities. The zero-temperature equation of state $E(\rho)/N$, where $\rho$ is
the total density, has a minimum, with an equilibrium density that decreases
with increasing distance between the layers. The attraction necessary for a
self-bound liquid comes from the inter-layer dipole-dipole interaction that
leads to a mediated intra-layer attraction. We investigate the regime of
negative pressure towards the spinodal instability, where the bilayer is
unstable against infinitesimal fluctuations of the total density, conformed by
calculations of the speed of sound of total density fluctuations.
