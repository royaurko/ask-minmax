Minimum energy (ME) source coding is an effective technique for efficient
communication with energy-constrained devices, such as sensor network nodes. In
this paper, the principles of generalized ME source coding is developed that is
broadly applicable. Two scenarios - fixed and variable length codewords - are
analyzed. The application of this technique to RFID systems where ME source
coding is particularly advantageous due to the asymmetric nature of data
communications is demonstrated, a first to the best of our knowledge.
