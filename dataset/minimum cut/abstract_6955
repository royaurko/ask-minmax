We continue our studies on stellar latitudinal differential rotation. The
presented work is a sequel of the work of Reiners et al. who studied the
spectral line broadening profile of hundreds of stars of spectral types A
through G at high rotational speed (vsini > 12 km/s). While most stars were
found to be rigid rotators, only a few tens show the signatures of differential
rotation. The present work comprises the rotational study of some 180
additional stars. The overall broadening profile is derived according to
Reiners et al. from hundreds of spectral lines by least-squares deconvolution,
reducing spectral noise to a minimum. Projected rotational velocities vsini are
measured for about 120 of the sample stars. Differential rotation produces a
cuspy line shape which is best measured in inverse wavelength space by the
first two zeros of its Fourier transform. Rigid and differential rotation can
be distinguished for more than 50 rapid rotators (vsini > 12 km/s) among the
sample stars from the available spectra. Ten stars with significant
differential rotation rates of 10-54 % are identified, which add to the few
known rapid differential rotators. Differential rotation measurements of 6 %
and less for four of our targets are probably spurious and below the detection
limit. Including these objects, the line shapes of more than 40 stars are
consistent with rigid rotation.
