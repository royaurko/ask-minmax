The minimum energy per baryon number of strange quark matter is studied, as a
function of the strangeness fraction, in the MIT bag model and in two different
versions of the Color Dielectric Model: a comparison is made with the hyperon
masses having the same strangeness fraction, and coherently calculated within
both models. Calculations are carried out in mean field approximation, with one
gluon exchange corrections. The results allow to discuss the model dependence
of the stability of strangelets: they can be stable in the MIT bag model and in
the double minimum version of the Color Dielectric Model, while the single
minimum version of the Color Dielectric Model excludes this possibility.
