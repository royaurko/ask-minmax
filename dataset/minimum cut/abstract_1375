The Lexical Access Problem consists of determining the intended sequence of
words corresponding to an input sequence of phonemes (basic speech sounds) that
come from a low-level phoneme recognizer. In this paper we present an
information-theoretic approach based on the Minimum Message Length Criterion
for solving the Lexical Access Problem. We model sentences using phoneme
realizations seen in training, and word and part-of-speech information obtained
from text corpora. We show results on multiple-speaker, continuous, read speech
and discuss a heuristic using equivalence classes of similar sounding words
which speeds up the recognition process without significant deterioration in
recognition accuracy.
