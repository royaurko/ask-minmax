We present an inflationary universe model which utilizes two coupled real
scalar fields. The inflation field $\phi$ experiences a first order phase
transition and its potential dominates the energy density of the Universe
during the inflationary epoch. This field $\phi$ is initially trapped in its
metastable minimum and must tunnel through a potential barrier to reach the
true vacuum. The second auxiliary field $\psi$ couples to the inflaton field
and serves as a catalyst to provide an abrupt end to the inflationary epoch;
i.e., the $\psi$ field produces a time-dependent nucleation rate for bubbles of
true $\phi$ vacuum. In this model, we find that bubbles of true vacuum can
indeed percolate and we argue that thermalization of the interiors can more
easily take place. The required degree of flatness (i.e., the fine tuning) in
the potential of the $\psi$ field is comparable to that of other models which
invoke slowly rolling fields. Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons may naturally
provide the flat potential for the rolling field.
