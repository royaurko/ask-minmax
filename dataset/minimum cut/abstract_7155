At the present time, it is considered that Bose crystals are formed at the
cooling of a fluid, because the state of crystal is more favorable by energy.
It is also believed [1,2] that no ordering factor forming a crystal is present,
except for the interatomic interaction.
  However, the available solutions [1,2,3] for the wave functions (WFs) of the
ground and excited states of a crystal are approximate and are obtained for
cyclic boundary conditions, which are not realized in the Nature. Here, we
present the exact solutions for the WFs of a Bose crystal with rectangular
lattice under natural zero boundary conditions.
  The structure of WFs implies that 1) a crystal is formed by a standing wave
in the probability field; 2) a crystal in the ground state contains a
condensate of atoms with the wave vector \textbf{k}_l=(\pi/\bar{R}_x,
\pi/\bar{R}_y, \pi/\bar{R}_z) (\bar{R}_x, \bar{R}_y, \bar{R}_z are the periods
of the lattice) that is equal to a half of the vector of the reciprocal
lattice. These solutions indicate that the ordering factor forming a crystal is
an intense standing wave similar to a sound one. Thus, the periodicity of a
lattice is caused by that of a sound wave, but not only by the energy minimum
principle. Apparently, the crystals of other types and with different lattices
have the wave nature as well. The condensate opens a possibility to explain the
nonclassical inertia moment discovered by Kim and Chan [4,5] in solid He-4,
which testifies, probably, to the presence of a superfluid subsystem in the
crystal.
