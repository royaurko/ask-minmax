(Abridged) Wavelet analysis can be used to measure the power spectrum of
solar wind fluctuations along a line in any direction with respect to the local
mean magnetic field. This technique is applied to study solar wind turbulence
in high-speed streams in the ecliptic plane near solar minimum using magnetic
field measurements with a cadence of eight vectors per second. The analysis of
nine high-speed streams shows that the reduced spectrum of magnetic field
fluctuations (trace power) is approximately azimuthally symmetric about B_0 in
both the inertial range and dissipation range; in the inertial range the
spectra are characterized by a power-law exponent that changes continuously
from 1.6 \pm 0.1 in the direction perpendicular to the mean field to 2.0 \pm
0.1 in the direction parallel to the mean field. The large uncertainties
suggest that the perpendicular power-law indices 3/2 and 5/3 are both
consistent with the data. The results are similar to those found by Horbury et
al. (2008) at high heliographic latitudes.
