We establish area theorems for iterative detection over coded linear systems
(including multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) channels,
inter-symbol-interference (ISI) channels, and orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) systems). We propose a linear precoding technique that
asymptotically ensures the Gaussianness of the messages passed in iterative
detection, as the transmission block length tends to infinity. We show that the
proposed linear precoding scheme with iterative linear minimum mean-square
error (LMMSE) detection is potentially information lossless, under various
assumptions on the availability of channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT). Numerical results are provided to verify our analysis.
