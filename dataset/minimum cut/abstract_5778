All available mid-eclipse times of the eclipsing binary Z Draconis are
analysed, and two sets of cyclic variations are found. Based on the
light-travel time model, two companions revolve around Z Draconis. The derived
orbital periods suggest that the two companions are in a 2:1 mean-motion
resonance with periods of 59.88 and 29.96 yr. Based on the Keplerian
assumption, the outer companion has the minimum mass of $\sim0.77M_{\bigodot}$,
whereas the inner companion is an M dwarf star with a mass of
$\sim0.40M_{\bigodot}$, suggesting that Z Draconis is a general four-body
system, or a general three-body system if the central eclipsing binary is
treated as a single object. The two-companion, Keplerian model is a reasonable
approximation to the true orbits, but fail to provide the accurate initial
conditions for further analyses of dynamical stability. The discovery will help
us understand the orbital/dynamical properties of such N-body systems.
