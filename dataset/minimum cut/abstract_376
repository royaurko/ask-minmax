Self-dual codes over F5 exist for all even lengths. The smallest length for
which the largest minimum weight among self-dual codes has not been determined
is 24, and the largest minimum weight is either 9 or 10. In this note, we show
that there exists no self-dual [24,12,10] code over F5, using the
classification of 24-dimensional odd unimodular lattices due to Borcherds.
