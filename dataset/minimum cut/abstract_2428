Many applications require the ability to judge uncertainty of time-series
forecasts. Uncertainty is often specified as point-wise error bars around a
mean or median forecast. Due to temporal dependencies, such a method obscures
some information. We would ideally have a way to query the posterior
probability of the entire time-series given the predictive variables, or at a
minimum, be able to draw samples from this distribution. We use a Bayesian
dictionary learning algorithm to statistically generate an ensemble of
forecasts. We show that the algorithm performs as well as a physics-based
ensemble method for temperature forecasts for Houston. We conclude that the
method shows promise for scenario forecasting where physics-based methods are
absent.
