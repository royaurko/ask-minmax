We present the results of broadband dielectric spectroscopy on two glass
formers with strong Johari-Goldstein beta-relaxations. In addition to the
alpha- and beta-relaxation dynamics, the extension of the spectra up to 1 THz
also allows revealing information on the fast beta-process in this class of
materials. There is clear evidence for a fast process contributing in the
region of the high-frequency loss minimum, which is analyzed in terms of the
idealized mode-coupling theory.
