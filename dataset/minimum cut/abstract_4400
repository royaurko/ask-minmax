SU(N) gauge theories, extended with adjoint fermions having periodic boundary
conditions, are confining at high temperature for sufficiently light fermion
mass m. Lattice simulations indicate that this confining region is smoothly
connected to the confining region of low-temperature pure SU(N) gauge theory.
In the high temperature confining region, the one-loop effective potential for
Polyakov loops has a Z(N)-symmetric confining minimum. String tensions
associated with Polyakov loops are smooth functions of m/T. In the magnetic
sector, the Polyakov loop plays a role similar to a Higgs field, leading to a
breaking of SU(N) to U(1)^{N-1}. This is turn yields an effective theory where
magnetic monopoles give rise to string tensions for spatial Wilson loops. These
string tensions are calculable semiclassically. There are many analytical
predictions for the high-temperature region that can be tested by lattice
simulations, but lattice work will be crucial for exploring the crossover from
this region to the low-temperature confining behavior of pure gauge theories.
