Cyclic codes are a subclass of linear codes and have important applications
in data storage systems, and communication systems because of their e?cient
encoding and decoding algorithms. Employing the First Class Whiteman's
generalized cyclotomic sequences with order 4, we describe several cyclic codes
over the ?nite ?eld GF(q) and give their generator polynomials. Additionally,
Lower bounds on the minimum weight of these cyclic codes are presented.
