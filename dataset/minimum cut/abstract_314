Joint equalization and decoding schemes are described for two-dimensional
intersymbol interference (ISI) channels. Equalization is performed using the
minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) criterion. Low-density parity-check codes are
used for error correction. The MMSE schemes are the extension of those proposed
by Tuechler et al. (2002) for one-dimensional ISI channels. Extrinsic
information transfer charts, density evolution, and bit-error rate versus
signal-to-noise ratio curves are used to study the performance of the schemes.
