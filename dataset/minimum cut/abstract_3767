We study the finite temperature phase transition of lattice QCD with an
irrelevant chiral 4-fermion interaction and two massless quark flavours, on
$8^3 \times 4$ and $12^2 \times 24 \times 4$ lattices. The strength of the
4-fermion interaction was reduced to half the minimum value used in previous
simulations, to study how the nature of this phase transition depends on this
additional interaction. We find that the transition remains first order as the
4-fermion coupling is reduced. Extending our earlier studies indicates that for
sufficiently large 4-fermion coupling, the transition is probably second order.
