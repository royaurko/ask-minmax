We have studied the c-axis interlayer magnetoresistance (ILMR), R_c(B) in
graphite. The measurements have been performed on strongly anisotropic highly
oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) samples in magnetic field up to B = 9 T
applied both parallel and perpendicular to the sample c-axis in the temperature
interval 2 K < T < 300 K. We have observed negative magnetoresistance, dR_c/dB
< 0, for B || c-axis above a certain field B_m(T) that reaches its minimum
value B_m = 5.4 T at T = 150 K. The results can be consistently understood
assuming that ILMR is related to a tunneling between zero-energy Landau levels
of quasi-two-dimensional Dirac fermions, in a close analogy with the behavior
reported for alpha-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 [N. Tajima et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102,
176403 (2009)], another multilayer Dirac electron system.
