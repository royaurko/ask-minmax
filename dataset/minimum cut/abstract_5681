We consider first-passage percolation on the multidimensional cubic lattice;
that is, we assign independently to each edge a nonnegative random weight with
a common distribution and consider the induced random graph distance (the
passage time). It was shown by Talagrand that Gaussian concentration for the
lower tail of the passage time holds under an exponential tail assumption on
the edge weights. In this paper, by the entropy method of
Bucheron-Lugosi-Massart, we show that this concentration holds under the
assumption that the minimum of the weights on d bonds has finite second moment.
We use this result to improve Alexander's convergence rate to the asymptotic
shape.
