In order to achieve fault tolerance, highly reliable system often require the
ability to detect errors as soon as they occur and prevent the speared of
erroneous information throughout the system. Thus, the need for codes capable
of detecting and correcting byte errors are extremely important since many
memory systems use b-bit-per-chip organization. Redundancy on the chip must be
put to make fault-tolerant design available. This paper examined several
methods of computer memory systems, and then a proposed technique is designed
to choose a suitable method depending on the organization of memory systems.
The constructed codes require a minimum number of check bits with respect to
codes used previously, then it is optimized to fit the organization of memory
systems according to the requirements for data and byte lengths.
