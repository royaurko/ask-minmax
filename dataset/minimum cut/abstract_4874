River streamflows are excellent climatic indicators since they integrate
precipitation over large areas. Here we follow up on our previous study of the
influence of solar activity on the flow of the Parana River, in South America.
We find that the unusual minimum of solar activity in recent years have a
correlation on very low levels in the Parana's flow, and we report historical
evidence of low water levels during the Little Ice Age. We also study data for
the streamflow of three other rivers (Colorado, San Juan and Atuel), and snow
levels in the Andes. We obtained that, after eliminating the secular trends and
smoothing out the solar cycle, there is a strong positive correlation between
the residuals of both the Sunspot Number and the streamflows, as we obtained
for the Parana. Both results put together imply that higher solar activity
corresponds to larger precipitation, both in summer and in wintertime, not only
in the large basin of the Parana, but also in the Andean region north of the
limit with Patagonia.
