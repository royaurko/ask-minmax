It is shown that under realistic background considerations, an improvement in
Cold Dark Matter sensitivity of several orders of magnitude is expected from a
detector based on superheated liquid droplets. Such devices are totally
insensitive to minimum ionizing radiation while responsive to nuclear recoils
of energies ~ few keV. They operate on the same principle as the bubble
chamber, but offer unattended, continuous, and safe operation at room
temperature and atmospheric pressure.
