Based on numerous experimental data on inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering
in liquids, we assert that the phonon-roton spectrum of elementary excitations,
predicted by Landau for superfluid helium, is a universal property of the
liquid state. We show that the existence of the roton minimum in the spectrum
of collective excitations is caused by the short-range order in liquids. Using
the superfluidity criterion, we assume that one more branch of collective
excitations should exist in He II, whose energy spectrum differs from the
phonon-roton spectrum.
