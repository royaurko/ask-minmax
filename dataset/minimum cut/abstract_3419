We present precise stellar radial velocity measurements for the K giant star
Beta Gem spanning over 25 years. These data show that the long period low
amplitude radial velocity variations found by Hatzes & Cochran (1993) are
long-lived and coherent. An examination of the Ca II K emission, spectral line
shapes from high resolution data (R = 210,000), and Hipparcos photometry show
no significant variations of these quantities with the RV period. These data
confirm the planetary companion hypothesis suggested by Hatzes & Cochran
(1993). An orbital solution assuming a stellar mass of 1.7 M_sun yields a
period, P = 589.6 days, a minimum mass of 2.3 M_Jupiter, and a semi-major axis,
and a = 1.6 AU. The orbit is nearly circular (e = 0.02). Beta Gem is the
seventh intermediate mass star shown to host a sub-stellar companion and
suggests that planet-formation around stars much more massive than the sun may
common.
