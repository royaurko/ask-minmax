We investigate the phase transitions in two-leg ladders systems in the
incommensurate phase, for which the gap is destroyed by a magnetic field
($h_{c1}< h$) and the ladder is not yet totally saturated ($h < h_{c2}$). We
compute quantitatively the correlation functions as a function of the magnetic
field for an isolated strong coupling ladder $J_\perp \gg J_\parallel$ and use
it to study the phase transition occuring in a three dimensional array of
antiferromagnetically coupled ladders. The three dimensional ordering is in the
universality class of Bose condensation of hard core bosons. We compute the
critical temperature $T_c(h)$ as well as various physical quantities such as
the NMR relaxations rate. $T_c$ has an unusual camel-like shape with a local
minimum at $h=(h_{c1}+h_{c2})/2$ and behaves as $T_c \sim (h-h_{c1})^{2/3}$ for
$h\sim h_{c1}$. We discuss the experimental consequences for compounds such as
Cu_2(C_5H_{12}N_2)_2Cl_4
