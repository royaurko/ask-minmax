Recent data on the reaction pD -> (pp) n with a fast forward pp pair with
very small excitation energy is analyzed within a covariant approach based on
the Bethe-Salpeter formalism. It is demonstrated that the minimum
non-relativistic amplitude is completely masked by relativistic effects, such
as Lorentz boost and the negative-energy P components in the 1S_0
Bethe-Salpeter amplitude of the pp pair.
