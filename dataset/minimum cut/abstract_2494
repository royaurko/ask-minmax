In this paper, we prove the asymptotic multipartite version of the
Alon-Yuster theorem, which is a generalization of the Hajnal-Szemer\'edi
theorem: If $k\geq 3$ is an integer, $H$ is a $k$-colorable graph and
$\gamma>0$ is fixed, then, for every sufficiently large $n$ and for every
balanced $k$-partite graph $G$ on $kn$ vertices with each of its corresponding
$\binom{k}{2}$ bipartite subgraphs having minimum degree at least
$(k-1)n/k+\gamma n$, $G$ has a subgraph consisting of $\lfloor n/|V(H)|\rfloor$
vertex-disjoint copies of $H$.
  The proof uses the Regularity method together with linear programming.
