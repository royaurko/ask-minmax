In this paper we consider the finite time minimum survival probability and
ultimate minimum survival probability in a two ? dimensional risk modal
perturbed by diffusion Using some properties of the minimum survival
probability we obtain the equation of the finite time minimum survival
probability and ultimate minimum survival probability that they are satisfied
and, the explicit expressions for ultimate minimum survival probability are
given in a special case.
