I present an analytic method for estimating the errors in fitting a
distribution. A well-known theorem from statistics gives the minimum variance
bound (MVB) for the uncertainty in estimating a set of parameters $\l_i$, when
a distribution function $F(z;\l_1 ... \l_m)$ is fit to $N$ observations of the
quantity(ies) $z$. For example, a power-law distribution (of two parameters $A$
and $\gaml$) is $F(z;A,\gaml) = A z^{-\gaml}$. I present the MVB in a form
which is suitable for estimating uncertainties in problems of astrophysical
interest. For many distributions, such as a power-law distribution or an
exponential distribution in the presence of a constant background, the MVB can
be evaluated in closed form. I give analytic estimates for the variances in
several astrophysical problems including the gallium solar-neutrino experiments
and the measurement of the polarization induced by a weak gravitational lens. I
show that it is possible to make significant improvements in the accuracy of
these experiments by making simple adjustments in how they are carried out or
analyzed. The actual variance may be above the MVB because of the form of the
distribution function and/or the number of observations. I present simple
methods for recognizing when this occurs and for obtaining a more accurate
estimate of the variance than the MVB when it does.
