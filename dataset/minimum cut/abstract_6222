Contrary to naive expectation, diluting the stellar component of the lensing
galaxy in a highly magnified system with smoothly distributed ``dark'' matter
increases rather than decreases the microlensing fluctuations caused by the
remaining stars. For a bright pair of images straddling a critical curve, the
saddlepoint (of the arrival time surface) is much more strongly affected than
the associated minimum. With a mass ratio of smooth matter to microlensing
matter of 4:1, a saddlepoint with a macro-magnification of mu = 9.5 will spend
half of its time more than a magnitude fainter than predicted. The anomalous
flux ratio observed for the close pair of images in MG0414+0534 is a factor of
five more likely than computed by Witt, Mao and Schechter if the smooth matter
fraction is as high as 93%. The magnification probability histograms for
macro-images exhibit distinctly different structure that varies with the smooth
matter content, providing a handle on the smooth matter fraction. Enhanced
fluctuations can manifest themselves either in the temporal variations of a
lightcurve or as flux ratio anomalies in a single epoch snapshot of a multiply
imaged system. While the millilensing simulations of Metcalf and Madau also
give larger anomalies for saddlepoints than for minima, the effect appears to
be less dramatic for extended subhalos than for point masses. Morever,
microlensing is distinguishable from millilensing because it will produce
noticeable changes in the magnification on a time scale of a decade or less.
