Let $Z \subseteq \proj{n}$ be a fat points scheme, and let $d(Z)$ be the
minimum distance of the linear code constructed from $Z$. We show that $d(Z)$
imposes constraints (i.e., upper bounds) on some specific shifts in the graded
minimal free resolution of $I_Z$, the defining ideal of $Z$. We investigate
this relation in the case that the support of $Z$ is a complete intersection;
when $Z$ is reduced and a complete intersection we give lower bounds for $d(Z)$
that improve upon known bounds.
