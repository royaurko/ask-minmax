Using first-principles calculations, we systematically study the potential
energy surfaces and dissociation processes for hydrogen molecules on the clean
and hydrogen-preadsorbed Be(0001) surfaces. It is found that the most
energetically favored dissociation channel for H2 molecules on the clean Be
surface is at the surface top site, with the minimum energy barrier of 0.75 eV.
It is further found that after dissociation, hydrogen atoms do not like to
cluster with each other, as well as to penetrate into subsurface sites. For the
hydrogen-preadsorbed Be(0001) surface, the smallest dissociation energy barrier
for H2 molecules is found to be 0.50 eV, which is smaller than the dissociation
energy barrier on a clean Be(0001) surface. The critical dependence of the
dissociation energy barriers for H2 molecules on their horizontal distances
from the preadsorbed hydrogen atom is revealed. Our studies well describe the
adsorption behaviors of hydrogen on the Be(0001) surface.
