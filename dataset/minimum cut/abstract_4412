To measure the floor in interplanetary magnetic field and estimate the time-
invariant open magnetic flux of Sun, it is necessary to know a part of magnetic
field of Sun carried away by CMEs. In contrast with previous papers, we did not
use global solar parameters: we identified different large-scale types of solar
wind for 1976-2000 interval, obtained a fraction of interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs)
and calculated magnitude of interplanetary magnetic field B averaged over 2
Carrington rotations. The floor of magnetic field is estimated as B value at
solar cycle minimum when the ICMEs were not observed and it was calculated to
be 4,65 \pm 6,0 nT. Obtained value is in a good agreement with previous
results.
