We study Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity models in four-dimensional anti-de
Sitter (AdS) spacetime which admit the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole
solution. We show that below a critical temperature the AdS-RN solution becomes
unstable against scalar perturbations and the gravitational system undergoes a
phase transition. We show using numerical calculations that the new phase is a
charged dilatonic black hole. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we discuss the
phase transition in the dual field theory both for non-vanishing temperatures
and in the extremal limit. The extremal solution has a Lifshitz scaling
symmetry. We discuss the optical conductivity in the new dual phase and find
interesting behavior at low frequencies where it shows a "Drude peak". The
resistivity varies with temperature in a non-monotonic way and displays a
minimum at low temperatures which is reminiscent of the celebrated Kondo
effect.
