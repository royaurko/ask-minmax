The value of the Prandtl number $P$ exerts a strong influence on
convection-driven dynamos in rotating spherical shells filled with electrically
conducting fluids. Low Prandtl numbers promote dynamo action through the shear
provided by differential rotation, while the generation of magnetic fields is
more difficult to sustain in high-Prandtl-number fluids where higher values of
the magnetic Prandtl number $P_m$ are required. The magnetostrophic
approximation often used in dynamo theory appears to be valid only for
relatively high values of $P$ and $P_m$. Dynamos with a minimum value of $P_m$
seem to be most readily realizable in the presence of convection columns at
moderately low values of $P$. The structure of the magnetic field varies
strongly with $P$ in that dynamos with a strong axial dipole field are found
for high values of $P$ while the energy of this component is exceeded by that
of the axisymmetric toroidal field and by that of the non-axisymmetric
components at low values of $P$. Some conclusions are discussed in relation to
the problem of the generation of planetary magnetic fields by motions in their
electrically conducting liquid cores.
