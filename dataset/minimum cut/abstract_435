We report on the first measurements of the LHCb experiment, as obtained from
$pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 0.9$ TeV and 7 TeV recorded using a minimum bias
trigger. In particular measurements of the absolute $K^0_S$ production cross
section at $\sqrt{s} = 0.9$ TeV and of the $\bar{\Lambda}/\Lambda$ ratio both
at $\sqrt{s} = 0.9$ TeV and 7 TeV are discussed and preliminary results are
presented.
