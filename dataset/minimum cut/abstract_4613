The monthly average values of the main solar activity indices such as Wolf
numbers (W), 10,7 cm radio flux (F10,7), 0,1-0,8 nm background, total solar
irradiance and Mg II UV-index (280 nm core to wing ratio) were studied for 23
activity cycle. The correlation coefficients of linear regression for main
solar activity indices versus F10,7 were analyzed for every year of 23 activity
cycle. All the correlation coefficients for 23 activity cycle have the minimum
values in 2001. We also analyzed the connection between monthly average values
of the most popular indices W and F10,7 for 21, 22 and 23 solar activity
cycles. The values of every year linear regression correlation coefficients for
W versus F10,7 show the cyclic variations with period closed to half path of
so-called 11-year period of solar activity.
