Data transmission over a communication channel is prone to a number of
factors that can render the data unreliable or inconsistent by introducing
noise, crosstalk or various other disturbances. A mechanism has to be in place
that detects these anomalies in the received data and corrects it to get the
data back as it was meant to be sent by the sender. Over the years a number of
error detection and correction methodologies have been devised to send and
receive the data in a consistent and correct form. The best of these
methodologies ensure that the data is received correctly by the receiver in
minimum number of retransmissions. In this paper performance of Reed Solomon
Code (RS) and BCH Code is compared over Rayleigh fading channel.
