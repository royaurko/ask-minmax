Maunder Minimum forms an archetype for the Grand minima, and detailed
knowledge of its temporal development has important consequences for the solar
dynamo theory dealing with long-term solar activity evolution. Here we
reconsider the current paradigm of the Grand minimum general scenario by using
newly recovered sunspot observations by G. Marcgraf and revising some earlier
uncertain data for the period 1636--1642, i.e., one solar cycle before the
beginning of the Maunder Minimum. The new and revised data dramatically change
the magnitude of the sunspot cycle just before the Maunder Minimum, from 60--70
down to about 20, implying a possibly gradual onset of the Minimum with reduced
activity started two cycles before it. This revised scenario of the Maunder
Minimum changes, through the paradigm for Grand solar/stellar activity minima,
the observational constraint on the solar/stellar dynamo theories focused on
long-term studies and occurrence of Grand minima.
