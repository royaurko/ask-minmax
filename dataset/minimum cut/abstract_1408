We have obtained the supersymmetric extension of spectral triple which
specify a noncommutative geometry(NCG). We assume that the functional space H
constitutes of wave functions of matter fields and their superpartners included
in the minimum supersymmetric standard model(MSSM). We introduce the internal
fluctuations to the Dirac operator on the manifold as well as on the finite
space by elements of the algebra A in the triple. So, we obtain not only the
vector supermultiplets which meditate SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)_Y gauge degrees of
freedom but also Higgs supermultiplets which appear in MSSM on the same
standpoint. Accoding to the supersymmetric version of the spectral action
principle, we calculate the square of the fluctuated total Dirac operator and
verify that the Seeley-DeWitt coeffients give the correct action of MSSM. We
also verify that the relation between coupling constants of $SU(3)$,$SU(2)$ and
$U(1)_Y$ is same as that of SU(5) unification theory.
