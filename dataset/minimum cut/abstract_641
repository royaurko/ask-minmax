In this paper, I review the results of 3-D evolution of the inner heliosphere
over the solar cycle #23, based on observations of interplanetary scintillation
(IPS) made at 327 MHz using the Ooty Radio Telescope. The large-scale features
of solar wind speed and density turbulence of the current minimum are
remarkably different from that of the previous cycle. The results on the solar
wind density turbulence show that (1) the current solar minimum is experiencing
a low level of coronal density turbulence, to a present value of ~50% lower
than the previous similar phase, and (2) the scattering diameter of the corona
has decreased steadily after the year 2003. The results on solar wind speed are
consistent with the magnetic-field strength at the poles and the warping of
heliospheric current sheet.
