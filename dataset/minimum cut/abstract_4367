We report results on quarkonium production from the STAR experiment at the
Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). J/psi spectra in p+p and Cu+Cu
collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV with transverse momenta in the range of 0.5-14
GeV/c and 5-8 GeV/c, respectively, are presented. We find that for p_T > 5
GeV/c yields in p+p collisions are consistent with those in minimum-bias Cu+Cu
collisions scaled with the respective number of binary nucleon-nucleon
collisions. In this range the nuclear modification factor, R_AA, is measured to
be 0.9+-0.2(stat). For the first time at RHIC, high-p_T J/psi-hadron
correlations were studied in p+p collisions. Implications from our measurements
on J/psi production mechanisms, constraints on open bottom yields, and J/psi
dissociation mechanisms at high-p_T are discussed. In addition, we give a brief
status of measurements of Upsilon production in p+p and Au+Au collisions and
present projections of future quarkonia measurements based on an upgrades to
the STAR detector and increased luminosity achieved through stochastic cooling
of RHIC.
