We present a measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
gravitational lensing potential using data from the first two seasons of
observations with SPTpol, the polarization-sensitive receiver currently
installed on the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The observations used in this work
cover 100 deg$^2$ of sky with arcminute resolution at 150 GHz. Using a
quadratic estimator, we make maps of the CMB lensing potential from
combinations of CMB temperature and polarization maps. We combine these lensing
potential maps to form a minimum-variance (MV) map. The lensing potential is
measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than one for angular
multipoles between $100< L <250$. This is the highest signal-to-noise mass map
made from the CMB to date and will be powerful in cross-correlation with other
tracers of large-scale structure. We calculate the power spectrum of the
lensing potential for each estimator, and we report the value of the MV power
spectrum between $100< L <2000$ as our primary result. We constrain the ratio
of the spectrum to a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model to be $A_{\rm MV}=0.92 \pm
0.14 {\rm\, (Stat.)} \pm 0.08 {\rm\, (Sys.)}$. Restricting ourselves to
polarized data only, we find $A_{\rm POL}=0.92 \pm 0.24 {\rm\, (Stat.)} \pm
0.11 {\rm\, (Sys.)}$. This measurement rejects the hypothesis of no lensing at
$5.9 \sigma$ using polarization data alone, and at $14 \sigma$ using both
temperature and polarization data.
