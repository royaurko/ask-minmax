In this paper, we study the p-ary linear code C(PG(n, q)), q = p^h, p prime,
h >= 1, generated by the incidence matrix of points and hyperplanes of a
Desarguesian projective space PG(n, q), and its dual code. We link the
codewords of small weight of this code to blocking sets with respect to lines
in PG(n, q) and we exclude all possible codewords arising from small linear
blocking sets. We also look at the dual code of C(PG(n,q)) and we prove that
find- ing the minimum weight of the dual code can be reduced to finding the
minimum weight of the dual code of points and lines in PG(2, q). We present an
improved upper bound on this minimum weight and we show that we can drop the
divisibility condition on the weight of the codewords in Sachar's lower bound
[12].
