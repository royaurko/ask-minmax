We have applied an effective numerical scheme for cosmic-ray transport to 3D
MHD simulations of jet flow in radio galaxies (see the companion paper by Jones
et al. 1999). The marriage of relativistic particle and 3D magnetic field
information allows us to construct a rich set of ``synthetic observations'' of
our simulated objects. The information is sufficient to calculate the ``true''
synchrotron emissivity at a given frequency using explicit information about
the relativistic electrons. This enables us to produce synchrotron
surface-brightness maps, including polarization. Inverse-Compton X-ray
surface-brightness maps may also be produced. First results intended to explore
the connection between jet dynamics and electron transport in radio lobes are
discussed. We infer lobe magnetic field values by comparison of synthetically
observed X-ray and synchrotron fluxes, and find these ``inverse-Compton''
fields to be quite consistent with the actual RMS field averaged over the lobe.
The simplest minimum energy calculation from the synthetic observations also
seems to agree with the actual simulated source properties.
