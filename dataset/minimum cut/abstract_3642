The Haldane system PbNi2V2O8 was investigated by the temperature dependent
magnetization M(T) measurements at fields higher than H_c, with H_c the
critical fields necessary to close the Haldane gap. It is revealed that M(T)
for H > H_c exhibits a cusp-like minimum at T_{min}, below which M(T) increases
with decreasing T having a convex curve. These features have been observed for
both $H \parallel c$ and $H \perp c$, with c-axis being parallel to the chain.
These data indicate the occurrence of field-induced magnetic ordering around
T_{min}. Phase boundaries for $H \parallel c$ and $H \perp c$ do not cross each
other, consistent with the theoretical calculation for negative single-ion
anisotropy D.
