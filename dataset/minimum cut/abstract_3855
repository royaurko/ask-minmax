We have investigated moduli stabilization leading to hierarchical
supersymmetry breakdown in racetrack models with two moduli fields
simultaneously present in the effective racetrack superpotential. We have shown
that stabilization of moduli occurs when a shift symmetry of the moduli space
becomes gauged. This gauging results in a D-term contribution to the scalar
potential that depends on moduli scalars. To break supersymmetry at a minimum
created this way in the case where only a single combination of moduli is
present in the superpotential one needs supergravity corrections. If the
superpotential depends on two independent combinations of moduli, supersymmetry
is broken by non-vanishing F-terms without supergravity terms. Some of the
minima that we see correspond to a non-vanishing expectation value of the
blowing-up modulus in the case of type IIB orientifold models. We point out
that the mass of the gauge boson associated with gauged shift symmetry becomes
naturally light in warped compactifications.
