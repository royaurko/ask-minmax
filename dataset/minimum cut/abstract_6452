A global network of laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors is
projected to be in operation by around the turn of the century. Here, the noisy
output of a single instrument is examined. A gravitational wave is assumed to
have been detected in the data and we deal with the subsequent problem of
parameter estimation. Specifically, we investigate theoretical lower bounds on
the minimum mean-square errors associated with measuring the parameters of the
inspiral waveform generated by an orbiting system of neutron stars/black holes.
Three theoretical lower bounds on parameter estimation accuracy are considered:
the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB); the Weiss-Weinstein bound (WWB); and the Ziv-Zakai
bound (ZZB). We obtain the WWB and ZZB for the Newtonian-form of the coalescing
binary waveform, and compare them with published CRB and numerical Monte-Carlo
results. At large SNR, we find that the theoretical bounds are all identical
and are attained by the Monte-Carlo results. As SNR gradually drops below 10,
the WWB and ZZB are both found to provide increasingly tighter lower bounds
than the CRB. However, at these levels of moderate SNR, there is a significant
departure between all the bounds and the numerical Monte-Carlo results.
