We find that the ROSAT source 1RXS J105010.3-140431 is a cataclysmic variable
with orbital period of 88.6 minutes and a spectrum closely resembling WZ Sge.
In particular, emission lines are flanked by Stark-broadened absorption wings
probably originating in the photosphere of a compact object. The Balmer
absorption lines can be modeled by the spectrum of a DA white dwarf with 13 000
$< T_{eff} <$ 24 000 K. The strong absorption lines allowed us to obtain direct
radial velocities of the white dwarf using the cross-correlation technique. We
find an extremely low white dwarf radial velocity half amplitude, $K_{wd}$ = 4
$\pm$ 1 km s$^{-1}$. This is consistent with the upper limit obtained from the
H$\alpha$ emission line wing K < 20 km s$^{-1}$. The corresponding mass
function is incompatible with a main sequence secondary, but is compatible with
a post orbital period minimum cataclysmic variable with a brown dwarf-like
secondary. The formal solution gives a secondary mass of 10-20 jovian masses.
Doppler maps for the emission lines and the hypothesis of black-body emission
indicate a steady state (T $\sim r^{-3/4}$) accretion disk mainly emitting in
H$\alpha$ and an optically thicker hotspot with a strong contribution to the
higher order Balmer lines and \ion{He}{I} 5875. As in other long cycle length
dwarf novae, evidence for inner disk removal is found from the analysis of the
emission lines.
