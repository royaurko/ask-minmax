We study the contact resistance and the transfer characteristics of
back-gated field effect transistors of mono- and bi-layer graphene. We measure
specific contact resistivity of ~7kohm*um2 and ~30kohm*um2 for Ni and Ti,
respectively. We show that the contact resistance is a significant contributor
to the total source-to-drain resistance and it is modulated by the back-gate
voltage. We measure transfer characteristics showing double dip feature that we
explain as the effect of doping due to charge transfer from the contacts
causing minimum density of states for graphene under the contacts and in the
channel at different gate voltage.
