We consider here solutions of the nonlinear fractional Schr\"odinger equation
$$\epsilon^{2s}(-\Delta)^s u+V(x)u=u^p.$$ We show that concentration points
must be critical points for $V$. We also prove that, if the potential $V$ is
coercive and has a unique global minimum, then ground states concentrate
suitably at such minimal point as $\epsilon$ tends to zero. In addition, if the
potential $V$ is radial, then the minimizer is unique provided $\epsilon$ is
small.
