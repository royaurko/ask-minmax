We investigate transresistance effects in electron-hole double layer systems
with an excitonic condensate. Our theory is based on the use of a minimum
dissipation premise to fix the current carried by the condensate. We find that
the drag resistance jumps discontinuously at the condensation temperature and
diverges as the temperature approaches zero.
