Most papers on high-dimensional statistics are based on the assumption that
none of the regressors are correlated with the regression error, namely, they
are exogenous. Yet, endogeneity can arise incidentally from a large pool of
regressors in a high-dimensional regression. This causes the inconsistency of
the penalized least-squares method and possible false scientific discoveries. A
necessary condition for model selection consistency of a general class of
penalized regression methods is given, which allows us to prove formally the
inconsistency claim. To cope with the incidental endogeneity, we construct a
novel penalized focused generalized method of moments (FGMM) criterion
function. The FGMM effectively achieves the dimension reduction and applies the
instrumental variable methods. We show that it possesses the oracle property
even in the presence of endogenous predictors, and that the solution is also
near global minimum under the over-identification assumption. Finally, we also
show how the semi-parametric efficiency of estimation can be achieved via a
two-step approach.
