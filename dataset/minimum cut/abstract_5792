Consider the network of all secondary structures of a given RNA sequence,
where nodes are connected when the corresponding structures have base pair
distance one. The expected degree of the network is the average number of
neighbors, where average may be computed with respect to the either the uniform
or Boltzmann probability. Here we describe the first algorithm, RNAexpNumNbors,
that can compute the expected number of neighbors, or expected network degree,
of an input sequence. For RNA sequences from the Rfam database, the expected
degree is significantly less than the CMFE structure, defined to have minimum
free energy over all structures consistent with the Rfam consensus structure.
The expected degree of structural RNAs, such as purine riboswitches,
paradoxically appears to be smaller than that of random RNA, yet the difference
between the degree of the MFE structure and the expected degree is larger than
that of random RNA. Expected degree does not seem to correlate with standard
structural diversity measures of RNA, such as positional entropy, ensemble
defect, etc. The program {\tt RNAexpNumNbors} is written in C, runs in cubic
time and quadratic space, and is publicly available at
