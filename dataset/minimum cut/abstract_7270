We developed a method to automatically detect and trace solar filaments in
H\alpha\ full-disk images. The program is able not only to recognize filaments
and determine their properties, such as the position, the area, the spine, and
other relevant parameters, but also to trace the daily evolution of the
filaments. The program consists of three steps: First, preprocessing is applied
to correct the original images; Second, the Canny edge-detection method is used
to detect filaments; Third, filament properties are recognized through the
morphological operators. To test the algorithm, we applied it to the
observations from the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO), and the program is
demonstrated to be robust and efficient. H\alpha\ images obtained by MLSO from
1998 to 2009 are analyzed, and a butterfly diagram of filaments is obtained. It
shows that the latitudinal migration of solar filaments has three trends in the
Solar Cycle 23: The drift velocity was fast from 1998 to the solar maximum;
After the solar maximum, it became relatively slow. After 2006, the migration
became divergent, signifying the solar minimum. About 60% filaments with the
latitudes larger than $50^{\circ}$ migrate towards the polar regions with
relatively high velocities, and the latitudinal migrating speeds in the
northern and the southern hemispheres do not differ significantly in the Solar
Cycle 23.
