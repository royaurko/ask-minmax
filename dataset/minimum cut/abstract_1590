We study the effect of variations of the electromagnetic coupling on the
process of generation of primordial magnetic fields. We find that only through
a significant growth of the electromagnetic coupling minimum seed fields can be
produced. We also show that, if through some process in the early Universe the
photon acquires a mass that leads, thanks to inflation, to the generation of
primordial magnetic fields, then the influence of variations of the
electromagnetic coupling amounts essentially to the results due to the photon
effective mass alone.
