The purpose of this article is to introduce, analyze and compare two
performance participation methods based on a portfolio consisting of two risky
assets: Option-Based Performance Participation (OBPP) and Constant Proportion
Performance Participation (CPPP). By generalizing the provided guarantee to a
participation in the performance of a second risky underlying, the new
strategies allow to cope with well-known problems associated with standard
portfolio insurance methods, like e.g. the CPPI cash lock-in. This is
especially an issue in times of market crisis. However, the minimum guaranteed
portfolio value at the end of the investment horizon is not deterministic
anymore, but subject to systematic risk instead. With respect to the comparison
of the two strategies, various criteria are applied such as comparison of
terminal payoffs and payoff distributions. General analytical expressions for
all moments of both performance participation strategies as well as standard
OBPI and CPPI are derived. Furthermore, dynamic hedging properties are
examined, in particular classical delta hedging.
