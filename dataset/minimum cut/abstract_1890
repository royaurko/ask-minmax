The n-th hull of a union of curves in R^3 is the set of points with the
property: Any plane passing through the point intersects the curves at least 2n
times. The hull number u(L) of a link L is defined as the minimum number of
non-empty hulls a representative of L can have. We show that the hull numbers
of torus links are smaller than expected, but still large. In particular, for a
link of type (p,p) hull number equals 3p/5, and in general for the type (p,q)
with q>p it is greater than or equal to p/2.
