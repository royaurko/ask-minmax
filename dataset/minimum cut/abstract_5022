A precise radial velocity survey conducted by a Korean-Japanese planet search
program revealed a planetary companion around the intermediate-mass clump giant
HD 100655. The radial velocity of the star exhibits a periodic Keplerian
variation with a period, semi-amplitude and eccentricity of 157.57 d, 35.2 m
s^-1 and 0.085, respectively. Adopting an estimated stellar mass of 2.4 M_Sun,
we confirmed the presence of a planetary companion with a semi-major axis of
0.76 AU and a minimum mass of 1.7 M_Jup. The planet is the lowest-mass planet
yet discovered around clump giants with masses greater than 1.9 M_Sun.
