We analyze ROSAT data for cluster gas surrounding powerful radio galaxies,
which is well fitted by a ``beta-model'' gas distribution, after allowing for a
compact central source. The cluster thermal pressure at the distance of the
radio lobes is typically an order of magnitude larger than the lobe minimum
pressure. Since radio lobes are sharply-bounded, the missing pressure is not
simply entrained intra-cluster gas. Thus the minimum energy in the lobes is a
severe underestimate of the actual energy content. We argue that the extra
energy is mostly in the form of particles, so that the magnetic field is below
equipartition and thus not a major factor in the lobe dynamics. The large
departure from minimum energy has far-reaching implications for the nature of
AGN central engines and the supply of mechanical energy to the cluster gas.
