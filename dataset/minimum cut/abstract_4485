With the aim of describing real-time electron dynamics, we introduce an
adiabatic approximation for the equation of motion of the one-body
reduced-density matrix (one-matrix). The eigenvalues of the one-matrix, which
represent the occupation numbers of single-particle orbitals, are obtained from
the constrained minimization of the instantaneous ground state energy
functional rather than from their dynamical equations. To clarify the
motivation for this minimization condition, we discuss a sequence of adiabatic
energy functionals, each obeying a minimum principle. The performance of the
approximation vis-a`-vis nonadiabatic effects is assessed in real-time
simulations for a two-site Hubbard model. Due to the presence of
Landau-Zener-type transitions, the system evolves into a nonstationary state
with persistent oscillations in the observables. The amplitude and phase of the
oscillations exhibit resonance behavior both with respect to the strength of
the electron-electron interaction and the rate of variation of the external
potential. Both types of resonances have the same origin -- the interference of
dynamical and scattering phases.
