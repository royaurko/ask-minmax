The conventional approach to calculation of the radion effective potential in
the string theory inspired models with magnetic fluxbrane throat-like
space-time compactified on a sphere gives the analytical expressions hopefully
capable to describe early inflation. Potential is rather flat inside the
throat, possesses steep slope for reheating in vicinity of the top of the
throat, and zero minimum at the top where UV brane's position is stabilized by
the anisotropic junction conditions. The form of the effective radion potential
is unambiguously determined by the choice of the theory. The D10 Type IIA
supergravity proves to be of special interest. In this theory the observed
large value of the electro-weak hierarchy may be received. The Euclidian "time"
version of the Schwarzshild type non-extremal generalization of the elementary
fluxbrane solution is used as a tool to fix the additional modulus - size of
extra torus and to construct a smooth IR end of the throat; it also permits to
estimate the small deviation of the radion effective potential from its zero
value in the minimum which may be seen today as Dark Energy density. Thus most
familiar fluxbrane solution proves to be rich enough in its possible physical
predictions.
