Precision Doppler velocity measurements from the 3.9--m Anglo-Australian
Telescope reveal a planet with a 6 year period orbiting the G5 dwarf HD 70642.
The a = 3.3 AU orbit has a low eccentricity (e = 0.1), and the minimum (\msini)
mass of the planet is 2.0 \mjup. The host star is metal rich relative to the
Sun, similar to most stars with known planets. The distant and approximately
circular orbit of this planet makes it a member of a rare group to emerge from
precision Doppler surveys.
