We continue developing cosmological models involving nilpotent chiral
superfields, which provide a simple unified description of inflation and the
current acceleration of the universe in the supergravity context. We describe
here a general class of models with a positive cosmological constant at the
minimum of the potential, such that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in
the direction of the nilpotent superfield $S$. In the unitary gauge, these
models have a simple action where all highly non-linear fermionic terms of the
classical Volkov-Akulov action disappear. We present masses for bosons and
fermions in these theories. By a proper choice of parameters in this class of
models, one can fit any possible set of the inflationary parameters $n_{s}$ and
$r$, a broad range of values of the vacuum energy $V_{0}$, which plays the role
of the dark energy, and achieve a controllable level of supersymmetry breaking.
This can be done without introducing light moduli, such as Polonyi fields,
which often lead to cosmological problems in phenomenological supergravity.
