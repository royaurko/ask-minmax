The optical scattering coefficient of a dilute, well solubilised eumelanin
solution has been accurately measured as a function of incident wavelength, and
found to contribute less than 6% of the total optical attenuation between 210
and 325nm. At longer wavelengths (325nm to 800nm) the scattering was less than
the minimum sensitivity of our instrument. This indicates that UV and visible
optical density spectra can be interpreted as true absorption with a high
degree of confidence. The scattering coefficient vs wavelength was found to be
consistent with Rayleigh Theory for a particle radius of 38+-1nm.
