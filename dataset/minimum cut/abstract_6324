The curl (B) modes of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization
anisotropies are a unique probe of the primordial background of inflationary
gravitational waves (IGWs). Unfortunately, the B-mode polarization anisotropies
generated by gravitational waves at recombination are confused with those
generated by the mixing of gradient-mode (E-mode) and B-mode polarization
anisotropies as CMB photons propagate through the Universe and are
gravitationally lensed. We describe here a method for delensing CMB
polarization anisotropies using observations of anisotropies in the cosmic
21-cm radiation emitted or absorbed by neutral hydrogen atoms at redshifts 10
to 200. While the detection of cosmic 21-cm anisotropies at high resolution is
challenging, a combined study with a relatively low-resolution (but
high-sensitivity) CMB polarization experiment could probe inflationary energy
scales well below the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale of 10^{16} GeV --
constraining models with energy scales below 10^{15} GeV (the detectable limit
derived from CMB observations alone). The ultimate theoretical limit to the
detectable inflationary energy scale via this method may be as low as 3 \times
10^{14} GeV.
