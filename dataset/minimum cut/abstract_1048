We analyze a minimal bottom-up seesaw scenario where we require the theory to
satisfy three phenomenological conditions: (i)it is supersymmetric; (ii) it has
a local B-L symmetry as part of the SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} gauge theory
to implement the seesaw mechanism and (iii) B-L symmetry breaking is such that
it leaves R-parity unbroken giving a naturally stable dark matter. We show that
in such a theory, one can predict the seesaw scale for neutrino masses to be
M_R ~ \sqrt{M_{SUSY} M_{Pl}} ~ 10^{11} GeV. We show that the ground state with
this property is a stable minimum and is lower than possible electric charge
violating minimum in this theory. Such models in their generic version are
known to predict the existence of a light doubly charged Higgs boson and
Higgsino which can be searched for in collider experiments. We give expressions
for their masses in this minimal version. We then indicate how one can get
different expectation values for the MSSM Higgs doublets in the theory required
to have realistic quark masses.
