Minimum-weight triangulation (MWT) is NP-hard. It has a polynomial-time
constant-factor approximation algorithm, and a variety of effective polynomial-
time heuristics that, for many instances, can find the exact MWT. Linear
programs (LPs) for MWT are well-studied, but previously no connection was known
between any LP and any approximation algorithm or heuristic for MWT. Here we
show the first such connections: for an LP formulation due to Dantzig et al.
(1985): (i) the integrality gap is bounded by a constant; (ii) given any
instance, if the aforementioned heuristics find the MWT, then so does the LP.
