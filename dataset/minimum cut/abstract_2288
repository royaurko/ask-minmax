More than half a million minimum-bias events of LHC collision data were
collected by the ATLAS experiment in December 2009 at centre-of-mass energies
of 0.9 TeV and 2.36 TeV. This paper reports on studies of the initial
performance of the ATLAS detector from these data. Comparisons between data and
Monte Carlo predictions are shown for distributions of several track- and
calorimeter-based quantities. The good performance of the ATLAS detector in
these first data gives confidence for successful running at higher energies.
