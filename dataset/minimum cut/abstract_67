We investigate the behavior of the intermediate-degree mode frequencies of
the sun during the current extended minimum phase to explore the time-varying
conditions in the solar interior. Using contemporaneous helioseismic data from
GONG and MDI, we find that the changes in resonant mode frequencies during the
activity minimum period are significantly greater than the changes in solar
activity as measured by different proxies. We detect a seismic minimum in MDI
p-mode frequency shifts during 2008 July--August but no such signature is seen
in mean shifts computed from GONG frequencies. We also analyze the frequencies
of individual oscillation modes from GONG data as a function of latitude and
observe a signature of the onset of the solar cycle 24 in early 2009. Thus the
intermediate degree modes do not confirm the onset of the cycle 24 during late
2007 as reported from the analysis of the low-degree GOLF frequencies. Further,
both the GONG and MDI frequencies show a surprising anti-correlation between
frequencies and activity proxies during the current minimum, in contrast to the
behavior during the minimum between cycles 22 and 23.
