Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are considered the young counterparts of
large doubles according to advance speeds measured or inferred from spectral
ageing. Here we present a simple power law model for the CSO/FRII evolution
based on the study of sources with well defined hot-spots. The luminosity of
the hot spots is estimated under minimum energy conditions. The advance of the
source is considered to proceed in ram pressure equilibrium with the ambient
medium. Finally, we also assume that the jets feeding the hot spots are
relativistic and have a time dependent power. Comparison with observational
data allows to interpret the CSO-FRII evolution in terms of decreasing jet
power with time.
