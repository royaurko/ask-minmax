Finite size effects in the multicriticity point and boundaries between phases
 are calculated. There are anomalous large finite size effects on the boundary
of ferromagnetic phase with paramagnetic or spin-glass. Multicriticity point is
not giving global minimum for the finite size corrections of free energy.
