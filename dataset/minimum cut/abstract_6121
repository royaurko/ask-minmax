We have combined Hubble Space Telescope/Faint Object Spectrograph,
ground-based, and Infrared Space Observatory spectra of the nucleus of NGC
4395, the least luminous and nearest known type 1 Seyfert galaxy. The spectra
show emission lines from a wide range of ionization states and critical
densities. We have generated multicomponent photoionization models of both the
broad and narrow emission-line regions (BLR and NLR) to investigate the
physical conditions in the emission-line gas and test the proposition that the
source of ionization is the non-thermal continuum radiation emitted by the
central source. We show that, with a minimum of free parameters, the model
predictions match the observed emission-line ratios quite well. The elemental
abundances appear to be subsolar, with even greater underabundance of
nitrogen.From the size of the BLR predicted by the models, we estimate a
central mass of a few x 10^5 solar masses, in reasonable agreement with
estimates from the stellar kinematics. Finally, our results suggest that the
covering factor of the emission-line gas is close to unity, and that the
observed UV to X-ray continuum is absorbed by intervening NLR gas. We argue
that high covering factor is responsible for the apparent flattening of the
Baldwin relation in low luminosity AGN.
