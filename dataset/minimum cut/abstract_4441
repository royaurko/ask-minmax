We search for persistent and quasi-periodic release events of streamer blobs
during 2007 with the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph on the \textit{Solar
and Heliospheric Observatory} and assess the velocity of the slow solar wind
along the plasma sheet above the corresponding streamer by measuring the
dynamic parameters of blobs. We find 10 quasi-periodic release events of
streamer blobs lasting for three to four days. In each day of these events, we
observe three-five blobs. The results are in line with previous studies using
data observed near the last solar minimum. Using the measured blob velocity as
a proxy for that of the mean flow, we suggest that the velocity of the
background slow solar wind near the Sun can vary significantly within a few
hours. This provides an observational manifestation of the large velocity
variability of the slow solar wind near the Sun.
