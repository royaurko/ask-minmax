Calculations of the positron-Li system were performed using the Stochastic
Variational Method and yielded a minimum energy of -7.53208 Hartree for the L=0
ground state. Unlike previous calculations of this system, the system was
found to be stable against dissociation into the Ps + Li$^+$ channel with a
binding energy of 0.00217 Hartree and is therefore electronically stable. This
is the first instance of a rigorous calculation predicting that it is possible
to combine a positron with a neutral atom and form an electronically stable
bound state.
