We exhibit seven linear codes exceeding the current best known minimum
distance d for their dimension k and block length n. Each code is defined over
F_8, and their invariants [n,k,d] are given by [49,13,27], [49,14,26],
[49,16,24], [49,17,23], [49,19,21], [49,25,16] and [49,26,15]. Our method
includes an exhaustive search of all monomial evaluation codes generated by
points in the [0,5]x[0,5] lattice square.
