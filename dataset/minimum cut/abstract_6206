One hundred years after the eruption of GK Per and the detection of
oscillations in its light curve it is still unclear why certain novae show a
smooth decline in their optical light curves after outburst while others have
oscillations / minimum during the `transition phase'. Two years ago we pointed
out a possible connection between this phase in classical novae and
intermediate polars (IPs), and predicted that novae that have the transition
phase should be IPs. Chandra observations on two recent novae support this
prediction. Nova V1494 Aql 99/2, which had oscillations during the transition
phase, can be classified as an IP, while X-ray observations on Nova V382 Vel
1999, whose optical decline from outburst was smooth, failed to detect any
short-term periodicity. About 10 percent of the CV population are IPs. This
figure is consistent with the rarity of the transition phase in novae. We also
present a model for this idea: the nova outburst disrupts the accretion disc
only in IPs because their discs are less massive than in non-magnetic systems
and their inner parts are depleted; the recovery of the disc, a few
weeks-months after the eruption, causes the formation of dust.
