On the basis of observations of solar granulation obtained with the New Solar
Telescope (NST) of Big Bear Solar Observatory, we explored proper motion of
bright points (BPs) in a quiet sun area, a coronal hole, and an active region
plage. We automatically detected and traced bright points (BPs) and derived
their mean-squared displacements as a function of time (starting from the
appearance of each BP) for all available time intervals. In all three magnetic
environments, we found the presence of a super-diffusion regime, which is the
most pronounced inside the time interval of 10-300 seconds. Super-diffusion,
measured via the spectral index, $\gamma$, which is the slope of the
mean-squared displacement spectrum, increases from the plage area
($\gamma=1.48$) to the quiet sun area ($\gamma=1.53$) to the coronal hole
($\gamma=1.67$). We also found that the coefficient of turbulent diffusion
changes in direct proportion to both temporal and spatial scales. For the
minimum spatial scale (22 km) and minimum time scale (10 sec), it is 22 and 19
km$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$ for the coronal hole and the quiet sun area, respectively,
whereas for the plage area it is about 12 km$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$ for the minimum
time scale of 15 seconds. We applied our BP tracking code to 3D MHD model data
of solar convection (Stein et al. 2007) and found the super-diffusion with
$\gamma=1.45$. An expression for the turbulent diffusion coefficient as a
function of scales and $\gamma$ is obtained.
