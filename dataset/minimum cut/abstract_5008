We present an investigation of heat transport in gapless graphene-based
Ferromagnetic /singlet Superconductor/Ferromagnetic (FG$\mid$SG$\mid$FG)
junctions. We find that unlike uniform increase of thermal conductance vs
temperature, the thermal conductance exhibits intensive oscillatory behavior vs
width of the sandwiched s-wave superconducting region between the two
ferromagnetic layers. This oscillatory form is occurred by interference of the
massless Dirac fermions in graphene. Also we find that the thermal conductance
vs exchange field $h$ displays a minimal value at $h/E_F\simeq 1$ within the
low temperature regime where this finding demonstrates that propagating modes
of the Dirac fermions in this value reach at their minimum numbers and verifies
the previous results for electronic conductance. We find that for thin widths
of superconducting region, the thermal conductance vs temperature shows linear
increment i.e. $\Gamma\varpropto T$. At last we propose an experimental set-up
to detect our predicted effects.
