This paper examines the allowed amount of IG (intergalactic) dust, which is
constrained by extinction and reddening of distant SNe and thermal history of
IGM (intergalactic medium) affected by dust photoelectric heating. Based on the
observational cosmic star formation history, we find an upper bound of $\chi$,
the mass ratio of the IG dust to the total metal in the Universe, as $\chi\la
0.1$ for $10 {\rm \AA} \la a \la 0.1 \micron$ and $\chi\la 0.1(a/0.1
\micron)^{-1}$ for $0.1 \micron\la a\la1\micron$, where $a$ is a characteristic
grain size of the IG dust. This upper bound of $\chi\sim0.1$ suggests that the
dust-to-metal ratio in the IGM is smaller than the current Galactic value. The
corresponding allowed density of the IG dust increases from $\sim10^{-34}$ g
cm$^{-3}$ at $z=0$ to $\sim10^{-33}$ g cm$^{-3}$ at $z\sim1$, and keeps almost
the value toward higher redshift. This causes IG extinction of $\la 0.2$ mag at
the observer's $B$-band for $z\sim 1$ sources and that of $\la 1$ mag for
higher redshift sources. Furthermore, if $E(B-V)\sim 0.1$ mag at the observer's
frame against $z\ga1$ sources is detected, we can conclude that a typical size
of the IG dust is $\la 100$ \AA. The 2175 \AA absorption feature of small
graphite may be found as a local minimum at $z\sim2.5$ in a plot of the
observed $E(B-V)$ as a function of the source redshift. Finally, the IGM mean
temperature at $z\la1$ can be still higher than $10^{4}$ K, provided the size
of the IG dust is $\la100$ \AA.
