We present Chandra observations of two relatively high redshift FRII radio
galaxies, 3C 432 and 3C 191 (z=1.785 and z=1.956 respectively), both of which
show extended X-ray emission along the axis of the radio jet or lobe. This
X-ray emission is most likely to be due to inverse-Compton scattering of Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Under this assumption we estimate the
minimum energy contained in the particles responsible. This can be extrapolated
to determine a rough estimate of the total energy. We also present new, deep
radio observations of 3C 294, which confirm some association between radio and
X-ray emission along the NE-SW radio axis and also that radio emission is not
detected over the rest of the extent of the diffuse X-ray emission. This,
together with the offset between the peaks of the X-ray and radio emissions may
indicate that the jet axis in this source is precessing.
