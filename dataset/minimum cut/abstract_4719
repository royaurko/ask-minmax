The CCD photometric data of the EW-type binary, II CMa, which is a contact
star in the field of the middle-aged open cluster Berkeley 33, are presented.
The complete R light curve was obtained. In the present paper, using the five
CCD epochs of light minimum (three of them are calculated from Mazur et al.
(1993)'s data and two from our new data), the orbital period P was revised to
0.22919704 days. The complete R light curve was analyzed by using the 2003
version of W-D (Wilson-Devinney) program. It is found that this is a contact
system with a mass ratio $q=0.9$ and a contact factor $f=4.1%$. The high mass
ratio ($q=0.9$) and the low contact factor ($f=4.1%$) indicate that the system
just evolved into the marginal contact stage.
