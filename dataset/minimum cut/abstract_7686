We present the first intermediate-resolution (lambda / 3000) spectrum of the
bright quasi-stellar object 3C273 at wavelengths between 900 and 1200 A.
Observations were performed with the Berkeley spectrograph aboard the
ORFEUS-SPAS II mission. We detect Lyman beta counterparts to
previously-identified intergalactic Lyman-alpha features at cz = 19900, 1600,
and 1000 km/s; counterparts to other putative Lyman-alpha clouds along the
sight line are below our detection limit. The strengths of the two very low
redshift Lyman-beta features, which are believed to arise in Virgo intracluster
gas, exceed preflight expectations, suggesting that the previous determination
of the cloud parameters may underestimate the true column densities. A
curve-of-growth analysis sets a minimum H I column density of 4 E14/cm^2 for
the 1600 km/s cloud. We find marginally significant evidence for Galactic H_2
along the sight line, with a total column density of about 1 E15/cm^2. We
detect the stronger interstellar O VI doublet member unambiguously; the weaker
member is blended with other features. If the Doppler b value for O VI is
comparable to that determined for N V then the O VI column density is 7 +/- 2
E14/cm^2, significantly above the only previous estimate. The O VI / N V ratio
is about 10, consistent with the low end of the range observed in the disk.
Additional interstellar species detected for the first time toward 3C273 (at
modest statistical significance) include P II, Fe III, Ar I, and S III.
