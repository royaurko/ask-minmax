We describe two different approaches to making systematic classifications of
plane lattice polygons, and recover the toric codes they generate, over small
fields, where these match or exceed the best known minimum distance. This
includes a [36,19,12]-code over F_7 whose minimum distance 12 exceeds that of
all previously known codes.
