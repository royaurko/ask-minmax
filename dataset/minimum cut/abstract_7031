We study the properties of the space-time that emerges dynamically from the
matrix model for type IIB superstrings in ten dimensions. We calculate the free
energy and the extent of space-time using the Gaussian expansion method up to
the third order. Unlike previous works, we study the SO(d) symmetric vacua with
all possible values of d within the range $2 \le d \le 7$, and observe clear
indication of plateaus in the parameter space of the Gaussian action, which is
crucial for the results to be reliable. The obtained results indeed exhibit
systematic dependence on d, which turns out to be surprisingly similar to what
was observed recently in an analogous work on the six-dimensional version of
the model. In particular, we find the following properties: i) the extent in
the shrunken directions is given by a constant, which does not depend on d; ii)
the ten-dimensional volume of the Euclidean space-time is given by a constant,
which does not depend on d except for d = 2; iii) The free energy takes the
minimum value at d = 3. Intuitive understanding of these results is given by
using the low-energy effective theory and some Monte Carlo results.
