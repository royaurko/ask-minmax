This paper considers extensions of minimum-disparity estimators to the
problem of estimating parameters in a regession model that is conditionally
specified; ie where the model gives the distribution of a response $y$
conditional on covariates $x$ but does not specify the distribution of $x$. The
consistency and asymptotic normality of such estimators is demonstrated for a
broad class of models that incorporates both discrete and continuous response
and covariate values and is based on a wide set of choices for kernel-based
conditional density estimation. It also establishes the robustness of these
estimators for a wide class of disparities. As has been observed in Tamura and
Boos (1986), kernel density estimates of more than one dimension can result in
an asymptotic bias that is larger that $n^{-1/2}$ in minimum disparity
estimators and we characterize a similar bias in our results and show that in
specialized cases it can be eliminated by appropriately centering the kernel
density estimate. In order to demonstrate these results, we establish a set of
$L_1$-consistency results for kernel-based estimates of centered conditional
densities.
