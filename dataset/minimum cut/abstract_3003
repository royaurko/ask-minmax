The present article discusses magnetic confinement of the Dirac excitations
in graphene in presence of inhomogeneous magnetic fields. In the first case a
magnetic field directed along the z axis whose magnitude is proportional to
$1/r$ is chosen. In the next case we choose a more realistic magnetic field
which does not blow up at the origin and gradually fades away from the origin.
The magnetic fields chosen do not have any finite/infinite discontinuity for
finite values of the radial coordinate. The novelty of the two magnetic fields
is related to the equations which are used to find the excited spectra of the
excitations. It turns out that the bound state solutions of the two-dimensional
hydrogen atom problem are related to the spectra of graphene excitations in
presence of the $1/r$ (inverse-radial) magnetic field. For the other magnetic
field profile one can use the knowledge of the bound state spectrum of a
two-dimensional cut-off Coulomb potential to dictate the excitation spectra of
the states of graphene. The spectrum of the graphene excitations in presence of
the inverse-radial magnetic field can be exactly solved while the other case
cannot be. In the later case we give the localized solutions of the zero-energy
states in graphene.
