Polariton relaxation mechanisms are analysed experimentally and theoretically
in a ZnO-based polariton laser. A minimum lasing threshold is obtained when the
energy difference between the exciton reservoir and the bottom of the lower
polariton branch is resonant with the LO phonon energy. Tuning off this
resonance increases the threshold, and exciton-exciton scattering processes
become involved in the polariton relaxation. These observations are
qualitatively reproduced by simulations based on the numerical solution of the
semi-classical Boltzmann equations.
