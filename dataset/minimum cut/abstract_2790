Despite tremendous advances in the field of genomics, the amount and function
of the large non-coding part of the genome in higher organisms remains poorly
understood. Here we report an observation, made for 37 fully sequenced
eukaryotic genomes, which indicates that eukaryotes require a certain minimum
amount of non-coding DNA (ncDNA). This minimum increases quadratically with the
amount of DNA located in exons. Based on a simple model of the growth of
regulatory networks, we derive a theoretical prediction of the required
quantity of ncDNA and find it to be in excellent agreement with the data. The
amount of additional ncDNA (in basepairs) which eukaryotes require obeys Ndef =
1/2 (Nc / Np) (Nc - Np), where Nc is the amount of exonic DNA, and Np is a
constant of about 10Mb. This value Ndef corresponds to a few percent of the
genome in Homo sapiens and other mammals, and up to half the genome in simpler
eukaryotes. Thus our findings confirm that eukaryotic life depends on a
substantial fraction of ncDNA and also make a prediction of the size of this
fraction, which matches the data closely.
