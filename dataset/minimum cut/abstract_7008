To explore the difference between the most two recent solar minima, we
analyze the in-situ ACE and ULYSSES observations and examine the distributions
of the three types of solar wind (streamer-stalk-associated wind, wind from
outside the streamer stalk that can be associated, in part, with coronal holes,
and interplanetary coronal mass ejections). We use the taxonomy provided by
Zhao et al. (2009) to identify the three types of solar wind. We then map the
in-situ observations to the 2.5 solar radii surface. With the aid of the
potential-field-source surface model (PFSS), we calculate the normal distance
from the solar wind "foot point" to the local helisopheric current sheet on
that surface. We find that the source region of the streamer stalk wind is
narrower compared to the previous minimum. The area outside the streamer stalk
is accordingly larger, but the magnetic field strength is observed to be lower,
with the result that the total amount of the magnetic open flux from the
outside of streamer stalk region is conserved in the two successive solar
minima. The implications of the conservation of open magnetic flux for models
of the behavior of the solar magnetic field are discussed.
