A large amount of research is currently going on in the field of reversible
logic, which have low heat dissipation, low power consumption, which is the
main factor to apply reversible in digital VLSI circuit design. This paper
introduces reversible gate named as Inventive0 gate. The novel gate is
synthesis the efficient adder modules with minimum garbage output and gate
count. The Inventive0 gate capable of implementing a 4-bit ripple carry adder
and carry skip adders.It is presented that Inventive0 gate is much more
efficient and optimized approach as compared to their existing design, in terms
of gate count, garbage outputs and constant inputs. In addition, some popular
available reversible gates are implemented in the MOS transistor design the
implementation kept in mind for minimum MOS transistor count and are completely
reversible in behavior more precise forward and backward computation. Lesser
architectural complexity show that the novel designs are compact, fast as well
as low power.
