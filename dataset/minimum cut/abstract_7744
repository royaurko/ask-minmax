Time series of B,V,I CCD photometry and radial velocity measurements from
high resolution spectroscopy (R=30,000) covering the full pulsation cycle are
presented for the field RR Lyrae star CM Leonis. The photometric data span a 6
year interval from 1994 to 1999, and allow us to firmly establish the pulsation
mode and periodicity of the variable. The derived period P=0.361699 days (+/-
0.000001) is very close to the value published in the Fourth Edition of the
General Catalogue of Variable Stars (P=0.361732 days). However, contrary to
what was previously found, the amplitude and shape of the light curve qualify
CM Leo as a very regular first overtone pulsator with a prominent hump on the
rising branch of its multicolour light curves. According to an abundace
analysis performed on three spectra taken near minimum light (0.42 < phase <
0.61), CM Leo is a metal-poor star with metal abundance [Fe/H]=-1.93 +/- 0.20.
The photometric and radial velocity curves of CM Leo have been compared with
the predictions of suitable pulsational models to infer tight constraints on
the stellar mass, effective temperature, and distance modulus of the star. We
derive a true distance modulus of CM Leo of (m-M)0=13.11 +/- 0.02 mag and a
corresponding absolute magnitude of Mv=0.47 +/- 0.04. This absolute magnitude,
once corrected for evolutionary and metallicity effects, leads to a true
distance modulus of the Large Magellanic Cloud of (m-M)0=18.43 +/- 0.06 mag, in
better agreement with the long astronomical distance scale.
