We report on recent progress with the definition of lattice chiral gauge
theories, using a lattice action that includes a discretized Lorentz
gauge-fixing term. This gauge-fixing term has a unique global minimum, and
allows us to use perturbation theory in order to study the influence of the
gauge degrees of freedom on the fermions. For the abelian case, we find, both
in perturbation theory and numerically, that the fermions remain chiral, and
that there are no doublers. More details on our approach, including a
discussion of how we evade the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, can be found in
hep-lat/9709115.
