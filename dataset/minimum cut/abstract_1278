We study the specific influence of African dust on each one of the categories
of Atlantic hurricanes. By applying wavelet analysis, we find a strong decadal
modulation of African dust on Category 5 hurricanes and an annual modulation on
all other categories of hurricanes. We identify the formation of Category 5
hurricanes occurring mainly around the decadal minimum variation of African
dust and in deep water areas of the Atlantic Ocean, where hurricane eyes have
the lowest pressure. According to our results, future tropical cyclones will
not evolve to Category 5 until the next decadal minimum that is, by the year
2015 +/- 2.
