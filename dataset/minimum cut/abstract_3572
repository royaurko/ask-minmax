The interplay between clustering and exchange coupling in magnetic
semiconductors for the prototype (Ga_{1-x},Mn_x)As with manganese
concentrations x of 1/16 and 1/32 in the interesting experimental range is
investigated. For x ~ 6 %, when all possible arrangements of two atoms within a
large supercell are considered, the clustering of Mn atoms at nearest-neighbour
Ga sites is energetically preferred. As shown by spin density analysis, this
minimum energy configuration localizes further one hole and reduces the
effective charge carrier concentration. Also the exchange coupling constant
increases to a value corresponding to lower Mn concentrations with decreasing
inter Mn distance.
