We present a non-supersymmetric theory with a naturally light dilaton. It is
based on a 5D holographic description of a conformal theory perturbed by a
close-to-marginal operator of dimension 4-epsilon, which develops a condensate.
As long as the dimension of the perturbing operator remains very close to
marginal (even for large couplings) a stable minimum at hierarchically small
scales is achieved, where the dilaton mass squared is suppressed by epsilon. At
the same time the cosmological constant in this sector is also suppressed by
epsilon, and thus parametrically smaller than in a broken SUSY theory. As a
byproduct we also present an exact solution to the scalar-gravity system that
can be interpreted as a new holographic realization of spontaneously broken
conformal symmetry. Even though this metric deviates substantially from AdS
space in the deep IR it still describes a non-linearly realized exactly
conformal theory. We also display the effective potential for the dilaton for
arbitrary holographic backgrounds.
