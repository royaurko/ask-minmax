We introduce twisted permutation codes, which are frequency permutation
arrays analogous to repetition permutation codes, namely, codes obtained from
the repetition construction applied to a permutation code. In particular, we
show that a lower bound for the minimum distance of a twisted permutation code
is the minimum distance of a repetition permutation code. We give examples
where this bound is tight, but more importantly, we give examples of twisted
permutation codes with minimum distance strictly greater than this lower bound.
