The value measured in the amorphous structure with the same chemical
composition is often considered as a lower bound for the thermal conductivity
of any material: the heat carriers are strongly scattered by disorder, and
their lifetimes reach the minimum time scale of thermal vibrations. An
appropriate design at the nano-scale, however, may allow one to reduce the
thermal conductivity even below the amorphous limit. In the present
contribution, using molecular-dynamics simulation and the Green-Kubo
formulation, we study systematically the thermal conductivity of layered
phononic materials (superlattices), by tuning different parameters that can
characterize such structures. We discover that the key to reach a
lower-than-amorphous thermal conductivity is to block almost completely the
propagation of the heat carriers, the superlattice phonons. We demonstrate that
a large mass difference in the two intercalated layers, or weakened
interactions across the interface between layers result in materials with very
low thermal conductivity, below the values of the corresponding amorphous
counterparts.
