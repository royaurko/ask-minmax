We have observed Eta Carinae over 34 nights between 4th January 2009 and 27th
March 2009 covering the estimated timeframe for a predicted spectroscopic event
related to a suspected binary system concealed within the homunculus nebula. A
photometric minimum feature was confirmed to be periodic and comparison to a
previous event indicated that the period to within our error at 2022.6 +/-1.0
d. Using the E-region standard star system, the apparent V magnitudes
determined for the local comparison stars were HD303308 8.14+/-0.02, HD 93205
7.77 +/-0.03 and HD93162 8.22 +/-0.05. The latter star was found to be dimmer
than previously reported.
