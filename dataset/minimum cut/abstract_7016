In this paper we derive aggregate separation bounds, named after
Davenport-Mahler-Mignotte (\dmm), on the isolated roots of polynomial systems,
specifically on the minimum distance between any two such roots. The bounds
exploit the structure of the system and the height of the sparse (or toric)
resultant by means of mixed volume, as well as recent advances on aggregate
root bounds for univariate polynomials, and are applicable to arbitrary
positive dimensional systems. We improve upon Canny's gap theorem
\cite{c-crmp-87} by a factor of $\OO(d^{n-1})$, where $d$ bounds the degree of
the polynomials, and $n$ is the number of variables. One application is to the
bitsize of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an integer matrix, which also
yields a new proof that the problem is polynomial. We also compare against
recent lower bounds on the absolute value of the root coordinates by Brownawell
and Yap \cite{by-issac-2009}, obtained under the hypothesis there is a
0-dimensional projection. Our bounds are in general comparable, but exploit
sparseness; they are also tighter when bounding the value of a positive
polynomial over the simplex. For this problem, we also improve upon the bounds
in \cite{bsr-arxix-2009,jp-arxiv-2009}. Our analysis provides a precise
asymptotic upper bound on the number of steps that subdivision-based algorithms
perform in order to isolate all real roots of a polynomial system. This leads
to the first complexity bound of Milne's algorithm \cite{Miln92} in 2D.
