We discuss the fragmentation of primordial gas clouds in the universe after
decoupling. Comparing the time scale of collapse with that of fragmentation,
we obtain the typical mass of a fragment both numerically and analytically.
It is shown that the estimated mass gives the minimum mass of a fragment
which is formed from the primordial gas cloud and is essentially determined
by the Chandrasekhar mass.
