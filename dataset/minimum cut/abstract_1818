The end of LEP and SLC is a good moment to review the way to summarize search
results in order to exploit at best, in future analyses and speculations, the
pieces of information coming from all experiments. Some known problems with the
usual way of reporting results in terms ``CL limits'' are shortly recalled, and
a plea is formulated to publish just parametrized likelihoods, possibly
rescaled to the asymptotic insensitivity limit level.
