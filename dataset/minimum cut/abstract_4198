We present a feasibility study of logic circuits utilizing spin waves for
information transmission and processing. As an alternative approach to the
transistor-based architecture, logic circuits with spin wave bus do not use
charge as an information carrier. In this work we describe the general concept
of logic circuits with spin wave bus and illustrate its performance by
numerical simulations based on available experimental data. Theoretical
estimates and results of numerical simulations on signal attenuation, signal
phase velocity, and the minimum spin wave energy required per bit in the spin
bus are obtained. The transport parameters are compared with ones for
conventional electronic transmission lines. Spin Wave Bus is not intended to
substitute traditional metal interconnects since it has higher signal
attenuation and lower signal propagation speed. The potential value of spin
wave bus is, however, an interface between electronic circuits and integrated
spintronics circuits. The logic circuits with spin wave bus allow us to provide
wireless read-in and read-out.
