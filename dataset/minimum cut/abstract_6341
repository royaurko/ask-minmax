We have analyzed the properties of dust in the high galactic latitude
translucent cloud Lynds 1780 using ISOPHOT maps at 100 and 200 micrometers and
raster scans at 60, 80, 100, 120, 150 and 200 micrometers. In far-infrared
(FIR) emission, the cloud has a single core that coincides with the maxima of
visual extinction and 200um optical depth. At the resolution of 3.0 arcmin, the
maximum visual extinction is 4.0 mag. At the cloud core, the minimum
temperature and the maximum 200um optical depth are 14.9+/-0.4 K and
2.0+/-0.2x10^{-3}, respectively, at the resolution of 1.5 arcmin. The cloud
mass is estimated to be 18M_{SUN}. The FIR observations, combined with IRAS
observations, suggest the presence of different, spatially distinct dust grain
populations in the cloud: the FIR core region is the realm of the "classical"
large grains, whereas the very small grains and the PAHs have separate maxima
on the Eastern side of the cold core, towards the "tail" of this
cometary-shaped cloud. The color ratios indicate an overabundance of PAHs and
VSGs in L1780. Our FIR observations combined with the optical extinction data
indicate an increase of the emissivity of the big grain dust component in the
cold core, suggesting grain coagulation or some other change in the properties
of the large grains. Based on our observations, we also address the question,
to what extent the 80um emission and even the 100um and the 120um emission
contain a contribution from the small-grain component.
