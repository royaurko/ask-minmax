We investigate the dynamics of gravity coupled to a scalar field using a
non-canonical form of the kinetic term. It is shown that its singular point
represents an attractor for classical solutions and the stationary value of the
field may occur distant from the minimum of the potential. In this paper
properties of universes with such stationary states are considered. We reveal
that such state can be responsible for modern dark energy density.
