We prove a comparison theorem between locally analytic group cohomology and
Lie algebra cohomology for locally analytic representations of a Lie group over
a nonarchimedean field of characteristic 0. The proof is similar to that of
van-Est's isomorphism and uses only a minimum of functional analysis.
