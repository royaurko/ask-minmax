We present quasi-elastic light scattering (LS) and dielectric (DS) spectra of
the glass former alpha-picoline (13K < T < 320K). At high temperatures the
evolution of the susceptibility minimum is well described by mode coupling
theory (MCT) yielding a critical temperature T_c = 162K +- 5K. At T_c > T > T_g
the excess wing of the alpha-process identified in the DS spectra and
characterized by a power-law exponent c is rediscovered in the LS spectra.
Introducing a universal evolution for c = c[lg(tau_{alpha})] as suggested by DS
data of several glass formers, the fast dynamics spectrum is singled out,
allowing to determine the non-ergodicity parameter f(T). The latter shows the
predicted cusp-like anomaly identifying T_c as well. Another discontinuous
change of f(T) is observed at T_g. The fast dynamics spectra exhibit a
crossover to ``white noise'' (T < T_c). Concerning the fast dynamics, we
conclude that idealized MCT predictions hold even below T_c.
