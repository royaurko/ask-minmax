We point out the possibility of having a roton-type excitation spectrum in a
quasi-1D Bose-Einstein condensate with dipole-dipole interactions. Normally
such a system is quite unstable due to the attractive portion of the dipolar
interaction. However, by reversing the sign of the dipolar interaction using
either a rotating magnetic field or a laser with circular polarization, a
stable cigar-shaped configuration can be achieved whose spectrum contains a
`roton' minimum analogous to that found in helium II. Dipolar gases also offer
the exciting prospect to tune the depth of this `roton' minimum by directly
controlling the interparticle interaction strength. When the minimum touches
the zero-energy axis the system is once again unstable, possibly to the
formation of a density wave.
