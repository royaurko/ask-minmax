In Dirac's hole theory the vacuum state is assumed to be the state where all
negative energy states are occupied and all positive energy states are
unoccupied. This is often referred to as the Dirac sea. It is generally assumed
that the Dirac sea is the minimum possible energy state. However it will be
shown in this paper that this is not the case.
