We report near-infrared spectroscopy of the gas giant planet HD 189733b in
transit. We used the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST WFC3) with
its G141 grism covering 1.1 um to 1.7 um and spatially scanned the image across
the detector at 2\arcsec$s^{-1}$. When smoothed to 75 nm bins, the local maxima
of the transit depths in the 1.15 um and 1.4 um water vapor features
respectively are 83+/-53 ppm and 200+/-47 ppm greater than the local minimum at
1.3 um. We compare the WFC3 spectrum with the composite transit spectrum of HD
189733b assembled by Pont et al. (2013), extending from 0.3 um to 24 um.
Although the water vapor features in the WFC3 spectrum are compatible with the
model of non-absorbing, Rayleigh-scattering dust in the planetary atmosphere
(Pont et al. 2013), we also re-interpret the available data with a clear
planetary atmosphere. In the latter interpretation, the slope of increasing
transit depth with shorter wavelengths from the near infrared, through the
visible and into the ultraviolet is caused by unocculted star spots, with a
smaller contribution of Rayleigh scattering by molecular hydrogen in the
planet's atmosphere. At relevant pressures along the terminator, our model
planetary atmosphere's temperature is ~700 K, which is below the condensation
temperatures of sodium- and potassium-bearing molecules, causing the broad
wings of the spectral lines of Na I and K I at 0.589 um and 0.769 um to be
weak.
