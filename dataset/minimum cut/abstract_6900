Three-quarters of the 1 cubic kilometer neutrino telescope IceCube is
currently taking data. Current models predict high-energy neutrino emission
from transient objects like supernovae (SNe) and gammaray bursts (GRBs). To
increase the sensitivity to such transient objects we have set up an optical
follow-up program that triggers optical observations on multiplets of
high-energy muon-neutrinos. We define multiplets as a minimum of two
muon-neutrinos from the same direction (within 4 deg) that arrive within a 100
s time window. When this happens, an alert is issued to the four ROTSE-III
telescopes, which immediately observe the corresponding region in the sky.
Image subtraction is applied to the optical data to find transient objects. In
addition, neutrino multiplets are investigated online for temporal and
directional coincidence with gamma-ray satellite observations issued over the
Gamma-Ray Burst Coordinate Network. An overview of the full program is given,
from the online selection of neutrino events to the automated follow-up, and
the resulting sensitivity to transient neutrino sources is presented for the
first time.
