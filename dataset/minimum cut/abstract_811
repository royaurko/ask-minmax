The electronic band structure of CeAgSb$_{2}$ has been calculated using the
self-consistent full potential nonorthogonal local orbital minimum basis scheme
based on the density functional theory. We investigated the electronic
structure with the spin-orbit interaction and on-site Coulomb potential for the
Ce-derived 4f orbitals to obtain the correctly ground state of CeAgSb$_{2}$.
