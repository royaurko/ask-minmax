We demonstrate by both experiments and phase-field simulations that lamellar
eutectic growth can be stable for a wide range of spacings below the point of
minimum undercooling at low velocity, contrary to what is predicted by existing
stability analyses. This overstabilization can be explained by relaxing Cahn's
assumption that lamellae grow locally normal to the eutectic interface.
