We propose a natural solution to the cosmological constant problem consistent
with the standard cosmology and successful over a broad range of energies. This
solution is based on the existence of a new field, the devaluton, with its
potential modeled on a tilted cosine. After inflation, the universe reheats and
populates the devaluton's many minima. As the universe cools, domain walls form
between different regions. The domain wall network then evolves and sweeps away
regions of higher vacuum energy in favor of lower energy ones. Gravitation
itself provides a cutoff at a minimum vacuum energy, thus leaving the universe
with a small cosmological constant comparable in magnitude to the present day
dark energy density.
