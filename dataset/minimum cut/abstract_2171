The most successful method to obtain lower bounds for the minimum distance of
an algebraic geometric code is the order bound, which generalizes the Feng-Rao
bound. We provide a significant extension of the bound that improves the order
bounds by Beelen and by Duursma and Park. We include an exhaustive numerical
comparison of the different bounds for 10168 two-point codes on the Suzuki
curve of genus g=124 over the field of 32 elements. Keywords: algebraic
geometric code, order bound, Suzuki curve.
