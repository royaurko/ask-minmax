In this paper we first describe the geometry of the Newton polyhedra of
polynomials invariant under certain linear Hamiltonian circle actions. From the
geometry of the polyhedra, various Poisson structures on the orbit spaces of
the actions are derived and Poisson embeddings into model spaces, for the orbit
spaces, are constructed. The Poisson structures, on respective source and model
space, are compatible even for the minimum possible (embedding) dimension of
the model spaces. This is, in particular, important since it is still an open
question if, in general, there exist finite dimensional model spaces with
Poisson structures compatible with the actions and the usual nondegenerate
Poisson structure on the source spaces.
