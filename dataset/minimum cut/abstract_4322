We present the thermopower S(T) and the resistivity rho(T) of
Lu(1-x)Yb(x)Rh2Si2 in the temperature range 3 K < T < 300 K. S(T) is found to
change from two minima for dilute systems (x < 0.5) to a single large minimum
in pure YbRh2Si2. A similar behavior has also been found for the magnetic
contribution to the resistivity rho_mag(T). The appearance of the low-T extrema
in S(T) and rho_mag(T) is attributed to the lowering of the Kondo scale with
decreasing x. The evolution of the characteristic energy scales for both the
Kondo effect and the crystal electric field splitting are deduced. An
extrapolation allows to estimate the Kondo temperature of YbRh2Si2 to 29 K.
