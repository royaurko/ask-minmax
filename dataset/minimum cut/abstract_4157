We present various planar magnetic designs that create points above the plane
where the magnitude of the static magnetic field is a local minimum. Structures
with these properties are of interest in the disciplines of neutral atom
confinement, magnetic levitation, and magnetic resonance imaging. Each planar
permanent magnet design is accompanied by the equivalent planar single
non-crossing conductor design. Presented designs fall into three categories
producing: a) zero value magnetic field magnitude point minima, b) non-zero
magnetic field magnitude point minima requiring external bias magnetic field,
and c) self-biased non-zero magnetic field magnitude point minima. We also
introduce the Principle of Amperean Current Doubling in planar perpendicularly
magnetized thin films that can be used to improve the performance of each
permanent magnet design we present. Single conductor current-carrying designs
are suitable for single layer lithographic fabrication, as we experimentally
demonstrate. Finally, we present the case that nanometer scale recording of
perpendicular anisotropy thin magnetic films using presently available data
storage technology can provide the ultimate miniaturization of the presented
designs.
