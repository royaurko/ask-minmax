Information erasure at the molecular scale during the depolymerization of
copolymers is shown to require a minimum entropy production in accordance with
Landauer's principle and as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics.
This general result is illustrated with an exactly solvable model of
copolymerization, which also shows that the minimum entropy production that is
possible for a specific molecular mechanism of depolymerization may be larger
than the minimum required by Landauer's principle.
