In this work we study the following class of problems in $\mathbb R^{N},
N>2s$ $$ \varepsilon^{2s} (-\Delta)^{s}u + V(z)u=f(u), \,\,\, u(z) > 0 $$ where
$0<s<1$, $(-\Delta)^{s}$ is the fractional Laplacian, $\varepsilon$ is a
positive parameter, the potential $V:\mathbb{R}^N \to\mathbb{R}$ %is a
continuous functions and the nonlinearity $f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ satisfy
suitable assumptions; in particular it is assumed that $V$ achieves its
positive minimum on some set $M.$ By using variational methods we prove
existence, multiplicity and concentration of maxima of positive solutions when
$\varepsilon\to 0^{+}$. In particular the multiplicity result is obtained by
means of the Ljusternick-Schnirelmann and Morse theory, by exploiting the
"topological complexity" of the set $M$.
