We present 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations of the
evolution of self--gravitating and weakly magnetized disks with an adiabatic
equation of state. Such disks are subject to the development of both the
magnetorotational and gravitational instabilities, which transport angular
momentum outward. As in previous studies, our hydrodynamical simulations show
the growth of strong m=2 spiral structure. This spiral disturbance drives
matter toward the central object and disappears when the Toomre parameter Q has
increased well above unity. When a weak magnetic field is present as well, the
magnetorotational instability grows and leads to turbulence. In that case, the
strength of the gravitational stress tensor is lowered by a factor of about~2
compared to the hydrodynamical run and oscillates periodically, reaching very
small values at its minimum. We attribute this behavior to the presence of a
second spiral mode with higher pattern speed than the one which dominates in
the hydrodynamical simulations. It is apparently excited by the high frequency
motions associated with MHD turbulence. The nonlinear coupling between these
two spiral modes gives rise to a stress tensor that oscillates with a frequency
which is a combination of the frequencies of each of the modes. This
interaction between MHD turbulence and gravitational instabilities therefore
results in a smaller mass accretion rate onto the central object.
