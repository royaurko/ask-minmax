We present a summary of measurements of strange particles performed by the
experiment NA49 in central and minimum bias Pb+Pb collisions in the beam energy
range 20A - 158A GeV. New results on Xi production in central Pb+Pb collisions
and on Lambda, Xi production in minimum bias collisions are shown. Transverse
mass spectra and rapidity distributions of strange particles at different
energies are compared. The energy dependence of the particle yields and ratios
is discussed. NA49 measurements of the Lambda and Xi enhancement factors are
shown for the first time.
