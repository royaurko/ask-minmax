In this correspondence, we focus on the performance analysis of the
widely-used minimum description length (MDL) source enumeration technique in
array processing. Unfortunately, available theoretical analysis exhibit
deviation from the simulation results. We present an accurate and insightful
performance analysis for the probability of missed detection. We also show that
the statistical performance of the MDL is approximately the same under both
deterministic and stochastic signal models. Simulation results show the
superiority of the proposed analysis over available results.
