A graph $G$ is called a cactus if each block of $G$ is either an edge or a
cycle. Denote by $Cact(n;t)$ the set of connected cacti possessing $n$ vertices
and $t$ cycles. In this paper, we show that there are some errors in [J. Du, G.
Su, J. Tu, I. Gutman, The degree resistance distance of cacti, Discrete Appl.
Math. 188 (2015) 16-24.], and we present some results which correct their
mistakes. We also give the second-minimum and third-minimum degree resistance
distances among graphs in $Cact(n;t)$, and characterize the corresponding
extremal graphs as well.
