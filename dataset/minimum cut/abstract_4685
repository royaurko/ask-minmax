The late time evolution of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models with a
perfect fluid matter source is studied in the conformal frame of $f(R) $
gravity. We assume that the corresponding scalar field, nonminimally coupled to
matter, has an arbitrary non-negative potential function $V(\phi) $. We prove
that equilibria corresponding to non-negative local minima for $V$ are
asymptotically stable. We investigate all cases where one of the matter
components eventually dominates. The results are valid for a large class of
non-negative potentials without any particular assumptions about the behavior
of the potential at infinity. In particular for a nondegenerate minimum of the
potential with zero critical value we show that if $\gamma $, the parameter of
the equation of state is larger than one, then there is a transfer of energy
from the fluid to the scalar field and the later eventually dominates.
