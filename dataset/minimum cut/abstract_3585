$H$-$T$ diagram of 3D diluted Ising antiferromagnet
Ni$_{c}$Mg$_{1-c}$(OH)$_{2}$ with $c$ = 0.8 has been determined from
measurements of SQUID DC magnetization and AC magnetic susceptibility. At $H$ =
0, this compound undergoes two magnetic phase transitions: an antiferromagnetic
(AF) transition at the N\'{e}el temperature $T_{N}$ (= 20.7 K) and a reentrant
spin glass (RSG) transition at $T_{RSG}$ ($\approx$ 6 K). The $H$-$T$ diagram
consists of the RSG, spin glass (SG), and AF phases. These phases meet a
multicritical point $P_{m}$ ($H_{m}$ = 42 kOe, $T_{m}$ = 5.6 K). The
irreversibility of susceptibility defined by $\delta$ (= $\chi_{FC} -
\chi_{ZFC}$) shows a negative local minimum for 10 $\leq H \leq$ 35 kOe,
suggesting the existence of possible glassy phase in the AF phase. A broad peak
in $\delta$ and $\chi^{\prime \prime}$ at $H \geq$ 20 kOe for $T_{N}(c=0.8,H)
\leq T \leq T_{N}(c=1,H=0)$ (= 26.4 K) suggests the existence of the Griffiths
phase.
