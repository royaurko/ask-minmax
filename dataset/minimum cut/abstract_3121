We present the analysis of the extraordinarily bright Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)
130427A under the hypothesis that the GRB central engine is an
accretion-powered magnetar. In this framework, initially proposed to explain
GRBs with precursor activity, the prompt emission is produced by accretion of
matter onto a newly-born magnetar, and the observed power is related to the
accretion rate. The emission is eventually halted if the centrifugal forces are
able to pause accretion. We show that the X-ray and optical afterglow is well
explained as the forward shock emission with a jet break plus a contribution
from the spin-down of the magnetar. Our modelling does not require any
contribution from the reverse shock, that may still influence the afterglow
light curve at radio and mm frequencies, or in the optical at early times. We
derive the magnetic field ($B\sim 10^{16}$ G) and the spin period ($P\sim 20$
ms) of the magnetar and obtain an independent estimate of the minimum
luminosity for accretion. This minimum luminosity results well below the prompt
emission luminosity of GRB 130427A, providing a strong consistency check for
the scenario where the entire prompt emission is the result of continuous
accretion onto the magnetar. This is in agreement with the relatively long spin
period of the magnetar. GRB 130427A was a well monitored GRB showing a very
standard behavior and, thus, is a well-suited benchmark to show that an
accretion-powered magnetar gives a unique view of the properties of long GRBs.
