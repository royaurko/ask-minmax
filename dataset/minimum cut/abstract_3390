We discuss the contribution of kiloparsec-scale jets in FR I radio galaxies
to the diffuse gamma-ray background radiation. The analyzed gamma-ray emission
comes from inverse-Compton scattering of starlight photon fields by the
ultrarelativistic electrons whose synchrotron radiation is detected from such
sources at radio, optical and X-ray energies. We find that these objects, under
the minimum-power hypothesis (corresponding to a magnetic field of 300 muG in
the brightest knots of these jets), can contribute about one percent to the
extragalactic gamma-ray background measured by EGRET. We point out that this
result already indicates that the magnetic fields in kpc-scale jets of
low-power radio galaxies are not likely to be smaller than 10 muG on average,
as otherwise the extragalactic gamma-ray background would be overproduced.
