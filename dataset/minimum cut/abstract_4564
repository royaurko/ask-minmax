We report the analysis of pseudogap Delta* derived from resistivity
experiments in FeAs-based superconductor SmFeAsO(0.85), having a critical
temperature T_c = 55 K. Rather specific dependence Delta*(T) with two
representative temperatures followed by a minimum at about 120 K was observed.
Below T_s = 147 K, corresponding to the structural transition in SmFeAsO,
Delta*(T) decreases linearly down to the temperature T_AFM = 133 K. This last
peculiarity can likely be attributed to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of
Fe spins. It is believed that the found behavior can be explained in terms of
Machida, Nokura, and Matsubara (MNM) theory developed for the AFM
superconductors.
