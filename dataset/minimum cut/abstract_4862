This paper establishes a connection between the notion of observation (or
monitoring) structure in game theory and the one of communication channels in
Shannon theory. One of the objectives is to know under which conditions an
arbitrary monitoring structure can be transformed into a more pertinent
monitoring structure. To this end, a mediator is added to the game. The
objective of the mediator is to choose a signalling scheme that allows the
players to have perfect, almost perfect or public monitoring and all of this,
at a minimum cost in terms of signalling. Graph coloring, source coding, and
channel coding are exploited to deal with these issues. A wireless power
control game is used to illustrate these notions but the applicability of the
provided results and, more importantly, the framework of transforming
monitoring structures go much beyond this example.
