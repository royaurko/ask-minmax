We consider (four dimensional) gravity coupled to a scalar field with
potential V(\phi). The potential satisfies the positive energy theorem for
solutions that asymptotically tend to a negative local minimum. We show that
for a large class of such potentials, there is an open set of smooth initial
data that evolve to naked singularities. Hence cosmic censorship does not hold
for certain reasonable matter theories in asymptotically anti de Sitter
spacetimes. The asymptotically flat case is more subtle. We suspect that
potentials with a local Minkowski minimum may similarly lead to violations of
cosmic censorship in asymptotically flat spacetimes, but we do not have
definite results.
