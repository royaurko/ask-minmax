Through an Ansatz specifying the azimuthal-angle dependence of the solution,
the static field equation for vortex of the Faddeev model is converted to an
algebraic ordinary differential equation. An approximate analytic expression of
the vortex solution is explored so that the energy per unit vortex length
becomes as small as possible. It is observed that the minimum energy of vortex
is approximately proportional to the integer which specifies the solution.
