The concepts of pseudocodeword and pseudoweight play a fundamental role in
the finite-length analysis of LDPC codes. The pseudoredundancy of a binary
linear code is defined as the minimum number of rows in a parity-check matrix
such that the corresponding minimum pseudoweight equals its minimum Hamming
distance. By using the value assignment of Chen and Kl{\o}ve we present new
results on the pseudocodeword redundancy of binary linear codes. In particular,
we give several upper bounds on the pseudoredundancies of certain codes with
repeated and added coordinates and of certain shortened subcodes. We also
investigate several kinds of k-dimensional binary codes and compute their exact
pseudocodeword redundancy.
