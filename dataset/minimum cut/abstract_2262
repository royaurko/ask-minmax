Ad Hoc and Mesh networks are good samples of multi agent systems, where their
nodes access the channel through carrier sense multiple access method, while a
node channel access influence the access of neighbor nodes to the channel.
Hence, game theory is a strong tool for studying this kind of networks. Carrier
sense multiple access parameters such as minimum and maximum size of contention
window and persistence factor can be modified based on game theoretic methods.
In this study different games for tuning the parameters is investigated and
different challenges are examined.
