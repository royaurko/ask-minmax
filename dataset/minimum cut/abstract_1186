Codes defined on graphs and their properties have been subjects of intense
recent research. On the practical side, constructions for capacity-approaching
codes are graphical. On the theoretical side, codes on graphs provide several
intriguing problems in the intersection of coding theory and graph theory. In
this paper, we study codes defined by planar Tanner graphs. We derive an upper
bound on minimum distance $d$ of such codes as a function of the code rate $R$
for $R \ge 5/8$. The bound is given by $$d\le \lceil \frac{7-8R}{2(2R-1)}
\rceil + 3\le 7.$$ Among the interesting conclusions of this result are the
following: (1) planar graphs do not support asymptotically good codes, and (2)
finite-length, high-rate codes on graphs with high minimum distance will
necessarily be non-planar.
