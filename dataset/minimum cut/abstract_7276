We consider the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric homogeneous
matter distribution consisting of a Weyssenhoff fluid in the presence of a
negative cosmological constant. Our aim is to investigate the effects of
torsion and spin averaged terms on the final outcome of the collapse. For a
specific interior spacetime setup, namely the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW
metric, we obtain two classes of solutions to the field equations where
depending on the relation between spin source parameters, $(i)$ the collapse
procedure culminates in a spacetime singularity or $(ii)$ it is replaced by a
non-singular bounce. We show that, under certain conditions, for a specific
subset of the former solutions, the formation of trapped surfaces is prevented
and thus the resulted singularity could be naked. The curvature singularity
that forms could be gravitationally strong in the sense of Tipler. Our
numerical analysis for the latter solutions shows that the collapsing dynamical
process experiences four phases, so that two of which occur at the pre-bounce
and the other two at post-bounce regimes. We further observe that there can be
found a minimum radius for the apparent horizon curve, such that the main
outcome of which is that there exists an upper bound for the size of the
collapsing body, below which no horizon forms throughout the whole scenario.
