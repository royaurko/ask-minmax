The heat transport and corresponding changes in the large-scale circulation
(LSC) in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection are studied by means of
three-dimensional direct numerical simulations as a function of the aspect
ratio $\Gamma$ of a closed cylindrical cell and the Rayleigh number $Ra$. For
small and moderate aspect ratios, the global heat transfer law $Nu=A\times
Ra^{\beta}$ shows a power law dependence of both fit coefficients $A$ and
$\beta$ on the aspect ratio. A minimum Nusselt number coincides with the point
where the LSC undergoes a transition from a single-roll to a double-roll
pattern. With increasing aspect ratio, we detect complex multi-roll LSC
configurations. The aspect ratio dependence of the turbulent heat transfer for
small and moderate $\Gamma$ is in line with a varying amount of energy
contained in the LSC, as quantified by the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
analysis. For $\Gamma\gtrsim 8$ the heat transfer becomes independent of the
aspect ratio.
