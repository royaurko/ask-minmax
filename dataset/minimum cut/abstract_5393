The stochastic MV-PURE estimator has been developed to provide linear
estimation robust to ill-conditioning, high noise levels, and imperfections in
model knowledge. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical performance of
the stochastic MV-PURE estimator under varying level of additive noise. More
precisely, we prove that the mean-square-error (MSE) of this estimator in the
low signal-to-noise (SNR) region is much smaller than that obtained with its
full-rank version, the minimum-variance distortionless estimator, and that the
gap in performance is the larger the higher the noise level. These results shed
light on the excellent performance of the stochastic MV-PURE estimator in
highly noisy settings obtained in simulations so far. We extend here previously
conducted numerical simulations to demonstrate a new insight provided by
results of this paper in practical applications.
