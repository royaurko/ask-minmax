The minimal renormalizable SUSY SO(10) model is a very compact and predictive
theory. It was very popular till one realized that it cannot account for the
masses of the neutrinos. The best cure to this problem is to add the 120 Higgs
representaion, the 'next to minimal' version. To reduce the number of free
parameters, it was suggested in recent papers to use only real parameters in
the superpotential and induce CP violation via complex VEVs. This is what one
usually calls 'spontaneous CP violation'. The number of free parameters turned
out, then, to be even smaller than in the original minimal model and good fits
to all known masses and mixings were obtained. Out of those papers only that of
Aulakh and Garg discusses how CP is spontaneously violated. Some heavy MSSM
singlet VEVs generate a phase at high scale and CP violationis carried down to
the CKM matrix by the mixing of the scalar MSSM doublets. They study the model
in great detail and give a large set of solutions. As a proof of principle, two
of the solutions are shown to induce realistic phenomenological fits. It is not
clear, however, how the right physical solution is obtained. I study the way
solutions for spontaneous CP violation affect the scalar potential. The one
that gives the lowest minimum of the potential, in terms of a given set of
parameters, is the right physical one. In the way of doing so, I will prove
that complex MSSM singlet VEVs lead actually to lower minima than the real (CP
conserving) ones. This proves that CP is spontaneously violated in this model.
