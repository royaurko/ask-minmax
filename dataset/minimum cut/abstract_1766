We study the anisotropies of the Galactic confusion noise background and its
effects on LISA data analysis. LISA has two data streams of the gravitational
waves signals relevant for low frequency regime. Due to the anisotropies of the
background, the matrix for their confusion noises has off-diagonal components
and depends strongly on the orientation of the detector plane. We find that the
sky-averaged confusion noise level $\sqrt {S(f)}$ could change by a factor of 2
in three months, and would be minimum when the orbital position of LISA is
either around the spring or autumn equinox.
