We report the detection of 3 new planetary companions orbiting the solar-type
stars GJ 3021, HD 52265 and HD 169830 using radial-velocity measurements taken
with the CORALIE echelle spectrograph. All these planetary companions have
longer orbital periods than the 51 Peg-like objects. The orbits are fairly
eccentric. The minimum masses of these planets range from 1 to 3.3 M_Jup. The
stars have spectral types from F8V to G6V. They are metal-rich. We also present
our radial-velocity measurements for three solar-type stars known to host
planetary companions iota Hor (HD 17051), HD 210277 and HD 217107.
