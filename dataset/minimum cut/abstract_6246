In this article we present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of more than 50
extra-solar planet host stars. Stellar atmospheric parameters and metallicities
are derived using high resolution and high S/N spectra. The spectroscopy
results, added to the previous studies, imply that we have access to a large
and uniform sample of metallicities for about 80 planet hosts stars. We make
use of this sample to confirm the metal-rich nature of stars with planets, and
to show that the planetary frequency is rising as a function of the [Fe/H].
Furthermore, the source of this high metallicity is shown to have most probably
an ``primordial'' source, confirming previous results. The comparison of the
orbital properties (period and eccentricity) and minimum masses of the planets
with the stellar properties also reveal some emerging but still not significant
trends. These are discussed and some explanations are proposed. Finally, we
show that the planet host stars included in the CORALIE survey have similar
kinematical properties as the whole CORALIE volume-limited planet search
sample. Planet hosts simply seem to occupy the metal-rich envelope of this
latter population.
