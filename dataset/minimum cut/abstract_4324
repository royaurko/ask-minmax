Ginzburg-Landau model with two order parameters appears in many
condensed-matter problems. However, even for scalar order parameters, the most
general U(1)-symmetric Landau potential with all quadratic and quartic terms
contains 13 independent coefficients and cannot be minimized with
straightforward algebra. Here, we develop a geometric approach that circumvents
this computational difficulty and allows one to study properties of the model
without knowing the exact position of the minimum. In particular, we find the
number of minima of the potential, classify explicit symmetries possible in
this model, establish conditions when and how these symmetries are
spontaneously broken, and explicitly describe the phase diagram.
