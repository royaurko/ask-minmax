The main purpose of this paper is to study the performance of two linear
channel estimators for LTE Downlink systems, the Least Square Error (LSE) and
the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE). As LTE is a MIMO-OFDM based
system, a cyclic prefix is inserted at the beginning of each transmitted OFDM
symbol in order to completely suppress both inter-carrier interference (ICI)
and inter-symbol interference (ISI). Usually, the cyclic prefix is equal to or
longer than the channel length but in some cases and because of some unforeseen
channel behaviour, the cyclic prefix can be shorter. Therefore, we propose to
study the performance of the two linear estimators under the effect of the
channel length. Computer simulations show that, in the case where the cyclic
prefix is equal to or longer than the channel length,LMMSE performs better than
LSE but at the cost of computational complexity.In the other case, LMMSE
continue to improve its performance only for low SNR values but it degrades for
high SNR values in which LS shows better performance for LTE Downlink systems.
MATLAB Monte-Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the
studied estimators in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Bit Error Rate (BER)
for 2x2 LTE Downlink systems.
