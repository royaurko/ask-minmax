In immiscible two-phase flows, contact line denotes the intersection of the
fluid-fluid interface with the solid wall. When one fluid displaces the other,
the contact line moves along the wall. A classical problem in continuum
hydrodynamics is the incompatibility between the moving contact line and the
no-slip boundary condition, as the latter leads to a non-integrable
singularity. The recently discovered generalized Navier boundary condition
(GNBC) offers an alternative to the no-slip boundary condition which can
resolve the moving contact line conundrum. We present a variational derivation
of the GNBC through the principle of minimum energy dissipation (entropy
production), as formulated by Onsager for small perturbations away from the
equilibrium. Through numerical implementation of a continuum hydrodynamic
model, it is demonstrated that the GNBC can quantitatively reproduce the moving
contact line slip velocity profiles obtained from molecular dynamics
simulations. In particular, the transition from complete slip at the moving
contact line to near-zero slip far away is shown to be governed by a power-law
partial slip regime, extending to mesoscopic length scales. The sharp
(fluid-fluid) interface limit of the hydrodynamic model, together with some
general implications of slip versus no-slip, are discussed.
