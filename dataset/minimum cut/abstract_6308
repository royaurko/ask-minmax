We study analytically and numerically the evolution of bound systems in
universes with accelerating expansion where the acceleration either increases
with time towards a Big Rip singularity (phantom cosmologies) or decreases with
time (quintessence). We confirm the finding of Caldwell et. al.
[arXiv:astro-ph/0302506] (hereafter CKW) that bound structures get dissociated
in phantom cosmologies but we demonstrate that this happens earlier than
anticipated by CKW. In particular we find that the `rip time' when a bound
system gets unbounded is not the time when the repulsive phantom energy
gravitational potential due to the average $(\rho + 3p)$ balances the
attractive gravitational potential of the mass M of the system. Instead, the
`rip time' is the time when the minimum of the time dependent effective
potential (including the centrifugal term) disappears. For the Milky Way galaxy
this happens approximately 180Myrs before the Big Rip singularity instead of
approximately 60Myrs indicated by CKW for a phantom cosmology with w=-1.5. A
numerical reconstruction of the dissociating bound orbits is presented.
