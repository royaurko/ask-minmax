We present a study of adiabatic Cooper pair pumping in one dimensional array
of Cooper pair boxes. We do a detailed theoretical analysis of an
experimentally realizable stabilized charge pumping scheme in a linear array of
Cooper pair boxes. Our system is subjected to synchronized flux and voltage
fields and travel along a loop which encloses their critical ground state of
the system in the flux-voltage plane. The locking potential in the sine-Gordon
model slides and changes its minimum which yields the Cooper pair pumping. Our
analytical methods are the Berry phase analysis and Abelian bosonization
studies.
