We review our recent modeling of crystal nucleation and polycrystalline
growth using a phase field theory. First, we consider the applicability of
phase field theory for describing crystal nucleation in a model hard sphere
fluid. It is shown that the phase field theory accurately predicts the
nucleation barrier height for this liquid when the model parameters are fixed
by independent molecular dynamics calculations. We then address various aspects
of polycrystalline solidification and associated crystal pattern formation at
relatively long timescales. This late stage growth regime, which is not
accessible by molecular dynamics, involves nucleation at the growth front to
create new crystal grains in addition to the effects of primary nucleation.
Finally, we consider the limit of extreme polycrystalline growth, where the
disordering effect due to prolific grain formation leads to isotropic growth
patterns at long times, i.e., spherulite formation. Our model of spherulite
growth exhibits branching at fixed grain misorientations, induced by the
inclusion of a metastable minimum in the orientational free energy. It is
demonstrated that a broad variety of spherulitic patterns can be recovered by
changing only a few model parameters.
