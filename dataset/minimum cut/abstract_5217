Given a 3-graph H, let \ex_2(n, H) denote the maximum value of the minimum
codegree of a 3-graph on n vertices which does not contain a copy of H. Let F
denote the Fano plane, which is the 3-graph
\{axx',ayy',azz',xyz',xy'z,x'yz,x'y'z'\}. Mubayi proved that
\ex_2(n,F)=(1/2+o(1))n and conjectured that \ex_2(n, F)=\floor{n/2} for
sufficiently large n. Using a very sophisticated quasi-randomness argument,
Keevash proved Mubayi's conjecture. Here we give a simple proof of Mubayi's
conjecture by using a class of 3-graphs that we call rings. We also determine
the Tur\'an density of the family of rings.
