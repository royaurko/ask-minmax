In this work is elaborated the wording of Fermat`s principle for
electromagnetic waves spreading in materials with negative index of refractions
(MNR). The recent experiments with such material has confirmed their main
characteristics, predicted earlier. It is shown that for MNR not applicable
wording of Fermat`s principle through minimum (or extremum) of time of
spreading the wave between two points. The correct wording for this case is a
wording through extremum of total optical length for way between two points
moreover optical length at passing of wave through MNR is taken negative. In
paper are considered some properties of original flat lenses, executed from
MNR.
