We report a study of disorder effects on epitaxial graphene in the vicinity
of the Dirac point by magneto-transport. Hall effect measurements show that the
carrier density increases quadratically with temperature, in good agreement
with theoretical predictions which take into account intrinsic thermal
excitation combined with electron-hole puddles induced by charged impurities.
We deduce disorder strengths in the range 10.2 $\sim$ 31.2 meV, depending on
the sample treatment. We investigate the scattering mechanisms and estimate the
impurity density to be $3.0 \sim 9.1 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ for our samples.
An asymmetry in the electron/hole scattering is observed and is consistent with
theoretical calculations for graphene on SiC substrates. We also show that the
minimum conductivity increases with increasing disorder potential, in good
agreement with quantum-mechanical numerical calculations.
