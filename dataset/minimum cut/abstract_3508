In complex systems with many degrees of freedom such as peptides and proteins
there exist a huge number of local-minimum-energy states. Conventional
simulations in the canonical ensemble are of little use, because they tend to
get trapped in states of these energy local minima. A simulation in generalized
ensemble performs a random walk in potential energy space and can overcome this
difficulty. From only one simulation run, one can obtain canonical-ensemble
averages of physical quantities as functions of temperature by the
single-histogram and/or multiple-histogram reweighting techniques. In this
article we review uses of the generalized-ensemble algorithms. Three well-known
methods, multicanonical algorithm, simulated tempering, and replica-exchange
method, are described first. Both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics versions
of the algorithms are given. We then present three new generalized-ensemble
algorithms which combine the merits of the above methods. The effectiveness of
the methods for molecular simulations in the protein folding problem is tested
with short peptide systems.
