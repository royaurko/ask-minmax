Temperature dependent conformations of linear polymer molecules adsorbed at
carbon nanotube (CNT) interfaces are investigated through molecule dynamics
simulations. Model polyethylene (PE) molecules are shown to have selective
conformations on CNT surface, controlled by atomic structures of CNT lattice
and geometric coiling energy. PE molecules form entropy driven assembly
domains, and their preferred wrapping angles around large radius CNT (40, 40)
reflect the molecule configurations with energy minimums on a graphite plane.
While PE molecules prefer wrapping on small radius armchair CNT (5, 5)
predominantly at low temperatures, their configurations are shifted to larger
wrapping angle ones on a similar radius zigzag CNT (10, 0). A nematic
transformation around 280 K is identified through Landau-deGennes theory, with
molecule aligning along tube axis in extended conformations
