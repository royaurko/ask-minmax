We present a new characteristic of a regular ideal language called reset
complexity. We find some bounds on the reset complexity in terms of the state
complexity of a given language. We also compare the reset complexity and the
state complexity for languages related to slowly synchronizing automata and
study uniqueness question for automata yielding the minimum of reset
complexity.
