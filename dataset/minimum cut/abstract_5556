The field-angle-resolved specific heat C(T,H,phi) of the f-electron
superconductor CeRu2 (Tc=6.3 K) has been measured at low temperatures down to
90 mK on two single crystals of slightly different qualities. We reveal that
the C(phi) oscillation in a rotating magnetic field, originating from the gap
anisotropy, diminishes at low temperatures below the characteristic field H*,
as expected for an anisotropic gap without nodes. We also observe the
suppression of H* by decreasing the gap anisotropy ratio $\Delta_{\rm
min}/\Delta_{\rm max}$, a behavior that has been predicted from a microscopic
theory for anisotropic s-wave superconductors. The present technique is
established as a powerful tool for investigating minimum-gap structures as well
as nodal structures.
