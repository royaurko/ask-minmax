It has been shown numerically that the performance of the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm can be improved by including a second order correction known as the
geodesic acceleration. In this paper we give the method a more sound
theoretical foundation by deriving the geodesic acceleration correction without
using differential geometry and showing that the traditional convergence proofs
can be adapted to incorporate geodesic acceleration. Unlike other methods which
include second derivative information, the geodesic acceleration does not
attempt to improve the Gauss-Newton approximate Hessian, but rather is an
extension of the small-residual approximation to cubic order. In deriving
geodesic acceleration, we note that the small-residual approximation is
complemented by a small-curvature approximation. This latter approximation
provides a much broader justification for the Gauss-Newton approximate Hessian
and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. In particular, it is justifiable even if the
best fit residuals are large, is dependent only on the model and not on the
data being fit, and is applicable for the entire course of the algorithm and
not just the region near the minimum.
