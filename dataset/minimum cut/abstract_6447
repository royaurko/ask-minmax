A recent result of Zheng and Tse states that over a quasi-static channel,
there exists a fundamental tradeoff, referred to as the diversity-multiplexing
gain (D-MG) tradeoff, between the spatial multiplexing gain and the diversity
gain that can be simultaneously achieved by a space-time (ST) block code. This
tradeoff is precisely known in the case of i.i.d. Rayleigh-fading, for T>=
n_t+n_r-1 where T is the number of time slots over which coding takes place and
n_t,n_r are the number of transmit and receive antennas respectively. For T <
n_t+n_r-1, only upper and lower bounds on the D-MG tradeoff are available.
  In this paper, we present a complete solution to the problem of explicitly
constructing D-MG optimal ST codes, i.e., codes that achieve the D-MG tradeoff
for any number of receive antennas. We do this by showing that for the square
minimum-delay case when T=n_t=n, cyclic-division-algebra (CDA) based ST codes
having the non-vanishing determinant property are D-MG optimal. While
constructions of such codes were previously known for restricted values of n,
we provide here a construction for such codes that is valid for all n.
  For the rectangular, T > n_t case, we present two general techniques for
building D-MG-optimal rectangular ST codes from their square counterparts. A
byproduct of our results establishes that the D-MG tradeoff for all T>= n_t is
the same as that previously known to hold for T >= n_t + n_r -1.
