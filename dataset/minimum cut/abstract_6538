The conditional diameter of a connected graph $\Gamma=(V,E)$ is defined as
follows: given a property ${\cal P}$ of a pair $(\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2)$ of
subgraphs of $\Gamma$, the so-called \emph{conditional diameter} or ${\cal
P}$-{\em diameter} measures the maximum distance among subgraphs satisfying
${\cal P}$. That is, \[ D_{{\cal P}}(\Gamma):=\max_{\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2\subset
\Gamma} \{\partial(\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2): \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \quad {\rm satisfy
}\quad {\cal P}\}. \] In this paper we consider the conditional diameter in
which ${\cal P}$ requires that $\delta(u)\ge \alpha$ for all $ u\in
V(\Gamma_1)$, $\delta(v)\ge \beta$ for all $v\in V(\Gamma_2)$, $| V(\Gamma_1)|
\ge s$ and $| V(\Gamma_2)| \ge t$ for some integers $1\le s,t\le |V|$ and
$\delta \le \alpha, \beta \le \Delta$, where $\delta(x)$ denotes the degree of
a vertex $x$ of $\Gamma$, $\delta$ denotes the minimum degree and $\Delta$ the
maximum degree of $\Gamma$. The conditional diameter obtained is called
$(\alpha ,\beta, s,t)$-\emph{diameter}. We obtain upper bounds on the $(\alpha
,\beta, s,t)$-diameter by using the $k$-alternating polynomials on the mesh of
eigenvalues of an associated weighted graph. The method provides also bounds
for other parameters such as vertex separators.
