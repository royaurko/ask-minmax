Using the ATLAS detector, observations have been made of a
centrality-dependent dijet asymmetry in the collisions of lead ions at the
Large Hadron Collider. In a sample of lead-lead events with a per-nucleon
center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV, selected with a minimum bias trigger, jets
are reconstructed in fine-grained, longitudinally-segmented electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeters. The underlying event is measured and subtracted
event-by-event, giving estimates of jet transverse energy above the ambient
background. The transverse energies of dijets in opposite hemispheres is
observed to become systematically more unbalanced with increasing event
centrality leading to a large number of events which contain highly asymmetric
dijets. This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such
large dijet asymmetries, not observed in proton-proton collisions, and which
may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot,
dense medium.
