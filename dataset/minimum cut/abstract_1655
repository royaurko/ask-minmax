We derive catastrophic senescence of the Pacific salmon from an aging model
which was recently proposed by Stauffer. The model is based on the postulates
of a minimum reproduction age and a maximal genetic lifespan. It allows for
self-organization of a typical age of first reproduction and a typical age of
death. Our Monte Carlo simulations of the population dynamics show that the
model leads to catastrophic senescence for semelparous reproduction as it
occurs in the case of salmon, but to a more gradually increase of senescence
for iteroparous reproduction.
