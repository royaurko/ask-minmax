We report a dual-band observation at 223 and 654 GHz (460 micron) toward an
ultracompact (UC) HII region, G240.31+0.07, with the Submillimeter Array. With
a beam size of 1"5 X 0"8, the dust continuum emission is resolved into two
clumps, with clump A coincident well with an H2O maser and the UC HII region.
The newly discovered clump, B, about 1"3 (~8.3 X 10^3 AU) to the southwest of
clump A, is also associated with H2O masers and may be a more recent
star-forming site. The continuum flux densities imply an opacity spectral index
of \beta = 1.5 +- 0.3, suggestive of a value lower than the canonical 2.0 found
in the interstellar medium and in cold, massive cores. The presence of hot
(~100 K) molecular gas is derived by the brightness ratio of two H2CO lines in
the 223 GHz band. A radial velocity difference of 2.5 +- 0.4 km/s is found
between the two clumps in C18O (6-5) emission. The total (nebular and stellar)
mass of roughly 58 Msun in the central region is close to, but not by far
larger than, the minimum mass required for the two clumps to be gravitationally
bound for binary rotation. Our continuum data do not suggest a large amount of
matter associated with the H2 knots that were previously proposed to arise from
a massive disk or envelope.
