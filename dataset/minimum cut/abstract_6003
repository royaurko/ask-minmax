A common method to reduce the uncertainty of causal inferences from
experiments is to assign treatments in fixed proportions within groups of
similar units: blocking. Previous results indicate that one can expect
substantial reductions in variance if these groups are formed so to contain
exactly as many units as treatment conditions. This approach can be contrasted
to threshold blocking which, instead of specifying a fixed size, requires that
the groups contain a minimum number of units. In this paper, I investigate the
advantages of respective method. In particular, I show that threshold blocking
is superior to fixed-sized blocking in the sense that it always finds a weakly
better grouping for any objective and sample. However, this does not
necessarily hold when the objective function of the blocking problem is
unknown, and a fixed-sized design can perform better in that case. I
specifically examine the factors that govern how the methods perform in the
common situation where the objective is to reduce the estimator's variance, but
where groups are constructed based on covariates. This reveals that the
relative performance of threshold blocking improves when the covariates become
more predictive of the outcome.
