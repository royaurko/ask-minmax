The two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) can have two electroweak breaking,
CP-conserving, minima. The possibility arises that the minimum which
corresponds to the known elementary particle spectrum is metastable, a
possibility we call the "panic vacuum". We present analytical bounds on the
parameters of the softly broken Peccei-Quinn 2HDM which are necessary and
sufficient conditions to avoid this possibility. We also show that, for this
particular model, the current LHC data already tell us that we are necessarily
in the global minimum of the theory, regardless of any cosmological
considerations about the lifetime of the false vacua.
