We study the evolution of correlations in a quasi-2D dipolar gas driven
out-of-equilibrium by a sudden ramp of the interaction strength. For
sufficiently strong ramps, the momentum distribution, excited fraction and
density-density correlation function all display pronounced features that are
directly related to the appearance of a roton minimum in the underlying
spectrum. Our study suggests that the evolution of correlations following a
quench can be used as a probe of roton-like excitations in a dipolar gas. We
also find that the build up of density-density correlations following a quench
occurs much more slowly in the dipolar gas compared to a non-dipolar gas, owing
to the long-range interactions.
