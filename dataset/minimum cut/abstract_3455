A model of localized classical electrons coupled to lattice degrees of
freedom and, via the Coulomb interaction, to each other, has been studied to
gain insight into the charge and orbital ordering observed in lightly doped
manganese perovskites. Expressions are obtained for the minimum energy and
ionic displacements caused by given hole and electron orbital configurations.
The expressions are analyzed for several hole configurations, including that
experimentally observed by Yamada et al. in La_{7/8}Sr_{1/8}MnO_3. We find
that, although the preferred charge and orbital ordering depend sensitively on
parameters, there are ranges of the parameters in which the experimentally
observed hole configuration has the lowest energy. For these parameter values
we also find that the energy differences between different hole configurations
are on the order of the observed charge ordering transition temperature. The
effects of additional strains are also studied. Some results for
La_{1/2}Ca_{1/2}MnO_3 are presented, although our model may not adequately
describe this material because the high temperature phase is metallic.
