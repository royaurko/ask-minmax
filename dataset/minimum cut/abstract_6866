We present the recent results on non-photonic electron (NPE) yields from RHIC
run8 p+p collisions. The $e/\pi$ ratio as a function of $p_T$ in run8 with a
factor of 10 reduction of the inner detector material at STAR is found to be
consistent with those results from run3 taking into account the NPE from charm
leptonic decay and the difference of photonic electron yield from photon
conversion in detector material. \Jpsi spectra in \pp and \cucu collisions at
\sNN = 200 GeV with high sampled luminosity \Jpsi spectrum at high-\pT follows
$x_T$ scaling, but the scaling is violated at low \pT. $J/\psi$-hadron
correlations in \pp collisions are studied to understand the \Jpsi production
mechanism at high $p_T$. We observed an absence of charged hadrons accompanying
\Jpsi on the near-side, in contrast to the strong correlation peak in the
di-hadron correlations. This constrains the $B$-meson contribution and jet
fragmentation to inclusive \Jpsi to be ${}^{<}_{\sim}17%$. Yields in
minimum-bias \cucu collisions are consistent with those in \pp collisions
scaled by the underlying binary nucleon-nucleon collisions in the measured \pT
range. Other measurements and future projects related to heavy-flavors are
discussed.
