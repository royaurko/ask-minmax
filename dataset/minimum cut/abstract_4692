We review the stability of magnetized strange quark matter (MSQM) within the
phenomenological MIT bag model, taking into account the variation of the
relevant input parameters, namely, the strange quark mass, baryon density,
magnetic field and bag parameter. A comparison with magnetized asymmetric quark
matter in $\beta$-equilibrium as well as with strange quark matter (SQM) is
presented. We obtain that the energy per baryon for MSQM decreases as the
magnetic field increases, and its minimum value at vanishing pressure is lower
than the value found for SQM, which implies that MSQM is more stable than
non-magnetized SQM. The mass-radius relation for magnetized strange quark stars
is also obtained in this framework.
