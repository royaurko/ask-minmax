The Galactic Cepheid period histogram has a strong dip between 8 and 10 days
that has defied an explanation based on evolutionary and linear pulsation
studies. We show here that this deficiency is caused by the instability of the
nonlinear fundamental pulsation cycle in this period range. The strong
metallicity dependence of this instability is consistent with the absence of a
corresponding minimum in the Magellanic Cloud data. Our results also suggest
that the Galactic Cepheids must have a large spread in metallicity.
