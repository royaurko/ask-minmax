The cluster decay process in $^{270-318}$118 superheavy nuclei has been
studied extensively within the Coulomb and proximity potential model (CPPM),
thereby investigating the probable cluster decays from the various isotopes of
$Z = 118$. On comparing the predicted decay half lives with the values
evaluated using the Universal formula for cluster decay (UNIV) of Poenaru et
al., the Universal Decay Law (UDL) of Qi et al., and the Scaling Law of Horoi
et al., it was seen that, our values matches well with these theoretical
values. A comparison of the predicted alpha decay half life of the
experimentally synthesized superheavy isotope $^{294}$118 with its
corresponding experimental value shows that, our theoretical value is in good
agreement with the experimental value. The plots for $log_{10}(T_{1/2})$
against the neutron number of the daughter in the corresponding decay reveals
the behavior of the cluster half lives with the neutron number of the daughter
nuclei and for most of the decays, the half life was found to be the minimum
for the decay leading to a daughter with $N = 184$. Most of the predicted half
lives are well within the present experimental upper limit ($10^{30}$s) and
lower limit ($10^{-6}$s) for measurements and hence these predictions may be of
great use for further experimental investigation on cluster decay in the
superheavy region.
