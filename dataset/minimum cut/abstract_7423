We report the detection of an exoplanet candidate in orbit around sigma
Persei from a radial velocity (RV) survey. The system exhibits periodic RV
variations of 579.8 +/- 2.4 days. The purpose of the survey is to search for
low-amplitude and long-period RV variations in giants and examine the origin of
the variations using the fiber-fed Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph
installed at the 1.8-m telescope of Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory in
Korea. We present high-accuracy RV measurements of sigma Per made from December
2003 to January 2014. We argue that the RV variations are not related to the
surface inhomogeneities but instead a Keplerian motion of the planetary
companion is the most likely explanation. Assuming a stellar mass of 2.25 +/-
0.5 M_Sun, we obtain a minimum planetary companion mass of 6.5 +/- 1.0 M_Jup,
with an orbital semi-major axis of 1.8 +/- 0.1 AU, and an eccentricity of 0.3
+/- 0.1 around sigma Per.
