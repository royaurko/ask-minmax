Using kinetic theory, we calculate the shear viscosity and the spin diffusion
coefficient as well as the associated relaxation times for a two-component
Fermi gas in two dimensions, as a function of temperature, coupling strength,
polarization, and mass ratio of the two components. It is demonstrated that the
minimum value of the viscosity decreases with the mass ratio, since Fermi
blocking becomes less efficient. We furthermore analyze recent experimental
results for the quadrupole mode of a 2D gas in terms of viscous damping
obtaining a qualitative agreement using no fitting parameters.
