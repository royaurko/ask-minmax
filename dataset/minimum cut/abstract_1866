In the Skyrme model, atomic nuclei are identified with solitonic
configurations. If the pion mass is set to zero, these configurations are
spherical shells of energy with a fullerene-like appearance and are well
approximated by a simple rational map ansatz. Using simulated annealing, we
have calculated minimum energy configurations for non-zero pion mass and have
found that they are less round and are less well approximated by the rational
map ansatz.
