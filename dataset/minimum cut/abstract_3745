We present the results of a search for leptoquark (LQ) pairs in (85.2 +- 3.7)
pb^{-1} of p anti-p collider data collected by the D0 experiment at the
Fermilab Tevatron. We observe no evidence for leptoquark production and set a
limit on sigma(p anti-p -> LQ anti-LQ -> neutrino neutrino + jets) as a
function of the mass of the leptoquark (m_{LQ}). Assuming the decay LQ ->
neutrino q, we exclude scalar leptoquarks for m_{LQ} < 98 GeV/c^2, and vector
leptoquarks for m_{LQ} < 200 GeV/c^2 and coupling which produces the minimum
cross section, at a 95% confidence level.
