For graphs $F$ and $H$, we say $F$ is Ramsey for $H$ if every $2$-coloring of
the edges of $F$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H$. The graph $F$ is Ramsey
$H$-minimal if $F$ is Ramsey for $H$ and there is no proper subgraph $F'$ of
$F$ so that $F'$ is Ramsey for $H$. Burr, Erdos, and Lovasz defined $s(H)$ to
be the minimum degree of $F$ over all Ramsey $H$-minimal graphs $F$. Define
$H_{t,d}$ to be a graph on $t+1$ vertices consisting of a complete graph on $t$
vertices and one additional vertex of degree $d$. We show that $s(H_{t,d})=d^2$
for all values $1<d\le t$; it was previously known that $s(H_{t,1})=t-1$, so it
is surprising that $s(H_{t,2})=4$ is much smaller.
  We also make some further progress on some sparser graphs. Fox and Lin
observed that $s(H)\ge 2\delta(H)-1$ for all graphs $H$, where $\delta(H)$ is
the minimum degree of $H$; Szabo, Zumstein, and Zurcher investigated which
graphs have this property and conjectured that all bipartite graphs $H$ without
isolated vertices satisfy $s(H)=2\delta(H)-1$. Fox, Grinshpun, Liebenau,
Person, and Szabo further conjectured that all triangle-free graphs without
isolated vertices satisfy this property. We show that $d$-regular $3$-connected
triangle-free graphs $H$, with one extra technical constraint, satisfy $s(H) =
2\delta(H)-1$; the extra constraint is that $H$ has a vertex $v$ so that if one
removes $v$ and its neighborhood from $H$, the remainder is connected.
