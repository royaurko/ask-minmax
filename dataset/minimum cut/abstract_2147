We present a self-consistent solution for a model of a d-wave superconductor
with finite concen- tration of Anderson impurities at zero temperature using
the slave boson method. We show how the phase diagram depends on the strength
of interaction between impurity and extended states. For fixed impurity level
energy $E_0$ in the Kondo limit there is one superconducting-normal state
transition for all impurity concentrations $n$. When $E_0$ is close the Fermi
energy there are three such transitions for impurity concentration exceeding
certain minimum value $n(\Gamma_0,E_0)$. If hybridization $\Gamma_0$ is fixed
and the depth of the impurity level is varied, there are always two transitions
for concentration above $n(\Gamma_0,E_0)$.
