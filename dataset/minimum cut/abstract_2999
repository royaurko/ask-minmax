We study the secant varieties of the Veronese varieties and of Veronese
reembeddings of a smooth projective variety. We give some conditions, under
which these secant varieties are set-theoretically cut out by determinantal
equations. More precisely, they are given by minors of a catalecticant matrix.
These conditions include the case when the dimension of the projective variety
is at most 3 and the degree of reembedding is sufficiently high. This gives a
positive answer to a set-theoretic version of a question of Eisenbud in
dimension at most 3. For dimension four and higher we produce plenty of
examples when the catalecticant minors are not enough to set-theoretically
define the secant varieties to high degree Veronese varieties. This is done by
relating the problem to smoothability of certain zero-dimensional Gorenstein
schemes.
