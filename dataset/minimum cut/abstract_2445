Let $G$ be an unmixed bipartite graph of dimension $d-1$. Assume that
$K_{n,n}$, with $n\ge 2$, is a maximal complete bipartite subgraph of $G$ of
minimum dimension. Then $G$ is Cohen-Macaulay in codimension $d-n+1$. This
generalizes a characterization of Cohen-Macaulay bipartite graphs by Herzog and
Hibi and a result of Cook and Nagel on unmixed Buchsbaum graphs. Furthermore,
we show that any unmixed bipartite graph $G$ which is Cohen-Macaulay in
codimension $t$, is obtained from a Cohen-Macaulay graph by replacing certain
edges of $G$ with complete bipartite graphs. We provide some examples.
