We investigate the dynamics of a binary mixture Lennard-Jones system of
different system sizes with respect to the importance of the properties of the
underlying potential energy landscape (PEL). We show that the dynamics of small
systems can be very well described within the continuous time random walk
formalism, which is determined solely by PEL parameters. Finite size analysis
shows that the diffusivity of large and small systems are very similar. This
suggests that the PEL parameters of the small system also determine the local
dynamics in large systems. The structural relaxation time, however, displays
significant finite size effects. Furthermore, using a non-equilibrium
configuration of a large system, we find that causal connections exist between
close-by regions of the system. These findings can be described by the coupled
landscape model for which a macroscopic system is described by a superposition
of elementary systems each described by its PEL. A minimum coupling is
introduced which accounts for the finite size behavior. The coupling strength,
as the single adjustable parameter, becomes smaller closer to the glass
transition.
