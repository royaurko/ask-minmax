A fabrication process has been developed for fully planarized Nb-based
superconducting inter-layer connections (vias) with minimum size down to 250 nm
for superconductor very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits with 8 and 10
superconducting layers on 200-mm wafers. Instead of single Nb wiring layers, it
utilizes Nb/Al/Nb trilayers for each wiring layer to form Nb pillars (studs)
providing vertical connections between the wires etched in the bottom layer of
the trilayer and the next wiring layer that is also deposited as a Nb/Al/Nb
trilayer. This technology makes possible a dramatic increase in the density of
superconducting digital circuits by reducing the area of interconnects with
respect to presently utilized etched contact holes between superconducting
layers and by enabling the use of stacked vias. Results on the fabrication and
size dependence of electric properties of Nb studs with dimensions near the
resolution limit of 248-nm photolithography are presented in the normal and
superconducting states. Superconducting critical current density in the
fabricated stud-vias is about 0.3 A/{\mu}m2 and approaches the depairing
current density of Nb films.
