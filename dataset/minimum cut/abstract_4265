We present the study of type II A flux vacua and their M-theory duals for
compactification on a class of Calabi-Yau orientifolds. The Kaehler potential
is derived from toroidal compactifications and the superpotential contains a
contribution from non-Abelian gauge degrees of freedoms. We obtain complete
stabilisation of the moduli. We found one supersymmetric minimum and several
non supersymmetric ones. Consistency of the analysis constrains the parameters
of the models in a finite region containing a finite, although very large,
number of flux vacua. From the M-theory side, we found some differences in the
distributions of the physical quantities with respect to the M-theory ensemble
studied by Acharya et al. In particular, it is easier to find small
supersymmetry breaking scale.
