We report on the discovery of a new pulsating X-ray source during Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer observations of a low galactic latitude field centered at RA
(J2000) = 19 hr 05 m 43 s and Dec (J2000) = +08 deg 58 arcmin 48 arcsec.
Significant pulsations were detected by both the PCA and HEXTE instruments
aboard RXTE at a fundamental period of 89.17 +/- 0.02 seconds, with higher
harmonics also visible in the 2-10 keV power spectrum. The folded lightcurve
from the source is multiply peaked at lower energies, and changes to single
peaked morphology above ~20 keV. The phase averaged spectrum from the source is
well fit by strongly absorbed power law or thermal bremsstrahlung spectral
models of photon index 1.9 +/- 0.1 or temperature 19.5 +/- 4.6 keV,
respectively. The mean neutral hydrogen column density is approximately 10^23
cm^-2, suggesting a distance of >10 kpc to the source and a minimum 2-10 keV
X-ray luminosity of 2*10^{35} ergs s^{-1}. By comparison with other pulsars
with similar periods and luminosities, we suggest that XTE J1906+09 has a
supergiant companion with an underfilled Roche lobe. We speculate further that
one of the M stars in a peculiar M star binary system may be the companion.
