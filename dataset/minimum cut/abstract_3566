We report a novel method for depositing patterned dielectric layers with
sub-micron features using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The patterned films
are superior to sputtered or evaporated films in continuity, smoothness,
conformality, and minimum feature size. Films were deposited at 100-150C using
several different precursors and patterned using either PMMA or photoresist.
The low deposition temperature permits uniform film growth without significant
outgassing or hardbaking of resist layers. A liftoff technique presented here
gives sharp step edges with edge roughness as low as ~10 nm. We also measure
dielectric constants (k) and breakdown fields for the high-k materials aluminum
oxide (k ~ 8-9), hafnium oxide (k ~ 16-19) and zirconium oxide (k ~ 20-29),
grown under similar low temperature conditions.
