In this paper we study the curvature flow of a curve in a plane endowed with
a minkowskian norm whose unit ball is smooth. We show that many of the
properties known in the euclidean case can be extended (with due adaptations)
to this new situation. In particular, we show that simple, closed, strictly
convex, smooth curves remain so until the area enclosed by them vanishes.
Moreover, their isoperimetric ratios converge to the minimum possible value,
only attained by the minkowskian circle - so these curves converge to a
minkowskian "circular point" as the enclosed area approaches zero.
