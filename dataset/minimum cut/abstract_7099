Background: Theoretical calculations of the four-particle scattering above
the four-cluster breakup threshold are technically very difficult due to
nontrivial singularities or boundary conditions. Further complications arise
when the long-range Coulomb force is present.
  Purpose: We aim at calculating proton-${}^3$He elastic scattering observables
above three- and four-cluster breakup threshold.
  Methods: We employ Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations for the
four-nucleon transition operators and solve them in the momentum-space
framework using the complex-energy method whose accuracy and practical
applicability is improved by a special integration method.
  Results: Using realistic nuclear interaction models we obtain fully converged
results for the proton-${}^3$He elastic scattering. The differential cross
section, proton and ${}^3$He analyzing powers, spin correlation and spin
transfer coefficients are calculated at proton energies ranging from 7 to 35
MeV. Effective three- and four-nucleon forces are included via the explicit
excitation of a nucleon to a $\Delta$ isobar.
  Conclusions: Realistic proton-${}^3$He scattering calculations above the
four-nucleon breakup threshold are feasible. There is quite good agreement
between the theoretical predictions and experimental data for the
proton-${}^3$He scattering in the considered energy regime. The most remarkable
disagreements are the peak of the proton analyzing power at lower energies and
the minimum of the differential cross section at higher energies. Inclusion of
the $\Delta$ isobar reduces the latter discrepancy.
