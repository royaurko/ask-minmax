The NA49 experiment has collected comprehensive data on particle production
in nucleus-nucleus collisions over the whole SPS beam energies range, the
critical energy domain where the expected phase transition to a deconfined
phase is expected to occur. The latest results from Pb+Pb collisions between
20$A$ GeV and 158$A$ GeV on baryon stopping and light nuclei production as well
as those for strange hyperons are presented.
  The measured data on $p$, $\bar{p}$, $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $\Xi^-$ and
$\bar{\Xi}^+$ production were used to evaluate the rapidity distributions of
net-baryons at SPS energies and to compare with the results from the AGS and
the RHIC for central Pb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions.
  The dependence of the yield ratios and the inverse slope parameter of the
$m_t$ spectra on the collision energy and centrality, and the mass number of
the produced nuclei $^3He$, $t$, $d$ and $\bar{d}$ are discussed within
coalescence and statistical approaches. Analysis of the total multiplicity
exhibits remarkable agreement between the measured yield for $^3He$ and those
predicted by the statistical hadronization model.
  In addition, new results on $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ as well as $\Xi^-$
production in minimum bias Pb+Pb reactions at 40$A$ GeV and 158$A$ GeV and
central C+C, Si+Si and Pb+Pb collisions are presented. The system size
dependence of the yields of these hyperons was analysed to determine the
evolution of strangeness enhancement relative to elementary p+p collisions.
