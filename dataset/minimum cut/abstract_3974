The thermal equilibrium of string gas is necessary to activate the
Brandenberger-Vafa mechanism, which makes our observed 4-dimensional universe
enlarge. Nevertheless, the thermal equilibrium is not realized in the original
setup, a problem that remains as a critical defect. We study thermal
equilibrium in the Hagedorn universe, and explore possibilities for avoiding
the issue aforementioned flaw. We employ a minimal modification of the original
setup, introducing a dilaton potential. Two types of potential are
investigated: exponential and double-well potentials. For the first type, the
basic evolutions of universe and dilaton are such that both the radius of the
universe and the dilaton asymptotically grow in over a short time, or that the
radius converges to a constant value while the dilaton rolls down toward the
weak coupling limit. For the second type, in addition to the above solutions,
there is another solution in which the dilaton is stabilized at a minimum of
potential and the radius grows in proportion to $t$. Thermal equilibrium is
realized for both cases during the initial phase. These simple setups provide
possible resolutions of the difficulty.
