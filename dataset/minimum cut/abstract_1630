We propose a new mechanism to increase the reactions ratesin multistable
autocatalytic systems. The mechanism is based upon the possibility for the
enhancement of the response of the system due to the cooperative behavior
between the noise and an external periodic modulation. In order to illustrate
this feature we compute the reaction velocities for the particular case of the
Sel'Kov model, showing that they increase significantly when the periodic
modulation is introduced. This behavior originates from the existence of a
minimum in the mean first passage time, one of the signatures of stochastic
resonance.
