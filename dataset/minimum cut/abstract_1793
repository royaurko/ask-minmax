For hamiltonian lattice gauge theory, we introduce the matrix product anzats
inspired from density matrix renormalization group. In this method,
wavefunction of the target state is assumed to be a product of finite matrices.
As a result, the energy becomes a simple function of the matrices, which can be
evaluated using a computer. The minimum of the energy function corresponds to
the vacuum state. We show that the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain model are well
described with the ansatz. The method is also applied to the two-dimensional
S=1/2 Heisenberg and U(1) plaquette chain models.
