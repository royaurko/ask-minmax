We report optical and near-infrared spectra of the central star of the radio
source G79.29+0.46, a candidate luminous blue variable. The spectra contain
numerous narrow (FWHM < 100 km/s emission lines of which the low-lying hydrogen
lines are the strongest, and resemble spectra of other LBVc's and B[e]
supergiants. A few prominent infrared lines are unidentified. The terminal wind
speed is determined from H alpha to be 110 km/s. The strength of H alpha
implies the presence of a very dense wind. Extended emission from H alpha and
[N II] was detected but appears to be associated with the Cygnus X region
rather than the radio source. Both diffuse interstellar bands and interstellar
absorption lines are present in the optical spectrum of the central star,
suggesting that there are both diffuse and molecular cloud components to the
extinction and implying a minimum distance of 1 kpc and minimum luminosity of
\~10^5 L(sun) for the star. The new spectra and their analysis indicate a low
excitation, dense, and slowly expanding wind and support the LBVc
classification.
