The PHENIX Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured
open heavy-flavor production in minimum bias Au$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV via the yields of electrons from semileptonic decays
of charm and bottom hadrons. Previous heavy-flavor electron measurements
indicated substantial modification in the momentum distribution of the parent
heavy quarks due to the quark-gluon plasma created in these collisions. For the
first time, using the PHENIX silicon vertex detector to measure precision
displaced tracking, the relative contributions from charm and bottom hadrons to
these electrons as a function of transverse momentum are measured in Au$+$Au
collisions. We compare the fraction of electrons from bottom hadrons to
previously published results extracted from electron-hadron correlations in
$p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV and find the fractions to be
similar within the large uncertainties on both measurements for $p_T>4$
GeV/$c$. We use the bottom electron fractions in Au$+$Au and $p$$+$$p$ along
with the previously measured heavy flavor electron $R_{AA}$ to calculate the
$R_{AA}$ for electrons from charm and bottom hadron decays separately. We find
that electrons from bottom hadron decays are less suppressed than those from
charm for the region $3<p_T<4$ GeV/$c$.
