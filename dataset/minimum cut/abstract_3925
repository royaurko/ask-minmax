We study dynamical gauge symmetry breaking via compactified space in the
framework of SU(N) gauge theory in M^{d-1}\times S^1 (d=4,5,6) space-time. In
particular, we study in detail the gauge symmetry breaking in SU(2) and SU(3)
gauge theories when the models contain both fundamental and adjoint matter. As
a result, we find that any pattern of gauge symmetry breaking can be realized
by selecting an appropriate set of numbers (Nf,Nad) in these cases. This is
achieved without tuning boundary conditions of the matter fields. As a
by-product, in some cases we obtain an effective potential which has no
curvature at the minimum, thus leading to massless Higgs scalars, irrespective
of the size of the compactified space.
