Within the Standard Model, the current Higgs and top quark data favor
metastability of the electroweak vacuum, although the uncertainties are still
significant. The true vacuum is many orders of magnitude deeper than ours and
the barrier separating the two is tiny compared to the depth of the well. This
raises a cosmological question: how did the Higgs field get trapped in the
shallow minimum and why did it stay there during inflation? The Higgs initial
conditions before inflation must be fine--tuned to about one part in 10^8 in
order for the Higgs field to end up in the right vacuum. In this note, we show
that these problems can be resolved if there is a small positive coupling
between the Higgs and the inflaton.
