The accurate estimation of scaling exponents is central in the observational
study of scale-invariant phenomena. Natural systems unavoidably provide
observations over restricted intervals; consequently a stationary stochastic
process (time series) can yield anomalous time variation in the scaling
exponents, suggestive of non-stationarity. The variance in the estimates of
scaling exponents computed from an interval of N observations is known for
finite variance processes to vary as ~1/N as N goes to infinity for certain
statistical estimators; however, the convergence to this behaviour will depend
on the details of the process, and may be slow. We study the variation in the
scaling of second order moments of the time series increments with N, for a
variety of synthetic and `real world' time series; and find that in particular
for heavy tailed processes, for realizable N, one is far from this 1/N limiting
behaviour. We propose a semi-empirical estimate for the minimum N needed to
make a meaningful estimate of the scaling exponents for model stochastic
processes and compare these with some `real world' time series.
