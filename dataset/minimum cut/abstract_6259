Satellite CMB anisotropy missions and new generation of balloon-borne and
ground experiments, make use of complex multi-frequency instruments at the
focus of a meter class telescope. Between 70 GHz and 300 GHz, where foreground
contamination is minimum, it is extremely important to reach the best trade-off
between the improvement of the angular resolution and the minimization of the
straylight contamination mainly due to the Galactic emission. We focus here, as
a working case, on the 30 and 100 GHz channels of the Planck Low Frequency
Instrument (LFI). We evaluate the GSC introduced by the most relevant Galactic
foreground components for a reference set of optical configurations. We show
that it is possible to improve the angular resolution of 5-7% by keeping the
overall GSC below the level of few microKelvin. A comparison between the level
of straylight introduced by the different Galactic components for different
beam regions is presented. Simple approximate relations giving the rms and
peak-to-peak levels of the GSC are provided. We compare the results obtained at
100 GHz with those at 30 GHz, where GSC is more critical. Finally, we compare
the results based on Galactic foreground templates derived from radio and IR
surveys with those based on WMAP maps including CMB and extragalactic source
fluctuations.
