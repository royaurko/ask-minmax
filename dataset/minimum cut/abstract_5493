This paper reports the design and cold test of the cavity beam position
monitor (CBPM) for SX-FEL to fulfill the requirement of beam position
measurement resolution of less than 1{\mu}m, even 0.1{\mu}m. The CBPM was
optimized by using a coupling slot to damp the TM010 mode in the output signal.
The isolation of TM010 mode is about 117dB, and the shunt impedance is about
200{\Omega}@4.65GHz with the quality factor 80 from MAFIA simulation and test
result. A special antenna was designed to load power for reducing excitation of
other modes in the cavity. The resulting output power of TM110 mode was about
90mV/mm when the source was 6dBm, and the accomplishable minimum voltage was
about 200{\mu}V. The resolution of the CBPM was about 0.1{\mu}m from the linear
fitting result based on the cold test.
