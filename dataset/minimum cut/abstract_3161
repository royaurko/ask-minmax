Scale-invariant fluctuations and cold dark matter could originate from two
different modes of a single scalar field, fluctuations from massless Goldstone
oscillations and matter from massive Higgs modes. Matching the fluctuations and
dark matter density observed requires a heavy scale ($\phi_0\approx
10^{16}$GeV) for the potential minimum and an extremely small self coupling
($\lambda\approx 10^{-83}$). Mode coupling causes the dark matter to form in
lumps with nonnegligible velocities, leading to early collapse of dense dark
matter ``miniclusters'' and halos on the scale of compact dwarf galaxies.
