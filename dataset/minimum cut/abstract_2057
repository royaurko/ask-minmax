The conventional Hamming distance measurement captures only the short-time
dynamics of the displacement between the uncorrelated random configurations.
The minimum difference technique introduced by Tirnakli and Lyra [Int. J. Mod.
Phys. C 14, 805 (2003)] is used to study the short-time and long-time dynamics
of the two distinct random configurations of the isotropic and anisotropic
Bak-Sneppen models on a square lattice. Similar to 1-dimensional case, the time
evolution of the displacement is intermittent. The scaling behavior of the jump
activity rate and waiting time distribution reveal the absence of typical
spatial-temporal scales in the mechanism of displacement jumps used to quantify
the convergence dynamics.
