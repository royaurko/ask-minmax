This document describes the minimum interface that a (SOAP- or REST-based)
web service requires to participate in the IVOA. Note that this is not required
of standard VO services developed prior to this specification, although uptake
is strongly encouraged on any subsequent revision. All new standard VO
services, however, must feature a VOSI-compliant interface.
  This document has been produced by the Grid and Web Services Working Group.
It has been reviewed by IVOA Members and other interested parties, and has been
endorsed by the IVOA Executive Committee as an IVOA Recommendation. It is a
stable document and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative
reference from another document. IVOA's role in making the Recommendation is to
draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment.
This enhances the functionality and interoperability inside the Astronomical
Community.
