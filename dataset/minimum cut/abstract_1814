We consider laboratory experiments that can detect stable, neutral strongly
interacting massive particles (SIMPs). We explore the SIMP annihilation cross
section from its minimum value (restricted by cosmological bounds) to the barn
range, and vary the mass values from a GeV to a TeV.
 We also consider the prospects and problems of detecting such particles at the
Tevatron.
