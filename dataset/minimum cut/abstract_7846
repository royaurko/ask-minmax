We present measurements of the spatial clustering of galaxies with stellar
masses >10^11Msun, infrared luminosities >10^12 Lsun, and star formation rates
>200Msun per year in two redshift intervals; 1.5<z<2.0 and 2<z<3. Both samples
cluster very strongly, with spatial correlation lengths of r_0=14.40+/-1.99
h^-1Mpc for the 2<z<3 sample, and r_0=9.40+/-2.24 h^-1Mpc for the 1.5<z<2.0
sample. These clustering amplitudes are consistent with both populations
residing in dark matter haloes with masses of ~6x10^13Msun, making them among
the most biased galaxies at these epochs. We infer, from this and previous
results, that a minimum dark matter halo mass is an important factor for all
forms of luminous, obscured activity in galaxies at z>1, both starbursts and
AGN. Adopting plausible models for the growth of DM haloes with redshift, then
the haloes hosting the 2<z<3 sample will likely host the richest clusters of
galaxies at z=0, whereas the haloes hosting the 1.5<z<2.0 sample will likely
host poor to rich clusters at z=0. We conclude that ULIRGs at z>1 signpost
stellar buildup in galaxies that will reside in clusters at z=0, with ULIRGs at
increasing redshifts signposting the buildup of stars in galaxies that will
reside in increasingly rich clusters.
