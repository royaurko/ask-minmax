In a recent work, Kryuchkov, Suslov and Vega-Guzman [20013 J. Phys. B: At.
Mol. Opt. Phys. 46 104007] described a multi-parameter family of
minimum-uncertainty states satisfying the time-dependent Schrodinger equation
for the harmonic oscillator. We show how a different parametrization and a
proper geometrical insight reduces a complicated set of equations to two simple
circular motions.
