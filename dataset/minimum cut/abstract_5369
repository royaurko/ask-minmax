In this communication, direction of evolutionary variability of parameters of
genome size and structurally functional activity of plants in angiosperm taxa
among life forms, are analysed. It is shown that, in the Cretaceous-Cenozoic
era, the nuclear genome of the plants tended to increase. Functional genome
efficiency (intensity of functions per picogram of DNA) decreased as much as
possible from highest, at trees and lianas of rain and monsoonal forests of the
Paleogene, to minimum, at shrubs, perennial and annual grasses of meadow-steppe
vegetation appeared in the Neogene. Environmental changes in temperature,
humidity and carbon dioxide concentration in adverse direction, critical for
vegetation, are discussed as the cause of growth of evolutionary genome size
and loss in its functional efficiency. The growth of the genome in the Cenozoic
did not lead to the intensification of functions, but rather led to the
expansion of the adaptive capacity of species. Growth of nuclear
deoxyribonucleic acid content can be considered as one of the effective tools
of an adaptogenesis.
