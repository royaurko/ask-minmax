The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the next-generation atmospheric
Cherenkov gamma-ray observatory. CTA will consist of two installations, one in
the northern, and the other in the southern hemisphere, containing tens of
telescopes of different sizes. The CTA performance requirements and the
inherent complexity associated with the operation, control and monitoring of
such a large distributed multi-telescope array leads to new challenges in the
field of the gamma-ray astronomy. The ACTL (array control and data acquisition)
system will consist of the hardware and software that is necessary to control
and monitor the CTA arrays, as well as to time-stamp, read-out, filter and
store -at aggregated rates of few GB/s- the scientific data. The ACTL system
must be flexible enough to permit the simultaneous automatic operation of
multiple sub-arrays of telescopes with a minimum personnel effort on site. One
of the challenges of the system is to provide a reliable integration of the
control of a large and heterogeneous set of devices. Moreover, the system is
required to be ready to adapt the observation schedule, on timescales of a few
tens of seconds, to account for changing environmental conditions or to
prioritize incoming scientific alerts from time-critical transient phenomena
such as gamma ray bursts. This contribution provides a summary of the main
design choices and plans for building the ACTL system.
