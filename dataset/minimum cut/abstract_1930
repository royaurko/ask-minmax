A recent interpretation of the caloric curve based on the expansion of the
abraded spectator nucleus is re-analysed in the framework of the Time-Dependent
Hartree-Fock (TDHF) evolution. It is shown that the TDHF dynamics is more
complex than a single monopolar collective motion at moderate energy. The
inclusion of other important collective degrees of freedom may lead to the
dynamical creation of hollow structure. Then, low density regions could be
locally reached after a long time by the creation of these exotic density
profiles. In particular the systematic of the minimum density reached during
the expansion (the so-called turning points) appears to be different.
