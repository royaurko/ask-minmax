We address the problem of directional mobility of discrete solitons in
two-dimensional rectangular lattices, in the framework of a discrete nonlinear
Schr\"odinger model with saturable on-site nonlinearity. A numerical
constrained Newton-Raphson method is used to calculate two-dimensional
Peierls-Nabarro energy surfaces, which describe a pseudopotential landscape for
the slow mobility of coherent localized excitations, corresponding to
continuous phase-space trajectories passing close to stationary modes.
Investigating the two-parameter space of the model through independent
variations of the nonlinearity constant and the power, we show how parameter
regimes and directions of good mobility are connected to existence of smooth
surfaces connecting the stationary states. In particular, directions where
solutions can move with minimum radiation can be predicted from flatter parts
of the surfaces. For such mobile solutions, slight perturbations in the
transverse direction yield additional transverse oscillations with frequencies
determined by the curvature of the energy surfaces, and with amplitudes that
for certain velocities may grow rapidly. We also describe how the mobility
properties and surface topologies are affected by inclusion of weak lattice
anisotropy.
