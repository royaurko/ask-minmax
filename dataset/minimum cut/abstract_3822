If the preon structure of quarks, leptons and gauge bosons will be proved
then in the Universe during relativistic phase transition the production of
nonperturbative preon condensates has been occured collective excitations of
which are perceived as pseudogoldstone bosons. Dark matter consisting of
pseudogoldstone bosons of familon type contains a "hot" component from massless
particles and a "cold" (nonrelativistic) component from massive particles. It
is shown that such dark matter was undergone to two relativistic phase
transitions temperatures of which were different. In the result of these phase
transitions the structurization of dark matter and therefore the baryon
subsystem has taken place. Besides, the role of particle generations in the
Universe become more evident. For the possibility of structurization of matter
as minimum three generations of particles are necessary.
