In a distributed storage system based on erasure coding, an important problem
is the \emph{repair problem}: If a node storing a coded piece fails, in order
to maintain the same level of reliability, we need to create a new encoded
piece and store it at a new node. This paper presents a construction of
systematic $(n,k)$-MDS codes for $2k\le n$ that achieves the minimum repair
bandwidth when repairing from $k+1$ nodes.
