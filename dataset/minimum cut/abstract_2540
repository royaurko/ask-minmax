A total of 431 photoelectric B and V observations are presented for the short
period . The measurements have been obtained in two successive nights, 27/28
and 28/29 of September 1995, and represent the whole light curve phases. Four
times of minimum light, for each filter, were deduced and new periods have been
derived as 0.277892 day from the present photometric observations. New light
curves have been constructed, investigated and analyzed by using the recent
version of W-D code.
