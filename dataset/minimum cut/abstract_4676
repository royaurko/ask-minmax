As for a generic parameter dependent hamiltonian with the time reversal (TR)
invariance, a non Abelian Berry connection with the Kramers (KR) degeneracy are
introduced by using a quaternionic Berry connection. This quaternionic
structure naturally extends to the many body system with the KR degeneracy. Its
topological structure is explicitly discussed in comparison with the one
without the KR degeneracy. Natural dimensions to have non trivial topological
structures are discussed by presenting explicit gauge fixing. Minimum models to
have accidental degeneracies are given with/without the KR degeneracy, which
describe the monopoles of Dirac and Yang. We have shown that the Yang monopole
is literally a quaternionic Dirac monopole. The generic Berry phases
with/without the KR degeneracy are introduced by the complex/quaternionic Berry
connections. As for the symmetry protected $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantization of these
general Berry phases, a sufficient condition of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-quantization
is given as the inversion/reflection equivalence. Topological charges of the
SO(3) and SO(5) nonlinear $\sigma $-models are discussed in their relation to
the Chern numbers of the $CP^1 $ and $HP^1$ models as well.
