The Rayleigh diffraction bound sets the minimum separation for two point
objects to be distinguishable in a conventional imaging system. We demonstrate
resolution enhancement beyond the Rayleigh bound using random scanning of a
highly-focused beam and N-photon photodetection implemented with a
single-photon avalanche detector array. Experimental results show resolution
improvement by a factor ~sqrt(N) beyond the Rayleigh bound, in good agreement
with theory.
