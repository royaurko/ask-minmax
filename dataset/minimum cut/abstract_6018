It is an elementary fact that the size of an orthogonal array of strength t
on k factors must be a multiple of a certain number, say L_t, that depends on
the orders of the factors. Thus L_t is a lower bound on the size of arrays of
strength t on those factors, and is no larger than L_k, the size of the
complete factorial design. We investigate the relationship between the numbers
L_t, and two questions in particular: For what t is L_t < L_k? And when L_t =
L_k, is the complete factorial design the only array of that size and strength
t? Arrays are assumed to be mixed-level.
  We refer to an array of size less than L_k as a proper fraction. Guided by
our main result, we construct a variety of mixed-level proper fractions of
strength k-1 that also satisfy a certain group-theoretic condition.
