Goldbach`s Conjecture, "every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as
the sum of two primes" is renamed Goldbach`s Rule for it can not be otherwise.
The conjecture is proven by showing that the existence of prime pairs adding to
any even number greater than 2 is a natural by-product of the existence of the
prime sequence less than that even number. First it is shown that the remainder
of cancellations process which identifies primes less than an even number also
remainders prime pairs adding to that even number as a natural part of the
process. Then a minimum limit for the remaindered number of prime pairs adding
to an even number is expressed in terms of that even number and shown to exist
for every even number greater than 2. Furthermore, the reasonings and
formulations used in the proof are demonstrated to hold against observations.
