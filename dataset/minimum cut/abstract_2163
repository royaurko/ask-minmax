We report a set of measurements of inclusive invariant transverse momentum
differential cross sections of lambda, cascade and omega hyperons reconstructed
in the central region with pseudorapidity within 1 and transverse momentum up
to 10 GeV/c Events are collected with a minimum-bias trigger in ppbar
collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV using the CDF II detector at
the Tevatron Collider. As transverse momentum increases, the slopes of the
differential cross sections are similar not only to each other but also to
those of mesons, which could indicate a universality of the particle production
in transverse momentum The invariant differential cross sections are also
presented for different charged-particle multiplicity intervals.
