Full jet reconstruction in ALICE uses the combined information from charged
and neutral particles. Essentially all jet constituents can be measured with
large efficiency down to very low transverse momenta (pT > 150 MeV/c). This has
the advantage to introduce a minimum bias on the jet fragmentation, in
particular for low jet momenta and in the presence of quenching. In this
article, we present preliminary results from reconstruction of charged jets in
Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV. The inclusive charged jet spectrum,
the jet nuclear modification factors (R_AA, R_CP), the ratio of spectra
measured with different resolution parameters and hadron-jet correlations are
discussed. For pp data at the same center of mass energy, the inclusive
spectrum of fully reconstructed jets and its resolution parameter dependence
are reported.
