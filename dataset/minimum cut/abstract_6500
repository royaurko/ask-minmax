We study the flavor changing neutral current decays of the MSSM Higgs bosons
into strange and bottom quarks. We focus on a scenario of minimum flavor
violation here, namely only that induced by the CKM matrix. Taking into account
constraint from $b\to s \gamma$, $\delta\rho$ as well as experimental
constraints on the MSSM spectrum, we show that the branching ratio of $(\Phi\to
b\bar{s})$ and $(\Phi \to \bar{b}s)$ combined, for $\Phi$ being either one of
the CP even Higgs states, can reach the order $10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}$ for large
$\tan\beta$, large $\mu$, and large $A_t$. The result illustrates the
significance of minimal flavor violation scenario which can induce competitive
branching fraction for flavor changing Higgs decays. This can be compared with
the previous studies where similar branching fraction has been reported, but
with additional sources of flavor violations in squark mass matrices. We also
discuss some basic features of the flavor violating decays in the generic case.
