It is known that the action of Euclidean Einstein gravity is not bounded from
below and that the metric of flat space does not correspond to a minimum of the
action. Nevertheless, perturbation theory about flat space works well. The deep
dynamical reasons for this reside in the non perturbative behaviour of the
system and have been clarified in part by numerical simulations. Several open
issues remain. We treat in particular those zero modes of the action for which
R(x) is not identically zero, but the integral of sqrt{g(x)} R(x) vanishes.
