This paper focuses on joint beamforming design towards maximizing mutual
information (MI) in a coherent multiple access channel (MAC) wireless sensor
network (WSN) with nodes equipped with multiple antennae. We consider the
scenario where the same source signal is observed by all sensors, with each
sensor having independent noisy observation and individual power constraint.
All the sensors transmit their observations to a preassigned node, called
fusion center (FC), to perform further processing and data fusion. To attack
this nonconvex hard problem, we adopt the weighted minimum mean square
error(WMMSE) method to transform the original problem by introducing
intermediate variables and then consult to the block coordinate ascent (BCA)
methodology to develop iterative algorithms for solutions. Specifically, we
design a 3-block BCA algorithm with each of its three subproblems having closed
form solutions or being efficiently solvable by standard numerical solvers. As
will be shown, this proposed 3-BCA algorithm exhibits a satisfactory
convergence property. Besides that, a multiple block BCA algorithm is also
developed, which has closed form solution to each subproblem (possibably up to
a simple bisection search). This multiple block BCA algorithm cherishes low
complexity, does not depend on numerical solver and can even give out fully
analytical update in special circumstance. Extensive numerical results are
presented to test our algorithms.
