Given an arbitrary $1$-Lipschitz function $f$ on the torus $\mathbb{T}^n $,
we find a $k$-dimensional subtorus $M \subseteq \mathbb{T}^n$, parallel to the
axes, such that the restriction of $f$ to the subtorus $M$ is nearly a constant
function. The $k$-dimensional subtorus $M$ is chosen randomly and uniformly. We
show that when $k \leq c \log n / (\log \log n + \log 1/\varepsilon)$, the
maximum and the minimum of $f$ on this random subtorus $M$ differ by at most
$\varepsilon$, with high probability.
