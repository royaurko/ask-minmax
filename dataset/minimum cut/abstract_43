The simple interpretation of the minimum distance of a linear code obtained
by De Boer and Pellikaan, and later refined by the second contributor, is further
developed through the study of various finitely generated graded modules. We
use the methods of commutative/homological algebra to find connections between
the minimum distance and the $\alpha$-invariant of such modules.
