The $k$-way discrepancy $\disc_k (\C)$ of a rectangular array $\C$ of
nonnegative entries is the minimum of the maxima of the within- and
between-cluster discrepancies that can be obtained by simultaneous
$k$-clusterings (proper partitions) of its rows and columns. In the main
theorem, irrespective of the size of $\C$, we give the following estimate for
the $k$th largest non-trivial singular value of the normalized table: $s_k \le
9\disc_{k } (\C ) (k+2 -9k\ln \disc_{k } (\C ))$, provided $\disc_{k } (\C )
<1$ and $k\le \rk (\C )$. This statement is the converse of Theorem 7 of Bolla
\cite{Bolla14}, and the proof uses some lemmas and ideas of Butler
\cite{Butler}, where only the $k=1$ case is treated, in which case our upper
bound is the tighter. The result naturally extends to the singular values of
the normalized adjacency matrix of a weighted undirected or directed graph.
