We present spectroscopy and orbital periods Porb of four relatively
little-studied cataclysmic variable stars. The stars and their periods are: AF
Cam, Porb = 0.324(1) d (the daily cycle count is slightly ambiguous); V2069 Cyg
(= RX J2123.7+4217), 0.311683(2) d; PG 0935+075, 0.1868(3) d; and KUV
03580+0614, 0.1495(6) d. V2069 Cyg and KUV 03580+0614 both show HeII lambda
4686 emission comparable in strength to H beta. V2069 Cyg appears to be a
luminous novalike variable, and the strong HeII suggests it may be an
intermediate polar. The period of KUV 03580+0614 is similar to members of the
SW Sex-type novalike variables, and it shows the phase-dependent absorption in
the Balmer and He I lines typical of this subclass. AF Cam shows absorption
features from a K-type secondary, as expected given its rather long orbital
period. The secondary spectrum and the outburst magnitude both suggest that AF
Cam is about 1 kpc distant. The spectrum of PG 0935+075 resembles that of a
dwarf nova at minimum light, with a noticeable contribution from an M-dwarf
secondary star. The secondary spectrum and a tentative outburst magnitude both
suggest a distance near 500 pc.
