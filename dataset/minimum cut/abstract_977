We present new VLA C-configuration HI imaging of the Lyman Alpha-emitting
starburst galaxies Tol 1924-416 and IRAS 08339+6517. The effective resolution
probes neutral gas structures larger than 4.7 kpc in Tol 1924-416, and larger
than 8.1 kpc in IRAS 08339+6517. Both systems are revealed to be tidally
interacting: Tol 1924-416 with ESO 338-IG04B (6.6 arcminutes = 72 kpc minimum
separation), and IRAS 08339+6517 with 2MASX J08380769+6508579 (2.4 arcminutes =
56 kpc minimum separation). The HI emission is extended in these systems, with
tidal tails and debris between the target galaxies and their companions. Since
Lyman Alpha emission has been detected from both of these primary systems,
these observations suggest that the geometry of the ISM is one of the factors
affecting the escape fraction of Lyman Alpha emission from starburst
environments. Furthermore, these observations argue for the importance of
interactions in triggering massive star formation events.
