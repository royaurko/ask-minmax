In this paper, given a finitely presented group $\Gamma$, we provide the
explicit monodromy of a Lefschetz fibration with $(-1)$-sections whose total
space has fundamental group $\Gamma$ by applying "twisted substitutions" to
that of the Lefschetz fibration constructed by Cadavid and independently
Korkmaz. Consequently, we obtain an upper bound for the minimum $g$ such that
there exists a genus-$g$ Lefschetz pencil on a smooth 4-manifold whose
fundamental group is isomorphic to $\Gamma$.
