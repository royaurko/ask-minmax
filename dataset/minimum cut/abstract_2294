In this paper we investigate the minimum number of maximal subgroups H_i for
i=1 ...k of the symmetric group S_n (or the alternating group A_n) such that
each element in the group S_n (respectively A_n) lies in some conjugate of one
of the H_i. We prove that this number lies between a.phi(n) and bn for certain
constants a, b, where phi(n) is the Euler phi-function, and we show that the
number depends on the arithmetical complexity of n. Moreover in the case where
n is divisible by at most two primes, we obtain an upper bound of 2+phi(n)/2,
and we determine the exact value for S_n when n is odd and for A_n when n is
even.
