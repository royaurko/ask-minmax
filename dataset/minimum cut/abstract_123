It is shown, that a non-local form of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation allows to
describe not only the long-wave excitations, but also the short-wave ones in
the systems with Bose-condensate. At given parameter values, the excitation
spectrum mimics the Landau spectrum of quasi-particle excitations in superfluid
Helium with roton minimum. The excitation wavelength, at which the roton
minimum exists, is close to the inter-particle interaction range. It is shown,
that the existence domain of the spectrum with a roton minimum is reduced, if
one accounts for an inter-particle attraction.
