The new multi-color $BVRI$ photometric light curves of the short-period
eclipsing binary GSC 3576-0170 were obtained on two consecutive nights (October
5 and 6, 2009). With the 2003 version of Wilson-Devinney program, the precise
photometric solutions are derived for the first time. The result shows that GSC
3576-0170 is a semi-detached binary system with a large temperature difference
of approximately 1490 K. The light-curve distortions are further explained by a
hot spot on the secondary component through mass transfer via a stream hitting
the facing surface of the secondary component. By analyzing all available light
minimum times, we also derived an update ephemeris and found for the first time
a possible periodic oscillation with an amplitude of 0.0038 days and a period
of 4.3 years. The periodic oscillation could be explained either by the
light-time effect due to a presumed third component or by magnetic activity
cycle of the system.
