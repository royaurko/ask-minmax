We discuss consequences of an entropic view of gravity, which differs in
details from the original proposals of Jacobson and Verlinde. We assume the
entropy is localized in the degrees of freedom of the systems interacting
gravitationally. We then find there is a density-dependent minimum length for
Newtonian gravity. This makes renormalizability issues irrelevant. It also
follows that at nanometer scales Newton's universal law fails, black holes with
mass $M_{BH} \lesssim 10^{-13} M_{\odot}$ do not exist and all Hawking
radiation is at unobservably low temperature.
