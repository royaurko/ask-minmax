Using various model clocks it has been shown that the time-of-arrival cannot
be measured more accurately than 1/E where E is the kinetic energy of a free
particle. However, this result has never been proved. In this paper, we show
that a violation of the above limitation for the transit-time, implies a
violation of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation.
