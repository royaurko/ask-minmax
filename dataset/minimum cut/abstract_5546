Jets are collimated sprays of particles resulting from fragmentation of hard
scattered partons. They are measured in different types of collisions at
different energies to test perturbative Quantum Chromodynamic calculations and
are used to study the hard scattering, fragmentation and hadronisation of
partons. These phenomena, measured in simple systems such as proton--proton
collisions, serve as a baseline to investigate their modifications by hot and
dense nuclear matter created in high energy heavy-ion collisions.
  We have analysed data from minimum bias proton--proton collisions at centre
of mass energy of 2.76 and 7 TeV collected using the ALICE detector system at
the LHC and reconstructed the inclusive jet cross section from charged tracks
at midrapidity. We present jet spectra reconstructed using the infrared and
colinear safe anti-kT algorithm with underlying event subtraction, corrected
for detector effects via unfolding for both collision energies. Furthermore,
results from analyses of fragmentation distributions and jet shape observables
are shown. All results are compared with measurements of other LHC experiments
and with Monte Carlo generators.
