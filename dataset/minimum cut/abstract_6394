Temperature-dependent magnetization (M(T)) and specific heat (C_p(T))
measurements were carried out on single crystal Sm_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-delta}
(T_c = 16.5 K). The magnetic anisotropy in the static susceptibility, chi
{equiv} M/H, is apparent not only in its magnitude but also in its temperature
dependence, with chi_{perp} for H{perp}c larger than chi_{parallel} for
H{parallel}c. For both field orientations, chi does not follow the Curie-Weiss
behavior due to the small energy gap of the J = 7/2 multiplet above the J = 5/2
ground-state multiplet. However, with increasing temperature, chi_{parallel}(T)
exhibits a broad minimum near 100 K and then a slow increase while
chi_{perp}(T) shows a monotonic decrease. A sharp peak in C_p(T) at 4.7 K
manifests an antiferromagnetic ordering. The electronic contribution, gamma, to
C_p(T) is estimated to be gamma = 103.2 (7) mJ/moleSmK^2. The entropy
associated with the magnetic ordering is much smaller than Rln2, where R is the
gas constant, which is usually expected for the doublet ground state of
Sm^{+3}. The unusual magnetic and electronic properties evident in M(T) and
C_p(T) are probably due to a strong anisotropic interaction between conduction
electrons and localized electrons at Sm^{+3} sites.
