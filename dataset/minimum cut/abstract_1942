Using in the Bohr Hamiltonian the approximations leading to the Bohr and
Mottelson description of wobbling motion in even nuclei, a W(5) model for
wobbling bands, coexisting with a X(5) ground state band, is obtained.
Separation of variables is achieved by assuming that the relevant potential has
a sharp minimum at gamma_0, which is the only parameter entering in the spectra
and B(E2) transition rates (up to overall scale factors). B(E2) transition
rates exhibit the features expected in the wobbling case, while the spectrum
for gamma_0=20 degrees is in good agreement with experimental data for Dy-156.
