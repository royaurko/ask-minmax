We clarify some aspects of the calculation of the thermal transport
coefficients. For a tight-binding Hamiltonian we discuss the approximate nature
of the charge current and the thermal current obtained by Peierls substitution
which is also identical to the equation of motion technique. We address the
issue of choosing an appropriate basis for making the Peierls construction for
transport calculations. We propose a criteria for finding an optimum Wannier
basis where the difference between the exact current and the approximate one is
minimum. Using the equations of motion we derive the thermal current for a
generalized Hubbard model with density interaction. We identify a part which is
the contribution from the long range interactions to the heat current. For the
Hubbard model we derive expressions for the transport coefficients in the limit
of infinite dimensions.
