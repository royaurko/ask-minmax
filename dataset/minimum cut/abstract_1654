The Cluster Variation Method (CVM) is applied to the Ishibashi model for
ammonium dihydrogen phosphate ($\rm NH_{4}H_{2}PO_{4}$) of a typical hydrogen
bonded anti-ferroelectric crystal. The staggered and the uniform susceptibility
without hysteresis are calculated at equilibrium. On the other hand, by making
use of the natural iteration method (NIM) for the CVM, hysteresis phenomena of
uniform susceptibility versus temperature observed in experiments is well
explained on the basis of local minimum in Landau type variational free energy.
The polarization $P$ curves against the uniform field is also calculated.
