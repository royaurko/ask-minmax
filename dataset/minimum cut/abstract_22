The corona at solar minimum generally differs greatly from that during active
times. We discuss the current Cycle 23/24 minimum from the point of view of the
occurrence of flares and CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections). By comparison with the
previous minimum, the flare/CME ratio diminished by almost an order of
magnitude. This suggests that the environmental effect in flare/CME association
differed in the sense that the Cycle 23/24 minimum corona was relatively easy
to disrupt.
