The Self-Consistent Field theory of brushes of neutral water-soluble polymers
described by two-state models is formulated in terms of the effective Flory
interaction parameter $\chi_{eff}(T,\phi)$ that depends on both temperature, T
and the monomer volume fraction, $\phi$. The concentration profiles,
distribution of free ends and compression force profiles are obtained in the
presence and in the absence of a vertical phase separation. A vertical phase
separation within the layer leads to a distinctive compression force profile
and a minimum in the plot of the moments of the concentration profile vs. the
grafting density. The analysis is applied explicitly to the Karalstrom model.
The relevance to brushes of Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)(PNIPAM) is discussed.
