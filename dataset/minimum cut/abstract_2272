In this paper, we propose an algorithm to construct coherent states for an
exactly solvable position dependent mass Schr\"odinger equation. We use point
canonical transformation method and obtain ground state eigenfunction of the
position dependent mass Schr\"odinger equation. We fix the ladder operators in
the deformed form and obtain explicit expression of the deformed superpotential
in terms of mass distribution and its derivative. We also prove that these
deformed operators lead to minimum uncertainty relations. Further, we
illustrate our algorithm with two examples in which the coherent states given
for the second example is new.
