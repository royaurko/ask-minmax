We have used the radial velocity variations of two sdB stars previously
reported to be binaries to establish their orbital periods. They are
PG0940+068, (P=8.33d) and PG1247+554 (P=0.599d). The minimum masses of the
unseen companions, assuming a mass of 0.5 solar masses for the sdB stars, are
0.090 +/- 0.003 solar masses for PG1247+554 and 0.63 +/- 0.02 solar masses for
PG0940+068. The nature of the companions is not constrained further by our
data.
