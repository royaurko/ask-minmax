One of the main characteristics of the new family of two-dimensional crystals
of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) is the strong
spin-orbit interaction, which makes them very promising for future applications
in spintronics and valleytronics devices. Here we present a detailed study of
the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the band structure of single-layer
and bulk TMDs, including explicitly the role of the chalcogen orbitals and
their hybridization with the transition metal atoms. To this aim, we combine
density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a Slater-Koster tight-binding
model. Whereas most of the previous tight-binding models have been restricted
to the K and K' points of the Brillouin zone (BZ), here we consider the effect
of SOC in the whole BZ, and the results are compared to the band structure
obtained by DFT methods. The tight-binding model is used to analyze the effect
of SOC in the band structure, considering separately the contributions from the
transition metal and the chalcogen atoms. Finally, we present a scenario where,
in the case of strong SOC, the spin/orbital/valley entanglement at the minimum
of the conduction band at Q can be probed and be of experimental interest in
the most common cases of electron-doping reported for this family of compounds.
