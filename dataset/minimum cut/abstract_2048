In numerical studies of diffusive dynamics, two different action functionals
are often used to specify the probability distribution of trajectories, one of
which requiring the evaluation of the second derivative of the potential in
addition to the force. Here it is argued that both actions are equivalent
prescriptions for the purposes of reweighting and sampling trajectories,
whereas the most probable path is more generally given by the global minimum of
the action involving the second derivative term. The answer to this apparent
paradox lies in the non-differentiable character of Brownian paths, as well as
in the "entropy" associated with a given trajectory.
