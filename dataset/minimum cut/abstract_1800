We exhibit a complementary relationship between resonant $WZ$ and nonresonant
$W^+W^+$ scattering in a chiral Lagrangian model of the electroweak symmetry
breaking sector with a dominant ``$\rho$'' meson. We use the model to estimate
the minimum luminosity for the LHC to ensure a ``no-lose'' capability to
observe the symmetry breaking sector.
