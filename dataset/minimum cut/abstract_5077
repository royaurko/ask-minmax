The thickness, NIR(K) of a knot or link K is defined to be the radius of the
largest solid tube one can put around the curve without any self intersections,
which is also known as the normal injectivity radius of K. For C^{1,1} curves
K, NIR(K)=min{(1/2)DCSC(K),(1/(supkappa(K))))}, where kappa(K) is the
generalized curvature, and the double critical self distance DCSD(K) is the
shortest length of the segments perpendicular to K at both end points. The
knots and links in ideal shapes (or tight knots or links) belong to the minima
of ropelength = length/thickness within a fixed isotopy class. In this article,
we prove that NIR(K)=(1/2)DCSC(K), for every relative minimum K of ropelength
in R^n for certain dimensions n, including n=3.
