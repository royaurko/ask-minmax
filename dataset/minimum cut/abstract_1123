A toy model is proposed in which the cosmological constant and the baryon
number density of the universe are interrelated. The model combines the
mechanism of Dimopoulos and Susskind in which the baryon number density of the
universe is generated by the time-dependence of the phase of a complex scalar
field, i.e. its `angular momentum' in the two-dimensinal complex field space,
with that of Yoshimura in which the `centrifugal force' due the `angular
momentum' pushes the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field out of a
negative potential minimum and provides a small but positive cosmological
constant. Unfortunately, our model fails to relate the smallness of the two
numbers directly, requiring a fine-tuning of the negative potential minimum.
