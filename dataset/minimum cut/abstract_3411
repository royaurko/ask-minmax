We perform cosmological simulations of galaxies forming at z=3 using the
hydrodynamics grid code, Enzo. By selecting the largest galaxies in the volume
to correspond to Lyman-break galaxies, we construct observational spectra of
the HI flux distribution around these objects, as well as column densities of
CIV and OVI throughout a refined region. We successfully reproduce the most
recent observations of the mean HI flux in the close vicinity of Lyman-break
galaxies but see no evidence for the proximity effect in earlier observations.
While our galaxies do return metals to the IGM, their quantity and volume
appears to be somewhat less than observed. We conclude that either we do not
adequately resolve galactic winds, or that at least some of the intergalactic
metal enrichment is by early epoch objects whose mass is smaller than our
minimum resolved halo mass.
