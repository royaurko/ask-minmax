We consider the design of regenerating codes for distributed storage systems
that enjoy the property of local, exact and uncoded repair, i.e., (a) upon
failure, a node can be regenerated by simply downloading packets from the
surviving nodes and (b) the number of surviving nodes contacted is strictly
smaller than the number of nodes that need to be contacted for reconstructing
the stored file.
  Our codes consist of an outer MDS code and an inner fractional repetition
code that specifies the placement of the encoded symbols on the storage nodes.
For our class of codes, we identify the tradeoff between the local repair
property and the minimum distance. We present codes based on graphs of high
girth, affine resolvable designs and projective planes that meet the minimum
distance bound for specific choices of file sizes.
