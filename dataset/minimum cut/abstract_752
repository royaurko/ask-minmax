We study the response of the low-degree solar p-mode frequencies to the
unusual extension of the minimum of solar surface activity since 2007.
Helioseismic observations collected by the space-based, Sun-as-a-star GOLF
instrument and by the ground-based, multi-site network GONG (integrated signal)
are analyzed. Temporal variations of the low-degree (l=0,1,2), p-mode
frequencies are obtained. Although the known correlation of the frequency
changes with the solar surface activity is recovered for the period 1996-2007,
since the second half of 2007 and until July 2009 (latest period analyzed) we
notice a peculiar behavior amongst modes of different angular degrees. In
particular, a clear increase of the l=0 and l=2 p-mode frequencies is
consistently obtained since late 2007, while the l=1 frequencies follow the
general decreasing trend of surface activity. We interpret these differences in
the frequency shifts of individual low-degree modes as indicative of variations
at high latitudes in the magnetic flux beneath the surface of the Sun related
to the onset of solar cycle 24.
