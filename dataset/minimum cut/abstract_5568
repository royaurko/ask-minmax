In view of the LHC upgrade for the High Luminosity Phase (HL-LHC), the ATLAS
experiment is planning to replace the Inner Detector with an all-Silicon
system. The n-on-p technology represents a valid solution for the modules of
most of the layers, given the significant radiation hardness of this option and
the reduced cost. There is also the demand to reduce the inactive areas to a
minimum. The ATLAS LPNHE Paris group and FBK Trento started a collaboration for
the development on a novel n-on-p edgeless planar pixel design, based on the
deep-trench process which can cope with all these demands. This paper reports
selected results from the electrical characterization, both before and after
irradiation, of test structures from the first production batch.
