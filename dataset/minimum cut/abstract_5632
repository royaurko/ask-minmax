As minimum feature size and pitch spacing further decrease, triple patterning
lithography (TPL) is a possible 193nm extension along the paradigm of double
patterning lithography (DPL). However, there is very little study on TPL layout
decomposition. In this paper, we show that TPL layout decomposition is a more
difficult problem than that for DPL. We then propose a general integer linear
programming formulation for TPL layout decomposition which can simultaneously
minimize conflict and stitch numbers. Since ILP has very poor scalability, we
propose three acceleration techniques without sacrificing solution quality:
independent component computation, layout graph simplification, and bridge
computation. For very dense layouts, even with these speedup techniques, ILP
formulation may still be too slow. Therefore, we propose a novel vector
programming formulation for TPL decomposition, and solve it through effective
semidefinite programming (SDP) approximation. Experimental results show that
the ILP with acceleration techniques can reduce 82% runtime compared to the
baseline ILP. Using SDP based algorithm, the runtime can be further reduced by
42% with some tradeoff in the stitch number (reduced by 7%) and the conflict
(9% more). However, for very dense layouts, SDP based algorithm can achieve
140x speed-up even compared with accelerated ILP.
