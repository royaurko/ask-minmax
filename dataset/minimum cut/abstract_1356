We present experimental measurements and theoretical calculations of
photoionization time delays from the $3s$ and $3p$ shells in Ar in the photon
energy range of 32-42 eV. The experimental measurements are performed by
interferometry using attosecond pulse trains and the infrared laser used for
their generation. The theoretical approach includes intershell correlation
effects between the 3s and 3p shells within the framework of the random phase
approximation with exchange (RPAE). The connection between single-photon
ionization and the two-color two-photon ionization process used in the
measurement is established using the recently developed asymptotic
approximation for the complex transition amplitudes of laser-assisted
photoionization. We compare and discuss the theoretical and experimental
results especially in the region where strong intershell correlations in the 3s
to kp channel lead to an induced "Cooper" minimum in the 3s ionization
cross-section.
