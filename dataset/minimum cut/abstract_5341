We describe a dispersive nanoSQUID magnetometer comprised of two variable
thickness aluminum weak-link Josephson junctions shunted in parallel with an
on-chip capacitor. This arrangement forms a nonlinear oscillator with a tunable
4-8 GHz resonant frequency with a quality factor Q = 30 when coupled directly
to a 50 $\Omega$ transmission line. In the presence of a near-resonant
microwave carrier signal, a low frequency flux input generates sidebands that
are readily detected using microwave reflectometry. If the carrier excitation
is sufficiently strong then the magnetometer also exhibits parametric gain,
resulting in a minimum effective flux noise of 30 n$\Phi_0$/Hz$^{1/2}$ with 20
MHz of instantaneous bandwidth. If the magnetometer is followed with a near
quantum-noise-limited Josephson parametric amplifier, we can increase the
bandwidth to 60 MHz without compromising sensitivity. This combination of high
sensitivity and wide bandwidth with no on-chip dissipation makes this device
ideal for local sensing of spin dynamics, both classical and quantum.
