We address a special case of the Stabilization Problem for Heegaard
splittings, establishing an upper bound on the number of stabilizations
required to make a Heegaard splitting of a Haken 3-manifold isotopic to an
amalgamation along an essential surface. As a consequence we show that for any
positive integer $n$ there are 3-manifolds containing an essential torus and a
Heegaard splitting such that the torus and splitting surface must intersect in
at least $n$ simple closed curves. These give the first examples of lower
bounds on the minimum number of curves of intersection between an essential
surface and a Heegaard surface that are greater than one.
