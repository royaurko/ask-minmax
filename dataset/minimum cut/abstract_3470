We present some analytical results for the stochastic sandpile model, studied
earlier by Manna. In this model, the operators corresponding to particle
addition at different sites commute. The eigenvalues of operators satisfy a
system of coupled polynomial equations. For an L X L square, we construct a
nontrivial toppling invariant, and hence a ladder operator which acting on
eigenvectors of evolution operator gives new eigenvectors with different
eigenvalues. For periodic boundary conditions in one direction, one more
toppling invariant can be constructed. We show that there are many forbidden
subconfigurations, and only an exponentially small fraction of all stable
configurations are recurrent. We obtain rigorous lower and upper bounds for the
minimum number of particles in a recurrent configuration, and conjecture a
formula for its exact value for finite-size rectangles.
