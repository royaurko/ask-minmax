We argue that in asymptotically free non-Abelian gauge theories possessing
the phenomenon of dynamical mass generation the $\beta$ function is negative up
to a value of the coupling constant that corresponds to a non-trivial fixed
point, in agreement with recent AdS/QCD analysis. This fixed point happens at
the minimum of the vacuum energy ($\Omega$), which, as a characteristic of
theories with dynamical mass generation, has the properties of a c-function.
