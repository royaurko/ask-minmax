Let $M$ be a complete Sasakian sub-Riemannian $3$-manifold of constant
Webster scalar curvature $\kappa$. For any point $p\in M$ and any number
$\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ with $\lambda^2+\kappa>0$, we show existence of a $C^2$
spherical surface $\mathcal{S}_\lambda(p)$ immersed in $M$ with constant mean
curvature $\lambda$. Our construction recovers in particular the description of
Pansu spheres in the first Heisenberg group and the sub-Riemannian $3$-sphere.
Then, we study variational properties of $\mathcal{S}_\lambda(p)$ related to
the area functional. First, we obtain uniqueness results for the spheres
$\mathcal{S}_\lambda(p)$ as critical points of the area under a volume
constraint, thus providing sub-Riemannian counterparts to the theorems of Hopf
and Alexandrov for CMC surfaces in Riemannian $3$-space forms. Second, we
derive a second variation formula for admissible deformations possibly moving
the singular set, and prove that $\mathcal{S}_\lambda(p)$ is a second order
minimum of the area for those preserving volume. We finally give some
applications of our results to the isoperimetric problem in sub-Riemannian
$3$-space forms.
