In this paper we approximate the radiative transfer equations by the method
of moments, constructing mesoscopic approximations of arbitrary order of the
otherwise microscopic system. To define the necessary closure a minimum entropy
approach is utilized. While in radiative transfer, the minimum entropy closure
for moment systems up to the first-order moment is well known, higher-order
minimum entropy closures have not been implemented. This is probably due to the
fact that the closure cannot be expressed in analytical form. Our focus thus
lies in developing some general results about the minimum entropy system and in
deriving a numerical closure. By extending to higher order, among increasing
the precision, we are able to overcome difficulties that arise for the first
order minimum entropy method. Numerical experiments in a 1-dimensional domain
irradiated by two beams or with internal source show the accuracy of this
approach.
