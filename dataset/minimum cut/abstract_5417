The electric transport properties of superconducting FeSe0.3Te0.7/Au c-axis
(S/N) junctions, fabricated by using Pulsed Laser Deposition technique, have
been investigated in the temperature range of 2 K to the superconducting
transition temperature TC ~ 13.5 K, and in the presence of applied magnetic
fields from 0 to 9 T. A large zero bias conductance peak has always been
observed in the conductance spectra of several batches of junctions. In
addition, we have also found several gap-like features. Using the extended BTK
theory with the currently favored nodeless S+- wave symmetry, our conductance
spectrum can be reproduced quite well in the low bias range with {\Delta}1 = 4
meV, and {\Delta}2 = 6 meV at 2 K. However the experimental conductance
spectrum is substantially below the calculated one in the high bias range.
Furthermore, there is a conductance minimum at about 20 meV, which may be the
reason for the discrepancy.
