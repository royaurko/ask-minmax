The dynamics of prominence fine structures is a challenge to understand the
formation of cool plasma prominence embedded in the hot corona. Recent
observations from the high resolution Hinode/SOT telescope allow us to compute
velocities perpendicularly to the line-of-sight or transverse velocities.
Combining simultaneous observations obtained in H-alpha with Hinode/SOT and the
MSDP spectrograph operating in the Meudon solar tower we derive the velocity
vectors of a quiescent prominence. The velocities perpendicular to the
line-of-sight are measured by time slice technique, the Dopplershifts by the
bisector method. The Dopplershifts of bright threads derived from the MSDP
reach 15 km/s at the edges of the prominence and are between +/- 5 km/s in the
center of the prominence. Even though they are minimum values due to seeing
effect, they are of the same order as the transverse velocities. These
measurements are very important because they suggest that the
verticalstructures shown in SOT may not be real vertical magnetic structures in
the sky plane. The vertical structures could be a pile up of dips in more or
less horizontal magnetic field lines in a 3D perspective, as it was proposed by
many MHD modelers. In our analysis we also calibrate the Hinode H-alpha data
using MSDP observations obtained simultaneously.
