Let $\mathcal{D}_k$ be the class of graphs for which every minor has minimum
degree at most $k$.
  Then $\mathcal{D}_k$ is closed under taking minors.
  By the Robertson-Seymour graph minor theorem, $\mathcal{D}_k$ is
characterised by a finite family of minor-minimal forbidden graphs, which we
denote by $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_k$.
  This paper discusses $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_k$ and related topics. We obtain
four main results:
  We prove that every $(k+1)$-regular graph with less than ${4/3}(k+2)$
vertices is in $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_k$, and this bound is best possible.
  We characterise the graphs in $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_{k+1}$ that can be
obtained from a graph in $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_k$ by adding one new vertex.
  For $k\leq 3$ every graph in $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_k$ is $(k+1)$-connected,
but for large $k$, we exhibit graphs in $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_k$ with
connectivity 1. In fact, we construct graphs in $\mathcal{D}_k$ with arbitrary
block structure.
  We characterise the complete multipartite graphs in
$\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_k$, and prove analogous characterisations with minimum
degree replaced by connectivity, treewidth, or pathwidth.
