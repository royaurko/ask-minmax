The possibility of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in momentum space in a
generic Lifshitz scalar model - a non-relativistic scalar field theory with
higher spatial derivative terms - has been studied. We show that the minimum
energy state, the ground state, has a lattice structure, where the translation
invariance of the continuum theory is reduced to a discrete translation
symmetry. The scale of translation symmetry breaking (or induced lattice
spacing) is proportional to the inverse of the momentum of the condensate
particle.
  The crystalline ground state is stable under excitations below a certain
critical velocity. The small fluctuations above the ground state can have a
phonon like dispersion under suitable choice of parameters.
  At the beginning we have discussed the effects of next to nearest neighbour
interaction terms in a model of linear triatomic molecule depicted by a linear
system of three particles of same mass connected by identical springs. This
model is relevant since in the continuum limit the next to nearest neighbour
interaction terms generate higher (spatial) derivative wave equation, the main
topic of this paper.
