Here we present bulk property measurements and electronic structure
calculations for PuFeAsO, an actinide analogue of the iron-based rare-earth
superconductors RFeAsO. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity data suggest
the occurrence of an antiferromagnetic transition at TN=50 K. No further
anomalies have been observed down to 2 K, the minimum temperature that we have
been able to achieve. Structural measurements indicate that PuFeAsO, with its
more localized 5f electrons, bears a stronger resemblance to the RFeAsO
compounds with larger R ions, than NpFeAsO does.
