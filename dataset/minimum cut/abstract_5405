We demonstrate the existence of two species of stable bright solitons,
fundamental and dipole ones, in one-dimensional self-defocusing nonlocal media,
with the local value of nonlinearity coefficient having one or several minima
and growing at any rate faster than |x| at large values of coordinate x. The
model can be derived for a slab optical waveguide with thermal nonlinearity.
The most essential difference from the local counterpart of this system is the
competition between two different spatial scales, the one determining the
modulation pattern of the nonlinearity coefficient, and the correlation length
of the nonlocality. The competition is explicitly exhibited by analytically
obtained asymptotic form of generic solutions. Particular exact solutions are
found analytically, and full soliton families are constructed in a numerical
form. The multi-channel settings, with two or three local minima of the
nonlinearity coefficient, are considered here for the first time, for both
local and nonlocal models of the present type. States with multiple solitons
launched into different channels are stable if the spacing between them exceeds
a certain minimum value. A regime of stable Josephson oscillations of solitons
between parallel channels is reported too.
