This Letter presents a search for magnetic monopoles with the ATLAS detector
at the CERN Large Hadron Collider using an integrated luminosity of 2.0 fb^-1
of pp collisions recorded at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s)=7 TeV. No event
is found in the signal region, leading to an upper limit on the production
cross section at 95% confidence level of 1.6/epsilon fb for Dirac magnetic
monopoles with the minimum unit magnetic charge and with mass between 200 GeV
and 1500 GeV, where epsilon is the monopole reconstruction efficiency. The
efficiency epsilon is high and uniform in the fiducial region given by
pseudorapidity |eta|<1.37 and transverse kinetic energy 600-700<E^kin
sin(theta)<1400 GeV. The minimum value of 700 GeV is for monopoles of mass 200
GeV, whereas the minimum value of 600 GeV is applicable for higher mass
monopoles. Therefore, the upper limit on the production cross section at 95%
confidence level is 2 fb in this fiducial region. Assuming the kinematic
distributions from Drell-Yan pair production of spin-1/2 Dirac magnetic
monopoles, the efficiency is in the range 1%-10%, leading to an upper limit on
the cross section at 95% confidence level that varies from 145 fb to 16 fb for
monopoles with mass between 200 GeV and 1200 GeV. This limit is weaker than the
fiducial limit because most of these monopoles lie outside the fiducial region.
