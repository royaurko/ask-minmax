The form of the Coulomb potential of a point in a noncommutative geometry is
investigated. A distinction is made between measured distance and "coordinate"
distance. The "effective" value of an operator is defined as its expectation
value in a probe state of minimum coordinate dispersion. We find the effective
value of the Coulomb potential to be finite at the origin, the effective charge
density to be Gaussian, and the effective total electrostatic energy to be
finite. The operator corresponding to the total electrostatic energy is found
however to still be infinite.
