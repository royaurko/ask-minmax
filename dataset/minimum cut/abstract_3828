Scaling violation of inclusive jet production at small-$x$ in hadron
scattering with increasing total collision energy is discussed. Perturbative
QCD based on the factorisation theorem for hard processes and GLAPD evolution
equations predicts a minimum for scaled cross-section ratio that depends on jet
rapidity. Studies of such a scaling violation can reveal a vivid indication of
new dynamical effects in the high-energy limit of QCD. The BFKL effects, which
seem to be seen in recent L3 data at CERN LEP2, should give different results
from GLAPD predictions.
