On the basis of the full analytical solution of the overall unitary dynamics,
the time evolution of entanglement is studied in a simple bipartite model
system evolving unitarily from a pure initial state. The system consists of two
particles in one spacial dimension bound by harmonic forces and having its free
center of mass initially localized in space in a minimum uncertainty wave
packet. The existence of such initial states in which the bound particles are
not entangled is pointed out. The entanglement of the two particles is shown to
be independent of the wavepacket mean momentum, and to increase monotonically
in a time scale distinct from that of the spreading of the center of mass
wavepacket.
