We study sparse spikes deconvolution over the space of Radon measures when
the input measure is a finite sum of positive Dirac masses using the BLASSO
convex program. We focus on the recovery properties of the support and the
amplitudes of the initial measure in the presence of noise as a function of the
minimum separation $t$ of the input measure (the minimum distance between two
spikes). We show that when $w/\lambda$, $w/t^{2N-1}$ and $\lambda/t^{2N-1}$ are
small enough (where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, $w$ the noise
and $N$ the number of spikes), which corresponds roughly to a sufficient
signal-to-noise ratio and a noise level small enough with respect to the
minimum separation, there exists a unique solution to the BLASSO program with
exactly the same number of spikes as the original measure. We show that the
amplitudes and positions of the spikes of the solution both converge toward
those of the input measure when the noise and the regularization parameter
drops to zero faster than $t^{2N-1}$.
