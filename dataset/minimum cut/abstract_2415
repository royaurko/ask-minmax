A famous conjecture of Sidorenko and Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits states that if H is
a bipartite graph then the random graph with edge density p has in expectation
asymptotically the minimum number of copies of H over all graphs of the same
order and edge density. The goal of this expository note is to give a short
self-contained proof (suitable for teaching in class) of the conjecture if H
has a vertex complete to all vertices in the other part.
