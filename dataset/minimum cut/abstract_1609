We suggest an algorithm for determining the proper delay time and the minimum
embedding dimension for Takens' delay-time embedding procedure. This method
resorts to the rate of change of the spatial distribution of points on a
reconstructed attractor with respect to the delay time, and can be successfully
applied to a noisy time series which is too noisy to be discriminated from a
sutructureless noisy time series by means of the correlation integral, and also
indicates that the proper delay time depends on the embedding dimension.
