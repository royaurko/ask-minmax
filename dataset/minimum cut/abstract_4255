Distributions in jet production often depend on a soft function, S, which
describes hadronic radiation between the jets. Near kinematic thresholds S
encodes nonperturbative information, while far from thresholds S can be
computed with an operator product expansion (OPE). We design soft functions for
jets that serve this dual purpose, reducing to the perturbative result in the
OPE region and to a consistent model in the nonperturbative region. We use the
MSbar scheme, and in both regions S displays the appropriate renormalization
group scale dependence. We point out that viable soft function models should
have a gap associated with the minimum hadronic energy deposit. This gap is
connected to the leading O(Lambda_QCD) renormalon ambiguity in jet event
shapes. By defining the gap in a suitable scheme we demonstrate that the
leading renormalon can be eliminated. This improves the convergence of
perturbative results, and also the stability by which non-perturbative
parameters encode the underlying soft physics.
