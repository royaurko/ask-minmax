We study the most general effects of relic vector fields on the inflationary
background and density perturbations. Such effects are observable if the number
of inflationary e-folds is close to the minimum requirement to solve the
horizon problem. We show that this can potentially explain two CMB large scale
anomalies: the quadrupole-octopole alignment and the quadrupole power
suppression. We discuss its effect on the parity anomaly. We also provide
analytical template for more detailed data comparison.
