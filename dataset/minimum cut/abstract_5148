We study analytical properties of the holographic superconductors with Weyl
corrections. We describe the phenomena in the probe limit neglecting
backreaction of the space-time. We observe that for the conformal dimension
$\triangle_{+}=3$, the minimum value of the critical temperature $T^{Min}_c$ at
which condensation sets, can be obtained directly from the equations of motion
as $T^{Min}_c\approx 0.170845\sqrt[3]{\rho}$, which is in very good agreement
with the numerical value $T^{Min}_c=0.170\sqrt[3]{\rho}$
[Phys.Lett.B697:153-158,2011]. This value of $T^{Min}_c$ corresponds to the
value of the Weyl's coupling $\gamma=-0.06$ in table (1) of
[Phys.Lett.B697:153-158,2011]. We calculate the $T^{Min}_c\approx
0.21408\sqrt[3]{\rho}$ for another Weyl's coupling $\gamma=0.02$ and the the
conformal dimension $\triangle_{-}=1$. Further, we show that the critical
exponent is $\beta=1/2$. We observe that there is a linear relation between the
charge density $\rho$ and the chemical potential difference $\mu-\mu_c$
qualitatively matches the numerical curves.
