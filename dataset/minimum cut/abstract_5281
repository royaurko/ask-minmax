From a generalization to $Z^n$ of the concept of congruence we define a
family of regular digraphs or graphs called multidimensional circulants, which
turn out to be Cayley (di)graphs of Abelian groups. This paper is mainly
devoted to show the relationship between the Smith normal form for integral
matrices and the dimensions of such (di)graphs, that is the minimum ranks of
the groups they can arise from. In particular, those 2-step multidimensional
circulants which are circulants, that is Cayley (di)graphs of cyclic groups,
are fully characterized. In addition, a reasoning due to Lawrence is used to
prove that the cartesian product of $n$ circulants with equal number of
vertices $p>2$, $p$ a prime, has dimension $n$.
