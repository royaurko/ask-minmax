In recent years there has been an increasing use of embedded systems because
of advances in technology, the reduction of the costs of electronic equipment
and mainly the popularity of mobile devices. Many of these systems implement
low power consumption policies to extend their autonomy, usually because they
have a reduced amount of resources and the great majority of them use electric
power from batteries. One way to minimize the power consumption of these
devices is through of the application of low power consumption techniques. From
the various techniques presented in the literature - the intra-task Dynamic
Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) has played an important role. The main aim
of DVFS is to allow each task to manage the minimum resources necessary for
tasks execution, this way reducing the processor power consumption and, at the
same time, respecting the task deadlines when considered a real-time system
context. Therefore, this paper aims to apply a systematic literature review
with the goal of identifying and presenting the main methods using the
intra-task DVFS technique, applied in the context of real-time systems to
reduce energy consumption on the processor. Finally, this work will show the
advantages and disadvantages of each cataloged methodology.
