We calculate the tunneling density of states (TDOS) in a three wire junction
of interacting spin-1/2 electrons, and find an anomalous enhancement of the
TDOS in the zero bias limit, even for repulsive interactions for several
bosonic fixed points. This enhancement is physically related to the reflection
of holes from the junction for incident electrons, and it occurs only in the
vicinity of the junction ($x < v_{\rm min}/2\omega$ where $v_{\rm min}$ is the
minimum of the velocity of charge or spin excitations and $\omega$ is the bias
frequency), crossing over to the bulk value which is always suppressed, at
larger distances. The TDOS exponent can be directly probed in a STM experiment
by measuring the differential tunneling conductance as a function of either the
bias voltage or temperature as done in C. Blumenstein et al. Nature Physics 7,
776 (2011).
