The charm production is sensitive to early dynamics of the created system in
RHIC heavy ion collisions. Dominant process of charm quarks production at RHIC
is believed to be initial gluon fusion which can be calculated in the
perturbative QCD. Understanding both the charm production total cross section
and the fragmentation in p+p collisions is a baseline to further exploring the
QCD medium via open charm and charmonium in heavy ion collisions. In this paper
we present the first reconstruction of open charm meson $D^{0}$ via the weak
decay to K and $\pi$ mesons in the p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. The
analysis is based on the large p+p minimum bias sample collected in RHIC year
2009 by the STAR detector. The $D^0$ decay daughter identification was improved
by using the data of the newly installed Time-Of-Flight detector with 72% of
its designed coverage.
