We report on transport properties of grain boundaries fabricated in
YBa2Cu3O7-x thin films grown by the liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) technique on MgO
asymmetrical bicrystal substrate with 45o misorientation angle. In total around
10 samples have been studied. Substantial scatter of zero field values of the
critical current density at 5K has been observed. The upper limit of Jc of the
order of 104 A/cm2 found in our study is close to previously reported data for
45o bicrystals grown by various physical vapour deposition methods while the
minimal value of Jc for the LPE grown bicrystals in striking difference to the
results published before is exactly equal to zero. For samples with non-zero Jc
we have found a few different types of critical current dependence on magnetic
field ranging from pattern reminiscent Fraunhover-like Ic(H) to Ic(H) profile
with Ic minimum at zero field.
