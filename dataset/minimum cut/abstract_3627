We have performed multicanonical simulations of hydrophobic-hydrophilic
heteropolymers with two simple effective, coarse-grained off-lattice models to
study the influence of specific interactions in the models on conformational
transitions of selected sequences with 20 monomers. Another aspect of the
investigation was the comparison with the purely hydrophobic homopolymer and
the study of general conformational properties induced by the "disorder" in the
sequence of a heteropolymer. Furthermore, we applied an optimization algorithm
to sequences with up to 55 monomers and compared the global-energy minimum
found with lowest-energy states identified within the multicanonical
simulation. This was used to find out how reliable the multicanonical method
samples the free-energy landscape, in particular for low temperatures.
