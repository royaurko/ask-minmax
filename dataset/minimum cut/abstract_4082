It is demonstrated that there exists a direct correlation between chemical
freeze-out point and the softest point of the equation of state where the
pressure divided by the energy density, $p(\epsilon)/\epsilon$, has a minimum.
A dynamical model is given as an example where the passage of the softest point
coincides with the condition for chemical freeze-out, namely an average energy
per hadron $\approx$ 1 GeV. The sensitivity of the result to the equation of
state used is discussed.
