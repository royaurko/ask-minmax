In this article, the minimum distance of the dual $C^{\bot}$ of a functional
code $C$ on an arbitrary dimensional variety $X$ over a finite field $\F_q$ is
studied. The approach consists in finding minimal configurations of points on
$X$ which are not in "general position". If $X$ is a curve, the result improves
in some situations the well-known Goppa designed distance.
