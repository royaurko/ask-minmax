In creating his gravitational field equations Einstein unjustifiedly assumed
that inertial mass, and its energy equivalent, is a source of gravity. Denying
this assumption allows modifying the field equations to a form in which a
positive cosmological constant appears as a uniform density of gravitationally
repulsive matter. This repulsive matter is identified as the back sides of the
'drainholes' (called by some 'traversable wormholes') introduced by the contributor
in 1973, which attract on the high, front sides and repel more strongly on the
low, back sides. The field equations with a scalar field added produce
cosmological models that 'bounce' off a positive minimum of the scale factor
and accelerate throughout history. The 'dark drainholes' that radiate nothing
visible are hypothesized to constitute the 'dark matter' inferred from
observation, their excess of negative active mass over positive active mass
driving the accelerating expansion. For a universe with spatial curvature zero,
and the ratio of scale factor now to scale factor at bounce equal to the Hubble
radius over the Planck length, the model gives an elapsed time since the bounce
of two trillion years. The solutions for negative spatial curvature exhibit
early stage inflation of great magnitude in short times. Cosmic voids,
filaments, and walls are attributed to separation of the back sides of the
drainholes from the front, driven by their mutual attractive-repulsive
interactions.
