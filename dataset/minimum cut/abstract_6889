We study the effects of fermiophobic scalar/pseudo-scalar oblique corrections
on bound state energy levels in muonic atoms. To make the treatment
sufficiently general we will consider Unparticle scalars/pseudo-scalars which
couple only to photons. We derive the relevant vacuum polarization functions
and comment on the functional forms of the Unparticle Uehling potentials for
various scaling dimensions in the point nucleus and finite nucleus
approximations. It is estimated that for an infra-red fixed point near the
scale of electroweak symmetry breaking, in the low TeV range, the energy shifts
in the low-lying muonic lead transitions could typically be of the order of a
few times 0.1 eV to a few times 0.01 eV. It is shown that this conclusion is
not changed even when scale invariance is broken and is in fact relatively
insensitive to the scale at which it is broken. It is pointed out nevertheless
that the estimated magnitude of the Unparticle Uehling shift is a factor of
$10^{3}-10^{4}$ below the discrepancy in QED/nuclear theory and precision
muonic lead spectroscopy from about two decades ago. A minimum value for the
conformal invariance breaking scale is also estimated for the fermiophobic
scalar/pseudo-scalar sector to ensure consistency with astrophysics and
cosmology. The energy level structure of the Unparticle Uehling shifts are
inferred using general methods for the scalar and pseudo-scalar cases and it is
shown that the two cases contribute to the energy shifts with the same sign.
