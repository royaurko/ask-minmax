According to a classical result of Gr\"unbaum, the transversal number
$\tau(\F)$ of any family $\F$ of pairwise-intersecting translates or homothets
of a convex body $C$ in $\RR^d$ is bounded by a function of $d$. Denote by
$\alpha(C)$ (resp. $\beta(C)$) the supremum of the ratio of the transversal
number $\tau(\F)$ to the packing number $\nu(\F)$ over all families $\F$ of
translates (resp. homothets) of a convex body $C$ in $\RR^d$. Kim et al.
recently showed that $\alpha(C)$ is bounded by a function of $d$ for any convex
body $C$ in $\RR^d$, and gave the first bounds on $\alpha(C)$ for convex bodies
$C$ in $\RR^d$ and on $\beta(C)$ for convex bodies $C$ in the plane.
  Here we show that $\beta(C)$ is also bounded by a function of $d$ for any
convex body $C$ in $\RR^d$, and present new or improved bounds on both
$\alpha(C)$ and $\beta(C)$ for various convex bodies $C$ in $\RR^d$ for all
dimensions $d$. Our techniques explore interesting inequalities linking the
covering and packing densities of a convex body. Our methods for obtaining
upper bounds are constructive and lead to efficient constant-factor
approximation algorithms for finding a minimum-cardinality point set that
pierces a set of translates or homothets of a convex body.
