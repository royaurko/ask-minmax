We present a unique decoding algorithm of algebraic geometry codes on plane
curves, Hermitian codes in particular, from an interpolation point of view. The
algorithm successfully corrects errors of weight up to half of the order bound
on the minimum distance of the AG code. The decoding algorithm is the first to
combine some features of the interpolation based list decoding with the
performance of the syndrome decoding with majority voting scheme. The regular
structure of the algorithm allows a straightforward parallel implementation.
