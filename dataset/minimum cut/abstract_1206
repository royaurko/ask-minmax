We present and prove the correctness of an efficient algorithm that provides
a basis for all solutions of a key equation in order to decode Gabidulin (G-)
codes up to a given radius tau. This algorithm is based on a symbolic
equivalent of the Euclidean Algorithm (EA) and can be applied for decoding of
G-codes beyond half the minimum rank distance. If the key equation has a unique
solution, our algorithm reduces to Gabidulin's decoding algorithm up to half
the minimum distance. If the solution is not unique, we provide a basis for all
solutions of the key equation. Our algorithm has time complexity O(tau^2) and
is a generalization of the modified EA by Bossert and Bezzateev for
Reed-Solomon codes.
