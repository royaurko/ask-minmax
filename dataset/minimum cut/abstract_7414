Previous results on certain sampling series have left open if divergence only
occurs for certain subsequences or, in fact, in the limit. Here we prove that
divergence occurs in the limit.
  We consider three canonical reconstruction methods for functions in the
Paley-Wiener space $\mathcal{PW}^1_\pi$. For each of these we prove an instance
when the reconstruction diverges in the limit. This is a much stronger
statement than previous results that provide only $\limsup$ divergence. We also
address reconstruction for functions in the Hardy space $\mathcal{H}^1$ and
show that for any subsequence of the natural numbers there exists a function in
$\mathcal{H}^1$ for which reconstruction diverges in $\limsup$. For two of
these sampling series we show that when divergence occurs, the sampling series
has strong oscillations so that the maximum and the minimum tend to positive
and negative infinity. Our results are of interest in functional analysis
because they go beyond the type of result that can be obtained using the
Banach-Steinhaus Theorem. We discuss practical implications of this work; in
particular the work shows that methods using specially chosen subsequences of
reconstructions cannot yield convergence for the Paley-Wiener Space
$\mathcal{PW}^1_\pi$.
