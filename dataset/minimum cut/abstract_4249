In this paper, we clarify the relations between the existing sets of
regularity conditions for convergence rates of nonparametric indirect
regression (NPIR) and nonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV) regression
models. We establish minimax risk lower bounds in mean integrated squared error
loss for the NPIR and the NPIV models under two basic regularity conditions
that allow for both mildly ill-posed and severely ill-posed cases. We show that
both a simple projection estimator for the NPIR model, and a sieve minimum
distance estimator for the NPIV model, can achieve the minimax risk lower
bounds, and are rate-optimal uniformly over a large class of structure
functions, allowing for mildly ill-posed and severely ill-posed cases.
