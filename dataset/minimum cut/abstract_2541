It has recently been shown via an equivalence of gravitational radius and
Compton wavelength in four dimensions that the trans-Planckian regime of
gravity may by semi-classical, and that this point is defined by a minimum
horizon radius commensurate with the Planck mass. We extend the formalism to
gravity in the context of Randall-Sundrum and the generalized uncertainty
principle.
