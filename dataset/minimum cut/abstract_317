The motion of classical test spinning particles in Godel universe in the
realm of Einstein's General Relativity (GR) is investigated by making use of
Killing conserved currents. We consider three distinct cases of motion of
spinning particles polarized along the three distinct axes of the anisotropic
metric. It is shown that in the case the spin is polarised along the
y-direction the minimum energy of the motion is attained for only for spinless
particles while the other two directions the minimum energy is obtained for
spinning particles. The continuos energy spectrum is also computed.
