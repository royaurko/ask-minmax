We show that a Susy renormalizable theory based on gauge group SO(10) and
Higgs system {\bf {10 $\oplus$ 210 $\oplus$ 126 $\oplus$ $\overline{\bf 126}$}}
with no scale supergravity can lead to a Starobinsky kind of potential for
inflation. Successful inflation is possible in the cases where the potential
during inflation corresponds to $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times
U(1)_{B-L}$, $SU(5)\times U(1)$ and flipped $SU(5)\times U(1)$ symmetry. The
reheating in such scenario can occur via non perturbative decay of inflaton
i.e. through "preheating". After the end of inflation and preheating the
universe finds a minimum which corresponds to MSSM, where Susy can be restored
again.
