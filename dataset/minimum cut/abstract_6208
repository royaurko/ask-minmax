We present the results of VLT optical spectroscopy of a complete sample of 78
EROs with R-Ks\geq5 over a field of 52 arcmin^2. About 70% of the 45 EROs with
Ks\leq19.2 have been spectroscopically identified with old passively evolving
and dusty star-forming galaxies at 0.7<z<1.5. The two classes are about equally
populated and for each of them we present and discuss the average spectrum.
  From the old ERO average spectrum and for Z=Z_{\odot} we derive a minimum age
of \sim 3 Gyr, corresponding to a formation redshift of z_f \gtsima 2.4. PLE
models with such formation redshifts well reproduce the density of old EROs
(consistent with being passively evolving ellipticals), whereas the predictions
of the current hierarchical merging models are lower than the observed
densities by large factors (up to an order of magnitude). From the average
spectrum of the star-forming EROs we estimate a substantial dust extinction
with E(B-V) \gtsima 0.5. The star formation rates, corrected for the average
reddening, suggest a significant contribution from EROs to the cosmic
star-formation density at z \sim 1.
