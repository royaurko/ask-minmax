We address the question, does a system A being entangled with another system
B, put any constraints on the Heisenberg uncertainty relation (or the
Schrodinger-Robertson inequality)? We find that the equality of the uncertainty
relation cannot be reached for any two noncommuting observables, for finite
dimensional Hilbert spaces if the Schmidt rank of the entangled state is
maximal. One consequence is that the lower bound of the uncertainty relation
can never be attained for any two observables for qubits, if the state is
entangled. For infinite-dimensional Hilbert space too, we show that there is a
class of physically interesting entangled states for which no two noncommuting
observables can attain the minimum uncertainty equality.
