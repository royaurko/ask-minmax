In this work, decision feedback (DF) detection algorithms based on multiple
processing branches for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing
systems are proposed. The proposed detector employs multiple cancellation
branches with receive filters that are obtained from a common matrix inverse
and achieves a performance close to the maximum likelihood detector (MLD).
Constrained minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receive filters designed with
constraints on the shape and magnitude of the feedback filters for the
multi-branch MMSE DF (MB-MMSE-DF) receivers are presented. An adaptive
implementation of the proposed MB-MMSE-DF detector is developed along with a
recursive least squares-type algorithm for estimating the parameters of the
receive filters when the channel is time-varying. A soft-output version of the
MB-MMSE-DF detector is also proposed as a component of an iterative detection
and decoding receiver structure. A computational complexity analysis shows that
the MB-MMSE-DF detector does not require a significant additional complexity
over the conventional MMSE-DF detector, whereas a diversity analysis discusses
the diversity order achieved by the MB-MMSE-DF detector. Simulation results
show that the MB-MMSE-DF detector achieves a performance superior to existing
suboptimal detectors and close to the MLD, while requiring significantly lower
complexity.
