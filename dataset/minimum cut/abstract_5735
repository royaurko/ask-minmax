V-type asteroids, characterized by two absorption bands at 1.0 and 2.0 $\mu
m$, are usually thought to be portions of the crust of differentiated or
partially differentiated bodies. Most V-type asteroids are found in the inner
main belt and are thought to be current or past members of the Vesta dynamical
family. Recently, several V-type photometric candidates have been identified in
the central and outer main belt.
  While the dynamical evolution of V-type photometric candidates in the central
main belt has been recently investigated, less attention has been given to the
orbital evolution of basaltic material in the outer main belt as a whole. Here
we identify known and new V-type photometric candidates in this region, and
study their orbital evolution under the effect of gravitational and
non-gravitational forces. A scenario in which a minimum of three local sources,
possibly associated with the parent bodies of (349) Dembowska, (221) Eos, and
(1459) Magnya, could in principle explain the current orbital distribution of
V-type photometric candidates in the region.
