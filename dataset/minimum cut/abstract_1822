Within the context of the linear $\s$-model for two flavours, we investigate
non-equilibrium phenomena that may occur during the QCD chiral phase transition
in heavy-ion collisions. We assume that the chiral symmetry breaking is
followed by a rapid quench so that the system falls out of thermal equilibrium.
We study the mechanism for the amplification of the pion field during the
oscillations of the $\s$-field towards and around its new minimum. We show that
the pion spectrum develops a characteristic pronounced peak at low momenta.
