The Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm is an iterative improvement
technique for finding the minimum distance between two convex objects. It can
easily be extended to work with concave objects and return the pair of closest
points. [4] The key operation of GJK is testing whether a Voronoi region of a
simplex contains the origin or not. In this paper we show that, in the context
where one is interested only in the Boolean value of whether two convex objects
intersect, and not in the actual distance between them, the number of test
cases in GJK can be significantly reduced. This results in a simpler and more
efficient algorithm that can be used in many computational geometry
applications.
