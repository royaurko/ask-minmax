In these proceedings we give a status update of the Calan-Hertfordshire
Extrasolar Planet Search, an international collaboration led from Chile that
aims to discover more planets around super metal-rich and Sun-like stars, and
then follow these up with precision photometry to hunt for new bright transit
planets. We highlight some results from this program, including exoplanet and
brown dwarf discoveries, and a possible correlation between metallicity and
planetary minimum mass at the lowest planetary masses detectable. Finally we
discuss the short-term and long-term future pathways this program can take.
