We report on resonance line profiles predicted by radiation driven disk wind
models which extend radially one order of magnitude farther out than our
previous models. Our main result is that the inclusion of a disk wind at larger
radii changes qualitatively and quantitatively the line profiles predicted by
the models. Our new models predict line absorption that is significantly
stronger than those predicted by old models. Some of the previous line profiles
exhibit a doubled-humped structure near the line center which is now replaced
by a more plausible single, blueshifted minimum. We emphasize that the
improvements in the shape as well as the strength of the absorption were
achieved without changing the gross properties of the wind. In particular, our
new models do not predict a higher mass-loss rate than the previous models. The
main changes in the line profiles are due to the fact that the ratio between
the rotational velocity and poloidal velocity of the wind decreases downstream.
The new line profiles reproduce well the line absorption of the nova-like
variable, IX~Vel, and promise to reproduce observations of other cataclysmic
variables. This success of the radiation driven disk wind model provides an
important link between outflows in OB stars and outflows in active galactic
nuclei.
