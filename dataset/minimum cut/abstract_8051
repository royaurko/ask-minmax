We characterize the star formation in the low-metallicity galaxy NGC 6822
over the past few hundred million years, using GALEX far-UV (FUV, 1344-1786 A)
and near-UV (NUV, 1771-2831 A) imaging, and ground-based Ha imaging. From GALEX
FUV image, we define 77 star-forming (SF) regions with area >860 pc^2, and
surface brightness <=26.8 mag(AB)arcsec^-2, within 0.2deg (1.7kpc) of the
center of the galaxy. We estimate the extinction by interstellar dust in each
SF region from resolved photometry of the hot stars it contains: E(B-V) ranges
from the minimum foreground value of 0.22mag up to 0.66+-0.21mag. The
integrated FUV and NUV photometry, compared with stellar population models,
yields ages of the SF complexes up to a few hundred Myr, and masses from 2x10^2
Msun to 1.5x10^6 Msun. The derived ages and masses strongly depend on the
assumed type of interstellar selective extinction, which we find to vary across
the galaxy. The total mass of the FUV-defined SF regions translates into an
average star formation rate (SFR) of 1.4x10^-2 Msun/yr over the past 100 Myr,
and SFR=1.0x10^-2 Msun/yr in the most recent 10 Myr. The latter is in agreement
with the value that we derive from the Ha luminosity, SFR=0.008 Msun/yr. The
SFR in the most recent epoch becomes higher if we add the SFR=0.02 Msun/yr
inferred from far-IR measurements, which trace star formation still embedded in
dust (age <= a few Myr).
