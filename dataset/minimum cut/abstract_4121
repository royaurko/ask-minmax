Vibrational spectra of polyatomic molecules are often obtained from a
polynomial expansion of the adiabatic potential around a minimum. For several
molecules, we show that such an approximation displays an unphysical saddle
point of comparatively small energy, leading to a region where the potential is
negative and unbounded. This poses an upper limit for a reliable evaluation of
vibrational levels. We argue that the presence of such saddle points is
general.
