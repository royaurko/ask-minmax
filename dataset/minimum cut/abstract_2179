We first re-prove with a more complete method that the the minimum standard
model, with the inclusion of the CKM-matrix, requires the T-odd/P-odd total
cross section of two spin-1/2 particles to vanish in all orders\cite{gxu}. Then
we study the contribution to T-odd/P-odd total scattering cross sections from
various channels within the Higgs sector, and optimize conditions for possible
experimental measurements of these effects. These studies show that such
contributions can appear at tree level, and that the spin dependent cross
section asymmetry is measurable if the lightest Higgs paarticle is not too
massive, {\it e.g.} $m_H \sim 200 GeV$, and if suitable reaction channels and
beam energies and luminosities are chosen.
