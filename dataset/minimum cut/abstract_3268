We present two-colour CCD imaging of 2060 Chiron obtained between 1996 and
1998 with the 2.15 m telescope at CASLEO (San Juan, Argentina). These
post-perihelion observations show that Chiron was then near its historical
brightness minima, however a coma was clearly detected. The dynamical state of
the coma is studied by means of azimuthally averaged surface brightness
profiles, which show the signatures of radiation pressure on the dust grain
distribution. Aperture photometry shows an achromatic dimming with an amplitude
\~ 0.09 mag in approximately one hour. If due to rotation of the nucleus, this
rather high amplitude is used to derive a new value for the nuclear magnitude,
m_0 ~ 6.80 mag.
