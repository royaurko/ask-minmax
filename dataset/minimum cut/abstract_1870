We continue our study of the stability of designer gravity theories, where
one considers anti-de Sitter gravity coupled to certain tachyonic scalars with
boundary conditions defined by a smooth function W. It has recently been argued
there is a lower bound on the conserved energy in terms of the global minimum
of W, if the scalar potential arises from a superpotential P and the scalar
reaches an extremum of P at infinity. We show, however, there are
superpotentials for which these bounds do not hold.
