We investigate the effect on the sphaleron in the two Higgs doublet
electroweak theory of including CP violation in the Higgs potential. To have
better control over the relation between the sphaleron energy and the physical
quantities in the theory, we show how to parametrize the Higgs potential in
terms of physical masses and mixing angles, one of which causes CP violation.
By altering this CP violating angle (and keeping the other physical quantities
fixed) the sphaleron energy increases by up to 10%. We also calculate the
static minimum energy path between adjacent vacua as a function of Chern-Simons
number, using the method of gradient flow. The only effect CP violation has on
the barrier is the change in height. As a by-product of our work on
parametrization of the potential, we demonstrate that CP violation in the Higgs
sector favours nearly degenerate light Higgs masses.
