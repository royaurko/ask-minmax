We report on the study of the noise properties of laser light propagating
through a cold 87Rb atomic sample held in a magneto-optical trap. The laser is
tuned around the Fg = 2 \rightarrow Fe = 1, 2 D1 transitions of 87Rb. We
observe quadrature-dependent noise in the light signal, an indication that it
may be possible to produce squeezed states of light. We measure the minimum and
maximum phase-dependent noise as a function of detuning and compare these
results to theoretical predictions to explore the best conditions for light
squeezing using cold atomic Rb.
