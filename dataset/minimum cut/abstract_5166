First-principles density functional calculations demonstrate that a
spin-polarized two-dimensional conducting state can be realized at the
interface between two non-magnetic band insulators. The (001) surface of the
diamagnetic insulator FeS2 (pyrite) supports a localized surface state deriving
from Fe d-orbitals near the conduction band minimum. The deposition of a few
unit cells of the polar perovskite oxide LaAlO3 leads to electron transfer into
these surface bands, thereby creating a conducting interface. The occupation of
these narrow bands leads to an exchange splitting between the spin sub-bands,
yielding a highly spin-polarized conducting state distinct from the rest of the
non-magnetic, insulating bulk. Such an interface presents intriguing
possibilities for spintronics applications.
