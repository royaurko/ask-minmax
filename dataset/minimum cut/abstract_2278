This paper presents arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction and
multiplications in Modulo-4 arithmetic, and also addition, multiplication in
Galois field, using multi-valued logic (MVL). Quaternary to binary and binary
to quaternary converters are designed using down literal circuits. Negation in
modular arithmetic is designed with only one gate. Logic design of each
operation is achieved by reducing the terms using Karnaugh diagrams, keeping
minimum number of gates and depth of net in to consideration. Quaternary
multiplier circuit is proposed to achieve required optimization. Simulation
result of each operation is shown separately using Hspice.
