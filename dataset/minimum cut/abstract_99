Most stars previously identified as Maunder minimum stars are old stars
evolved off of the main sequence. Analysis of activity measurements from the
California and Carnegie Planet Search program stars and Hipparcos parallaxes
implies that the canonical age-chromospheric activity relation breaks down for
stars older than $\sim 6$ Gyr when activity is calculated from Mount Wilson S
values. Stars only 1 magnitude above the main sequence exhibit significantly
suppressed activity levels which have been mistaken for examples of Maunder
minimum behavior.
