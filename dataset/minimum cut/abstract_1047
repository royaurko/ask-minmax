We propose a flavor model where both CP and flavor symmetries are broken at
the supersymmetric level. The model is an effective SU(5) theory based on a
U(2) horizontal symmetry. The minimum of the supersymmetric scalar potential
can be solved to yield a realistic pattern of charged fermion masses. The Higgs
sector contains a symmetric, an antisymmetric and two vector fields, plus their
U(2) conjugates. These Higgs fields are the only fields strictly required to
break the flavor and CP symmetries and generate masses for all charged fermions
including the up-quark. The model predicts the existence of an absolute minimum
in the space of CP-phases. The value alpha ~ pi/2 is predicted in a particular
limit of the parameter space of the model.
