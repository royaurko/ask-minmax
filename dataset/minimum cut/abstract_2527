In Shannon's landmark 1949 paper Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems, the
idea of diffusive functions is briefly mentioned. We consider two common
definitions of such functions mapping between binary strings of fixed length.
Given the dimension of the input space, we determine the minimum dimension of
the output space for which such a function exists, by explicit construction and
with respect to each definition. It will follow that each larger output
dimension allows for such a function as well.
