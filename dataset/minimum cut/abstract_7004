Excited states in the extremely neutron-deficient nucleus, 180Pb, have been
identified for the first time using the JUROGAM II array in conjunction with
the RITU recoil separator at the Accelerator Laboratory of the University of
Jyvaskyla. This study lies at the limit of what is presently achievable with
in-beam spectroscopy, with an estimated cross-section of only 10 nb for the
92Mo(90Zr,2n)180Pb reaction. A continuation of the trend observed in 182Pb and
184Pb is seen, where the prolate minimum continues to rise beyond the N=104
mid-shell with respect to the spherical ground state. Beyond mean-field
calculations are in reasonable correspondence with the trends deduced from
experiment.
