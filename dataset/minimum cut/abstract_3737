Minimum Bias production cross sections of $\eta$ mesons have been measured in
200 AGeV/c S+Au and S+S collisions at the CERN SPS by reconstructing the $\eta
\to \gamma\gamma$ decay. The measurements have been made over the rapidity
range $2.1 \leq y \leq 2.9$ using the leadglass spectrometer of WA80. Within
the statistical and systematical uncertainties the spectral shapes of $\pi^0$
and $\eta$ mesons yields are identical when their invariant differential cross
section is plotted as a function of the transverse mass. The relative
normalization of the $\eta$ to $\pi^0$ transverse mass spectra is found to be
$0.53 \pm 0.07$ for S+Au and $0.43 \pm 0.15$ for S+S reactions. Extrapolation
to full phase space leads to an integrated cross section ratio of $\eta$ to
$\pi^0$ mesons of $0.147 \pm 0.017 {\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.015 {\rm (syst.)}$, and
$0.120 \pm 0.034 {\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.022 {\rm (syst.)}$ for S+Au and S+S
collisions, respectively.
