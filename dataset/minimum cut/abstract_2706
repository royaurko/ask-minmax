The absolute fluxes of the cosmic-ray antiprotons at solar minimum are
measured in the energy range 0.18 to 1.4 GeV, based on 43 events unambiguously
detected in BESS '95 data. The resultant energy spectrum appears to be flat
below 1 GeV, compatible with a possible admixture of primary antiproton
component with a soft energy spectrum, while the possibility of secondary
antiprotons alone explaining the data cannot be excluded with the present
accuracy. Further improvement of statistical accuracy and extension of the
energy range are planned in future BESS flights.
