For a prime power $q$, let $\alpha_q$ be the standard function in the
asymptotic theory of codes, that is, $\alpha_q(\delta)$ is the largest
asymptotic information rate that can be achieved for a given asymptotic
relative minimum distance $\delta$ of $q$-ary codes. In recent years the
Tsfasman-Vl\u{a}du\c{t}-Zink lower bound on $\alpha_q(\delta)$ was improved by
Elkies, Xing, and Niederreiter and \"Ozbudak. In this paper we show further
improvements on these bounds by using distinguished divisors of global function
fields. We also show improved lower bounds on the corresponding function
$\alpha_q^{\rm lin}$ for linear codes.
