Self-replication is a capacity common to every species of living thing, and
simple physical intuition dictates that such a process must invariably be
fueled by the production of entropy. Here, we undertake to make this intuition
rigorous and quantitative by deriving a lower bound for the amount of heat that
is produced during a process of self-replication in a system coupled to a
thermal bath. We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of
heat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and
durability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding
for bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of
self-replicating nucleic acids.
