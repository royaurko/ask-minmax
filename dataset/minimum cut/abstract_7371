We present a simple new way to visualize the constraints of Higgs coupling
measurements on light stops in natural SUSY scenarios beyond the MSSM, which
works directly in the plane of stop mass eigenvalues (with no need to make
assumptions about mixing angles). For given stop mass eigenvalues, the smallest
value of $X_t$ that can bring the correction to the $h \to gg$ and $h\to
\gamma\gamma$ couplings into agreement with data is computed. Requiring that
this $X_t$ is consistent--i.e. that the chosen mass eigenvalues can be the
outcome of diagonalizing a matrix with a given off-diagonal term--rules out the
possibility that both stops have a mass below $\approx$ 400 GeV. Requiring that
$X_t$ is not fine-tuned for agreement with the data shows that neither stop can
be lighter than $\approx$ 100 GeV. These constraints are interesting because,
unlike direct searches, they apply no matter how stops decay, and suggest a
minimum electroweak fine-tuning of between a factor of 5 and 10. We show that a
multi-parameter fit can slightly weaken this conclusion by allowing a large
Higgs coupling to $b$-quarks, but only if a second Higgs boson is within reach
of experiment. Certain models, like $R$-symmetric models with Dirac gauginos,
are much more strongly constrained because they predict negligible $X_t$. We
illustrate how the constraints will evolve given precise measurements at future
colliders (HL-LHC, ILC, and TLEP), and comment on the more difficult case of
Folded Supersymmetry.
