Dissolved oxygen in sea water is a major factor affecting marine habitats and
biogeochemical cycles. Oceanic zones with oxygen deficits represent significant
portions of the area and volume of the oceans and are thought to be expanding.
The Peruvian oxygen minimum zone is one of the most pronounced and lies in a
region of strong mesoscale activity in the form of vortices and frontal
regions, whose effect in the dynamics of the oxygen minimum zone is largely
unknown. Here, we study this issue from a modeling approach and a Lagrangian
point of view, using a coupled physical-biogeochemical simulation of the
Peruvian oxygen minimum zone and finite-size Lyapunov exponent fields to
understand the link between mesoscale dynamics and oxygen variations. Our
results show that, at depths between 380 and 600 meters, mesoscale structures
have a relevant dual role. First, their mean positions and paths delimit and
maintain the oxygen minimum zone boundaries. Second, their high frequency
fluctuations entrain oxygen across these boundaries as eddy fluxes that point
towards the interior of the oxygen minimum zone and are one order of magnitude
larger than mean fluxes. We conclude that these eddy fluxes contribute to the
ventilation of the oxygen minimum zone.
