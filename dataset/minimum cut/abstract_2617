In this note, we have revisited the previously published paper "Particle
Filtering for Attitude Estimation Using a Minimal Local-Error Representation".
In the revisit, we point out that the quaternion particle filtering based on
the local/global representation structure has not made full use of the
advantage of the particle filtering in terms of accuracy and robustness.
Moreover, a normalized quaternion determining procedure based on the minimum
mean-square error approach has been investigated into the quaternion-based
particle filtering to obtain the fiducial quaternion for the transformation
between quaternion and modified Rodrigues parameter. The modification
investigated in this note is expected to make the quaternion particle filtering
based on the local/global representation structure more strict.
