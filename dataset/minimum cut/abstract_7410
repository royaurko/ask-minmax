With the development of ultra intense laser technology, MeV ions from the
laser foil interaction have been obtained by different mechanisms, such as
target normal sheath acceleration, radiation pressure acceleration,
collisionless shock acceleration, breakout afterburner, and a combination of
different mechanisms. These energetic ion beams can be applied in fast ignition
for inertial confinement fusion, medical therapy, and proton imaging. However,
these ions are mainly accelerated in the laser propagation direction, and the
ion acceleration in an azimuthal orientation is scarcely mentioned. Here, a
doughnut Laguerre Gaussian LG laser is used for the first time to study the
laser plasma interaction in the relativistic intensity regime in three
dimensional particle in cell simulations. Studies have shown that a novel
rotation of the plasma is produced from the hollow screw like drill of a LG
mode laser. The angular momentum of the protons in the longitudinal direction
produced by the LG laser is remarkably enhanced compared with that produced by
the usual laser pulses, such as linearly and circularly polarized gaussian
pulses. Moreover, the particles, including electrons and ions, can be trapped
and uniformly compressed in the dark central minimum of the doughnut LG pulse.
Such hollow structured LG laser may be used to investigate some difficult
problems, such as screw like drilling in the inertial confinement fusion, laser
driven particle accelerations, and pulsars in the astrophysical environment.
