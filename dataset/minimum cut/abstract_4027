Let there be given a contaminated list of n R^d-valued observations coming
from g different, normally distributed populations with a common covariance
matrix. We compute the ML-estimator with respect to a certain statistical model
with n-r outliers for the parameters of the g populations; it detects outliers
and simultaneously partitions their complement into g clusters. It turns out
that the estimator unites both the minimum-covariance-determinant rejection
method and the well-known pooled determinant criterion of cluster analysis. We
also propose an efficient algorithm for approximating this estimator and study
its breakdown points for mean values and pooled SSP matrix.
