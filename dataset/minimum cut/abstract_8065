We analyze the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of 33 classical T Tauri stars
(CTTS), including 20 new spectra obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys
Solar Blind Channel (ACS/SBC) on the Hubble Space Telescope. Of the sources, 28
are in the ~1 Myr old Taurus-Auriga complex or Orion Molecular Cloud, 4 in the
8-10 Myr old Orion OB1a complex and one, TW Hya, in the 10 Myr old TW Hydrae
Association. We also obtained FUV ACS/SBC spectra of 10 non-accreting sources
surrounded by debris disks with ages between 10 and 125 Myr. We use a feature
in the FUV spectra due mostly to electron impact excitation of \h2 to study the
evolution of the gas in the inner disk. We find that the \h2 feature is absent
in non-accreting sources, but is detected in the spectra of CTTS and correlates
with accretion luminosity. Since all young stars have active chromospheres
which produce strong X-ray and UV emission capable of exciting \h2 in the disk,
the fact that the non-accreting sources show no \h2 emission implies that the
\h2 gas in the inner disk has dissipated in the non-accreting sources, although
dust (and possibly gas) remains at larger radii. Using the flux at 1600 {\AA},
we estimate that the column density of \h2 left in the inner regions of the
debris disks in our sample is less than ~ 3x10^-6 g cm^-2, nine orders of
magnitude below the surface density of the minimum mass solar nebula at 1 AU.
