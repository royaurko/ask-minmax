We report on the experimental demonstration of light dragging effect due to
atomic motion in a rubidium vapor cell. We found that the minimum group
velocity is achieved for light red-shifted from the center of the atomic
resonance, and that the value of this shift increases with decreasing group
velocity, in agreement with the theoretical predictions by Kocharovskaya,
Rostovtsev, and Scully [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 86}, 628 (2001)].
