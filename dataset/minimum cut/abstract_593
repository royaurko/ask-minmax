The objective of this paper is to point out that contact induced states can
help explain the structure dependence of the minimum conductivity observed
experimentally even if the samples were purely ballistic. Contact induced
states are similar to the well-known metal induced gap states (MIGS) in
metal-semiconductor Schottky junctions, which typically penetrate only a few
atomic lengths into the semiconductor, while the depth of penetration decreases
with increasing band gap. However, in graphene we find that these states
penetrate a much longer distance of the order of the width of the contacts. As
a result, ballistic graphene samples with a length less than their width can
exhibit a resistance proportional to length that is not Ohmic in origin, but
arises from a reduced role of contact-induced states. While actual samples are
probably not ballistic and involve scattering processes, our results show that
these contact induced effects need to be taken into account in interpreting
experiments and minimum conductivity depends strongly on the structure and
configuration (two- vs. four-terminal) used.
