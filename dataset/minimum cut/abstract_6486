We reconsider the old problem of the dynamics of spontaneous symmetry
breaking using 3d lattice simulations, and develop a theory of tachyonic
preheating, which occurs due to the spinodal instability of the scalar field.
Tachyonic preheating is so efficient that symmetry breaking typically completes
within a single oscillation of the field distribution as it rolls towards the
minimum of its effective potential. As an application of this theory we
consider preheating in the hybrid inflation scenario, including SUSY-motivated
F-term and D-term inflationary models. We show that preheating in hybrid
inflation is typically tachyonic and the stage of oscillations of a homogeneous
component of the scalar fields driving inflation ends after a single
oscillation. Our results may also be relevant for the theory of the formation
of disoriented chiral condensates in heavy ion collisions.
