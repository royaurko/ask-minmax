The influence of magnetic impurities on the transport properties of graphene
is investigated in the regime of strong applied electric fields. As a result of
electron-hole pair creation, the response becomes nonlinear and dependent on
the magnetic polarization. In the paramagnetic phase, time reversal symmetry is
statistically preserved, and transport properties are similar to the clean
case. At variance, in the antiferromagnetic phase, the system undergoes a
transition between a superdiffusive to a subdiffusive spreading of a wave
packet, signaling the development of localized states. This critical regime is
characterized by the appearance of electronic states with a multifractal
geometry near the gap. The local density of states concentrates in large
patches having a definite charge-spin correlation. In this state, the
conductivity tends to half the minimum conductivity of clean graphene.
