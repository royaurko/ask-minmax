A traditional paper-based passport contains a Machine- Readable Zone (MRZ)
and a Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ). The MRZ has two lines of the holder's
personal data, some document data, and verification characters encoded using
the Optical Character Recognition font B (OCRB). The encoded data includes the
holder's name, date of birth, and other identifying information for the holder
or the document. The VIZ contains the holder's photo and signature, usually on
the data page. However, the MRZ and VIZ can be easily duplicated with normal
document reproduction technology to produce a fake passport which can pass
traditional verification. Neither of these features actively verify the
holder's identity; nor do they bind the holder's identity to the document. A
passport also contains pages for stamps of visas and of country entry and exit
dates, which can be easily altered to produce fake permissions and travel
records. The electronic passport, supporting authentication using secure
credentials on a tamper-resistant chip, is an attempt to improve on the
security of the paper-based passport at minimum cost. This paper surveys the
security mechanisms built into the firstgeneration of authentication mechanisms
and compares them with second-generation passports. It analyzes and describes
the cryptographic protocols used in Basic Access Control (BAC) and Extended
Access Control (EAC).
