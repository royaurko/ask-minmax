Five new planets orbiting G and K dwarfs have emerged from the Magellan
velocity survey. These companions are jovian-mass planets in eccentric (e \geq
0.24) intermediate and long-period orbits. HD 86226b orbits a solar metallicity
G2 dwarf. The MP sin i mass of the planet is 1.5 MJUP, the semi-major axis is
2.6 AU, and the eccentricity 0.73. HD 129445b orbits a metal rich G6 dwarf. The
minimum mass of the planet is MP sin i =1.6 MJUP, the semi-major axis is 2.9
AU, and the eccentricity 0.70. HD 164604b orbits a K2 dwarf. The MP sin i mass
is 2.7 MJUP, semi-major axis is 1.3 AU, and the eccentricity is 0.24. HD
175167b orbits a metal rich G5 star. The MP sin i mass is 7.8 MJUP, the
semi-major axis is 2.4 AU, and the eccentricity 0.54. HD 152079b orbits a G6
dwarf. The MP sin i mass of the planet is 3 MJUP, the semi-major axis is 3.2
AU, and the eccentricity is 0.60.
