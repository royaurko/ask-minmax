We investigate theoretically and experimentally the capillary-gravity waves
created by a small object moving steadily at the water-air interface along a
circular trajectory. It is well established that, for straight uniform motion,
no steady waves appear at velocities below the minimum phase velocity $c_{min}
= 23 \rm{cm \cdot s}^{-1}$. We show theoretically that no such velocity
threshold exists for a steady circular motion, for which, even at small
velocities, a finite wave drag is experienced by the object. This wave drag
originates from the emission of a spiral-like wave pattern. Our results are in
good agreement with direct experimental observations of the wave pattern
created by a circularly moving needle in contact with water. Our study leads to
new insights into the problem of animal locomotion at the water-air interface.
