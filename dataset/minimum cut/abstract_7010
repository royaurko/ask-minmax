The third US Naval Observatory (USNO) CCD Astrograph Catalog, UCAC3 was
released at the IAU General Assembly on 2009 August 10. It is a highly
accurate, all-sky astrometric catalog of about 100 million stars in the R = 8
to 16 magnitude range. Recent epoch observations are based on over 270,000 CCD
exposures, which have been re-processed for the UCAC3 release applying
traditional and new techniques. Challenges in the data have been high dark
current and asymmetric image profiles due to the poor charge transfer
efficiency of the detector. Non-Gaussian image profile functions were explored
and correlations are found for profile fit parameters with properties of the
CCD frames. These were utilized to constrain the image profile fit models and
adequately describe the observed point-spread function of stellar images with a
minimum number of free parameters. Using an appropriate model function, blended
images of double stars could be fit successfully. UCAC3 positions are derived
from 2-dimensional image profile fits with a 5-parameter, symmetric Lorentz
profile model. Internal precisions of about 5 mas per coordinate and single
exposure are found, which are degraded by the atmosphere to about 10 mas.
However, systematic errors exceeding 100 mas are present in the x,y-data which
have been corrected in the astrometric reductions following the x,y-data
reduction step described here.
