We investigate the transient dynamics of a short overdamped Josephson
junction with a periodic driving signal in the presence of colored noise. We
analyze noise induced henomena, specifically resonant activation and noise
enhanced stability. We find that the positions both of the minimum of RA and
maximum of NES depend on the value of the noise correlation time tau_c.
Moreover, in the range where RA is observed, we find a non-monotonic behavior
of the mean switching time as a function of the correlation time tau_c.
