In this letter we consider a charged black hole in a flux compactification of
type IIB string theory. Both the black hole and the fluxes will induce
potentials for the complex structure moduli. We choose the compact dimensions
to be described locally by a deformed conifold, creating a large hierarchy. We
demonstrate that the presence of a black hole typically will not change the
minimum of the moduli potential in a substantial way. However, we also point
out a couple of possible loop-holes, which in some cases could lead to
interesting physical consequences such as changes in the hierarchy.
