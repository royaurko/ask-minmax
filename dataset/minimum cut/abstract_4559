The dense concentration of stars and high velocity dispersions in the
Galactic centre imply that stellar collisions frequently occur. Stellar
collisions could therefore result in significant mass loss rates. We calculate
the amount of stellar mass lost due to indirect and direct stellar collisions
and find its dependence on the present-day mass function of stars. We find that
the total mass loss rate in the Galactic centre due to stellar collisions is
sensitive to the present-day mass function adopted. We use the observed x-ray
luminosity in the Galactic centre to preclude any present-day mass functions
that result in mass loss rates $> 10^{-5} \mathrm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$ in the
vicinity of $\sim 1"$. For present-day mass functions of the form, $dN/dM
\propto M^{-\alpha}$, we constrain the present-day mass function to have a
minimum stellar mass $\lesssim 7\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and a power law slope
$\gtrsim 1.25$. We also use this result to constrain the initial mass function
in the Galactic centre by considering different star formation scenarios.
