Using transfer matrix and finite-size scaling methods, we study the
thermodynamic behavior of a lattice gas with two kinds of particles on the
square lattice. Only excluded volume interactions are considered, so that the
model is athermal. Large particles exclude the site they occupy and its four
first neighbors, while small particles exclude only their site. Two
thermodynamic phases are found: a disordered phase where large particles occupy
both sublattices with the same probability and an ordered phase where one of
the two sublattices is preferentially occupied by them. The transition between
these phases is continuous at small concentrations of the small particles and
discontinuous at larger concentrations, both transitions are separated by a
tricritical point. Estimates of the central charge suggest that the critical
line is in the Ising universality class, while the tricritical point has
tricritical Ising (Blume-Emery-Griffiths) exponents. The isobaric curves of the
total density as functions of the fugacity of small or large particles display
a minimum in the disordered phase.
