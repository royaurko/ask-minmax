The multiple point principle, according to which several vacuum states with
the same energy density exist, is put forward as a fine-tuning mechanism
predicting the exponentially huge ratio between the fundamental and weak scales
in the Standard Model (SM). Using renormalisation group equations for the SM,
we obtain the effective potential in the 2-loop approximation and investigate
the existence of its postulated second minimum at the fundamental scale. A
prediction is made of the existence of a new bound state of 6 top quarks and 6
anti-top quarks, formed due to Higgs boson exchanges between pairs of
quarks/anti-quarks. This bound state is supposed to condense in a new phase of
the SM vacuum. The existence of three vacuum states (new, weak and fundamental)
solves the hierarchy problem in the SM.
