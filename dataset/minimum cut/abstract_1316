We present a direct link between the minimum variability time scales
extracted through a wavelet decomposition and the rise times of the shortest
pulses extracted via fits of 34 Fermi GBM GRB light curves comprised of 379
pulses. Pulses used in this study were fitted with log-normal functions whereas
the wavelet technique used employs a multiresolution analysis that does not
rely on identifying distinct pulses. By applying a corrective filter to
published data fitted with pulses we demonstrate agreement between these two
independent techniques and offer a method for distinguishing signal from noise.
