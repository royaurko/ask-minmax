A proper vertex coloring of a graph is equitable if the sizes of color
classes differ by at most 1. The equitable chromatic number of a graph $G$,
denoted by $\chi_=(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ is equitably
$k$-colorable. The equitable chromatic threshold of a graph $G$, denoted by
$\chi_=^*(G)$, is the minimum $t$ such that $G$ is equitably $k$-colorable for
$k \ge t$. In this paper, we give the exact values of $\chi_=(K_{m_1,..., m_r}
\times K_n)$ and $\chi_=^*(K_{m_1,..., m_r} \times K_n)$ for $\sum_{i = 1}^r
m_i \leq n$.
