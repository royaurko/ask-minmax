The shocks of supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to accelerate particles
to cosmic ray (CR) energies. The amplification of the magnetic field due to CRs
propagating in the shock region is expected to have an impact on both the
emission from the accelerated particle population, as well as the acceleration
process itself. Using a 95 ks observation with the Advanced CCD Imaging
Spectrometer (ACIS) onboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we map and
characterize the synchrotron emitting material in the northwestern region of
RCW 86. We model spectra from several different regions, filamentary and
diffuse alike, where emission appears dominated by synchrotron radiation. The
fine spatial resolution of Chandra allows us to obtain accurate emission
profiles across 3 different non-thermal rims in this region. The narrow width
(l = 10''-30'') of these filaments constrains the minimum magnetic field
strength at the post-shock region to be approximately 80 {\mu}G.
