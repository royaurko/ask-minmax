Temperature-dependent inter-plane resistivity, $\rho_c(T)$, was measured
systematically as a function of transition metal substitution in the
iron-arsenide superconductors Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$T$_x$)$_2$As$_2$, $T$= Ni, Pd, Rh.
The data are compared with the behavior found in
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$, revealing resistive signatures of pseudogap. In
all compounds we find resistivity crossover at a characteristic pseudogap
temperature $T^*$ from non-metallic to metallic temperature dependence on
cooling. Suppression of $T^*$ proceeds very similar in cases of Ni and Pd
doping and much faster than in similar cases of Co and Rh doping. In cases of
Co and Rh doping an additional minimum in the temperature-dependent $\rho_c$
emerges for high dopings, when superconductivity is completely suppressed.
These features are consistent with the existence of a charge gap covering part
of the Fermi surface. The part of the Fermi surface affected by this gap is
notably larger for Ni and Pd doped compositions than in Co and Rh doped
compounds.
