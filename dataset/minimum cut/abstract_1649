Mechanical restoring forces acting on ferroelastic domain walls displaced
from the equilibrium positions in epitaxial films are calculated for various
modes of their cooperative translational oscillations. For vibrations of the
domain-wall superlattice with the wave vectors corresponding to the center and
boundaries of the first Brillouin zone, the soft modes are singled out that are
distinguished by a minimum magnitude of the restoring force. It is shown that,
in polydomain ferroelectric thin films, the soft modes of wall vibrations may
create enormously large contribution to the film permittivity.
