We detected a brown dwarf-mass companion around the intermediate-mass giant
star HD 119445 (G6III) using the Doppler technique. This discovery is the first
result from a Korean-Japanese planet search program based on precise radial
velocity measurements. The radial velocity of this star exhibits a periodic
Keplerian variation with a period, semi-amplitude and eccentricity of 410.2
days, 413.5 m/s and 0.082, respectively. Adopting a stellar mass of 3.9
M_solar, we were able to confirm the presence of a massive substellar companion
with a semimajor axis of 1.71 AU and a minimum mass of 37.6 M_Jup, which falls
in the middle of the brown dwarf-mass region. This substellar companion is the
most massive ever discovered within 3 AU of a central intermediate-mass star.
The host star also ranks among the most massive stars with substellar
companions ever detected by the Doppler technique. This result supports the
current view of substellar systems that more massive substellar companions tend
to exist around more massive stars, and may further constrain substellar system
formation mechanisms.
