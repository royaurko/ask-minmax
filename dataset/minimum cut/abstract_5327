A proper vertex coloring of a graph is said to be locally identifying if the
sets of colors in the closed neighborhood of any two adjacent non-twin vertices
are distinct. The lid-chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of
colors used by a locally identifying vertex-coloring. In this paper, we prove
that for any graph class of bounded expansion, the lid-chromatic number is
bounded. Classes of bounded expansion include minor closed classes of graphs.
For these latter classes, we give an alternative proof to show that the
lid-chromatic number is bounded. This leads to an explicit upper bound for the
lid-chromatic number of planar graphs. This answers in a positive way a
question of Esperet et al [L. Esperet, S. Gravier, M. Montassier, P. Ochem and
A. Parreau. Locally identifying coloring of graphs. Electronic Journal of
Combinatorics, 19(2), 2012.].
