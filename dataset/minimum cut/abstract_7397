We study cosmological $\alpha$-attractors in superconformal/supergravity
models, where $\alpha$ is related to the geometry of the moduli space. For
$\alpha=1$ attractors \cite{Kallosh:2013hoa} we present a generalization of the
previously known manifestly superconformal higher curvature supergravity model
\cite{Cecotti:1987sa}. The relevant standard 2-derivative supergravity with a
minimum of two chiral multiplets is shown to be dual to a 4-derivative higher
curvature supergravity, where in general one of the chiral superfields is
traded for a curvature superfield. There is a degenerate case when both matter
superfields become non-dynamical and there is only a chiral curvature
superfield, pure higher derivative supergravity. Generic $\alpha$-models
\cite{Kallosh:2013yoa} interpolate between the attractor point at $\alpha=0$
and generic chaotic inflation models at large $\alpha$, in the limit when the
inflaton moduli space becomes flat. They have higher derivative duals with the
same number of matter fields as the original theory or less, but at least one
matter multiplet remains. In the context of these models, the detection of
primordial gravity waves will provide information on the curvature of the
inflaton submanifold of the Kahler manifold, and we will learn if the inflaton
is a fundamental matter multiplet, or can be replaced by a higher derivative
curvature excitation.
