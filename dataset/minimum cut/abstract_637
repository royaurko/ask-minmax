We provide broadband dielectric loss spectra of glass-forming glycerol with
varying additions of LiCl. The measurements covering frequencies up to 10 THz
extend well into the region of the fast beta process, commonly ascribed to
caged molecule dynamics. Aside of the known variation of the structural alpha
relaxation time and a modification of the excess wing with ion content, we also
find a clear influence on the shallow loss minimum arising from the fast beta
relaxation. Within the framework of mode-coupling theory, the detected
significant broadening of this minimum is in reasonable accord with the found
variation of the alpha-relaxation dynamics. A correlation between
alpha-relaxation rate and minimum position holds for all ion concentrations and
temperatures, even below the critical temperature defined by mode-coupling
theory.
