We report the detection of a low-mass companion orbiting the solar-type star
HD178911B, the distant component of the stellar triple system HD178911. The
variability of HD178911B was first detected using radial-velocity measurements
obtained with the HIRES spectrograph mounted on the 10-m Keck1 telescope at the
W.M. Keck Observatory (Hawaii, USA). We then started an intense radial-velocity
follow up of the star with the ELODIE echelle spectrograph mounted on the
1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France) in order to
derive its orbital solution. The detected planet candidate has an orbital
period of 71.5 days and a minimum mass of 6.3 Jupiter masses. We performed a
spectral analysis of the star, which shows that the lithium abundances in the
system are similar to those in another known planet-hosting wide binary stellar
system, 16 Cyg. In both systems the lithium is undetected in the atmosphere of
the visual secondary harboring the planetary companion, but is easily detected
in the spectrum of the visual primary. We discuss this similarity and its
ramifications.
