Landauer argued that the process of erasing the information stored in a
memory device incurs an energy cost in the form of a minimum amount of
mechanical work. We find, however, that this energy cost can be reduced to zero
by paying a cost in angular momentum or any other conserved quantity. Erasing
the memory of Maxwell's demon in this way implies that work can be extracted
from a single thermal reservoir at a cost of angular momentum and an increase
in total entropy. The implications of this for the second law of thermodynamics
are assessed.
