We investigate, at both zero and finite temperature, the properties of
strangelets versus the electric charge Z and strangeness S. The strangelet
radius is not a monotonic function of either charge or strangeness, and a
minimum is reached in the (Z, S) plane. However, the thermodynamically stable
strangelets do not correspond to the radius minimum. The minimum radius always
appears at positive strangeness, while the stable radius may appear at negative
strangeness for very small baryon numbers. For large baryon numbers, the stable
radius is proportional to the cubic root of baryon numbers, but inversely
proportional to the square root of the confinement parameter in the present
model. If bulk strange quark matter is absolutely stable, the reduced size of
strangelets is about 1 fm, which may be relevant for the analysis of the
strangelet production and detection.
