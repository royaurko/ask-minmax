We apply a Bayesian "razor" to forecast Bayes factors between different
parameterizations of the galaxy cluster mass function. To demonstrate this
approach, we calculate the minimum size N-body simulation needed for strong
evidence favoring a two-parameter mass function over one-parameter mass
functions and visa versa, as a function of the minimum cluster mass.
