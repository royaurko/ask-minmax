In Aligned Natural Inflation, an alignment between different potential terms
produces an inflaton excursion greater than the axion scales in the potential.
We show that, starting from a general potential of two axions with two aligned
potential terms, the effective theory for the resulting light direction is
characterized by four parameters: an effective potential scale, an effective
axion constant, and two extra parameters (related to ratios of the axion scales
and the potential scales in the $2-$field theory). For all choices of these
extra parameters, the model can support inflation along valleys (in the
$2-$field space) that end in minima of the potential. This leads to a
phenomenology similar to that of single field Natural Inflation. For a
significant range of the extra two parameters, the model possesses also higher
altitude inflationary trajectories passing through saddle points of the
$2-$field potential, and disconnected from any minimum. These plateaus end when
the heavier direction becomes unstable, and therefore all of inflation takes
place close to the saddle point, where - due to the higher altitude - the
potential is flatter (smaller $\epsilon$ parameter). As a consequence, a
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = {\rm O } \left( 10^{-4} - 10^{-2} \right)$ can be
easily achieved in the allowed $n_s$ region, well within the latest $1 \sigma$
CMB contours.
