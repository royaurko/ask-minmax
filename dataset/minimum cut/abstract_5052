This paper presents comparison of Access Techniques used in Medium Access
Control (MAC) protocol for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). Comparison is
performed between Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division
Multiple Access (FDMA), Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
(CSMA/CA), Pure ALOHA and Slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA). Performance metrics used for
comparison are throughput (T), delay (D) and offered load (G). The main goal
for comparison is to show which technique gives highest Throughput and lowest
Delay with increase in Load. Energy efficiency is major issue in WBAN that is
why there is need to know which technique performs best for energy conservation
and also gives minimum delay.
