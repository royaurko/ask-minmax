In this paper, we investigate abstract homomorphism from the special linear
group over complete discrete valuation rings with finite residue field, such as
the ring of p-adic integers, into the general linear group over the reals. We
find the minimal dimension in which such a representation has infinite image.
For positive characteristic rings, this minimum is infinity.
