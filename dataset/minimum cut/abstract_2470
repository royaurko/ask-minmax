Salazar, Dunn and Graham in [Salazar et. al., 2006] presented an improved
Feng-Rao bound for the minimum distance of dual codes. In this work we take the
improvement a step further. Both the original bound by Salazar et. al., as well
as our improvement are lifted so that they deal with generalized Hamming
weights. We also demonstrate the advantage of working with one-way
well-behaving pairs rather than weakly well-behaving or well-behaving pairs.
