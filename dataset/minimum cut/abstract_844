We provide a rationale for the Planck scale being the minimum scale in the
universe, as also its specific numerical values. In the process we answer the
question of why the Planck scale is $10^{20}$ times the Compton scale of
elementary particles. These considerations show how the Planck scale provides
an underpinning for space time.
