We construct a binomial model for a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit
(GMWB) rider to a variable annuity (VA) under optimal policyholder behaviour.
The binomial model results in explicitly formulated perfect hedging strategies
funded using only periodic fee income. We consider the separate perspectives of
the insurer and policyholder and introduce a unifying relationship.
Decompositions of the VA and GMWB contract into term-certain payments and
options representing the guarantee and early surrender features similar to
those presented in Hyndman and Wenger (Insurance Math. Econom. 55:283-290,
2014) are extended to the binomial framework. We incorporate an approximation
algorithm for Asian options that significantly improves efficiency of the
binomial model while retaining accuracy. Several numerical examples are
provided which illustrate both the accuracy and the tractability of the model.
