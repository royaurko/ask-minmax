We report the discovery of a planetary system around HD9446, performed from
radial velocity measurements secured with the spectrograph SOPHIE at the 193-cm
telescope of the Haute-Provence Observatory during more than two years. At
least two planets orbit this G5V, active star: HD9446b has a minimum mass of
0.7 M_Jup and a slightly eccentric orbit with a period of 30 days, whereas
HD9446c has a minimum mass of 1.8 M_Jup and a circular orbit with a period of
193 days. As for most of the known multi-planet systems, the HD9446-system
presents a hierarchical disposition, with a massive outer planet and a lighter
inner planet.
