Continuing the project described by Kato et al. (2009, arXiv:0905.1757), we
collected times of superhump maxima for 102 SU UMa-type dwarf novae observed
mainly during the 2014-2015 season and characterized these objects. Our project
has greatly improved the statistics of the distribution of orbital periods,
which is a good approximation of the distribution of cataclysmic variables at
the terminal evolutionary stage, and confirmed the presence of a period minimum
at a period of 0.053 d and a period spike just above this period. The number
density monotonically decreased toward the longer period and there was no
strong indication of a period gap. We detected possible negative superhumps in
Z Cha. It is possible that normal outbursts are also suppressed by the presence
of a disk tilt in this system. There was no indication of enhanced orbital
humps just preceding the superoutburst, and this result favors the
thermal-tidal disk instability as the origin of superoutbursts. We detected
superhumps in three AM CVn-type dwarf novae. Our observations and recent other
detections suggest that 8% of objects showing dwarf nova-type outbursts are AM
CVn-type objects. AM CVn-type objects and EI Psc-type object may be more
abundant than previously recognized. OT J213806, a WZ Sge-type object,
exhibited a remarkably different feature between the 2010 and 2014
superoutbursts. Although the 2014 superoutburst was much fainter the plateau
phase was shorter than the 2010 one, the course of the rebrightening phase was
similar. This object indicates that the O-C diagrams of superhumps can be
indeed variable at least in WZ Sge-type objects. Four deeply eclipsing SU
UMa-type dwarf novae (ASASSN-13cx, ASASSN-14ag, ASASSN-15bu, NSV 4618) were
identified. We studied long-term trends in supercycles in MM Hya and CY UMa and
found systematic variations of supercycles of ~20%.
