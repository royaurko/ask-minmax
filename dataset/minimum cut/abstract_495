Given a binary nonlinear code, we provide a deterministic algorithm to
compute its weight and distance distribution, and in particular its minimum
weight and its minimum distance, which takes advantage of fast Fourier
techniques. This algorithm's performance is similar to that of best-known
algorithms for the average case, while it is especially efficient for codes
with low information rate. We provide complexity estimates for several cases of
interest.
