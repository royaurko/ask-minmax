Variation of intensity of the flux at the cores of large features and
spectral lines of the classical magnetic CP star alpha2 CVn in the ultraviolet
spectral region from 1150 to 3200 A is investigated. This study is based on the
archival International Ultraviolet Explorer data obtained at different phases
of the rotational cycle. The shapes of two light curves at \lambda \lambda 1375
and 1415 A at the core of large feature at \lambda 1400 A curves significantly
differ. The light curve at \lambda 1375 A show similar shape as in the
'pseudo-continuum'. The same behavior of the flux is at the cores of Si II
resonance lines at \lambda \lambda 1260--64 and 1485 A. While, the light curve
at \lambda 1415 A show the phase displacement of minimum of the flux. The phase
displacement also is presented at the cores of Si II resonance lines at \lambda
\lambda 1304--09 and 1485 A. The minimal values of the amplitude of the flux
variations are reached at the cores of the large features at \lambda \lambda
1560 and 1770 A and at the cores of the strong Si II resonance lines. The flux
at the cores of large feature at \lambda 1770 A and Fe II resonance line at
\lambda 1725--31 A, within errors measurements, does not vary. The
investigation of variability of the flux in the wings of Lyman-alpha line
indicate that the fluxes, which formed in inner layers of atmosphere, are
redistributed into outer layers of atmosphere of alpha2 CVn.
