The uniaxial pressure dependences of the exchange coupling and the structural
distortion in the dimerized phase of CuGeO$_3$ are analyzed. A minimum magnetic
dimerization of 3 % is obtained, incompatible with an adiabatic approach to the
spin-Peierls transition. Exploring the properties of an Heisenberg spin chain
with dynamical spin-phonon coupling, the dimerization dependence of the spin
excitation gap is found to be in qualitative agreement with experiment.
