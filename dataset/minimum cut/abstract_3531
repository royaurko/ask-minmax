We consider solutions where the surface tension of the solvent is smaller
than the surface tension of the polymer. In an evaporating film, a plume of
solvent rich fluid, then induces a local depression in surface tension, and the
surface forces tend to strengthen the plume. We give an estimate (at the level
of scaling laws) for the minimum thickness required to obtain this instability.
We predict that the thickness a) is a decreasing function of the solvent vapor
pressure b) should be very small (<1 micron) provided that the initial solution
is rather dilute. The overall evaporation time for the film should be much
longer than the growth time of the instability. The instability should lead to
distortions of the free surface and may be optically observable. It should
dominate over the classical Bernard-Marangoni instability induced by cooling.
