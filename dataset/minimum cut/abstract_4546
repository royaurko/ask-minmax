Imperfections change essentially the electronic transport properties of
graphene. Motivated by a recent experiment reporting on the possible
application of graphene as junctions, we study transport properties in
graphene-based junctions with single localized defect. We solve the
Dirac-Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equation with a single localized defect
superconductor-normal(graphene)-superconductor (SNS) junction. We consider the
properties of tunneling conductance and Josephson current through an undoped
strip of graphene with heavily doped s-wave superconducting electrodes in the
dirty limit. We find that spectrum of Andreev bound states are modified in the
presence of single localized defect in the bulk and the minimum tunneling
conductance remains the same. The Josephson junction exhibits sign
oscillations.
