The prospects for accomplishing X-ray polarization measurements appear to
have grown in recent years after a more than 35-year hiatus. Unfortunately,
this long hiatus has brought with it some confusion over the statistical
uncertainties associated with polarization measurements of astronomical
sources. The heart of this confusion stems from a misunderstanding (or
potential misunderstanding) of a standard figure of merit-the minimum
detectable polarization (MDP)-that one of us introduced many years ago. We
review the relevant statistics, and quantify the differences between the MDP
and the uncertainty of an actual polarization measurement. We discuss the
implications for future missions.
