In many statistical problems, stochastic signals can be represented as a
sequence of noisy wavelet coefficients. In this paper, we develop general
empirical Bayes methods for the estimation of true signal. Our estimators
approximate certain oracle separable rules and achieve adaptation to ideal
risks and exact minimax risks in broad collections of classes of signals. In
particular, our estimators are uniformly adaptive to the minimum risk of
separable estimators and the exact minimax risks simultaneously in Besov balls
of all smoothness and shape indices, and they are uniformly superefficient in
convergence rates in all compact sets in Besov spaces with a finite secondary
shape parameter. Furthermore, in classes nested between Besov balls of the same
smoothness index, our estimators dominate threshold and James-Stein estimators
within an infinitesimal fraction of the minimax risks. More general block
empirical Bayes estimators are developed. Both white noise with drift and
nonparametric regression are considered.
