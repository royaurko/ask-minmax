We apply optimization algorithms to the problem of finding ground states for
crystalline surfaces and flux lines arrays in presence of disorder. The
algorithms provide ground states in polynomial time, which provides for a more
precise study of the interface widths than from Monte Carlo simulations at
finite temperature. Using $d=2$ systems up to size $420^2$, with a minimum of
$2 \times 10^3$ realizations at each size, we find very strong evidence for a
$\ln^2(L)$ super-rough state at low temperatures.
