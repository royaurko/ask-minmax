The present study concerns the numerical modeling of sea-wave instability
under the effect of logarithmic-wind profile in hurricane conditions. The
central point of the study is the calculation of the wave growth rate, which is
proportional to the fractional input energy from the weakly-sheared
(logarithmic) wind to the wave exponentially varying with time. It is shown for
hurricane conditions that the Miles-type stability model based on the
Charnock's formula with the standard constant coefficient underestimates the
growth rate ~5 to 50 times as compared with the model employing the roughness
adopted from experimental data for hurricane winds. The drag reduction with
wind speed at hurricane conditions coupled with the similar behavior of the
dimensionless gravity acceleration, leads to the minimum in the maximal growth
rate and the maximum in the most unstable wavelength.
