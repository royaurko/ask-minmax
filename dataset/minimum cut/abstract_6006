Droplet formation of suspensions is present in many industrial and
technological processes such as coating and food engineering. Whilst the finite
time singularity of the minimum neck diameter in capillary break-up of simple
liquids can be described by well known self-similarity solutions, the pinching
of non-Brownian suspension depends in a complex way on the particle dynamics in
the thinning thread. Here we focus on the very dilute regime where the filament
contains only isolated beads to identify the physical mechanisms leading to the
pronounced acceleration of the filament thinning observed. This accelerated
regime is characterized by an asymmetric shape of the filament with an enhanced
curvature that depends on the size and the spatial distribution of the
particles within the capillary thread.
