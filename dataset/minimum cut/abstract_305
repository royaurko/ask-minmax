We report the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the resistivity of the heavy
fermion Kondo lattice compound Yb$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ in the temperature range
2-300 K and in pressures upto 10 Kbar. At ambient pressure the resistivity
shows a prominent Kondo effect. The Kondo minimum shifts from 22.5 K at ambient
pressure to 19.2 K at a pressure of 10 Kbar. The depth of the Kondo minimum
also progressively decreases with pressure. These results suggest a possible
weakening of the Kondo effect with the application of pressure.
