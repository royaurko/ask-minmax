The hybrid form is a combination of the Rydberg potential and the London
inverse-sixth-power energy. It is accurate at all relevant distance scales and
simple enough for use in all-atom simulations of biomolecules. One may compute
the parameters of the hybrid potential for the ground state of a pair of
neutral atoms from their internuclear separation, the depth and curvature of
their potential at its minimum, and from their van der Waals coefficient of
dispersion.
