A graph G is called (2k, k)-connected if G is 2k-edge-connected and G-v is
k-edge-connected for every vertex v. The study of (2k, k)-connected graphs is
motivated by a conjecture of Frank which states that a graph has a
2-vertex-connected orientation if and only if it is (4, 2)-connected. In this
paper, we provide a construction of the family of (2k, k)-connected graphs for
k even which generalizes the construction given by Jord\'an for k = 2. We also
solve the corresponding connectivity augmentation problem: given a graph G and
an integer k \geq 2, what is the minimum number of edges to be added to make G
(2k, k)-connected. Both these results are based on a new splitting-off theorem
for (2k, k)-connected graphs.
