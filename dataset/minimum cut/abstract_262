Apriori Algorithm is one of the most important algorithm which is used to
extract frequent itemsets from large database and get the association rule for
discovering the knowledge. It basically requires two important things: minimum
support and minimum confidence. First, we check whether the items are greater
than or equal to the minimum support and we find the frequent itemsets
respectively. Secondly, the minimum confidence constraint is used to form
association rules. Based on this algorithm, this paper indicates the limitation
of the original Apriori algorithm of wasting time and space for scanning the
whole database searching on the frequent itemsets, and present an improvement
on Apriori.
