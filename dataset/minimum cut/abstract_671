The effective potential of the Higgs scalar field in the Standard Model may
have a second degenerate minimum at an ultrahigh vacuum expectation value. This
second minimum then determines, by radiative corrections, the values of the
top-quark and Higgs-boson masses at the standard minimum corresponding to the
electroweak energy scale. An argument is presented that this ultrahigh vacuum
expectation value is proportional to the energy scale of gravity, E_{Planck}
\equiv \sqrt{\hbar c^5/G_N}, considered to be characteristic of a spacetime
foam. In the context of a simple model, the existence of kink-type wormhole
solutions places a lower bound on the ultrahigh vacuum expectation value and
this lower bound is of the order of E_{Planck}.
