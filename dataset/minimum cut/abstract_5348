A generic expression of double-parton scattering cross sections in
high-energy nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions is derived as a function of the
corresponding single-parton hard cross sections and of the A-A event
centrality. We consider the case of prompt-J/psi production in lead-lead
(Pb-Pb) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and find that about 20% (35%) of the
J/psi events in minimum-bias (most central) collisions contain a second J/psi
from double parton interactions. In Pb-Pb at 5.5 TeV, in the absence of
final-state effects, about 240 double-J/psi events are expected per unit
midrapidity and per inverse-nanobarn in the dilepton decay modes. The
implications of double-J/psi production on the interpretation of the observed
J/psi suppression in A-A collisions are discussed.
