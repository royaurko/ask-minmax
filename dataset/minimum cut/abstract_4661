We have used scanning tunneling spectroscopy to investigate short-length
electronic correlations in three-layer Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O(10+d) (Bi-2223). We show
that the superconducting gap and the energy Omega_dip, defined as the
difference between the dip minimum and the gap, are both modulated in space
following the lattice superstructure, and are locally anti-correlated. Based on
fits of our data to a microscopic strong-coupling model we show that Omega_dip
is an accurate measure of the collective mode energy in Bi-2223. We conclude
that the collective mode responsible for the dip is a local excitation with a
doping dependent energy, and is most likely the (pi,pi) spin resonance.
