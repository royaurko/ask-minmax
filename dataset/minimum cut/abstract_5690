The Euler-Lagrange equation of the phase-field crystal (PFC) model has been
solved under appropriate boundary conditions to obtain the equilibrium free
energy of the body centered cubic crystal-liquid interface for 18 orientations
at various reduced temperatures in the range $\epsilon\in\left[0,0.5\right]$.
While the maximum free energy corresponds to the $\left\{ 100\right\} $
orientation for all $\epsilon$ values, the minimum is realized by the $\left\{
111\right\} $ direction for small $\epsilon\,(<0.13)$, and by the $\left\{
211\right\} $ orientation for higher $\epsilon$. The predicted dependence on
the reduced temperature is consistent with the respective mean field critical
exponent. The results are fitted with an eight-term Kubic harmonic series, and
are used to create stereographic plots displaying the anisotropy of the
interface free energy. We have also derived the corresponding Wulff shapes that
vary with increasing $\epsilon$ from sphere to a polyhedral form that differs
from the rhombo-dodecahedron obtained previously by growing a bcc seed until
reaching equilibrium with the remaining liquid.
