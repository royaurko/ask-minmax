We study cardinal auctions for selling multiple copies of a good, in which
bidders specify not only their bid or how much they are ready to pay for the
good, but also a cardinality constraint on the number of copies that will be
sold via the auction. We perform first known Price of Anarchy type analyses
with detailed comparison of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction
and one based on minimum pay property (MPP) which is similar to Generalized
Second Price auction commonly used in sponsored search. Without cardinality
constraints, MPP has the same efficiency (total value to bidders) and at least
as much revenue (total income to the auctioneer) as VCG; this also holds for
certain other generalizations of MPP (e.g., prefix constrained auctions, as we
show here). In contrast, our main results are that, with cardinality
constraints, (a) equilibrium efficiency of MPP is 1/2 of that of VCG and this
factor is tight, and (b) in equilibrium MPP may collect as little as 1/2 the
revenue of VCG. These aspects arise because in presence of cardinality
constraints, more strategies are available to bidders in MPP, including bidding
above their value, and this makes analyses nontrivial.
