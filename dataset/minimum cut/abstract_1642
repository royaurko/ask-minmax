We investigate the stationary states of one-dimensional driven diffusive
systems, coupled to boundary reservoirs with fixed particle densities. We argue
that the generic phase diagram is governed by an extremal principle for the
macroscopic current irrespective of the local dynamics. In particular, we
predict a minimal current phase for systems with local minimum in the
current--density relation. This phase is explained by a dynamical phenomenon,
the branching and coalescence of shocks, Monte-Carlo simulations confirm the
theoretical scenario.
