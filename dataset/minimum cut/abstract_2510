In the limit $\hbar\to 0$, we analyze a class of Schr\"odinger operators
$H_\hbar = \hbar^2 L + \hbar W + V\cdot \mathrm{id}_\Eh$ acting on sections of
a vector bundle $\Eh$ over a Riemannian manifold $M$ where $L$ is a Laplace
type operator, $W$ is an endomorphism field and the potential energy $V$ has a
non-degenerate minimum at some point $p\in M$. We construct quasimodes of
WKB-type near $p$ for eigenfunctions associated with the low lying eigenvalues
of $H_\hbar$. These are obtained from eigenfunctions of the associated harmonic
oscillator $H_{p, \hbar}$ at $p$, acting on $C^\infty (T_pM, \Eh_p)$.
