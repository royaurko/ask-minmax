The STAR collaboration presents for the first time two-dimensional di-hadron
correlations with identified leading hadrons in 200 GeV central Au+Au and
minimum-bias d+Au collisions to explore hadronization mechanisms in the quark
gluon plasma. The enhancement of the jet-like yield for leading pions in Au+Au
data with respect to the d+Au reference and the absence of such an enhancement
for leading non-pions (protons and kaons) are discussed within the context of a
quark recombination scenario. The correlated yield at large angles,
specifically in the \emph{ridge region}, is found to be significantly higher
for leading non-pions than pions. The consistencies of the constituent quark
scaling, azimuthal harmonic model and a mini-jet modification model description
of the data are tested, providing further constraints on hadronization.
