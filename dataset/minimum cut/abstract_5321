We estimate the minimum number of vertices of a cubic graph with given
oddness and cyclic connectivity. We prove that a bridgeless cubic graph $G$
with oddness $\omega(G)$ other than the Petersen graph has at least
$5.41\cdot\omega(G)$ vertices, and for each integer $k$ with $2\le k\le 6$ we
construct an infinite family of cubic graphs with cyclic connectivity $k$ and
small oddness ratio $|V(G)|/\omega(G)$. In particular, for cyclic connectivity
2, 4, 5, and 6 we improve the upper bounds on the oddness ratio of snarks to
7.5, 13, 25, and 99 from the known values 9, 15, 76, and 118, respectively. In
addition, we construct a cyclically 4-connected snark of girth 5 with oddness 4
on 44 vertices, improving the best previous value of 46.
