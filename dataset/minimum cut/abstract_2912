New photometric observations of the hierarchical eclipsing TY CrA system were
taken in the optical with VYSOS6 and in the near-IR with SOFI and REMIR. They
are the first observations showing the deep eclipse minimum of the pre-main
sequence secondary in the near-IR. For the first time, the secondary minimum
can be reliably used in the calculation of the O-C diagram of TY CrA. By now,
the O-C diagram can be studied on a time basis of about two decades. We
confirm, that the O-C diagram cannot be explained by the spectroscopic
tertiary. For the first time, the light curve of the inner eclipsing binary is
analysed in both optical and near-IR bands simultaneously. In combination with
already published spectroscopic elements, precise absolute dimensions and
masses of the primary and the secondary component are obtained using the ROCHE
code. The inclusion of the near-IR data puts strong constraints on the third
light which is composed of the reflection nebula, the spectroscopic tertiary
and a visual fourth component. The absolute parameters of the inner eclipsing
binary agree very well with previous work except of the primary radius
(1.46+/-0.15 Rsun) and luminosity (40+/-10 Lsun) which are clearly smaller.
While the parameters of the secondary are well understood when assuming an age
of about 3-5 Myrs, the primary seems considerably undersized. Low metallicity
cannot explain the parameters of the primary.
