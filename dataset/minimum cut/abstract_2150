One-point codes on the Hermitian curve produce long codes with excellent
parameters. Feng and Rao introduced a modified construction that improves the
parameters while still using one-point divisors. A separate improvement of the
parameters was introduced by Matthews considering the classical construction
but with two-point divisors. Those two approaches are combined to describe an
elementary construction of two-point improved codes. Upon analysis of their
minimum distance and redundancy, it is observed that they improve on the
previous constructions for a large range of designed distances.
