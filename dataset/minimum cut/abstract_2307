In this paper we introduce the space-fractional Poisson process whose state
probabilities $p_k^\alpha(t)$, $t>0$, $\alpha \in (0,1]$, are governed by the
equations $(\mathrm d/\mathrm dt)p_k(t) = -\lambda^\alpha (1-B)p_k^\alpha(t)$,
where $(1-B)^\alpha$ is the fractional difference operator found in the study
of time series analysis. We explicitly obtain the distributions
$p_k^\alpha(t)$, the probability generating functions $G_\alpha(u,t)$, which
are also expressed as distributions of the minimum of i.i.d.\ uniform random
variables. The comparison with the time-fractional Poisson process is
investigated and finally, we arrive at the more general space-time fractional
Poisson process of which we give the explicit distribution.
