We construct non-minimal GUT local models in the F-theory configuration. The
gauge group on the bulk G_S is one rank higher than the GUT gauge group. The
line bundles on the curves are non-trivial to break G_S down to the GUT gauge
groups. We demonstrate examples of SU(5) GUT from G_S=SU(6) and G_S=SO(10), the
flipped SU(5) from G_S=SO(10), and the SO(10) GUT from G_S=SO(12) and G_S=E_6.
We obtain complete GUT matter spectra and couplings, with minimum exotic matter
contents. GUT gauge group breaking to MSSM is achievable by instanton
configurations.
