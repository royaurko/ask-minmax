Long BGO (Bismuth Germanate) and BSO (Bismuth Silicate) crystals coupled with
silicon photodiodes have been used to detect minimum-ionizing particles(MIP).
With a low noise amplifier customized for this purpose, the crystals can detect
MIPs with an excellent signal-to-noise ratio. The NCE(Nuclear Counter Effect}
is also clearly observed and measured. Effect of full and partial wrapping of a
reflector around the crystal on light collection is also studied.
