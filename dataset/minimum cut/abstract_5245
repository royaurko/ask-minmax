The fundamental instability responsible for the shear localization which
results in shear bands in amorphous solids remains unknown despite enormous
amount of research, both experimental and theoretical. As this is the main
mechanism for the failure of metallic glasses, understanding the instability is
invaluable in finding how to stabilize such materials against the tendency to
shear localize. In this Letter we explain the mechanism for shear localization
under shear, which is the appearance of highly correlated lines of Eshelby-like
quadrupolar singularities which organize the non-affine plastic flow of the
amorphous solid into a shear band. We prove analytically that such highly
correlated solutions in which $\C N$ quadrupoles are aligned with equal
orientations are minimum energy states when the strain is high enough. The line
lies at 45 degrees to the compressive stress.
