We have observed a high-mass protobinary system in the hot core W3(H2O) with
the BIMA Array. Our continuum maps at wavelengths of 1.4mm and 2.8mm both
achieve sub-arcsecond angular resolutions and show a double-peaked morphology.
The angular separation of the two sources is 1.19" corresponding to 2.43X10^3
AU at the source distance of 2.04 kpc. The flux densities of the two sources at
1.4mm and 2.8mm have a spectral index of 3, translating to an opacity law of
kappa ~ nu. The small spectral indices suggest that grain growth has begun in
the hot core. We have also observed 5 K components of the CH3CN (12-11)
transitions. A radial velocity difference of 2.81 km/s is found towards the two
continuum peaks. Interpreting these two sources as binary components in orbit
about one another, we find a minimum mass of 22 Msun for the system. Radiative
transfer models are constructed to explain both the continuum and methyl
cyanide line observations of each source. Power-law distributions of both
density and temperature are derived. Density distributions close to the
free-fall value, r^-1.5, are found for both components, suggesting continuing
accretion. The derived luminosities suggest the two sources have equivalent
zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) spectral type B0.5 - B0. The nebular masses
derived from the continuum observations are about 5 Msun for source A and 4
Msun for source C. A velocity gradient previously detected may be explained by
unresolved binary rotation with a small velocity difference.
