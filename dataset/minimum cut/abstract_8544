We present azimuthal angular correlations between charged hadrons and energy
deposited in calorimeter towers in central $d$$+$Au and minimum bias $p$$+$$p$
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV. The charged hadron is measured at
midrapidity $|\eta|<0.35$, and the energy is measured at large rapidity
($-3.7<\eta<-3.1$, Au-going direction). An enhanced near-side angular
correlation across $|\Delta\eta| >$ 2.75 is observed in $d$$+$Au collisions.
Using the event plane method applied to the Au-going energy distribution, we
extract the anisotropy strength $v_2$ for inclusive charged hadrons at
midrapidity up to $p_T=4.5$ GeV/$c$. We also present the measurement of $v_2$
for identified $\pi^{\pm}$ and (anti)protons in central $d$$+$Au collisions,
and observe a mass-ordering pattern similar to that seen in heavy ion
collisions. These results are compared with viscous hydrodynamic calculations
and measurements from $p$$+$Pb at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. The magnitude of
the mass-ordering in $d$$+$Au is found to be smaller than that in $p$$+$Pb
collisions, which may indicate smaller radial flow in lower energy $d$$+$Au
collisions.
