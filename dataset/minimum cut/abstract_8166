We present a detailed study of the X-ray, optical and radio emission from the
jet, lobes and core of the quasar PKS 2101-490 as revealed by new Chandra, HST
and ATCA images. We extract the radio to X-ray spectral energy distributions
from seven regions of the 13 arcsecond jet, and model the jet X-ray emission in
terms of Doppler beamed inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave
background (IC/CMB) for a jet in a state of equipartition between particle and
magnetic field energy densities. This model implies that the jet remains highly
relativistic hundreds of kpc from the nucleus, with a bulk Lorentz factor Gamma
~ 6 and magnetic field of order 30 microGauss. We detect an apparent radiative
cooling break in the synchrotron spectrum of one of the jet knots, and are able
to interpret this in terms of a standard one-zone continuous injection model,
based on jet parameters derived from the IC/CMB model. However, we note
apparent substructure in the bright optical knot in one of the HST bands. We
confront the IC/CMB model with independent estimates of the jet power, and find
that the IC/CMB model jet power is consistent with the independent estimates,
provided that the minimum electron Lorentz factor gamma_min > 50, and the knots
are significantly longer than the jet width, as implied by de-projection of the
observed knot lengths.
