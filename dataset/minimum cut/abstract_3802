The decay of disoriented chiral condensates into soft pions is considered
within the context of a linear sigma model. Unlike earlier analytic studies,
which focused on the production of pions as the sigma field rolled down toward
its new equilibrium value, here we focus on the amplification of
long-wavelength pion modes due to parametric resonance as the sigma field
oscillates around the minimum of its potential. This process can create larger
domains of pion fluctuations than the usual spinodal decomposition process, and
hence may provide a viable experimental signature for chiral symmetry breaking
in relativistic heavy ion collisions; it may also better explain physically the
large growth of domains found in several numerical simulations.
