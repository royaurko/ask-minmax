Brownian particles in random potentials show an extended regime of
subdiffusive dynamics at intermediate times. The asymptotic diffusive behavior
is often established at very long times and thus cannot be accessed in
experiments or simulations. For the case of one-dimensional random potentials
with Gaussian distributed energies, we present a detailed analysis of
experimental and simulation data. It is shown that the asymptotic long-time
diffusion coefficient can be related to the behavior at intermediate times,
namely the minimum of the exponent that characterizes subdiffusion and hence
corresponds to the maximum degree of subdiffusion. As a consequence,
investigating only the dynamics at intermediate times is sufficient to predict
the order of magnitude of the long-time diffusion coefficient and the timescale
at which the crossover from subdiffusion to diffusion occurs, i.e. when the
long-time diffusive regime and hence thermal equilibrium is established.
