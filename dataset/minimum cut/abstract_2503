The equipartition or minimum-energy calculation is a well-known procedure for
estimating magnetic field strength and total energy in the magnetic field and
cosmic ray particles by using only the radio synchrotron emission. In one of
our previous papers we have offered a modified equipartition calculation for
supernova remnants (SNRs) with spectral indices 0.5<\alpha <1. Here we extend
the analysis to SNRs with \alpha =0.5 and \alpha =1.
