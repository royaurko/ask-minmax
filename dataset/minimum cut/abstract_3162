We have obtained infrared spectra of the star suggested to be the counterpart
of the soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) 1806-20. We found strong emission lines
similar to those seen in the spectra of the rare Luminous Blue Variables and
B[e] stars. A He I absorption line is also seen, from which we infer a spectral
type O9--B2. This classification, in combination with the minimum distance of
$\simgt6$ kpc inferred from its extinction, makes the star one of the most
luminous in the Galaxy. We infer that it is a companion to SGR 1806-20, and
suggest that the presence of a companion is somehow related to the SGR
phenomenon.
