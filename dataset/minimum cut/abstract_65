It has recently been observed that there are no disc galaxies with masses
less than 10^9 M_solar and this cutoff has not been explained. It is shown here
that this minimum mass can be predicted using a model that assumes that 1)
inertia is due to Unruh radiation, and 2) this radiation is subject to a
Hubble-scale Casimir effect. The model predicts that as the acceleration of an
object decreases, its inertial mass eventually decreases even faster
stabilising the acceleration at a minimum value, which is close to the observed
cosmic acceleration. When applied to rotating disc galaxies the same model
predicts that they have a minimum rotational acceleration, ie: a minimum
apparent mass of 1.1x10^9 M_solar, close to the observed minimum mass. The
Hubble mass can also be predicted. It is suggested that assumption 1 above
could be tested using a cyclotron to accelerate particles until the Unruh
radiation they see is short enough to be supplemented by manmade radiation. The
increase in inertia may be detectable.
