Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (EGB) provides a natural higher dimensional and
higher order curvature generalization of Einstein gravity. It contains a new,
presumably microscopic, length scale that should affect short distance
properties of the dynamics, such as Choptuik scaling. We present the results of
a numerical analysis in generalized flat slice co-ordinates of self-gravitating
massless scalar spherical collapse in five and six dimensional EGB gravity near
the threshold of black hole formation. Remarkably, the behaviour is universal
(i.e. independent of initial data) but qualitatively different in five and six
dimensions. In five dimensions there is a minimum horizon radius, suggestive of
a first order transition between black hole and dispersive initial data. In six
dimensions no radius gap is evident. Instead, below the GB scale there is a
change in the critical exponent and echoing period.
