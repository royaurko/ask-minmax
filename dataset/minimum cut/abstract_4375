It has been recently found that a number of systems displaying crackling
noise also show a remarkable behavior regarding the temporal occurrence of
successive events versus their size: a scaling law for the probability
distributions of waiting times as a function of a minimum size is fulfilled,
signaling the existence on those systems of self-similarity in time-size. This
property is also present in some non-crackling systems. Here, the uncommon
character of the scaling law is illustrated with simple marked renewal
processes, built by definition with no correlations. Whereas processes with a
finite mean waiting time do not fulfill a scaling law in general and tend
towards a Poisson process in the limit of very high sizes, processes without a
finite mean tend to another class of distributions, characterized by double
power-law waiting-time densities. This is somehow reminiscent of the
generalized central limit theorem. A model with short-range correlations is not
able to escape from the attraction of those limit distributions. A discussion
on open problems in the modeling of these properties is provided.
