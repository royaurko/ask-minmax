We present the results of a study performed on the interactions of 10.6A GeV
gold nuclei in nuclear emulsions. In a minimum bias sample of 1311 interac-
tions, 5260 helium nuclei and 2622 heavy fragments were observed as Au projec-
tile fragments. The experimental data are analyzed with particular emphasis of
target separation interactions in emulsions and study of criticalexponents.
Multiplicity distributions of the fast-moving projectile fragments are inves-
tigated. Charged fragment moments, conditional moments as well as two and three
-body asymmetries of the fast moving projectile particles are determined in
terms of the total charge remaining bound in the multiply charged projectile
fragments. Some differences in the average yields of helium nuclei and heavier
fragments are observed, which may be attributed to a target effect. However,
two and three-body asymmetries and conditional moments indicate that the
breakup mechanism of the projectile seems to be independent of target mass. We
looked for evidence of critical point observable in finite nuclei by study the
resulting charged fragments distributions. We have obtained the values for the
critical exponents gamma, beta and tau and compare our results with those at
lower energy experiment (1.0A GeV data). The values suggest that a phase
transition like behavior, is observed.
