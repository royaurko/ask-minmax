The D-brane world is an idea that we are living on the D-brane imbedded in a
10- or 11-dimensional spacetime of string theories, aiming at the construction
of realistic models from string theories. We investigate the cosmological
aspects of the D-brane world, focusing on homogeneous anisotropic cosmology
driven by the dilaton and the NS-NS 2-form field which becomes massive in the
presence of the D-brane. The dilaton possesses the potential due to the
presence of the D-brane, various form field fluxes, and the curvature of extra
dimensions. In the absence of stabilizing potential, we found the attractor
solutions for this system which show the overall features of general solutions.
In the presence of the non-vanishing NS-NS 2-form field, the homogeneous
universe expands anisotropically while the D-brane term dominates. The isotropy
is recovered as the dilaton rolls down and the curvature term dominates. With
the stabilizing potential for the dilaton, the anisotropy developed by the
initial NS-NS 2-form field flux is erased as the NS-NS 2-form field begins to
oscillate around the minimum, forming the B-matter, and the isotropic
matter-dominated universe is obtained.
