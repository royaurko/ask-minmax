In CuCl bulk crystal negatively charged excitons (trions $X^-$) can be
induced by the resonant optical excitation of extra electrons in conduction
band minimum. In the case of light polarization and due to the top valence band
structure of CuCl only the electrons with spin antiparallel to the direction of
the light propagation contribute to the formation of $X^-$, while the emerging
$X^-$ can recombine into both possible electron states, with spin parallel and
antiparallel to the direction of light propagation. We propose to use this
mechanism for optical electronic spin pumping. We describe the dynamics of
pumping in terms of density matrix formalism. The coherent pumping laser pulse
propagating through the sample is described by Maxwell wave equation coupled to
the density matrix evolution equations. The results of our approximate simple
model calculations suggest that spin polarization close to 100% can be achieved
in time shorter than 100ps.
