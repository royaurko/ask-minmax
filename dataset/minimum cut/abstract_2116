We find nonperturbative solutions of a nonlocal scalar field equation, with
cubic or exponential potential on a cosmological background. The former case
corresponds to the lowest level effective tachyon action of cubic string field
theory. While the well known Minkowski solution is wildly oscillating, due to
Hubble friction its cosmological counterpart describes smooth rolling towards
the local minimum of the potential.
