In this paper, the minimum distance distribution of irregular generalized
LDPC (GLDPC) code ensembles is investigated. Two classes of GLDPC code
ensembles are analyzed; in one case, the Tanner graph is regular from the
variable node perspective, and in the other case the Tanner graph is completely
unstructured and irregular. In particular, for the former ensemble class we
determine exactly which ensembles have minimum distance growing linearly with
the block length with probability approaching unity with increasing block
length. This work extends previous results concerning LDPC and regular GLDPC
codes to the case where a hybrid mixture of check node types is used.
