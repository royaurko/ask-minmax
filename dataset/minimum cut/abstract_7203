We present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova
CSS100603:112253-111037. Its optical spectrum is rich in helium, with broad,
double-peaked emission lines produced in an accretion disc. We measure a line
flux ratio HeI5876/H_alpha = 1.49 +/- 0.04, a much higher ratio than is
typically observed in dwarf novae. The orbital period, as derived from the
radial velocity of the line wings, is 65.233 +/- 0.015 minutes. In combination
with the previously measured superhump period, this implies an extreme mass
ratio of M_2/M_1 = 0.017 +/- 0.004. The H_alpha and HeI6678 emission lines
additionally have a narrow central spike, as is often seen in the spectra of AM
CVn type stars. Comparing its properties with CVs, AM CVn systems and hydrogen
binaries below the CV period minimum, we argue that CSS100603:112253-111037 is
the first compelling example of an AM CVn system forming via the evolved CV
channel.
  With the addition of this system, evolved cataclysmic variables (CVs) now
account for seven per cent of all known semi-detached white dwarf binaries with
Porb < 76 min. Two recently discovered binaries may further increase this
figure. Although the selection bias of this sample is not yet well defined,
these systems support the evolved CV model as a possible formation channel for
ultracompact accreting binaries. The orbital periods of the three ultracompact
hydrogen accreting binaries overlap with those of the long period AM CVn stars,
but there are currently no known systems in the period range 67 - 76 minutes.
