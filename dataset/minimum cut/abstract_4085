We propose how to approach, and report on the first results in our effort
for, describing nuclear matter starting from the solitonic picture of baryons
which is supposed to represent QCD for large number of colors. For this
purpose, the instanton-skyrmion connection of Atiyah and Manton is exploited to
describe skyrmion matter. We first modify 't Hooft's multi-instanton solution
so as to suitably incorporate proper dynamical variables into the skyrmion
matter and then by taking these variables as variational parameters, we show
that they cover a configuration space sufficient to adequately describe the
ground state properties of nuclear matter starting from the skyrmion picture.
Our results turn out to be comparable to those so far found in different
numerical calculations, with our solution reaching stability at high density
for a crystal structure and obtaining a comparable value for the energy per
baryon at the minimum, thus setting the stage for the next step.
