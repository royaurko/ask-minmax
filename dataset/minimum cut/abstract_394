We present a constructive example of violation of additivity of minimum
output R\'enyi entropy for each p>2. The example is provided by antisymmetric
subspace of a suitable dimension. We discuss possibility of extension of the
result to go beyond p>2 and obtain additivity for p=0 for a class of
entanglement breaking channels.
