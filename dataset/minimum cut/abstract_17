The current cycle minimum appears to be deeper and broader than recent cycle
minima, and this minimum appears similar to the minima in the early 1900s. With
the best-ever solar irradiance measurements from several different satellite
instruments, this minimum offers a unique opportunity to advance our
understanding of secular (long-term) changes in the solar irradiance.
Comparisons of the 2007-2009 irradiance results to the irradiance levels during
the previous minimum in 1996 suggest that the solar irradiance is lower in this
current minimum. For example, the total solar irradiance (TSI) indicates lower
irradiance in 2008 than in 1996 by about 200 ppm, and the SOHO Solar EUV
Monitor (SEM) 26 to 34 nm irradiance is about 15% lower in 2008 than in 1996.
However, these irradiance variations have 30-50% uncertainties due to these
results depending strongly on instrument degradation trends over 12 years.
Supporting evidence for lower irradiance include that the solar magnetic fields
are lower and that there are more low-latitude coronal holes during this
current minimum.
