We analyse the breakdown of supersymmetry in an ISS model in the presence of
gravity, under the requirement that the cosmological constant vanishes
dynamically. The gravitational backreaction is calculated in the metastable
minimum and, in conjuction with the condition V=0, this is shown to generate
non-zero F-terms for the squarks. Once the squarks are coupled to the messenger
sector, a gauge mediation scheme is realised and it leads to a distinctive soft
spectrum, with a two order of magnitude split between the gaugino and the soft
scalar masses.
