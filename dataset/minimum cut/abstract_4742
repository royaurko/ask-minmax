There is a considerable body of work on sequence mining of Web Log Data. We
are using One Pass frequent Episode discovery (or FED) algorithm, takes a
different approach than the traditional apriori class of pattern detection
algorithms. In this approach significant intervals for each Website are
computed first (independently) and these interval used for detecting frequent
patterns/Episode and then the Analysis is performed on Significant Intervals
and frequent patterns That can be used to forecast the user's behavior using
previous trends and this can be also used for advertising purpose. This type of
applications predicts the Website interest. In this approach, time-series data
are folded over a periodicity (day, week, etc.) Which are used to form the
Interval? Significant intervals are discovered from these time points that
satisfy the criteria of minimum confidence and maximum interval length
specified by the user.
