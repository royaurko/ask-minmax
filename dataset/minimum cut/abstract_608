The fluid dynamics of the classical dewetting instability in ultrathin films
is a non-linear process. However, the physical manifestation of the instability
in terms of characteristic length and time scales can be described by a
linearized form of the initial conditions of the films's dynamics. Alternately,
the thermodynamic approach based on equating the rate of free energy decrease
to the viscous dissipation [de Gennes, C. R. Acad. Paris.v298, 1984] can give
similar information. Here we have evaluated dewetting in the presence of
thermocapillary forces arising from a film-thickness (h) dependent temperature.
Such a situation can be found during pulsed laser melting of ultrathin metal
films where nanoscale effects lead to a local h-dependent temperature. The
thermodynamic approach provides an analytical description of this
thermocapillary dewetting. The results of this approach agree with those from
linear theory and experimental observations provided the minimum value of
viscous dissipation is equated to the rate of free energy decrease. The flow
boundary condition that produces this minimum viscous dissipation is when the
film-substrate tangential stress is zero. The physical implication of this
finding is that the spontaneous dewetting instability follows the path of
minimum rate of energy loss.
