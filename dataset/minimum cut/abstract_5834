The phenomenon of Ostwald Ripening is generally considered a limiting factor
in the monodisperse production of nanoparticles. However, by analysing the free
energy of a binary AB solution with precipitated A particles we show that there
is a region in the parameter space of component concentrations and interaction
energies where smaller particles are more stable than bigger ones. The strong
binding of B species to surfaces of A particles significantly decreases the
particle effective surface energy, making it negative. The global minimum of
free energy in such a system is thus reached when mass is transferred from
bigger particles to the smaller ones, such that all particles become identical
in size. The process of mass transfer is opposite to Ostwald ripening, and can
be used for generating monodisperse arrays of nanoparticles.
