The Grad-Shafranov reconstruction is a method of estimating the orientation
(invariant axis) and cross-section of magnetic flux ropes using the data from a
single spacecraft. It can be applied to various magnetic structures such as
magnetic clouds (MCs) and flux ropes embedded into the magnetopause and in the
solar wind. We develop a number of improvements of this technique and show some
examples of the reconstruction procedure of interplanetary coronal mass
ejections (ICMEs) observed at 1 AU by the STEREO, WIND and ACE spacecraft
during the minimum following the solar cycle 23. The analysis is conducted not
only for ideal localized ICME events but also for non-trivial cases of magnetic
clouds in fast solar wind. The Grad-Shafranov reconstruction gives reasonable
results for the sample events, although it possesses certain limitations, which
need to be taken into account during the interpretation of the model results.
