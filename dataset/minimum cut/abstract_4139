We have recently introduced the idea of making use of three-photon positron
annihilations in positron emission tomography. In this paper the basic
characteristics of the three-gamma imaging in PET are studied by means of Monte
Carlo simulations and analytical computations. Two typical configurations of
human and small animal scanners are considered. Three-photon imaging requires
high energy resolution detectors. Parameters currently attainable by CdZnTe
semiconductor detectors, the technology of choice for the future development of
radiation imaging, are assumed. Spatial resolution is calculated as a function
of detector energy resolution and size, position in the field of view, scanner
size, and the energies of the three gamma annihilation photons. Possible ways
to improve the spatial resolution obtained for nominal parameters: 1.5 cm and
3.2 mm FWHM for human and small animal scanners, respectively, are indicated.
Counting rates of true and random three-photon events for typical human and
small animal scanning configurations are assessed. A simple formula for minimum
size of lesions detectable in the three-gamma based images is derived.
Depending on the contrast and total number of registered counts, lesions of a
few mm size for human and sub mm for small animal scanners can be detected.
