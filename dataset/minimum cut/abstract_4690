Stellar perturbations affect planet-formation in binary systems. Recent
studies show that the planet-formation stage of mutual accretion of km-sized
planetesimals is most sensitive to binary effects. In this paper, the condition
for planetesimal accretion is investigated around Alpha CenB, which is believed
to be an ideal candidate for detection of an Earth-like planet in or near its
habitable zone(0.5-0.9 AU). A simplified scaling method is developed to
estimate the accretion timescale of the planetesimals embedded in a
protoplanetary disk. Twenty-four cases with different binary
inclinations(i_B=0, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 deg), gas densities(0.3,1,and 3 times of
the Minimum Mass of Solar Nebula, MMSN hereafter), and with and without gas
depletion, are simulated. We find: (1)...(2)...(3)...(4)...(see the paper for
details). In other words, our results suggest that formation of Earth-like
planets through accretion of km-sized planetesimals is possible in Alpha CenB,
while formation of gaseous giant planets is not favorable.
