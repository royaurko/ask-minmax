ArgoNeuT, or Argon Neutrino Test, is a 170 liter liquid argon time projection
chamber designed to collect neutrino interactions from the NuMI beam at Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory. ArgoNeuT operated in the NuMI low-energy beam
line directly upstream of the MINOS Near Detector from September 2009 to
February 2010, during which thousands of neutrino and antineutrino events were
collected. The MINOS Near Detector was used to measure muons downstream of
ArgoNeuT. Though ArgoNeuT is primarily an R&D project, the data collected
provide a unique opportunity to measure neutrino cross sections in the 0.1-10
GeV energy range. Fully reconstructing the muon from these interactions is
imperative for these measurements. This paper focuses on the complete kinematic
reconstruction of neutrino-induced through-going muons tracks. Analysis of this
high statistics sample of minimum ionizing tracks demonstrates the reliability
of the geometric and calorimetric reconstruction in the ArgoNeuT detector.
