We study numerically the scaling correction to the internal energy per spin
as a function of system size and temperature in a variety of Ising and vector
spin glasses. From a standard scaling analysis we estimate the effective size
correction exponent x at each temperature. For each system with a finite
ordering temperature, as temperature is increased from zero, x initially
decreases regularly until it goes through a minimum at a temperature close to
the critical temperature, and then increases strongly. The behavior of the
exponent x at and below the critical temperature is more complex than suggested
by the model for the size correction that relates x to the domain-wall
stiffness exponent.
