Three deep flux minima were observed with nearly the same time-scales and
intervals for the blazar PKS 1510-089 in the past few years. A binary black
hole system was proposed to be at the nucleus of this object, and a new minimum
was predicted to occur in 2002 March. We monitored this source with a 60/90 cm
Schmidt telescope from 2002 February to April. In combination with the data
obtained by Xie et al. (2004) in the same period, we presented for the 2002
minimum a nearly symmetric light curve, which would be required by an eclipsing
model of a binary black hole system. We also constrained the time-scale of the
minimum to be 35 min, which is more consistent with the time-scales ~42 min of
the three previous minima than the 89 min time-scale given by the same contributors.
The wiggling miniarcsecond radio jet observed in this object is taken as a
further evidence for the binary black hole system. The `coupling' of the
periodicity in light curve and the helicity in radio jet is discussed in the
framework of a binary black hole system.
