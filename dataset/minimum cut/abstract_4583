In biomolecular systems (especially all-atom models) with many degrees of
freedom such as proteins and nucleic acids, there exist an astronomically large
number of local-minimum-energy states. Conventional simulations in the
canonical ensemble are of little use, because they tend to get trapped in
states of these energy local minima. Enhanced conformational sampling
techniques are thus in great demand. A simulation in generalized ensemble
performs a random walk in potential energy space and can overcome this
difficulty. From only one simulation run, one can obtain canonical-ensemble
averages of physical quantities as functions of temperature by the
single-histogram and/or multiple-histogram reweighting techniques. In this
article we review uses of the generalized-ensemble algorithms in biomolecular
systems. Three well-known methods, namely, multicanonical algorithm, simulated
tempering, and replica-exchange method, are described first. Both Monte Carlo
and molecular dynamics versions of the algorithms are given. We then present
various extensions of these three generalized-ensemble algorithms. The
effectiveness of the methods is tested with short peptide and protein systems.
