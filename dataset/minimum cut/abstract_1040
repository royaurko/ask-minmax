We present a modular cosmology scenario where the difficulties encountered in
conventional modular cosmology are solved in a self-consistent manner, with
definite predictions to be tested by observation. Notably, the difficulty of
the dilaton finding its way to a precarious weak coupling minimum is made
irrelevant by having eternal modular inflation at the vacuum supersymmetry
breaking scale after the dilaton is stabilised. Neither this eternal inflation
nor the subsequent non-slow-roll modular inflation destabilise the dilaton from
its precarious minimum due to the low energy scale of the inflation and
consequent small back reaction on the dilaton potential. The observed flat CMB
spectrum is obtained from fluctuations in the angular component of a modulus
near a symmetric point, which are hugely magnified by the roll down of the
modulus to Planckian values, allowing them to dominate the final curvature
perturbation. We also give precise calculations of the spectral index and its
running.
