CDMS II data from the 5-tower runs at the Soudan Underground Laboratory were
reprocessed with an improved charge-pulse fitting algorithm. Two new analysis
techniques to reject surface-event backgrounds were applied to the 612 kg days
germanium-detector WIMP-search exposure. An extended analysis was also
completed by decreasing the 10 keV analysis threshold to $\sim$5 keV, to
increase sensitivity near a WIMP mass of 8 GeV/$c^2$. After unblinding, there
were zero candidate events above a deposited energy of 10 keV and 6 events in
the lower-threshold analysis. This yielded minimum WIMP-nucleon
spin-independent scattering cross-section limits of $1.8 \times 10^{-44}$ and
$1.18 \times 10 ^{-41}$ cm$^2$ at 90\% confidence for 60 and 8.6 GeV/$c^2$
WIMPs, respectively. This improves the previous CDMS II result by a factor of
2.4 (2.7) for 60 (8.6) GeV/$c^2$ WIMPs.
