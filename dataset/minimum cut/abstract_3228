We examine the necessity of resolving the Jeans mass in hydrodynamical
simulations of the hierarchical formation of cosmological structures. We
consider a standard two-component fluid and use smoothed particle hydrodynamics
to model the baryonic component. It is found that resolution of the Jeans mass
is not necessary to extract bulk properties of bound objects that are
independent of resolution, provided that the objects have undergone a number of
merger events. The degree of merging must be sufficient to populate the objects
with substructure of similar total mass. After this criterion is met, neither
the density profiles of structures nor their density-temperature distributions
depend appreciably on the resolution of the simulation. Resolution of the Jeans
mass by the imposition of a minimum temperature is not found to adversely
affect the state of the matter in the final clusters. The baryon concentration
profiles still indicate a deficit of gas with respect to the dark matter in the
interiors of structures.
