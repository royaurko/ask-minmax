This paper is concerned with construction and structural analysis of both
cyclic and quasi-cyclic codes, particularly LDPC codes. It consists of three
parts. The first part shows that a cyclic code given by a parity-check matrix
in circulant form can be decomposed into descendant cyclic and quasi-cyclic
codes of various lengths and rates. Some fundamental structural properties of
these descendant codes are developed, including the characterizations of the
roots of the generator polynomial of a cyclic descendant code. The second part
of the paper shows that cyclic and quasi-cyclic descendant LDPC codes can be
derived from cyclic finite geometry LDPC codes using the results developed in
first part of the paper. This enlarges the repertoire of cyclic LDPC codes. The
third part of the paper analyzes the trapping sets of regular LDPC codes whose
parity-check matrices satisfy a certain constraint on their rows and columns.
Several classes of finite geometry and finite field cyclic and quasi-cyclic
LDPC codes with large minimum weights are shown to have no harmful trapping
sets with size smaller than their minimum weights. Consequently, their
performance error-floors are dominated by their minimum weights.
