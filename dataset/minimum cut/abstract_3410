The dust in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), an ideal analog of primordial
galaxies at high redshifts, differs markedly from that in the Milky Way by
exhibiting a steeply rising far-ultraviolet extinction curve, an absence of the
2175 Angstrom extinction feature, and a local minimum at ~12 micron in its
infrared emission spectrum, suggesting the lack of ultrasmall carbonaceous
grains (i.e. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules) which are ubiquitously
seen in the Milky Way. While current models for the SMC dust all rely heavily
on silicates, recent observations of the SMC sightline toward Sk 155 indicated
that Si and Mg are essentially undepleted and the depletions of Fe range from
mild to severe, suggesting that metallic grains and/or iron oxides, instead of
silicates, may dominate the SMC dust. However, in this Letter we apply the
Kramers-Kronig relation to demonstrate that neither metallic grains nor iron
oxides are capable of accounting for the observed extinction; silicates remain
as an important contributor to the extinction, consistent with current models
for the SMC dust.
