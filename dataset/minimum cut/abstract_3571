A novel low temperature bolometric method has been devised and implemented
for high-precision measurements of the microwave surface resistance of small
single-crystal platelet samples having very low absorption, as a continuous
function of frequency. The key to the success of this non-resonant method is
the in-situ use of a normal metal reference sample that calibrates the absolute
rf field strength. The sample temperature can be controlled independently of
the 1.2 K liquid helium bath, allowing for measurements of the temperature
evolution of the absorption. However, the instrument's sensitivity decreases at
higher temperatures, placing a limit on the useful temperature range. Using
this method, the minimum detectable power at 1.3 K is 1.5 pW, corresponding to
a surface resistance sensitivity of $\approx$1 $\mu\Omega$ for a typical 1
mm$\times$1 mm platelet sample.
