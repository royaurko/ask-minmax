Finite Formation Time (FFT) effects in the exclusive reaction ^4He(e,e'p)^3H
at high values of Q^2 are introduced and discussed. It is shown that the
minimum in the momentum distributions predicted by the Plane Wave Impulse
Approximation (PWIA), which is filled by the Glauber-type Final State
Interaction (FSI), is completely recovered when FFT effects are taken into
account. The semi-inclusive process ^4 He(e,e'p)X is also investigated.
