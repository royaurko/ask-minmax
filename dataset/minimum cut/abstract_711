The unknotting number of a knot is the minimum number of crossings one must
change to turn that knot into the unknot. The algebraic unknotting number is
the minimum number of crossing changes needed to transform a knot into an
Alexander polynomial-one knot. We work with a generalization of unknotting
number due to Mathieu-Domergue, which we call the untwisting number. The
untwisting number is the minimum number (over all diagrams of a knot) of right-
or left-handed twists on even numbers of strands of a knot, with half of the
strands oriented in each direction, necessary to transform that knot into the
unknot. We show that the algebraic untwisting number is equal to the algebraic
unknotting number. However, we also exhibit several families of knots for which
the difference between the unknotting and untwisting numbers is arbitrarily
large, even when we only allow twists on a fixed number of strands or fewer.
