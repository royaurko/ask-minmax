Quantum vortex tunneling is studied for the case where the Hall and the
dissipative dynamics are simultaneously present. For a given temperature, the
magnetization relaxation rate is calculated as a function of the external
current and the quasiparticle scattering time. The relaxation rate is solved
analytically at zero temperature and obtained numerically at finite
temperatures by the variational method. In the moderately clean samples, we
have found that a minimum in the relaxation rate exists at zero temperature,
which tends to disappear with increase in the temperature.
