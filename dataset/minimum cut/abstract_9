In this paper, we study the minimum mean square estimator for a sublinear
operator. Under some mild assumptions, we prove the existence and uniqueness of
the minimum mean square estimator. Several characterizations of the minimum
mean square estimator are obtained. We also explore the relationship between
the minimum mean square estimator and the conditional coherent risk measure and
conditional g-expectation.
