We consider a CFT defined on a static metric that is the product of time with
a smooth closed space of positive scalar curvature. We expect the theory to
exhibit an energy gap and our aim is to investigate how that gap depends on the
geometry of the space. For a free conformal scalar it is straightforward to
show the gap normalised by the minimum value of the Ricci scalar of the space
is minimised when the space is a sphere. Our main result is then to show using
geometric arguments that precisely the same result holds for fluctuations of a
scalar operator in any holographic CFT. We prove this under the assumption that
the dual vacuum geometry is a smooth Einstein metric ending only on the
conformal boundary, and then consider fluctuations of a minimally coupled
massive scalar field about this. We also argue the holographic CFT will have
states dual to small bulk black holes whose existence is related to the energy
gap. We show the thermodynamic properties of these black holes obey a bound of
a similar nature to that of the scalar fluctuations - the ratio of CFT energy
to a power of entropy for the states dual to black holes in the 'small' limit
is bounded from below when appropriately normalised by the minimum Ricci scalar
of the boundary space. Again the bound is saturated for a sphere.
