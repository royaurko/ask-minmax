We present the discovery of a further five recycled pulsar systems in the
mid-Galactic latitude portion of the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU)
Survey. The pulsars have rotational periods ranging from 2 ms to 66 ms, and
four are in binary systems with orbital periods between 10.8 hours and 9.0
days. Three of these binary systems are particularly interesting; PSR
J1227-6208 has a pulse period of 34.5 ms and the highest mass function of all
pulsars with near-circular orbits. The circular orbit suggests that the
companion is not another neutron star, so future timing experiments may reveal
one of the heaviest white dwarfs ever found ($>$ 1.3 M$_\odot$). Timing
observations of PSR J1431$-$4715 indicate that it is eclipsed by its companion
which has a mass indicating it belongs to the redback class of eclipsing
millisecond pulsars. PSR J1653-2054 has a companion with a minimum mass of only
$0.08$ M$_\odot$, placing it among the class of pulsars with low-mass
companions. Unlike the majority of such systems, however, no evidence of
eclipses is seen at 1.4 GHz.
