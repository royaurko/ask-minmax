Some aspects of hadron production in p-p collisions remain unresolved,
including the low-hadron-momentum structure of high-parton-energy dijets,
separation of triggered dijets from the underlying event (UE), the systematics
of multiple parton interactions and possible systematic underestimation of
dijet contributions to high-energy nuclear collisions. In this study we apply a
minimum-bias trigger-associated (TA) correlation analysis to p-p collisions. We
extract a hard component from TA correlations that can be compared with
measured jet fragment systematics derived from e-e collisions. The kinematic
limits on jet fragment production may be determined. The same method may be
extended to A-A collisions where the role of minimum-bias jets in spectra and
correlations is strongly contested.
