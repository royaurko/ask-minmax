In this paper we obtain some upper bounds for $b$-chromatic number of
$K_{1,t}$ -free graphs, graphs with given minimum clique partition and
bipartite graphs. These bounds are in terms of either clique number or
chromatic number of graphs or biclique number for bipartite graphs. We show
that all the bounds are tight.
