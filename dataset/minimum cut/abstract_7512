The quantity and quality of satellite photometric data strings is revealing
details in Cepheid variation at very low levels. Specifically, we observed a
Cepheid pulsating in the fundamental mode and one pulsating in the first
overtone with the Canadian MOST satellite. The 3.7-d period fundamental mode
pulsator (RT Aur) has a light curve that repeats precisely, and can be modeled
by a Fourier series very accurately. The overtone pulsator (SZ Tau, 3.1 d
period) on the other hand shows light curve variation from cycle to cycle which
we characterize by the variations in the Fourier parameters. We present
arguments that we are seeing instability in the pulsation cycle of the overtone
pulsator, and that this is also a characteristic of the O-C curves of overtone
pulsators. On the other hand, deviations from cycle to cycle as a function of
pulsation phase follow a similar pattern in both stars, increasing after
minimum radius. In summary, pulsation in the overtone pulsator is less stable
than that of the fundamental mode pulsator at both long and short timescales.
