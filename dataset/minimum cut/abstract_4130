The difference between the rf voltage seen by the beam and the accelerating
voltage required to match the rate of change of the Booster magnetic field is
used to estimate the energy loss per beam turn. Because the rf voltage (RFSUM)
and the synchronous phase can be experimentally measured, they can be used to
calculate the effective accelerating voltage. Also an RFSUM reduction technique
has been applied to measure experimentally the RFSUM limit at which the beam
loss starts. With information on beam energy loss, the running conditions,
especially for the high intensity beam, can be optimized in order to achieve a
higher intensity beam from the Fermilab Booster.
