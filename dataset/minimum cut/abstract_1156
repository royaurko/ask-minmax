Quantum stabilizer states over GF(m) can be represented as self-dual additive
codes over GF(m^2). These codes can be represented as weighted graphs, and
orbits of graphs under the generalized local complementation operation
correspond to equivalence classes of codes. We have previously used this fact
to classify self-dual additive codes over GF(4). In this paper we classify
self-dual additive codes over GF(9), GF(16), and GF(25). Assuming that the
classical MDS conjecture holds, we are able to classify all self-dual additive
MDS codes over GF(9) by using an extension technique. We prove that the minimum
distance of a self-dual additive code is related to the minimum vertex degree
in the associated graph orbit. Circulant graph codes are introduced, and a
computer search reveals that this set contains many strong codes. We show that
some of these codes have highly regular graph representations.
