LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is a proposed space mission, which
will use coherent laser beams exchanged between three remote spacecraft to
detect and study low-frequency cosmic gravitational radiation. In the low-part
of its frequency band, the LISA strain sensitivity will be dominated by the
incoherent superposition of hundreds of millions of gravitational wave signals
radiated by inspiraling white-dwarf binaries present in our own galaxy. In
order to estimate the magnitude of the LISA response to this background, we
have simulated a synthesized population that recently appeared in the
literature. We find the amplitude of the galactic white-dwarf binary background
in the LISA data to be modulated in time, reaching a minimum equal to about
twice that of the LISA noise for a period of about two months around the time
when the Sun-LISA direction is roughly oriented towards the Autumn equinox.
Since the galactic white-dwarfs background will be observed by LISA not as a
stationary but rather as a cyclostationary random process with a period of one
year, we summarize the theory of cyclostationary random processes and present
the corresponding generalized spectral method needed to characterize such
process. We find that, by measuring the generalized spectral components of the
white-dwarf background, LISA will be able to infer properties of the
distribution of the white-dwarfs binary systems present in our Galaxy.
