We find the minimum dilatation of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms that stabilize
an orientable foliation on surfaces of genus three, four, or five, and provide
a lower bound for genus six to eight. Our technique also simplifies Cho and
Ham's proof of the least dilatation of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms on a genus
two surface. For genus g=2 to 5, the mimimum dilatation is the smallest Salem
number for polynomials of degree 2g.
