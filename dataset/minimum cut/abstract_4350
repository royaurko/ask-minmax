We have measured 2D autocorrelations for all charged hadrons in STAR with
$p_{t}$ $>$ 0.15 GeV/c and $| \eta |$ $<$ 1 from Au+Au collisions at 62 and 200
GeV. The correlation structure is dominated by a peak centered at zero relative
opening angles on $\eta$ and $\phi$ which we hypothesize is caused by
minimum-bias jets (minijets). We observe a large excess of minijet correlations
in more-central Au-Au collisions relative to binary-collision scaling (more
correlated pairs than expected from surface emission or even volume emission).
We also observe a sudden increase of the minijet peak amplitude and $\eta$
width relative to binary-collision scaling of scattered partons which occurs at
an energy-dependent centrality point. There is a possible scaling of the
transition point with transverse particle density.
