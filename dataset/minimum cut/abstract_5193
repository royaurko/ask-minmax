The discovery of the largest trans-neptunian object 2003 UB313 (dwarf planet
Eris) was made more than 5 years ago, but the question on the true relation of
the sizes of Pluto and Eris (and according to of their densities) remains
debatable in view of a sizable scatter of their size's estimates obtained by
the various methods. Here, we first used a semi-empirical approach to deduce
the expression linking the orbital parameter eccentricity to the physical
properties of the trans-neptunian dwarf planets and have applied it to
determining the mean size of these planets. In doing so is proved that the mean
Eris' size should be about 9 % larger than of Pluto's. Based on the published
photometric data and the derived mean diameter the possible estimates of the
minimum and maximum diameters of Pluto and Eris on the assumption of a
deviation their form from spherical are provided. The probable reason for an
occurrence of such an aspherical form of these dwarf planets is briefly
discussed.
