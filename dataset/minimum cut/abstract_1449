For a non-square positive integer x, let k_x denote the distance between x^3
and the perfect square closest to x^3. A conjecture of Marshall Hall states
that the ratios r_x = (x^(1/2))/k_x, are bounded above. (Elkies has shown that
any such bound must exceed 46.6.) Let {x(n)} be the sequence of "Hall numbers":
positive non-square integers for which r_x(n) exceeds 1. Extensive computer
searches have identified approximately 50 Hall numbers. (It can be proved that
infinitely many exist.) In this paper we study the minimum gap between
consecutive Hall numbers. We prove that for all n, x(n + 1) - x(n) >
(1/5)x(n)^(1/6), with stronger gaps applying when x(n) is close to perfect even
or odd squares (approximately x(n)^(1/3) or x(n)^(1/4), respectively). This
result has obvious implications for the minimum "horizontal gap" (and hence
straight line and arc distance) between integer points (whose x-coordinates
exceed k^2) on the Mordell elliptic curves x^3 - y^2 = k, a question that does
not appear to have been addressed.
