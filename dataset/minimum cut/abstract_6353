We present multi-epoch observations of the radio nebula around the neutron
star X-ray binary Circinus X-1 made at 1.4 and 2.5 GHz with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array between October 2000 and September 2004. The nebula can
be seen as a result of the interaction between the jet from the system and the
interstellar medium and it is likely that we are actually looking toward the
central X-ray binary system through the jet-powered radio lobe. The study of
the nebula thus offers a unique opportunity to estimate for the first time
using calorimetry the energetics of a jet from an object clearly identified as
a neutron star. An extensive discussion on the energetics of the complex is
presented: a first approach is based on the minimum energy estimation, while a
second one employs a self-similar model of the interaction between the jets and
the surrounding medium. The results suggest an age for the nebula of \leq 10^5
years and a corresponding time-averaged jet power \geq 10^{35} erg s^{-1}.
During periodic flaring episodes, the instantaneous jet power may reach values
of similar magnitude to the X-ray luminosity.
