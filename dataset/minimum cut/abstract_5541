Presented here are algorithms for converting between (decimal)
scientific-notation and (binary) IEEE-754 double-precision floating-point
numbers. By employing a rounding integer quotient operation these algorithms
are much simpler than those previously published. The values are stable under
repeated conversions between the formats. Unlike Java-1.6, the scientific
representations generated use only the minimum number of mantissa digits needed
to convert back to the original binary values.
  Implemented in Java these algorithms execute as fast or faster than Java's
native conversions over nearly all of the IEEE-754 double-precision range.
