We report the discovery of a new double-mode RR Lyrae variable (RRd) in the
field of our Galaxy: CU Comae. CU Comae is the sixth such RRd identified to
date and is the most metal-poor RRd ever detected. Based on BVI CCD photometry
spanning eleven years of observations, we find that CU Comae has periods
P0=0.5441641 +/-0.0000049d and P1=0.4057605 +/-0.0000018d. The amplitude of the
primary (first-overtone) period of CU Comae is about twice the amplitude of the
secondary (fundamental) period. The combination of the fundamental period of
pulsation P0 and the period ratio of P1/P0=0.7457 places the variable on the
metal-poor side of the Petersen diagram, in the region occupied by M68 and M15
RRd's. A mass of 0.83 solar masses is estimated for CU Comae using an updated
theoretical calibration of the Petersen diagram. High resolution spectroscopy
(R=30,000) covering the full pulsation cycle of CU Comae was obtained with the
2.7 m telescope of the Mc Donald Observatory, and has been used to build up the
radial velocity curve of the variable. Abundance analysis done on the four
spectra taken near minimum light (phase: 0.54 -- 0.71) confirms the metal poor
nature of CU Comae, for which we derive [Fe/H]=-2.38 +/-0.20. This value places
this new RRd at the extreme metal-poor edge of the metallicity distribution of
the RR Lyrae variables in our Galaxy.
