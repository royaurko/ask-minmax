Modern time projection chambers are increasingly based on micro pattern gas
detector readout systems. In this paper a self-supporting method used to mount
Gas Electron Multiplier foils is presented. It is based on light weight ceramic
grids, and promises to cover large readout areas with minimum dead zones and
material, while ensuring a flat and mechanically stable mounting. The structure
has been tested in a Time Projection Chamber prototype, using cosmic muon
tracks. The impact of the mounting structure on the charge measurement, the
track reconstruction and the single point resolution is quantified.
