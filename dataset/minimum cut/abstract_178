mRNA editing of sequences of many species is analyzed. The nature of the
inserted nucleotides and the position of the insertion sites, once fixed the
edited peptide chain, are explained by introducing a minimum principle in the
framework of the crystal basis model of the genetic code introduced by the
contributors.
