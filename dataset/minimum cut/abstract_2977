We introduce a new measure on secrecy, which is established based on
rate-distortion theory. It is named \emph{security rate}, which is the minimum
(infimum) of the additional rate needed to reconstruct the source within target
distortion level with any positive probability for wiretapper. It denotes the
minimum distance in information metric (bits) from what wiretapper has received
to any decrypted reconstruction (where decryption is defined as reconstruction
within target distortion level with some positive possibility). By source
coding theorem, it is equivalent to a distortion-based equivocation
$\mathop{\min}\limits
_{p\left(v^{n}|s^{n},m\right):Ed\left(S^{n},V^{n}\right)\le
D_{E}}\frac{1}{n}I\left(S^{n};V^{n}|M\right)$ which can be seen as a direct
extension of equivocation $\frac{1}{n}H\left(S^{n}|M\right)$ to lossy
decryption case, given distortion level $D_{E}$ and the received (encrypted)
message $M$ of wiretapper. In this paper, we study it in Shannon cipher system
with lossless communication, where a source is transmitted from sender to
legitimate receiver secretly and losslessly, and also eavesdropped by a
wiretapper. We characterize the admissible region of secret key rate, coding
rate of the source, wiretapper distortion, and security rate (distortion-based
equivocation). Since the security rate equals the distortion-based
equivocation, and the equivocation is a special case of the distortion-based
equivocation (with Hamming distortion measure and $D_{E}=0$), this gives an
answer for the meaning of the maximum equivocation.
