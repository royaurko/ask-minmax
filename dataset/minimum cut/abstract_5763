We quantitatively analyze and evaluate the controller's power in $N$-qubit
controlled teleportation schemes. We calculate the minimum control power
required to ensure the controller's contributority such that the teleportation
fidelity without the controller's permission is no more than the classical
bound. We revisit several typical controlled teleportation schemes from the
controller's point of view and evaluate the control power in these schemes. We
find that for teleporting arbitrary N-qubit states, each controller should
control at least N bits of useful information to ensure his/her contributority over
the protocol. We also discuss the general rules that must be satisfied by
controlled teleportation schemes to ensure both teleportation fidelity and
control power.
