We start with the spinfluid: a nearly-homogeneous, 8-spinor medium, with
small local eddies and twists. As it expends, these seed a raft of intersecting
codimension-J singularities: a spinfoam. As this expands, the energy trapped in
each (4-J) brane varies as the Jth power of the scale factor. Summing on
J=(0,1,2,3,4) creates a quartic dilation potential with either 1 or 2 minima:
preferred length and mass scales. The spinfoam expands forever with 1 minimum,
but recontracts with 2. To quantize it, we take a canonical ensemble of
spinfoams, immersed in a heat bath of vacuum spinors, whose microstates vastly
outnumber the matter states. It's evolution is governed by a free energy which
admits phase transitions at two critical scale, separated by a triple
point.Their critical droplets correspond to the varieties of leptons and
hadrons.We identify the first as inflation, the second as baryogenesis; and the
heat bath of vacuum spinors as dark energy.
