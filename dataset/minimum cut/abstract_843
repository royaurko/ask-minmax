The normalized multiplicity moments and their relation with soft and hard
processes in relativistic heavy ion collisions are analyzed in a general
two-component model. It is found that, the strong fluctuations in binary
collision number N_c in minimum-bias events can enhance the hard component,
especially for the higher order moments. This enhancement can not be
effectively described by modifying the participant number in the one-component
model.
