A total dominator coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper coloring of $G$ in
which each vertex of the graph is adjacent to every vertex of some color class.
The total dominator chromatic number $\chi_d^t(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum number
of color classes in a total dominator coloring of it. In [Total dominator
chromatic number of a graph, submitted] the contributor initialed to study this
number in graphs and obtained some important results. Here, we continue it in
Mycieleskian graphs. We show that the total dominator chromatic number of the
Mycieleskian of a graph $G$ belongs to between $\chi_d^t(G)+1$ and
$\chi_d^t(G)+2$, and then characterize the family of graphs the their total
dominator chromatic numbers are each of them.
