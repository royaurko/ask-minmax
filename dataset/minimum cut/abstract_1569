It has been suggested that if the Universe satisfies a flat, multiply
connected, perturbed Friedmann-Lema^itre model, then cosmic microwave
background data from the COBE satellite implies that the minimum size of the
injectivity diameter (shortest closed spatial geodesic) must be larger than
about two fifths of the horizon diameter. To show that this claim is
misleading, a simple $T^2 \times R$ universe model of injectivity diameter a
quarter of this size, i.e. a tenth of the horizon diameter, is shown to be
consistent with COBE four year observational maps of the cosmic microwave
background. This is done using the identified circles principle.
