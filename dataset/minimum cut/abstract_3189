The hard X-ray emission from Cygnus X-1 has been monitored continually by
BATSE since the launch of CGRO in April 1991. We present the hard X-ray
intensity and spectral history of the source covering a period of more than
five years. Power spectral analysis shows a significant peak at the binary
orbital period. The 20-100 keV orbital light curve is roughly sinusoidal with a
minimum near superior conjunction of the X-ray source and an rms modulation
fraction of approximately 1.7%. No longer-term periodicities are evident in the
power spectrum. We compare our results with other observations and discuss the
implications for models of the source geometry.
