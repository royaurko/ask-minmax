Two dimensional suspensions of spherical colloids subject to periodic
external fields exhibit a rich variety of molecular crystalline phases. We
study in simulations the ground state configurations of dimeric and trimeric
systems, that are realized on square and triangular lattices, when either two
or three macroions are trapped in each external potential minimum. Bipartite
orders of the checkerboard or stripe types are reported together with more
complex quadripartite orderings, and the shortcomings of envisioning the
colloids gathered in a single potential minimum as a composite rigid object are
discussed. This work also sheds light on simplifying assumptions underlying
previous theoretical treatments and that made possible the mapping onto spin
models.
