Electrical transport and specific heat properties of Nd_{1-x}Pb_{x}MnO_{3}
single crystals for 0.15 < x 0.5 have been studied in low temperature regime.
The resistivity in the ferromagnetic insulating (FMI) phase for x < 0.3 has an
activated character. The dependence of the activation gap Delta on doping x has
been determined and the critical concentration for the zero-temperature
metal-insulator transition was determined as x_{c} ~ 0.33. For a metallic
sample with x=0.42, a conventional electron-electron (e-e) scattering term
proportional T^{2} is found in the low-temperature electrical resistivity,
although the Kadowaki-Woods ratio is found to be much larger for this manganite
than for a normal metal. For a metallic sample with x=0.5, a resistivity
minimum is observed for x= 0.5. The effect is attributed to weak localization
and can be described by a negative T^{1/2} weak-localization contribution to
resistivity for a disordered three-dimensional electron system. The specific
heat data have been fitted to contributions from free electrons (gamma), spin
excitations (beta_{3/2}), lattice and a Schottky-like anomaly related to the
rare-earth magnetism of the Nd ions. The value of gamma is larger than for
normal metals, which is ascribed to magnetic ordering effects involving Nd.
Also, the Schottky-like anomaly appears broadened and weakened suggesting
inhomogeneous molecular fields at the Nd-sites.
