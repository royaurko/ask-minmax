We address the problem of estimating a random vector X from two sets of
measurements Y and Z, such that the estimator is linear in Y. We show that the
partially linear minimum mean squared error (PLMMSE) estimator does not require
knowing the joint distribution of X and Y in full, but rather only its
second-order moments. This renders it of potential interest in various
applications. We further show that the PLMMSE method is minimax-optimal among
all estimators that solely depend on the second-order statistics of X and Y. We
demonstrate our approach in the context of recovering a signal, which is sparse
in a unitary dictionary, from noisy observations of it and of a filtered
version of it. We show that in this setting PLMMSE estimation has a clear
computational advantage, while its performance is comparable to
state-of-the-art algorithms. We apply our approach both in static and dynamic
estimation applications. In the former category, we treat the problem of image
enhancement from blurred/noisy image pairs, where we show that PLMMSE
estimation performs only slightly worse than state-of-the art algorithms, while
running an order of magnitude faster. In the dynamic setting, we provide a
recursive implementation of the estimator and demonstrate its utility in the
context of tracking maneuvering targets from position and acceleration
measurements.
