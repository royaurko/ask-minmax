We discuss the adiabatic self-trapping of small polarons within the density
functional theory (DFT). In particular, we carried out plane-wave
pseudo-potential calculations of the triplet exciton in NaCl and found no
energy minimum corresponding to the self-trapped exciton (STE) contrary to the
experimental evidence and previous calculations. To explore the origin of this
problem we modelled the self-trapped hole in NaCl using hybrid density
functionals and an embedded cluster method. Calculations show that the
stability of the self-trapped state of the hole drastically depends on the
amount of the exact exchange in the density functional: at less than 30% of the
Hartree-Fock exchange, only delocalized hole is stable, at 50% - both
delocalized and self-trapped states are stable, while further increase of exact
exchange results in only the self-trapped state being stable. We argue that the
main contributions to the self-trapping energy such as the kinetic energy of
the localizing charge, the chemical bond formation of the di-halogen quasi
molecule, and the lattice polarization, are represented incorrectly within the
Kohn-Sham (KS) based approaches.
