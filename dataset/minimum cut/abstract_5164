Rapidly spinning neutron stars are known to harbour pulsation modes that may
become unstable and grow in amplitude by emitting gravitational radiation.
Among the various stellar modes, the f-mode is the one typically considered as
a promising source of gravitational radiation for ground-based detectors such
as LIGO and VIRGO. Improving the existing work in Newtonian stellar models, we
present the first calculation of the basic properties of the f-mode instability
in rapidly rotating relativistic neutron stars, adopting the Cowling
approximation. Using a relativistic polytropic stellar model, we obtain a
minimum gravitational growth timescale (for the dominant l=m=4 mode) of the
order of 10^3-10^4 s near the Kepler spin frequency Omega_K, which is
substantially shorter than the Newtonian value. By accounting for dissipation
in neutron star matter, i.e. shear/bulk viscosity and superfluid mutual
friction, we calculate the associated f-mode instability window. For our
specific stellar model, the instability is active above 0.92 \times Omega_K and
for temperatures \sim (10^9 - 2 \times 10^{10}) K, characteristic of newborn
neutron stars.
