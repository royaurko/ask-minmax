The availability of continuous helioseismic data for two consecutive solar
minima has provided a unique opportunity to study the changes in the solar
interior that might have led to this unusual minimum. We present preliminary
analysis of inter mediate-degree mode frequencies in the 3 mHz band during the
current period of minimal solar activity and show that the mode frequencies are
significantly lower than those during the previous activity minimum. Our
analysis do not show any signature of the beginning of cycle 24 till the end of
2008. In addition, the zonal and meridional flow patterns inferred from
inverting frequencies also hint for a delayed onset of a new cycle. The
estimates of travel time are higher than the previous minimum confirming a
relatively weak solar activity during the current minimum.
