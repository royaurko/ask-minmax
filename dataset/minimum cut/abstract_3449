A modified version of a finite random field Ising ferromagnetic model in an
external magnetic field at zero temperature is presented to describe group
decision making. Fields may have a non-zero average. A postulate of minimum
inter-individual conflicts is assumed. Interactions then produce a group
polarization along one very choice which is however randomly selected. A small
external social pressure is shown to have a drastic effect on the polarization.
Individual bias related to personal backgrounds, cultural values and past
experiences are introduced via quenched local competing fields. They are shown
to be instrumental in generating a larger spectrum of collective new choices
beyond initial ones. In particular, compromise is found to result from the
existence of individual competing bias. Conflict is shown to weaken group
polarization. The model yields new psycho-sociological insights about consensus
and compromise in groups.
