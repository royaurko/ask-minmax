Recent work has shown that properly designed protograph-based LDPC codes may
have minimum distance linearly increasing with block length. This notion rests
on ensemble arguments over all possible expansions of the base protograph. When
implementation complexity is considered, the expansion is typically chosen to
be quite orderly. For example, protograph expansion by cyclically shifting
connections creates a quasi-cyclic (QC) code. Other recent work has provided
upper bounds on the minimum distance of QC codes. In this paper, these bounds
are expanded upon to cover puncturing and tightened in several specific cases.
We then evaluate our upper bounds for the most prominent protograph code thus
far, one proposed for deep-space usage in the CCSDS experimental standard, the
code known as AR4JA.
