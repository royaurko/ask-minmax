We continue our study of the fractal structure of escape-time plots for
chaotic maps. In the preceding paper, we showed that the escape-time plot
contains regular sequences of successive escape segments, called epistrophes,
which converge geometrically upon each endpoint of every escape segment. In the
present paper, we use topological techniques to: (1) show that there exists a
minimal required set of escape segments within the escape-time plot; (2)
develop an algorithm which computes this minimal set; (3) show that the minimal
set eventually displays a recursive structure governed by an ``Epistrophe Start
Rule'': a new epistrophe is spawned Delta = D+1 iterates after the segment to
which it converges, where D is the minimum delay time of the complex.
