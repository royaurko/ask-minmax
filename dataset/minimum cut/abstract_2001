The von Neumann entropy at the output of a bosonic channel with thermal noise
is analyzed. Coherent-state inputs are conjectured to minimize this output
entropy. Physical and mathematical evidence in support of the conjecture is
provided. A stronger conjecture--that output states resulting from
coherent-state inputs majorize the output states from other inputs--is also
discussed.
