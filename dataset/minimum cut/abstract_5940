The thermodynamical stability of a set of circular double helical molecules
is analyzed by path integral techniques. The minicircles differ only in
\textit{i)} the radius and \textit{ii)} the number of base pairs ($N$) arranged
along the molecule axis. Instead, the rise distance is kept constant. For any
molecule size, the computational method simulates a broad ensemble of possible
helicoidal configurations while the partition function is a sum over the path
trajectories describing the base pair fluctuational states. The stablest
helical repeat of every minicircle is determined by free energy minimization.
We find that, for molecules with $N$ larger than $100$, the helical repeat
grows linearly with the size and the twist number is constant. On the other
hand, by reducing the size below $100$ base pairs, the double helices sharply
unwind and the twist number drops to one for $N=\,20$. This is predicted as the
minimum size for the existence of helicoidal molecules in the closed form. The
helix unwinding appears as a strategy to release the bending stress associated
to the circularization of the molecules.
