We develop a novel design framework for energy-efficient spectrum sharing
among autonomous users who aim to minimize their energy consumptions subject to
minimum throughput requirements. Most existing works proposed stationary
spectrum sharing policies, in which users transmit at fixed power levels. Since
users transmit simultaneously under stationary policies, to fulfill minimum
throughput requirements, they need to transmit at high power levels to overcome
interference. To improve energy efficiency, we construct nonstationary spectrum
sharing policies, in which the users transmit at time-varying power levels.
Specifically, we focus on TDMA (time-division multiple access) policies in
which one user transmits at each time (but not in a round-robin fashion). The
proposed policy can be implemented by each user running a low-complexity
algorithm in a decentralized manner. It achieves high energy efficiency even
when the users have erroneous and binary feedback about their interference
levels. Moreover, it can adapt to the dynamic entry and exit of users. The
proposed policy is also deviation-proof, namely autonomous users will find it
in their self-interests to follow it. Compared to existing policies, the
proposed policy can achieve an energy saving of up to 90% when the number of
users is high.
