The resistivity and magnetoresistance measurements were carried out on thin
film of La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 to investigate the possible origin of low temperature
resistivity minimum observed in these samples. We observed large hysteresis in
the magnetoresistance at low temperature; 5K and the sample current I has large
effect on resistivity minima temperature. The observation of hysteresis at low
temperatures suggests the presence of inhomogeneity at low temperatures. These
in-homogeneities consist of regions of different resistive phases. It appears
that the high resistive phase prevents the tunneling of charge carriers between
two low resistive regions and thus giving rise to the resistivity minimum in
these samples.
