The formation and evolution of young low mass stars are characterized by
important processes of mass loss and accretion ocurring in the innermost
regions of their placentary circumstellar disks. Because of the large
obscuration of these disks at optical and infrared wavelengths in the early
protostellar stages (Class 0 Sources), they were previously detected only at
radio wavelengths using interferometric techniques. We have detected with the
Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) the mid-infrared emission associated with the
Class 0 protostar VLA1 in the HH1-2 region located in the Orion nebula. The
emission arises in the three wavelength windows at 5.3, 6.6 and 7.5 micras
where the absorption due to ices and silicates has a local minimum that exposes
the central parts of the youngest protostellar systems to mid-infrared
investigations. The mid-infrared emission arises from a central source with 4
AU diameter at an averaged temperature of 700 K, deeply embedded in a dense
region with a visual extinction of Av=80-100mag.
