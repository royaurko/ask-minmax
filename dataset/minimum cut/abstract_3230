The bound state in the system of three protons and an electron (pppe) under a
homogeneous strong magnetic field where the protons are situated in the
vertices of an equilateral triangle perpendicular to the magnetic field lines
is found. It is shown that for magnetic fields B = 10^11 - 4.414x10^13 G the
potential energy curves as a function of the internuclear distance R have an
explicit minimum. For all magnetic fields studied, the binding energy of the
triangular configuration is less than the binding energy of the linear parallel
configuration (A. Turbiner et al. JETP Lett. 69, p. 844). In the contrary to
the linear case, the binding energy decreases with a magnetic field growth,
while the equilibrium internuclear distance slowly increases.
