We consider the Schur multipliers of finite dimensional nilpotent Lie
algebras. If the algebra has dimension greater than one, then the Schur
multiplier is non-zero. We give a direct proof of an upper bound for the
dimension of the Schur multiplier as a function of class and the minimum number
of generators of the algebra. We then compare this bound with another known
bound.
