This paper studies the design of codes for distributed storage systems (DSS)
that enable local repair in the event of node failure. This paper presents
locally repairable codes based on low degree multivariate polynomials. Its code
construction mechanism extends work on Noisy Interpolating Set by Dvir et al.
\cite{dvir2011}. The paper presents two classes of codes that allow node repair
to be performed by contacting 2 and 3 surviving nodes respectively. It further
shows that both classes are good in terms of their rate and minimum distance,
and allow their rate to be bartered for greater flexibility in the repair
process.
