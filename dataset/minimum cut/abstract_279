In this paper, we address the controversy regarding the recent extended solar
minimum as seen in helioseismic low- and intermediate-degree mode frequencies:
studies from different instruments identify different epochs of seismic minima.
Here we use mode frequencies from a network of six identical instruments,
Global Oscillation Network Group, continuously collecting data for more than 15
years, to investigate the epoch of minimum in solar oscillation frequencies
prior to the beginning of solar cycle 24. We include both low- and
intermediate-degree modes in the $\ell$ range of 0 -- 120 and frequency range
of 2.0 -- 3.5 mHz. In this analysis, we demonstrate that there were indeed two
minima in oscillation frequencies, depending upon the degree of modes, or more
precisely the lower turning point radius of the propagating wave. We also
analyze frequencies as a function of latitude to identify the beginning of
solar cycle 24. We observe two minima at high latitudes and a single minimum at
mid/low latitudes. This scenario is in contrast to cycle 23 where the epoch of
seismic minimum did not change with latitude or depth. Our results also hint
towards a possible role of the relic magnetic field in modifying the
oscillation frequencies of modes sampling deeper layers.
