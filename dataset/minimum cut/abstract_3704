Science projects are data publishers. The scale and complexity of current and
future science data changes the nature of the publication process. Publication
is becoming a major project component. At a minimum, a project must preserve
the ephemeral data it gathers. Derived data can be reconstructed from metadata,
but metadata is ephemeral. Longer term, a project should expect some archive to
preserve the data. We observe that pub-lished scientific data needs to be
available forever ? this gives rise to the data pyramid of versions and to data
inflation where the derived data volumes explode. As an example, this article
describes the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) strategies for data publication,
data access, curation, and preservation.
