Raman cooling of non-zero-spin atoms in the presence of gravitational and
external magnetic fields is investigated. The magnetic field is adjusted so as
to compensate for the gravitational force acting on ground-state atoms. The
dark state (DS) is created and supported in momentum space with additional
velocity-selective two-photon transitions. The minimum allowed temperature is
found to be determined only by the width of velocity selection and therefore
can be much less than the gravitational limit. A complete set of analytical
formulas describing cooling of a dilute atomic sample is derived. They serve as
the basis for numerical simulations which are carried out in the
one-dimensional (1D) case.
