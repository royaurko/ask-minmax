We report electron-spin resonance measurements in polycrystalline samples of
(Gd_{1-x}Y_{x})_2PdSi_{3}. We observe the onset of a broadening of the
linewidth and of a decrease of the resonance field at approximately twice the
Neel temperature in the paramagnetic state, this characteristic temperature
coincides with the electrical resistivity minimum. The high-temperature
behaviour of the linewidth is governed by a strong bottleneck effect.
