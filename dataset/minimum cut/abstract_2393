The concordance genus of a knot K is the minimum Seifert genus of all knots
smoothly concordant to K. Concordance genus is bounded below by the 4-ball
genus and above by the Seifert genus. We give a lower bound for the concordance
genus of K coming from the knot Floer complex of K. As an application, we prove
that there are topologically slice knots with 4-ball genus equal to one and
arbitrarily large concordance genus.
