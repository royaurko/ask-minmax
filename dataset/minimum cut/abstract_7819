We report on 8.4 GHz VLBI observations of SN2001gd in the spiral galaxy
NGC5033 made on 26 June 2002 and 8 April 2003. Our data nominally suggests a
relatively strong deceleration for the expansion of SN2001gd, but we cannot
dismiss the possibility of a free supernova expansion. From our VLBI
observations on 8 April 2003, we inferred a minimum total energy in
relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the supernova shell of E_min
=(0.3-14) 10^{47} ergs, and a corresponding equipartition average magnetic
field of B_min = (50--350) mG. We also present multiwavelength VLA measurements
of SN2001gd, which are well fit by an optically thin, synchrotron spectrum,
partially absorbed by thermal plasma. We obtain a supernova flux density of
(1.02 +/- 0.05) mJy at the observing frequency of 8.4 GHz for the second epoch,
which results in an isotropic radio luminosity of (6.0 +/- 0.3) * 10^{36} ergs
between 1.4 and 43.3 GHz, at an adopted distance of 13.1 Mpc. Finally, we
report on an XMM-Newton X-ray detection of SN2001gd on 18 December 2002. The
supernova X-ray spectrum is consistent with optically thin emission from a soft
component (associated with emission from the reverse shock) at a temperature
around 1 keV. The observed flux corresponds to an isotropic X-ray luminosity of
L_X = 1.4 +/- 0.4 * 10^{39} ergs/s in the (0.3-5) keV band. We suggest that
both radio and X-ray observations of SN2001gd indicate that a circumstellar
interaction similar to that displayed by SN1993J in M81 is taking place.
