Differential dijet cross sections are measured in photoproduction in the
region of photon virtualities Q^2 < 1 GeV^2 with the H1 detector at the HERA ep
collider using an integrated luminosity of 66.6 pb^{-1}. Jets are defined with
the inclusive k_T algorithm and a minimum transverse momentum of the leading
jet of 25 GeV is required. Dijet cross sections are measured in direct and
resolved photon enhanced regions separately. Longitudinal proton momentum
fractions up to 0.7 are reached. The data compare well with predictions from
Monte Carlo event generators based on leading order QCD and parton showers and
with next-to-leading order QCD calculations corrected for hadronisation
effects.
