The dependence of the Curie temperature Tc on nearly hydrostatic pressure has
been determined to 17.2 GPa for the weak itinerant ferromagnetic SrRuO3 in both
polycrystalline and single-crystalline form. Tc is found to decrease under
pressure from 162 K to 42.7 K at 17.2 GPa in nearly linear fashion at the rate
dTc/dP = -6.8 K/GPa. No superconductivity was found above 4 K in the pressure
range 17 to 34 GPa. Room-temperature X-ray diffraction studies to 25.3 GPa
reveal no structural phase transition but indicate that the average Ru-O-Ru
bond angle passes through a minimum near 15 GPa. The bulk modulus and its
pressure derivative were determined to be B =192(3) GPa and B' = 5.0(3),
respectively. Parallel ac susceptibility studies on polycrystalline CaRuO3 at 6
and 8 GPa pressure found no evidence for either ferromagnetism or
superconductivity above 4 K.
