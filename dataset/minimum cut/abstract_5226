We describe an FPGA based Front-End Data Acquisition Module (FEDAM) for
implementing Time-over-Threshold (ToT) Time-to-Digital conversion (TDC) of
pulses obtained from the COSMICi astroparticle telescope detector system
photomultiplier tubes. The telescope system consists of a minimum of three
scintillation detectors configured to detect particle airshowers likely
initiated by Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR). The relative time delay of
detection events between the detectors is used to estimate the angle of
incidence of the shower. The FEDAM provides time-over-threshold measurements
with a resolution of 2 ns. This allows determination of shower direction to an
error of 0.035 (cos {\theta})-1 radians where {\theta} is the angle between the
baseline axis through a pair of detectors and the plane representing the shower
front.
