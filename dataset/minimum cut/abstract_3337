We report the discovery of the binary millisecond pulsar J0514-4002A, which
is the first known pulsar in the globular cluster NGC 1851 and the first pulsar
discovered using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The pulsar has a
rotational period of 4.99 ms, an orbital period of 18.8 days, and the most
eccentric pulsar orbit yet measured (e = 0.89). The companion has a minimum
mass of 0.9 M_sun and its nature is presently unclear. After accreting matter
from a low-mass companion star which spun it up to a (few) millisecond spin
period, the pulsar eventually exchanged the low-mass star for its more massive
present companion. This is exactly the same process that could form a system
containing a millisecond pulsar and a black hole; the discovery of NGC 1851A
demonstrates that such systems might exist in the Universe, provided that
stellar mass black holes exist in globular clusters.
