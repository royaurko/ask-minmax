Rapid orbital drift of macroscopic dust particles is one of the major
obstacles against planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. We reexamine
this problem by considering porosity evolution of dust aggregates. We apply a
porosity model based on recent N-body simulations of aggregate collisions,
which allows us to study the porosity change upon collision for a wide range of
impact energies. As a first step, we neglect collisional fragmentation and
instead focus on dust evolution outside the snow line, where the fragmentation
has been suggested to be less significant than inside the snow line because of
a high sticking efficiency of icy particles. We show that dust particles can
evolve into highly porous aggregates (with internal densities of much less than
0.1 g/cm^3) even if collisional compression is taken into account. We also show
that the high porosity triggers significant acceleration in collisional growth.
This acceleration is a natural consequence of particles' aerodynamical property
at low Knudsen numbers, i.e., at particle radii larger than the mean free path
of the gas molecules. Thanks to this rapid growth, the highly porous aggregates
are found to overcome the radial drift barrier at orbital radii less than 10 AU
(assuming the minimum-mass solar nebula model). This suggests that, if
collisional fragmentation is truly insignificant, formation of icy
planetesimals is possible via direct collisional growth of submicron-sized icy
particles.
