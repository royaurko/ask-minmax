Hydrodynamics on non-commutative space is studied based on a formulation of
hydrodynamics by Y. Nambu in terms of Poisson and Nambu brackets. Replacing
these brackets by Moyal brackets with a parameter $\theta$, a new hydrodynamics
on non-commutative space is derived. It may be a step toward to find the
hydrodynamics of granular materials whose minimum volume is given by $\theta$.
To clarify this minimum volume, path integral quantization and uncertainty
relation of Nambu dynamics are examined.
