We consider a class of generalized spin coherent states by choosing the
labeling coefficients to be monopole harmonics.The latters are L2 eigenstates
of the mth spherical Landau level on the Riemann sphere with m in Z+. We verify
that the Klauder minimum properties for these states to be considered as
coherent states are satisfied. We particularize them for the case of the
Kravchuk oscillator and we obtain explicite expression for their wave
functions.The associated coherent states transforms provide us with a
Bargmann-type representation for the states of the oscillator Hilbert space.
For the lowest level m = 0 indexing monopole harmonics, we identify the
obtained coherent states to be those of Klauder-Perelomov type which were
constructed in Ref.J. Math. Phys. 48, 112106 (2007)
