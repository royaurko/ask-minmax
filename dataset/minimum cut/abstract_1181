This paper deals with many-valued modal logics, based only on the necessity
operator, over a residuated lattice. We focus on three basic classes, according
to the accessibility relation, of Kripke frames: the full class of frames
evaluated in the residuated lattice (and so defining the minimum modal logic),
the ones evaluated in the idempotent elements and the ones evaluated in 0 and
1. We show how to expand an axiomatization, with canonical constants in the
language, of a finite residuated lattice into one of the modal logic, for each
one of the three basic classes of Kripke frames, over the very lattice. And we
also give axiomatizations for the case of a finite MV chain but this time
without canonical constants.
