We present observations taken with the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch
of Reionization (PAPER) of the Centaurus A field in the frequency range 114 to
188 MHz. The resulting image has a 25' resolution, a dynamic range of 3500 and
an r.m.s. of 0.5 Jy\beam (for a beam size of 25' x 23'). A spectral index map
of Cen A is produced across the full band. The spectral index distribution is
qualitatively consistent with electron reacceleration in regions of excess
turbulence in the radio lobes, as previously identified morphologically. Hence,
there appears to be an association of 'severe weather' in radio lobes with
energy input into the relativistic electron population. We compare the PAPER
large scale radio image with the X-ray image from the ROSAT All Sky Survey.
There is a tentative correlation between radio and X-ray features at the end of
the southern lobe, some 200 kpc from the nucleus, as might be expected from
inverse Compton scattering of the CMB by the relativistic electrons also
responsible for the radio synchrotron emission. The magnetic fields derived
from the (possible) IC and radio emission are of similar magnitude to fields
derived under the minimum pressure assumptions, ~ 1 {\mu}G. However, the X-ray
field is complex, with large scale gradients and features possibly unrelated to
Cen A. If these X-ray features are unrelated to Cen A, then these fields are
lower limits.
