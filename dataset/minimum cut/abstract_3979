Supersymmetry breaking in a metastable vacuum is re-examined in a
cosmological context. It is shown that thermal effects generically drive the
Universe to the metastable minimum even if it begins in the
supersymmetry-preserving one. This is a generic feature of the ISS models of
metastable supersymmetry breaking due to the fact that SUSY preserving vacua
contain fewer light degrees of freedom than the metastable ground state at the
origin. These models of metastable SUSY breaking are thus placed on an equal
footing with the more usual dynamical SUSY breaking scenarios.
