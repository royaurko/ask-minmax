In a recent paper [I.P. Neupane and D.L. Wiltshire, Phys. Lett. B 619, 201
(2005).] we have found a new class of accelerating cosmologies arising from a
time--dependent compactification of classical supergravity on product spaces
that include one or more geometric twists along with non-trivial curved
internal spaces. With such effects, a scalar potential can have a local minimum
with positive vacuum energy. The existence of such a minimum generically
predicts a period of accelerated expansion in the four-dimensional
Einstein-conformal frame. Here we extend our knowledge of these cosmological
solutions by presenting new examples and discuss the properties of the
solutions in a more general setting. We also relate the known (asymptotic)
solutions for multi-scalar fields with exponential potentials to the
accelerating solutions arising from simple (or twisted) product spaces for
internal manifolds.
