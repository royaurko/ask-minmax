The critical currents in Josephson junctions of conventional superconductors
with macroscopic defects are calculated for different defect critical current
densities as a function of the magnetic field. We also study the evolution of
the different modes with the defect position, at zero external field. We study
the stability of the solutions and derive simple arguments, that could help the
defect characterization. In most cases a reentrant behavior is seen, where both
a maximum and a minimum current exist.
