The three-dimensional cranking model is used to investigate the microscopic
aspects of the rotation of nuclei with the tetrahedral symmetry. Two classes of
rotation axes are studied corresponding to two different discrete symmetries of
the rotating hamiltonian. Self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations
show that the tetrahedral minimum remains remarkably stable until the first
single-particle crossing.
