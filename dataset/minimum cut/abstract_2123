We present preliminary results from D^0 meson measurements through the
hadronic decay channel in minimum bias Au+Au collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200
GeV at STAR. The measurements are performed using a secondary vertexing
technique that exploits the resolution given by the Silicon detectors available
in STAR.
