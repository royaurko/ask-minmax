The data supporting neutrino oscillations are reexamined empirically,
ignoring the phase space of the usual theory. An absolutely minimum description
can be constructed easily without assuming oscillations. An empirical fit to a
simplified but representative set of neutrino problem data may require only two
free parameters; the usual oscillation theory requires as many as four.
  Free parameters used were total mass in range of a propagating neutrino,
distance travelled, and a detector profile parameter.
  The usual oscillation theory appears overcomplicated and inefficient. Even if
future data do not demand it be complicated further, it should be abandoned for
something better.
