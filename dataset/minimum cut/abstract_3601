Specific heat $C(T)$ measurements were made on single crystals of the
superconducting filled skutterudite series Pr(Os$_{1-x}$Ru$_x$)$_4$Sb$_{12}$
down to 0.6 K. Crystalline electric field fits in the normal state produced
parameters which were in agreement with previous measurements. Bulk
superconductivity was observed for all values of the Ru concentration $x$ with
transition temperatures consistent with previous experiments, confirming a
minimum in $T_{c}$ at $x=0.6$. The $C(T)$ data below $T_{c}$ appear to be more
consistent with power law behavior for $x=0$ (PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$), and with
exponential behavior for $0.05 \leq x \leq 0.2$. An enhanced electronic
specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ was observed for $x \leq 0.4$, further
supporting $x \simeq 0.6$ as a critical concentration where the physical
properties abruptly change. Significant enhancement of $\Delta C/T_{c}$ above
the weak coupling value was only observed for $x=0$ and $x=0.05$.
