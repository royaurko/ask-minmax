We evaluate the average number of locally minimal solutions for maximum-{\it
a-posteriori} (MAP) demodulation in code-division multiple-access (CDMA)
systems. For this purpose, we use a sophisticated method to investigate the
ground state properties for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick-type (i.e. fully
connected) spin glasses established by Tanaka and Edwards in 1980. We derive
the number of locally minimal solutions as a function of several parameters
which specify the CDMA multiuser MAP demodulator. We also calculate the
distribution function of the normalized-energies for the locally minimum
states. We find that for a small number of chip intervals (or equivalently a
large number of users) and large noise level at the base station, the number of
local minimum solutions becomes larger than that of the SK model. This provides
us with useful information about the computational complexity of the MAP
demodulator.
