A proposal in a weighted voting game is accepted if the sum of the
(non-negative) weights of the "yea" voters is at least as large as a given
quota. Several contributors have considered representations of weighted voting games
with minimum sum, where the weights and the quota are restricted to be
integers. Freixas and Molinero have classified all weighted voting games
without a unique minimum sum representation for up to 8 voters. Here we
exhaustively classify all weighted voting games consisting of 9 voters which do
not admit a unique minimum sum integer weight representation.
