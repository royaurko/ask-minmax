Dense Bose superfluids, as HeII, differ from dilute ones by the existence of
a roton minimum in their excitation spectrum. It is known that this roton
minimum is qualitatively responsible for density oscillations close to any
singularity, such as vortex cores, or close to solid boundaries. We show that
the period of these oscillations, and their exponential decrease with the
distance to the singularity, are fully determined by the position and the width
of the roton minimum. Only an overall amplitude factor and a phase shift are
shown to depend on the details of the interaction potential. Reciprocally, it
allows for determining the characteristics of this roton minimum from static
"observations" of a disturbed ground state, in cases where the dynamics is not
easily accessible. We focus on the vortex example. Our analysis further shows
why the energy of these oscillations is negligible compared to the kinetic
energy, which limits their influence on the vortex dynamics, except for high
curvatures.
