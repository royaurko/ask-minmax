A cellular bleb grows when a portion of the cell membrane detaches from the
underlying cortex under the influence of a cytoplasmic pressure. We develop a
quantitative model for the growth and dynamics of these objects in a simple
two-dimensional setting. In particular, we first find the minimum cytoplasmic
pressure and minimum unsupported membrane length for a stationary bleb to
nucleate and grow as a function of the membrane-cortex adhesion. We next show
how a bleb may travel around the periphery of the cell when the cytoplasmic
pressure varies in space and time in a prescribed way and find that the
traveling speed is governed by the speed of the pressure change induced by
local cortical contraction while the shape of the traveling bleb is governed by
the speed of cortical healing. Finally, we relax the assumption that the
pressure change is prescribed and couple it hydrodynamically to the cortical
contraction and membrane deformation. By quantifying the phase space of bleb
formation and dynamics, our framework serves to delineate the range and scope
of bleb-associated cell motility and synthesizes a variety of experimental
observations.
