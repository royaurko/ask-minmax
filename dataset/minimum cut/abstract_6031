We demonstrate ultra-fast (down to 400 ps) deterministic bipolar
magnetization switching of a three-terminal perpendicular Ta/CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB
magnetic tunnel junction. The critical current density rises significantly as
the current pulse shortens below 10 ns, which translates into a minimum in the
write energy in the ns range. Micromagnetic simulations qualitatively reproduce
the experimental results only when considering an enhanced damping parameter.
Our results show that SOT-MRAM allows fast, deterministic and low power write
operations, which renders it highly promising for non-volatile cache memory
applications.
