Geometrical arrangements of minimum energy of a system of identical repelling
particles in two dimensions are studied for different forms of the interaction
potential. Stability conditions for the triangular structure are derived, and
some potentials not satisfying them are discussed. It is shown that in addition
to the triangular lattice, other structures may appear (some of them with
non-trivial unit cells, and non-equivalent positions of the particles) even for
simple choices of the interaction. The same qualitative behavior is expected in
three dimensions.
