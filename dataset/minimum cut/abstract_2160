We derive an upper bound for the mean of the supremum of the empirical
process indexed by a class of functions that are known to have variance bounded
by a small constant $\delta$. The bound is expressed in the uniform entropy
integral of the class at $\delta$. The bound yields a rate of convergence of
minimum contrast estimators when applied to the modulus of continuity of the
contrast functions.
