We report theoretical calculations on the effect of the multiple orbital
contribution in high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from aligned CO$_2$ with
inclusion of macroscopic propagation of harmonic fields in the medium. Our
results show very good agreements with recent experiments for the dynamics of
the minimum in HHG spectra as laser intensity or alignment angle changes.
Calculations are carried out to check how the position of the minimum in HHG
spectra depends on the degrees of molecular alignment, laser focusing
conditions, and the effects of alignment-dependent ionization rates of the
different molecular orbitals. These analyses help to explain why the minima
observed in different experiments may vary.
