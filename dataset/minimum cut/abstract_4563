We report on the first systematic study of spin transport in bilayer graphene
(BLG) as a function of mobility, minimum conductivity, charge density and
temperature. The spin relaxation time $\tau_s$ scales inversely with the
mobility $\mu$ of BLG samples both at room temperature and at low temperature.
This indicates the importance of D'yakonov - Perel' spin scattering in BLG.
Spin relaxation times of up to 2 ns are observed in samples with the lowest
mobility. These times are an order of magnitude longer than any values
previously reported for single layer graphene (SLG). We discuss the role of
intrinsic and extrinsic factors that could lead to the dominance of
D'yakonov-Perel' spin scattering in BLG. In comparison to SLG, significant
changes in the density dependence of $\tau_s$ are observed as a function of
temperature.
