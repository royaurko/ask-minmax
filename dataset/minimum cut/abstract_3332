We review our present understanding of the physical properties of substellar
objects, brown dwarfs and irradiated or non-irradiated gaseous exoplanets. This
includes a description of their internal properties, mechanical structure and
heat content, their atmospheric properties, thermal profile and emergent
spectrum, and their evolution, in particular as irradiated companions of a
close parent star. The general theory can be used to make predictions in term
of detectability for the future observational projects. Special attention is
devoted to the evolution of the two presently detected transit planets,
HD209458B and OGLE-TR-56B. For this latter, we present a consistent evolution
for its recently revised mass and show that we reproduce the observed radius
within its error bars. We briefly discuss differences between brown dwarfs and
gaseous planets, both in terms of mass function and formation process. We
outline several arguments to show that the minimum mass for deuterium burning,
recently adopted officially as the limit to distinguish the two types of
objects, is unlikely to play any specific role in star formation, so that such
a limit is of purely semantic nature and is not supported by a physical
justification.
