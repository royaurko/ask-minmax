In this article we present the following new fact for prime p=11. For knots
6_2 and 7_2, mincol_{11} 6_2 = 5 = mincol_{11} 7_2, along with the following
feature. There is a pair of diagrams, one for 6_2 and the other one for 7_2,
each of them admitting only non-trivial 11-colorings using 5 colors, but
neither of them admitting being colored with the sets of 5 colors that color
the other one. This is in full contrast with the behavior exhibited by links
admitting non-trivial p-colorings over the smaller primes, p=2, 3, 5 or 7.
  We also prove results concerning obstructions to the minimization of colors
over generic odd moduli. We apply these to find the right colors to eliminate
from non-trivial colorings. We thus prove that 5 is the minimum number of
colors for each knot of prime determinant 11 or 13 from Rolfsen's table.
