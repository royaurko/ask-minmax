The group of local unitary transformations acts on the space of n-qubit pure
states, decomposing it into orbits. In a previous paper we proved that a
product of singlet states (together with an unentangled qubit for a system with
an odd number of qubits) achieves the smallest possible orbit dimension, equal
to 3n/2 for n even and (3n + 1)/2 for n odd, where n is the number of qubits.
In this paper we show that any state with minimum orbit dimension must be of
this form, and furthermore, such states are classified up to local unitary
equivalence by the sets of pairs of qubits entangled in singlets.
