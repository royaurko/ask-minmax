The concept of multiple partonic interactions in hadronic events is vital for
the understanding of both minimum-bias and underlying-event physics. The area
is rather little studied, however, and current models offer a far from complete
coverage, even of the effects we know ought to be there. In this article we
address one such topic, namely that of rescattering, where an already scattered
parton is allowed to take part in another subsequent scattering. A framework
for rescattering is introduced for the Pythia 8 event generator and fully
integrated with normal multiparton interactions and initial- and final-state
radiation. Using this model, the effects on event structure are studied, and
distributions are shown both for minimum-bias and jet events.
