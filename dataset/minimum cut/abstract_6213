We present new data of the dwarf galaxy NGC 1569 at 450 $\mu$m, 850 $\mu$m
and 1200$\mu$m taken with SCUBA at the JCMT and the bolometer array at the IRAM
30m telescope. After including data from IRAS at 12, 25, 60 and 100 $\mu$m, we
have successfully fitted the dust grain population model of D\'esert et al.
(1990) to the observed midinfrared-to-millimeter spectrum. The fit requires a
combination of both large and very small grains exposed to a strong radiation
field as well as an enhancement of the number of very small grains relative to
the number of large grains. We interpret this as the consequence of large grain
destruction due to shocks in the turbulent interstellar medium of NGC 1569. The
contribution of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) is found to be negligible.
Comparison of the dust emission maps with an HI map of similar resolution shows
that both dust and molecular gas distributions peak close to the radio
continuum maximum and at a minimum in the HI distribution. From a comparison of
these three maps and assuming that the gas-to-dust mass ratio is the same
everywhere, we estimate the ratio of molecular hydrogen column density to
integrated CO intensity to be about 25 -- 30 times the local Galactic value.
The gas-to-dust ratio is 1500 -- 2900, about an order of magnitude higher than
in the Solar Neighbourhood.
