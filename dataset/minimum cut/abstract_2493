Oriented chromatic number of an oriented graph $G$ is the minimum order of an
oriented graph $H$ such that $G$ admits a homomorphism to $H$. The oriented
chromatic number of an unoriented graph $G$ is the maximal chromatic number
over all possible orientations of $G$. In this paper, we prove that every Halin
graph has oriented chromatic number at most 8, improving a previous bound by
Hosseini Dolama and Sopena, and confirming the conjecture given by Vignal.
