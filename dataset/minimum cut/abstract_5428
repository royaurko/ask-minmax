The problem of inference is applied to the process of work extraction from
two constant heat capacity reservoirs, when the thermodynamic coordinates of
the process are not fully specified. The information that is lacking, includes
both the specific value of a temperature as well as the label of the reservoir
to which it is assigned. The estimates for thermal efficiency reveal that
uncertainty regarding the exact labels, reduces the maximal efficiency below
the Carnot value, its minimum value being the well known Curzon-Ahlborn value.
We also make an average estimate of the efficiency {\it before} the value of
the temperature is revealed. It is found that if the labels are known with
certainty, then in the near-equilibrium limit the efficiency scales as 1/2 of
Carnot value, while if there is maximal uncertainty in the labels, then the
average estimate for efficiency drops to 1/3 of Carnot value. We also suggest
how infered properties of the incomplete model can be mapped to a model with
complete information but with an additional source of thermodynamic
irreversibility.
