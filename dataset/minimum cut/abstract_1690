We study the electric-field induced capillary interaction of charged
particles at a polar interface. The algebraic tails of the electrostatic
pressure of each charge results in a deformation of the interface $u\sim \rho
^{-4}$. The resulting capillary interaction is repulsive and varies as $\rho
^{-6}$ with the particle distance. As a consequence, electric-field induced
capillary forces cannot be at the origin of the secondary minimum observed
recently for charged PMMA particles at on oil-water interface.
