We study supergravity inflationary models where inflation is produced along
the angular direction. For this we express the scalar component of a chiral
superfield in terms of the radial and the angular components. We then express
the supergravity potential in a form particularly simple for calculations
involving polynomial expressions for the superpotential and Kahler potential.
We show for a simple Polonyi model the angular direction may give rise to a
stage of inflation when the radial field is fixed to its minimum. We obtain
analytical expressions for all the relevant inflationary quantities and discuss
the possibility of supersymmetry breaking in the radial direction while
inflating by the angular component.
