Dijet production in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) in the range 150 < Q^2 <
35000 GeV^2 has been measured by the H1 collaboration using the Durham jet
algorithm in the laboratory frame. QCD calculations in next-to-leading order
(NLO) are found to give a good description of the data when requiring a small
minimum jet separation, which selects a dijet sample containing 1/3 of DIS
events in contrast to approximately 1/10 with more typical jet analyses.
