This paper revisits the Maxwell Demon Problem. Representing the demon with a
simple physical computer composed of a single memory element, we demonstrate
that the average minimum entropy increase of the universe due to sorting of
particles with a Maxwell Demon is eta=0.8400 for particles that are initially
randomly distributed.
