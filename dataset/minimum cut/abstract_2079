STAR preliminary results of di-hadron correlations versus $\phi_{s}$, the
trigger particle azimuthal angle relative to the constructed event plane are
reported for mid-central Au+Au collisions and compared to central Au+Au as well
as minimum bias d+Au collisions. The correlations are observed to vary with
$\phi_{s}$ on both the near and away side of the trigger particle. The
away-side correlation evolves from single- to double-peak with increasing
$\phi_{s}$. The near-side correlation is separated into 'jet' and 'ridge': the
ridge is found to decrease with $\phi_{s}$ while the jet remains relatively
constant.
