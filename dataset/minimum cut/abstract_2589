In this paper, we develop a general parametrization technique for calculating
Adomian polynomials for several nonlinear operators. Some important properties
of Adomian polynomials are also discussed and illustrated with examples. We
develop two new parametrization methods for calculating Adomian polynomials,
which utilize the orthogonality of functions $\{e^{inx}, n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$.
These methods require minimum computation, are easy to implement and generate
Adomian polynomials in fewer steps. These methods are then extended to
multivariable case also. Examples of different forms of nonlinearity, which
include Navier Stokes equation and time fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation, are considered and explicit expression for the $n$-th order Adomian
polynomials are obtained.
