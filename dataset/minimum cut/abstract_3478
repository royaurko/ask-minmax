We study a generic model of interacting fermions in a finite-sized disordered
system. We show that the off-diagonal interaction matrix elements induce
density of states fluctuations which generically favor a minimum spin ground
state at large interaction amplitude, $U$. This effect competes with the
exchange effect which favors large magnetization at large $U$, and it
suppresses this exchange magnetization in a large parameter range. When
off-diagonal fluctuations dominate, the model predicts a spin gap which is
larger for odd-spin ground states as for even-spin, suggesting a simple
experimental signature of this off-diagonal effect in Coulomb blockade
transport measurements.
