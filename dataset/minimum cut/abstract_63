The minimum distance graph of a code has the codewords as vertices and edges
exactly when the Hamming distance between two codewords equals the minimum
distance of the code. A constructive proof for reconstructibility of an
extended perfect binary one-error-correcting code from its minimum distance
graph is presented. Consequently, inequivalent such codes have nonisomorphic
minimum distance graphs. Moreover, it is shown that the automorphism group of a
minimum distance graph is isomorphic to that of the corresponding code.
