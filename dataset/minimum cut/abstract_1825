We calculate the screening potential of a fast parton moving through a
quark-gluon plasma in the framework of semi-classical transport theory. We
found an anisotropic potential showing a minimum in the direction of the parton
velocity. Possible consequences of this potential on binary states in a
quark-gluon plasma are discussed.
