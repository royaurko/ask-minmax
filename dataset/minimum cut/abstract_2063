Modulated DSC measurements on bulk (Na2O)x(GeO2)1-x glasses show a sharp
reversibility window in the 14% < x < 19% soda range, which correlates well
with a broad global minimum in molar volumes. Raman and IR reflectance TO and
LO mode frequencies exhibit anomalies between xc(1) = 14% (stress transition)
and xc(2) = 19% (rigidity transition), with optical elasticity power-laws
confirming the nature of the transitions . Birefringence measurements dramatize
the macroscopically stress-free nature of the Intermediate Phase in the
reversibility window.
