I calculate the parity violating asymmetry A_{pv} for elastic electron
scattering from 27Al in order to compare with the Qweak experiment "background"
27Al measurement. I find that Coulomb distortions, and the quadrupole form
factor, reduce A_{pv} near the diffraction minimum. The Qweak data can be used
to confirm the neutron radius of 27Al, if nuclear structure uncertainties are
indeed small, as I suggest, and one can estimate inelastic and impurity
contributions. This could provide an important check of the measurement,
analysis, and theory.
