One of the most striking aspects of the 11-year sunspot cycle is that there
have been times in the past when some cycles went missing, a most well-known
example of this being the Maunder minimum during 1645-1715. Analyses of
cosmogenic isotopes (C14 and Be10) indicated that there were about 27 grand
minima in the last 11,000 yr, implying that about 2.7% of the solar cycles had
conditions appropriate for forcing the Sun into grand minima. We address the
question how grand minima are produced and specifically calculate the frequency
of occurrence of grand minima from a theoretical dynamo model. We assume that
fluctuations in the poloidal field generation mechanism and the meridional
circulation produce irregularities of sunspot cycles. Taking these fluctuations
to be Gaussian and estimating the values of important parameters from the data
of last 28 solar cycles, we show from our flux transport dynamo model that
about 1-4% of the sunspot cycles may have conditions suitable for inducing
grand minima.
