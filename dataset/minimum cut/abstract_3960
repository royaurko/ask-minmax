Behavior of static axially symmetric monopole-antimonopole and vortex ring
solutions of the SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in an external uniform magnetic
field is considered. It is argued that the axially symmetric
monopole-antimonopole chains and vortex rings can be treated as a bounded
electromagnetic system of the magnetic charges and the electric current rings.
The magnitude of the external field is a parameter which may be used to test
the structure of the static potential of the effective electromagnetic
interaction between the monopoles with opposite orientation in the group space.
It is shown that for a non-BPS solutions there is a local minimum of this
potential.
