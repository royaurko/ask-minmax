An $L(1,1)$-labeling of a graph $G$ is an assignment of labels from $\{0,1
\cdots, k \}$ to the vertices of $G$ such that two vertices that are adjacent
or have a common neighbor receive distinct labels. The $\lambda_1^1-$ number,
$\lambda_1^1(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum value $k$ such that $G$ admits an
$L(1,1)$ labeling. We establish the $\lambda_1^1-$ numbers for direct product
of cycles $C_m \times C_n$ for all positive $m, n \geq 3$, where both $m,n$ are
even or when one of them is even and the other odd.
