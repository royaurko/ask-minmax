The potential energy of a system in stable equilibrium has a minimum value.
This property is used to derive a formula that is useful in determi- nation of
stability of a floating body. It is found that a floating body is in stable
equilibrium if its center of gravity has a minimum height with respect to its
related center of buoyancy.
