We present the exact solutions to the equations of the lowest energy states
of the colored and color-symmetric sectors of the Bonn quark model, which is
SU(3) symmetric and is defined in terms of an effective pairing force with
$su(4)$ algebraic structure. We show that the groundstate of the model is not
color symmetrical except for a narrow interval in the range of possible quark
numbers. We also study the performance of the Glauber coherent state, as well
as of superconducting states of the BCS type, with respect to the description,
not only of the absolute (colored) groundstate, but also of the minimum energy
state of the color-symmetrical sector, finding that it is remarkably good. We
use the model to discuss, in a schematic context, some controversial aspects of
the conventional treatment of color superconductivity.
