We approximate a given rational spectral density by one that is consistent
with prescribed second-order statistics. Such an approximation is obtained by
minimizing a suitable distance from the given spectrum and under the
constraints corresponding to imposing the given second-order statistics. Here,
we consider the Alpha divergence family as a distance measure. We show that the
corresponding approximation problem leads to a family of rational solutions.
Secondly, such a family contains the solution which generalizes the
Kullback-Leibler solution proposed by Georgiou and Lindquist in 2003. Finally,
numerical simulations suggest that this family contains solutions close to the
non-rational solution given by the principle of minimum discrimination
information.
