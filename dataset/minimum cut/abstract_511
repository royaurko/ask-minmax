We investigate a hierarchy of arithmetical structures obtained by a
transfinite addition of a canonic universal predicate, where the canonic
universal predicate for M is defined as a minimum universal predicate for M in
terms of definability. We determine the upper bound of the hierarchy and give a
characterisation for the sets definable in the hierarchy.
