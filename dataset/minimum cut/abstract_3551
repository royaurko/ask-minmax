Recognising the difficulties in systematic understanding of the physical
characteristics of strongly correlated f-electron systems, we considered it
worthwhile to subject the so-called "normal" f-electron systems like those of
Gd to careful investigations. We find that the spin-disorder contribution to
electrical resistivity ($\rho$) in the paramagnetic state, instead of remaining
contant, surprisingly increases with decreasing temperature (T) in the
paramagnetic state in some of the Gd alloys. In some cases, this "excess
resistance" is so large that a distinct minimum in the plot of $\rho$ versus T
can be seen, mimicking the behaviour of Kondo lattices. This excess resistance
can be suppressed by the application of a magnetic field, naturally resulting
in large magnetoresistance. In addition, these alloys are found to exhibit
heavy-fermion-like heat-capacity behavior. These unusual findings imply
hither-to-unexplored electron correlation effects even in Gd-based alloys.
