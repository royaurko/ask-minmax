This paper addresses the following question for a given graph $H$: what is
the minimum number $f(H)$ such that every graph with average degree at least
$f(H)$ contains $H$ as a minor? Due to connections with Hadwiger's Conjecture,
this question has been studied in depth when $H$ is a complete graph. Kostochka
and Thomason independently proved that $f(K_t)=ct\sqrt{\ln t}$. More generally,
Myers and Thomason determined $f(H)$ when $H$ has a super-linear number of
edges. We focus on the case when $H$ has a linear number of edges. Our main
result, which complements the result of Myers and Thomason, states that if $H$
has $t$ vertices and average degree $d$ at least some absolute constant, then
$f(H)\leq 3.895\sqrt{\ln d}\,t$. Furthermore, motivated by the case when $H$
has small average degree, we prove that if $H$ has $t$ vertices and $q$ edges,
then $f(H) \leq t+6.291q$ (where the coefficient of 1 in the $t$ term is best
possible).
