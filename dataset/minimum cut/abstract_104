Stationary, axisymmetric, vacuum, solutions of Einstein's equations are
obtained as critical points of the total mass among all axisymmetric and
$(t,\phi)$ symmetric initial data with fixed angular momentum. In this
variational principle the mass is written as a positive definite integral over
a spacelike hypersurface. It is also proved that if absolute minimum exists
then it is equal to the absolute minimum of the mass among all maximal,
axisymmetric, vacuum, initial data with fixed angular momentum. Arguments are
given to support the conjecture that this minimum exists and is the extreme
Kerr initial data.
