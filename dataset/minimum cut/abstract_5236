We have studied the dependence of the superconducting (SC) transition
temperature on the mutual orientation of magnetizations of Fe1 and Fe2 layers
in the spin valve system CoO_x/Fe1/Cu/Fe2/Pb. We find that this dependence is
nonmonotonic when passing from the parallel to the antiparallel case and
reveals a distinct minimum near the orthogonal configuration. The analysis of
the data in the framework of the SC triplet spin valve theory gives direct
evidence for the long-range triplet superconductivity arising due to
noncollinearity of the two magnetizations.
