The Suzaku X-ray observatory monitored the supermassive binary system Eta
Carinae 10 times during the whole 5.5 year orbital cycle between 2005-2011.
This series of observations presents the first long-term monitoring of this
enigmatic system in the extremely hard X-ray band between 15-40 keV. During
most of the orbit, the 15-25 keV emission varied similarly to the 2-10 keV
emission, indicating an origin in the hard energy tail of the kT ~4 keV
wind-wind collision (WWC) plasma. However, the 15-25 keV emission declined only
by a factor of 3 around periastron when the 2-10 keV emission dropped by two
orders of magnitude due probably to an eclipse of the WWC plasma. The observed
minimum in the 15-25 keV emission occurred after the 2-10 keV flux had already
recovered by a factor of ~3. This may mean that the WWC activity was strong,
but hidden behind the thick primary stellar wind during the eclipse. The 25-40
keV flux was rather constant through the orbital cycle, at the level measured
with INTEGRAL in 2004. This result may suggest a connection of this flux
component to the gamma-ray source detected in this field. The Helium-like Fe
Kalpha line complex at ~6.7 keV became strongly distorted toward periastron as
seen in the previous cycle. The 5-9 keV spectra can be reproduced well with a
two-component spectral model, which includes plasma in collision equilibrium
(CE) and a plasma in non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) with tau ~1e11 cm-3 s-1.
The NEI plasma increases in importance toward periastron.
