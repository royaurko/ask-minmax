We studied lasing modes in a disordered photonic crystal. The scaling of the
lasing threshold with the system size depends on the strength of disorder. For
sufficiently large size, the minimum of the lasing threshold occurs at some
finite value of disorder strength. The highest random cavity quality factor was
comparable to that of an intentionally introduced single defect. At the
minimum, the lasing threshold showed a super-exponential decrease with the size
of the system. We explain it through a migration of the lasing mode frequencies
toward the photonic bandgap center, where the localization length takes the
minimum value. Random lasers with exponentially low thresholds are predicted.
