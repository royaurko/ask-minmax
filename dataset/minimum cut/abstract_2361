We investigate the dynamics of a d-dimensional domain wall (DW) in a
d+1-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) bulk. Exact effective potential
induced by the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term on the wall is derived. In the absence of
the GB term we recover the familiar gravitational and anti-harmonic oscillator
potentials. Inclusion of the GB correction gives rise to a minimum radius of
bounce for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe expanding with a
negative pressure on the DW.
