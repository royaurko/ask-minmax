A chiral polyhedron with Schl\"afli symbol $\{p, q\}$ is called tight if it
has $2pq$ flags, which is the minimum possible. In this paper, we fully
characterize the Schl\"afli symbols of tight chiral polyhedra. We also provide
presentations for the automorphism groups of several families of tight chiral
polyhedra.
