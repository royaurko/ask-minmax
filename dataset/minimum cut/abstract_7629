In wireless cellular networks with densely deployed base stations, knowing
the velocities of mobile devices is a key to avoid call drops and improve the
quality of service to the user equipments (UEs). A simple and efficient way to
estimate a UE's velocity is by counting the number of handovers made by the UE
during a predefined time window. Indeed, handover-count based mobility state
detection has been standardized since Long Term Evolution (LTE) Release-8
specifications. The increasing density of small cells in wireless networks can
help in accurate estimation of velocity and mobility state of a UE. In this
paper, we model densely deployed small cells using stochastic geometry, and
then analyze the statistics of the number of handovers as a function of UE
velocity, small-cell density, and handover count measurement time window. Using
these statistics, we derive approximations to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)
for the velocity estimate of a UE. Also, we determine a minimum variance
unbiased (MVU) velocity estimator whose variance tightly matches with the CRLB.
Using this velocity estimator, we formulate the problem of detecting the
mobility state of a UE as low, medium, or high-mobility, as in LTE
specifications. Subsequently, we derive the probability of correctly detecting
the mobility state of a UE. Our analysis shows that the accuracy of velocity
estimation and mobility state detection increases with increasing small cell
density and with increasing handover count measurement time window.
