Informatics world digitizes the human beings, with the contribution made by
all the industrial people. In the recent survey it is proved that people are
not accustomed or they are not able to access the electronic devices to its
extreme usage. Also people are more dependent to the technologies and their
day-to-day activities are ruled by the same. In this paper we discuss on one of
the advanced technology which will soon rule the world and make the people are
more creative and at the same time hassle-free. This concept is introduced as
6th sense technology by an IIT, Mumbai student who is presently Ph.D., scholar
in MIT, USA. Similar to this research there is one more research going on under
the title Augmented Reality. This research makes a new association with the
real world to digital world and allows us to share and manipulate the
information directly with our mental thoughts. A college which implements state
of the art technology for teaching and learning, Higher College of Technology,
Muscat, (HCT) tries to identify the opportunities and limitations of
implementing this augmented reality for teaching and learning. The research
team of HCT, here, tries to give two scenarios in which augmented reality can
fit in. Since this research is in the conceptual level we are trying to
illustrate the history of this technology and how it can be adopted in the
teaching environment
