We consider a hybrid scalar field which is non-minimally coupled to the
matter and models a chameleon cosmology. By introducing an effective potential,
we study the dependence of the effective potential's minimum and hybrid
chameleon field's masses to the local matter density. In a dynamical system
technique, we analyze the phase space of this two-field chameleon model, find
its fixed points and study their stability. We show that the hybrid chameleon
domination solution is a stable attractor and the universe in this setup
experiences a phantom divide crossing.
