The physiology of voltage gated ion channels is complex and insights into
their gating mechanism is incomplete. Their function is best represented by
Markov models with relatively large number of distinct states that are
connected by thermodynamically feasible transitions. On the other hand, popular
models such as the one of Hodgkin and Huxley have empirical assumptions that
are generally unrealistic. Experimental protocols often dictate the number of
states in proposed Markov models, thus creating disagreements between various
observations on the same channel. Here we aim to propose a limit to the minimum
number of states required to model ion channels by employing a paradigm to
define stationary conductance in a class of ion-channels. A simple expression
is generated using concepts in elementary thermodynamics applied to protein
conformational transitions. Further, it matches well many published channel
current-voltage characteristics and parameters of the model are found to be
identifiable and easily determined from usual experimental protocols.
