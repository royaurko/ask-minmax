The advent of sensor networks presents untapped opportunities for synthesis.
We examine the problem of synthesis of behavioral specifications into networks
of programmable sensor blocks. The particular behavioral specification we
consider is an intuitive user-created network diagram of sensor blocks, each
block having a pre-defined combinational or sequential behavior. We synthesize
this specification to a new network that utilizes a minimum number of
programmable blocks in place of the pre-defined blocks, thus reducing network
size and hence network cost and power. We focus on the main task of this
synthesis problem, namely partitioning pre-defined blocks onto a minimum number
of programmable blocks, introducing the efficient but effective PareDown
decomposition algorithm for the task. We describe the synthesis and simulation
tools we developed. We provide results showing excellent network size
reductions through such synthesis, and significant speedups of our algorithm
over exhaustive search while obtaining near-optimal results for 15 real network
designs as well as nearly 10,000 randomly generated designs.
