HD 89744 is an F7 V star with mass 1.4 M, effective temperature 6166 K, age
2.0 Gy and metallicity [Fe/H]= 0.18. The radial velocity of the star has been
monitored with the AFOE spectrograph at the Whipple Observatory since 1996, and
evidence has been found for a low mass companion. The data were complemented by
additional data from the Hamilton spectrograph at Lick Observatory during the
companion's periastron passage in fall 1999. As a result, we have determined
the star's orbital wobble to have period P = 256 d, orbital amplitude K = 257
m/s, and eccentricity e = 0.7. From the stellar mass we infer that the
companion has minimum mass m2 sin i = 7.2 MJup in an orbit with semi-major axis
a2 = 0.88 AU. The eccentricity of the orbit, among the highest known for
extra-solar planets, continues the trend that extra-solar planets with
semi-major axes greater than about 0.15 AU tend to have much higher
eccentricities than are found in our solar system. The high metallicity of the
parent star reinforces the trend that parent stars of extra-solar planets tend
to have high metallicity
