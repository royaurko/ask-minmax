The fast (ms) radio bursts reported by Thornton, {\it et al.} have extremely
high brightness temperatures if at the inferred cosmological distances. This
implies coherent emission by "bunches" of charges. We model the emission region
as a screen of dipole radiators resonant at the frequency of observation and
calculate the necessary charge bunching. From this we infer the minimum
electron energy required to overcome electrostatic repulsion. The FRB, like the
giant pulses of the Crab pulsar, display banded spectra that may be harmonics
of plasma frequency emission by plasma turbulence. If FRB are the counterparts
of comparatively frequent Galactic events, these may be detected by radio
telescopes in their far sidelobes or by small arrays of dipoles.
