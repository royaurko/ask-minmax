The forthcoming 5G cellular network is expected to overlay millimeter-wave
(mmW) transmissions with the incumbent micro-wave ($\mu$W) architecture. The
overall mm-$\mu$W resource management should therefore harmonize with each
other. This paper aims at maximizing the overall downlink (DL) rate with a
minimum uplink (UL) rate constraint, and concludes: mmW tends to more focus on
DL transmissions while $\mu$W has high priority for complementing UL, under
time-division duplex (TDD) mmW operations. Such UL dedication of $\mu$W results
from the limited use of mmW UL bandwidth due to high peak-to-average power
ratio (PAPR) at mobile users. To further relieve this UL bottleneck, we propose
mmW UL decoupling that allows a $\mu$W base station (BS) to receive mmW
signals. Its impact on mm-$\mu$W resource management is provided in a tractable
way by virtue of a novel closed-form mm-$\mu$W spectral efficiency (SE)
derivation. In an ultra-dense cellular network (UDN), our derivation verifies
mmW (or $\mu$W) SE is a logarithmic function of BS-to-user density ratio. This
strikingly simple yet practically valid analysis is enabled by exploiting
stochastic geometry in conjunction with real three dimensional (3D) building
blockage statistics in Seoul, Korea.
