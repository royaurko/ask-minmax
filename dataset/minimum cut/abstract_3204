We present here space-based VLBI observations with VSOP and a southern
hemisphere ground array of the gamma-ray blazar NRAO 530 at 1.6 GHz and 5 GHz.
The brightness temperature of the core at 1.6 GHz is $5 \times 10^{11}$ K. The
size is near the minimum observable value in the direction of NRAO~530 due to
interstellar scattering. The 5 GHz data show a single component with a
brightness temperature of $\sim 3 \times 10^{12}$ K, significantly in excess of
the inverse Compton limit and of the equipartition brightness temperature limit
(Readhead 1994). This is strong evidence for relativistic motion in a jet
requiring model-dependent Doppler boosting factors in the range 6 to 60. We
show that a simple homogeneous sphere probably does not model the emission
region accurately. We favor instead an inhomogeneous jet model with a Doppler
boosting factor of 15.
