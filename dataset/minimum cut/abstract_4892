In this paper, we present a method of constructing new families of LDPC block
code ensembles formed by terminating irregular protograph-based LDPC
convolutional codes. Using the accumulate-repeat-by-4-jagged-accumulate (AR4JA)
protograph as an example, a density evolution analysis for the binary erasure
channel shows that this flexible design technique gives rise to a large
selection of LDPC block code ensembles with varying code rates and thresholds
close to capacity. Further, by means of an asymptotic weight enumerator
analysis, we show that all the ensembles in this family also have minimum
distance that grows linearly with block length, i.e., they are asymptotically
good.
