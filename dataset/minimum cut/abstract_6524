The P-matrix approach for the determination of the orbit spaces of compact
linear groups enabled to determine all orbit spaces of compact coregular linear
groups with up to 4 basic polynomial invariants and, more recently, all orbit
spaces of compact non-coregular linear groups with up to 3 basic invariants.
This approach does not involve the knowledge of the group structure of the
single groups but it is very general, so after the determination of the orbit
spaces one has to determine the corresponding groups. In this article it is
reviewed the main ideas underlying the P-matrix approach and it is reported the
list of linear irreducible finite groups and of linear compact simple Lie
groups, with up to 4 basic invariants, together with their orbit spaces. Some
general properties of orbit spaces of coregular groups are also discussed. This
article will deal only with the mathematical aspect, however one must keep in
mind that the stratification of the orbit spaces represents the possible
schemes of symmetry breaking and that the phase transitions appear when the
minimum of an invariant potential function shifts from one stratum to another,
so the exact knowledge of the orbit spaces and their stratifications might be
useful to single out some yet hidden properties of phase transitions.
