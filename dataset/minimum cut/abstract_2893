In 2008, researchers at the Hewlett-Packard (HP) laboratories claimed to have
found an analytical physical model for a genuine memristor device [1]. The
model is considered for a thin TiO_2 film containing a region which is highly
self-doped with oxygen vacancies and a region which is less doped, i.e., a
single-phase material with a built-in chemical inhomogeneity sandwiched between
two platinum electrodes. On base of the proposed model, Strukov et al. [1] were
able to obtain the characteristic dynamical state equation and current-voltage
relation for a genuine memristor. However, some fundamental facts of
electrochemistry have been overlooked by the contributors while putting forward
their model, namely the coupling of diffusion currents at the boundary between
both regions. The device will operate for a certain time like a "chemical
capacitor" until the chemical inhomogeneity is balanced out, thus violating the
essential requirement on a genuine memristor, the so-called "no energy
discharge property". Moreover, the dynamical state equation for the
HP-memristor device must fail as this relation violates by itself Landauer's
principle of the minimum energy costs for information processing. Maybe, such
an approach might be upheld if one introduces an additional prerequisite by
specifying the minimum amount of electric power input to the device which is
required to continuously change internal, physical states of the considered
system. However, we have reasonable doubts with regard to this.
