The observation of blank fields, defined as regions of the sky that are
devoid of stars down to a given threshold magnitude, constitutes one of the
most relevant calibration procedures required for the proper reduction of
astronomical data obtained following typical observing strategies. In this
work, we have used the Delaunay triangulation to search for deep blank fields
throughout the whole sky, with a minimum size of 10 arcmin in diameter and an
increasing threshold magnitude from 15 to 18 in the R band of the USNO-B
Catalog of the United States Naval Observatory. The result is a catalogue with
the deepest blank fields known so far. A short sample of these regions has been
tested with the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias, and it has been shown to be
extremely useful for medium and large size telescopes. Because some of the
regions found could also be suitable for new extragalactic studies, we have
estimated the galactic extinction in the direction of each deep blank field.
This catalogue is accessible through the Virtual Observatory tool TESELA, and
the user can retrieve - and visualize using Aladin - the deep blank fields
available near a given position in the sky.
