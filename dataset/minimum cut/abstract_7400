The joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) filter is a popular tracking
methodology for problems involving well-spaced targets, but it is rarely
applied in problems with closely-spaced targets due to its complexity in these
cases, and due to the well-known phenomenon of coalescence. This paper
addresses these difficulties using random finite sets (RFSs) and variational
inference, deriving a highly tractable, approximate method for obtaining the
multi-Bernoulli distribution that minimises the set Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence from the true posterior, working within the RFS framework to
incorporate uncertainty in target existence. The derivation is interpreted as
an application of expectation-maximisation (EM), where the missing data is the
correspondence of Bernoulli components (i.e., tracks) under each data
association hypothesis. The missing data is shown to play an identical role to
the selection of an ordered distribution in the same ordered family in the set
JPDA algorithm. Subsequently, a special case of the proposed method is utilised
to provide an efficient approximation of the minimum mean optimal sub-pattern
assignment estimator. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated
in challenging scenarios in which up to twenty targets come into close
proximity.
