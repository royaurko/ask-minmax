Flux-creep data was obtained for fields along the second magnetization peak
observed in M(H) curves of BaFe{1.9}Ni{0.1}As2 for H||c-axis. H||ab-planes and
H forming a 45 degrees angle with ab-planes. The M-H loops from the different
field directions can be collapsed onto a universal curve with a scaling factor
equivalent to the superconducting anisotropy, showing that the pinning is three
dimensional, although with remarkable differences in the vortex-dynamics as a
function of field orientation. The resulting relaxation rate, R, when plotted
as a function of field and temperature does not show any specific feature in
the vicinity of the second magnetization peak field Hp, the relaxation shows a
maximum at a field H_2 well above Hp for H||c and a minimum at H^* for fields
well below Hp for H||ab$ and H$-45-ab. Isofield plots of the scaled activation
energy obtained from flux-creep data at several different temperatures also do
not show any evidence of a change in the pinning mechanism as the peak field is
crossed. The Hp lines in the resulting phase diagrams do not appear to be
consistent with a description-terms of a collective-plastic pinning crossover.
