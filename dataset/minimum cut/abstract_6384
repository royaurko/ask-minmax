We discuss the occurrence of crossing points in the magnetization -
temperature $(m,T$) plane within the framework of critical phenomena. It is
shown that in a two-dimensional superconducting slab of thickness $d_{s}$
$m_{z}(\delta)$ versus temperature $T$ curves measured in different fields
$\mathbf{H} = H(0,\sin (\delta) ,\cos (\delta))$ will cross at the critical
temperature T_c of the slab. In contrast, in a 3D anisotropic bulk
superconductor the crossing point occurs in the plot $m_{z}(\delta)
/H_{z}^{1/2}$ versus $T$. The experimental facts that 2D crossing point
features have been observed in ceramics and in single crystals for $\mathbf{H}$
close to $\mathbf{H} = H(0,0,1)$, but not for $\mathbf{H} = H(0,1,0)$, is
explained in terms of an angle-dependent crossover field separating the regions
where 2D or 3D thermal fluctuations dominate. The measured 2D-crossing point
data are used to estimate one of the fundamental parameters of cuprate
superconductors, the minimum thickness of the slab $(d_{s})$, which remains
superconducting. Our estimates, based on experimental 2D-crossing point data
for single crystals, reveal that this length adopts material dependent values.
Therefore, experimental data for T_c and $\lambda_{\Vert}^{2}(T=0)$, plotted in
terms of T_c versus $1/\lambda_{\Vert}^{2}(T=0)$ will not tend to a straight
line with universal slope as the underdoped limit is approached. Implications
for magnetic torque measurements are also worked out.
