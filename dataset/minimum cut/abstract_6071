We report the first extragalactic detection of the neutral carbon [CI]
3P2-3P1 fine structure line at 809 GHz. The line was observed towards M82
simultaneously with the 3P1-3P0 line at 492 GHz, providing a precise
measurement of the J=2-1/J=1-0 integrated line ratio of 0.96 (on a [K km s^-1]
-scale). This ratio constrains the [CI] emitting gas to have a temperature of
at least 50 K and a density of at least 10^4 cm^-3. Already at this minimum
temperature and density, the beam averaged CI-column density is large, 2.1
10^18 cm^-2, confirming the high CI/CO abundance ratio of approximately 0.5
estimated earlier from the 492 GHz line alone. We argue that the [CI] emission
from M82 most likely arises in clouds of linear size around a few pc with a
density of about 10^4 cm^-3 or slightly higher and temperatures of 50 K up to
about 100 K.
