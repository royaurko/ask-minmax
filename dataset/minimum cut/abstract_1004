We propose a simple picture for the occurrence of superconductivity and the
pressure dependence of the superconducting critical temperature, T_{SC}, in
ZrZn_2. According to our hypothesis the pairing potential is independent of
pressure, but the exchange splitting, E_{xc}, leads to a pressure dependence in
the (spin dependent) density of states at the Fermi level,
D_\sigma(\epsilon_F). Assuming p-wave pairing T_{SC} is dependent on
D_\sigma(\epsilon_F) which ensures that, in the absence of non-magnetic
impurities, T_{SC} decreases as pressure is applied until it reaches a minimum
in the paramagnetic state. Disorder reduces this minimum to zero, this gives
the illusion that the superconductivity disappears at the same pressure as
ferromagnetism does.
