This work provides additional evidence on the involvement of exotic particles
like axions and/or other WISPs, following recent measurements during the
quietest Sun and flaring Sun. Thus, SPHINX mission observed a minimum basal
soft X-rays emission in the extreme solar minimum in 2009. The same scenario
(with ~17 meV axions) fits also the dynamical behaviour of white-light solar
flares, like the measured spectral components in the visible and in soft
X-rays, and, the timing between them. Solar chameleons remain a viable
candidate, since they may preferentially convert to photons in outer space.
