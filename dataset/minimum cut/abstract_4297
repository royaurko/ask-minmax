We study concretely several issues altogether, moduli stabilization, the
dynamical supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking, the uplifting of SUSY anti-de Sitter
(AdS) vacuum and the sequestering of hidden sector, in a simple supergravity
model with a single extra dimension. The sequestering is achieved dynamically
by a wavefunction localization in extra dimension. The expressions for the
visible sector soft SUSY breaking terms as well as the hidden sector potential
are shown explicitly in our model. We find that the tree-level soft scalar mass
and the A-term can be suppressed at a SUSY breaking Minkowski minimum where the
radius modulus is stabilized, while gaugino masses would be a mirage type.
