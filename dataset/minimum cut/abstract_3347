We present high S/N spectra of the H-beta region in 17 intermediate redshift
(0.85 le z le 2.5) quasars. The spectra represent first results of our campaign
to test the redshift/luminosity robustness of the so-called Eigenvector 1 (E1)
parameter space as developed for low redshift AGN in Sulentic et al. (2000).
The new quasars span the luminosity range -26 ge M_B ge -29 while most of our
low redshift sample (n=215) involve sources in the range -19 ge M_B ge -26. The
high redshift sources show E1 parameter values and domain occupation that are
similar to our low redshift sample supporting earlier findings that E1
parameters are uncorrelated with source luminosity. Elementary accretion theory
can account for a systematic increase of the minimum observed H-beta profile
width with source luminosity. Narrow line Seyfert 1 sources with M_B = -28 show
FWHM(H-beta) as much as 2000 km/s broader than those with M_B = -22. A possible
change in the higher redshift/luminosity sources involves systematically weaker
