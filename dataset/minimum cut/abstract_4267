First principles calculations based on the density functional theory within
the local spin density approximation plus U(LSDA+U)scheme, show rhombohedral
Bi$_2$FeTiO$_6$ is a potential multiferroic in which the magnetism and
ferroelectricity coexist . A ferromagnetic configuration with magnetic moment
of 4 $\mu_B$ per formula unit have been reported with respect to the minimum
total energy. Spontaneous polarization of 27.3 $\mu$ C/cm$^2$, caused mainly by
the ferroelectric distortions of Ti, was evaluated using the berry phase
approach in the modern theory of polarization. The Bi-6s stereochemical
activity of long-pair and the `d$^0$-ness' criterion in off-centring of Ti were
coexisting in the predicted new system. In view of the oxidation state of
Bi$^{3+}$,Fe$^{2+}$,Ti$^{4+}$, and O$^{2-}$ from the orbital-resolved density
of states of the Bi-6p, Fe-3d,Ti-3d, and O-2p states,the valence state of
Bi$_2$FeTiO$_6$ in the rhombohedral phase was found to be
Bi$_2$$^{3+}$Fe$^{2+}$Ti$^{4+}$O$_6$.
