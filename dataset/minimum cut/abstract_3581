By mid 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is epected to
launch its final recommendations on minimum capital requirements in the banking
industry. Although there is the intention to arrive at capital charges which
concur with economic intuition, the risk weight formulas proposed by the
committee will lack an adequate treatment of concentration risks in credit
portfolios. The question arises whether this problem can be solved without
recourse to fully-fledged portfolio models. Since recent practical experience
shows that the risk measure Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is particularly
well suited for detecting concentrations, we develop the semi-asymptotic
approach by Emmer and Tasche in the CVaR context and compare it with the
capital charges recently suggested by the Basel Committee. Both approaches are
based on the same Vasicek one-factor model.
