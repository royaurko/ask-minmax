The study of the sphericity of primary charged particles in minimum bias
proton-proton collisions at 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV with the ALICE detector at the
LHC is presented. The mean sphericity as a function of multiplicity is reported
for events with different hardness. The ALICE results show a growing transverse
sphericity with multiplicity for all collision energies, with a steeper rise at
low multiplicity. The tendency of the MC generators is opposite at high
multiplicity.
