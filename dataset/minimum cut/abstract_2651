New bounds on the cardinality of permutation codes equipped with the Ulam
distance are presented. First, an integer-programming upper bound is derived,
which improves on the Singleton-type upper bound in the literature for some
lengths. Second, several probabilistic lower bounds are developed, which
improve on the known lower bounds for large minimum distances. The results of a
computer search for permutation codes are also presented.
