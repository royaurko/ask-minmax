We investigate the electronic transport properties of a
ferromagnet/normal/ferromagnet junction on the surface of a topological
insulator with a gate voltage exerted on the normal segment. It is found that
the conductance oscillates with the width of normal segment and gate voltage,
and the maximum of conductance gradually decreases while the minimum of
conductance approaches zero as the width increases. The conductance can be
controlled by tuning the gate voltage like a spin field-effect transistor. It
is found that the magnetoresistance ratio can be very large, and can also be
negative owing to the anomalous transport. In addition, when there exists a
magnetization component in the surface plane, it is shown that only the
component parallel to the junction interface has an influence on the
conductance.
