We present non-extremal generalizations of N_f=2N_c supergravity duals
obtained by adding flavor branes to the Chamseddine-Volkov-Maldacena-Nunez
background and taking their backreaction into account. For a particular range
of parameters we obtain a one parameter family of analytic black hole solutions
with regular horizons. These solutions have a temperature that is always above
the Hagedorn temperature of little string theory. We find that including flavor
branes and their backreaction increases the minimum temperature of these
systems from T = 1/(4\pi), for the background without flavor, to T = 1/(2\pi
\sqrt{1 + epsilon}), epsilon << 1. We show that outside the range of validity
of the analytic solutions presented here the backgrounds have naked
singularities.
