GRB~090618 is a bright GRB with multiple pulses. It shows evidence of a
thermal emission in the initial pulses as well as in the early afterglow phase.
We investigate the shape and evolution of the thermal component in the early
afterglow/ late prompt emission phase using data from Swift/BAT, Swift/XRT, and
Fermi/GBM detectors. An independent fit to the BAT and the XRT data reveals two
correlated blackbodies with monotonically decreasing temperatures. Hence we
investigated the combined data with a model consisting of two blackbodies and a
power-law (2BBPL), a model suggested for several bright GRBs. We elicit the
following interesting features of the 2BBPL model: a) the same model is
applicable from the peak of the last pulse in the prompt emission to the
afterglow emission, b) the ratio of temperatures and the fluxes of the two
black bodies remain constant throughout the observations, c) the black body
temperatures and fluxes show a monotonic decrease with time, with the fluxes
dropping about a factor of two faster than the flux of the power-law emission,
d) attributing the blackbody emission to photospheric emissions, we find that
the photospheric radii increase very slowly with time, and the lower
temperature blackbody shows a radius about 65 times larger than the radius of
the higher temperature black body. We find some evidence that the underlying
shape of the non-thermal emission is a cut-off power-law rather than a
power-law. We sketch a spine-sheath jet model to explain our observations.
