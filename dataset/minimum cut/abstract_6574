The nonlinear evolution of resistive double tearing modes (DTMs) with safety
factor values q=1 and q=3 is studied in a reduced cylindrical model of a
tokamak plasma. We focus on cases where the resonant surfaces are a small
distance apart. Recent numerical studies have shown that in such configurations
high-m modes are strongly unstable. In this paper, it is first demonstrated
that linear DTM theory predicts the dominance of high-m DTMs. A semi-empirical
formula for estimating the poloidal mode number of the fastest growing mode,
m_peak, is obtained from the existing linear theory. Second, using nonlinear
simulations, it is shown that the presence of fast growing high-m modes leads
to a rapid turbulent collapse in an annular region, whereby small magnetic
island structures form. Furthermore, consideration is given to the evolution of
low-m modes, in particular the global m=1 internal kink, which can undergo
nonlinear driving through coupling to fast growing linear high-m DTMs. Factors
influencing the details of the dynamics are discussed. These results may be
relevant for the understanding of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) activity near
the minimum of q and may thus be of interest to studies concerned with
stability and confinement in advanced tokamaks.
