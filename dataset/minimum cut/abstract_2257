In this paper we construct families of rotated $D_n$-lattices which may be
suitable for signal transmission over both Gaussian and Rayleigh fading
channels via subfields of cyclotomic fields. These constructions exhibit full
diversity and good minimum product distance which are important parameters
related to the signal transmission error probability. It is also shown that for
some Galois extensions $\matK|\matQ$ it is impossible to construct rotated
$D_n$-lattices via fractional ideals of $\mathcal O_{\mattK}$.
