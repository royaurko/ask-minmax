In this paper we study \emph{many-to-one boundary labeling with backbone
leaders}. In this new many-to-one model, a horizontal backbone reaches out of
each label into the feature-enclosing rectangle. Feature points that need to be
connected to this label are linked via vertical line segments to the backbone.
We present dynamic programming algorithms for label number and total leader
length minimization of crossing-free backbone labelings. When crossings are
allowed, we aim to obtain solutions with the minimum number of crossings. This
can be achieved efficiently in the case of fixed label order, however, in the
case of flexible label order we show that minimizing the number of leader
crossings is NP-hard.
