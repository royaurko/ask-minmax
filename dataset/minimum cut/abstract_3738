Data on the mean multiplicity of strange hadrons produced in minimum bias
proton--proton and central nucleus--nucleus collisions at momenta between 2.8
and 400 GeV/c per nucleon have been compiled. The multiplicities for
nucleon--nucleon interactions were constructed. The ratios of strange particle
multiplicity to participant nucleon as well as to pion multiplicity are larger
for central nucleus--nucleus collisions than for nucleon--nucleon interactions
at all studied energies. The data at AGS energies suggest that the latter ratio
saturates with increasing masses of the colliding nuclei. The strangeness to
pion multiplicity ratio observed in nucleon--nucleon interactions increases
with collision energy in the whole energy range studied. A qualitatively
different behaviour is observed for central nucleus--nucleus collisions: the
ratio rapidly increases when going from Dubna to AGS energies and changes
little between AGS and SPS energies. This change in the behaviour can be
related to the increase in the entropy production observed in central
nucleus-nucleus collisions at the same energy range. The results are
interpreted within a statistical approach. They are consistent with the
hypothesis that the Quark Gluon Plasma is created at SPS energies, the critical
collision energy being between AGS and SPS energies.
