We present 53 simultaneous photometric (I band) and spectroscopic (6900-9500
Angstroms) observations of J0422+32, taken during December 1997. From these we
determine that J0422+32 was in its lowest state yet observed, at
I=20.44+/-0.08. Using relative spectrophotometry, we show that it is possible
to correct very accurately for telluric absorption. Following this, we use the
TiO bands at 7055 Angstroms and 7589 Angstroms for a radial velocity study and
thereby obtain a semi-amplitude of 378+/-16kms-1, which yields
f(M)=1.191+/-0.021M_solar and q=9.0+2.2-2.7, consistent with previous
observations. We further demonstrate that this little explored method is very
powerful for such systems. We also determine a new orbital ephemeris of
HJD=2450274.4156+/-0.0009 + 0.2121600+/-0.0000002E.
  We see some evidence for an ellipsoidal modulation, from which we determine
the orbital inclination of J0422+32 to be less than 45 degrees. We therefore
calculate a minimum mass for the primary of 2.22M_solar, consistent with a
black hole, but not necessarily the super-massive one proposed by Beekman et al
(1997). We obtain an M4-5 spectral type for the secondary star and determine
that the secondary contributes 38+/-2% of the flux that we observe from
J0422+32 over the range 6950-8400 Angstroms. From this we calculate the
distance to the system to be 1.39+/-0.15kpc.
