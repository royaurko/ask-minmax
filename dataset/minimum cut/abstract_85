In this paper we study evaluation codes arising from plane quotients of the
Hermitian curve, defined by affine equations of the form $y^q+y=x^m$, $q$ being
a prime power and $m$ a positive integer which divides $q+1$. The dual minimum
distance and minimum weight of such codes are studied from a geometric point of
view. In many cases we completely describe the minimum-weight codewords of
their dual codes through a geometric characterization of the supports, and
provide their number. Finally, we apply our results to describe Goppa codes of
classical interest on such curves.
