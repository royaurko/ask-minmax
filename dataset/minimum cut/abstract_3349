We present the first determination of the pairwise velocity dispersion of
galaxies at different luminosity with the final release of the Two-Degree Field
Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). Our result surprisingly shows that the random
velocities of the faint galaxies are very high, around $ 700 \kms$, reaching
similar values as the brightest galaxies. At intermediate luminosities slightly
brighter than the characteristic luminosity $M_\star$, the velocities exhibit a
well defined steep minimum near $ 400 \kms$. The result challenges the current
halo model of galaxies of Yang et al. that was obtained by matching the
clustering and luminosity function of 2dFGRS, and can be an important
constraint in general on theories of galaxy formation, e.g., the
semi-analytical model. Combining the observed luminosity dependence of
clustering, our result implies that quite a fraction of faint galaxies are in
massive halos of galaxy clusters as the brightest ones, but most of the
$M_\star$ galaxies are in galactic halos.
