We have analyzed the latest NA50 data on $J/\psi$ suppression in Pb+Pb
collisions at CERN SPS. It is shown that a QCD based nuclear absorption model,
where $J/\psi$'s are absorbed in nuclear medium could explain the latest NA50
data on the centrality dependence of the $J/\psi$ over Drell-Yan ratio. The
model also explains the NA50 data on $J/\psi$ over minimum bias ratio and the
$p_T$ broadening of $J/\psi$'s. A QGP based threshold model where all the
$J/\psi$'s are suppressed above a threshold density, also explains the data
sets with smeared threshold density. Even at RHIC energy, centrality dependence
of $J/\psi$ suppression or $p_T$ broadening could not distinguish between the
two models.
