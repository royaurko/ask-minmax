According to the core-accretion scenario, planets form in protostellar disks
through the condensation of dust, coagulation of planetesimals, and emergence
of protoplanetary embryos. At a few AU in a minimum mass nebula, embryos'
growth is quenched by dynamical isolation due to the depletion of planetesimals
in their feeding zone. However, embryos with masses ($M_p$) in the range of a
few Earth masses ($M_\oplus$) migrate toward a transition radius between the
inner viscously heated and outer irradiated regions of their natal disk. Their
limiting isolation mass increases with the planetesimals surface density. When
$M_p > 10 M_\oplus$, embryos efficiently accrete gas and evolve into cores of
gas giants. We use numerical simulation to show that, despite streamline
interference, convergent embryos essentially retain the strength of
non-interacting embryos' Lindblad and corotation torque by their natal disks.
In disks with modest surface density (or equivalently accretion rates), embryos
capture each other in their mutual mean motion resonances and form a convoy of
super Earths. In more massive disks, they could overcome these resonant
barriers to undergo repeated close encounters including cohesive collisions
which enable the formation of massive cores.
