We consider a cosmological model based upon a non-canonical noncommutative
extension of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra to address the thermodynamical
stability and the singularity problem of both the Schwarzschild and the
Kantowski-Sachs black holes. The interior of the black hole is modelled by a
noncommutative extension of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We compute the
temperature and entropy of a Kantowski-Sachs black hole and compare our results
with the Hawking values. Again, the noncommutativity in the momenta sector
allows us to have a minimum in the potential, which is relevant in order to
apply the Feynman-Hibbs procedure. For Kantowski-Sachs black holes, the same
model is shown to generate a non-unitary dynamics, predicting vanishing total
probability in the neighborhood of the singularity. This result effectively
regularizes the Kantowski-Sachs singularity and generalizes a similar result,
previously obtained for the case of Schwarzschild black hole.
