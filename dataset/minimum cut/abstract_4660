Measurement involves the determination of quantitative estimates of physical
quantities from experiment, along with estimates of their associated
uncertainties. Herewith an experimental system model is the key to extracting
information from the experimental data. The measurement information obtained
depends directly on the quality of the model. With this concern novel
regression modelling techniques have been fashioned by data integration from
computer-simulation and physical designed experiments. These techniques have
allowed attaining the advanced level of model completeness, parsimony, and
precision via approximation of the exact unknown model by mathematical product
of available theoretical and appropriate empirical functions. The purpose of
this approximation is to represent adequately the true model on the considered
region of factor space with all advantages of theoretical modelling. This
allows a further focus on the measurement science of issue. Pneumatic gauge
hybrid data candidate model building, solving and validation reviled that such
adequate models permit to attain minimum discrepancy from empirical evidence.
