The generalized wordlength pattern (GWLP) introduced by Xu and Wu (2001) for
an arbitrary fractional factorial design allows one to extend the use of the
minimum aberration criterion to such designs. Ai and Zhang (2004) defined the
$J$-characteristics of a design and showed that they uniquely determine the
design. While both the GWLP and the $J$-characteristics require indexing the
levels of each factor by a cyclic group, we see that the definitions carry over
with appropriate changes if instead one uses an arbitrary abelian group. This
means that the original definitions rest on an arbitrary choice of group
structure. We show that the GWLP of a design is independent of this choice, but
that the $J$-characteristics are not. We briefly discuss some implications of
these results.
