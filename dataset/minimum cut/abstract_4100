We develop a formulation for molecular dynamics, Langevin, and hybrid Monte
Carlo algorithms in the recently proposed generalized ensemble that is based on
a physically motivated realisation of Tsallis weights. The effectiveness of the
methods are tested with an energy function for a protein system. Simulations in
this generalized ensemble by the three methods are performed for a penta
peptide, Met-enkephalin. For each algorithm, it is shown that from only one
simulation run one can not only find the global-minimum-energy conformation but
also obtain probability distributions in canonical ensemble at any temperature,
which allows the calculation of any thermodynamic quantity as a function of
temperature.
