We have made the first experimental demonstration of the simultaneous minimum
uncertainty product between two complementary observables for a two-state
system (a qubit). A partially entangled two-photon state was used to perform
such measurements. Each of the photons carries (partial) information of the
initial state thus leaving a room for measurements of two complementary
observables on every member in an ensemble.
