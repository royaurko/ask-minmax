Cyclic codes are an interesting type of linear codes and have applications in
communication and storage systems due to their efficient encoding and decoding
algorithms. They have been studied for decades and a lot of progress has been
made. In this paper, three types of generalized cyclotomy of order two and
three classes of cyclic codes of length $n_1n_2$ and dimension $(n_1n_2+1)/2$
are presented and analysed, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are two distinct primes.
Bounds on their minimum odd-like weight are also proved. The three
constructions produce the best cyclic codes in certain cases.
