In recent years, radio frequency identification technology has moved into the
mainstream applications that help to speed up handling of manufactured goods
and materials. RFID tags are divided into two classes: active and passive.
Active tag requires a power source that's why its cost is more than passive
tags. However, the low-cost RFID tags are facing new challenges to security and
privacy. Some solutions utilize expensive cryptographic primitives such as hash
or encryption functions, and some lightweight approaches have been reported to
be not secure.
  This paper describes a lightweight Mutual authentication and ownership
transfer protocol utilizing minimalistic cryptography using Physically
Unclonable Functions (PUF) and Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR). PUFs and
LFSRs are very efficient in hardware and particularly suitable for the low-cost
RFID tags. To functioning security in low cost RFID tag minimum gate
requirement is 2000 gates. To implement security protocols using PUF and LFSR
functions need only approx 800 gates. In this paper it is explained how we can
authenticate and transfer ownership of low cost RFID tag securely using LFSR
and PUF as compared to existing solutions based on hash functions.
