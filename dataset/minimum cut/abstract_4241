In this paper we lay special stress on analyzing the topological properties
of the lattice systems and try to ovoid the conventional ways to calculate the
critical points. Only those clusters with finite sizes can execute the self
similar transformations of infinite hierarchies. Each ordered cluster has
fractal dimension, their minimum relates to the edge fixed point, which accords
with the transformations fixed point relating to a critical point. There are
two classes of systems and clusters by their connectivity. Using mathematic
mapping method we set up cluster-spin Gaussian model solved accurately. There
are single state and -fold coupling state in a reducible cluster, each of which
corresponds to a subsystem described by a Gaussian model. By the minimal
fractal dimension a final expression of the critical points is obtained. The
critical points of three lattice systems are calculated, our method makes the
calculations very simplified and highly accurate. A possibility of existence of
different clusters at the critical temperature is discussed.
