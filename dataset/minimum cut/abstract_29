The zero forcing number Z(G), which is the minimum number of vertices in a
zero forcing set of a graph G, is used to study the maximum nullity / minimum
rank of the family of symmetric matrices described by G. It is shown that for a
connected graph of order at least two, no vertex is in every zero forcing set.
The positive semidefinite zero forcing number Z_+(G) is introduced, and shown
to be equal to |G|-OS(G), where OS(G) is the recently defined ordered set
number that is a lower bound for minimum positive semidefinite rank. The
positive semidefinite zero forcing number is applied to the computation of
positive semidefinite minimum rank of certain graphs. An example of a graph for
which the real positive symmetric semidefinite minimum rank is greater than the
complex Hermitian positive semidefinite minimum rank is presented.
