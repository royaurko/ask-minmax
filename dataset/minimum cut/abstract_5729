The objective is to design output feedback event-triggered controllers to
stabilize a class of nonlinear systems. One of the main difficulties of the
problem is to ensure the existence of a minimum amount of time between two
consecutive transmissions, which is essential in practice. We solve this issue
by combining techniques from event-triggered and time-triggered control. The
idea is to turn on the event-triggering mechanism only after a fixed amount of
time has elapsed since the last transmission. This time is computed based on
results on the stabilization of time-driven sampled-data systems. The overall
strategy ensures an asymptotic stability property for the closed-loop system.
The results are proved to be applicable to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems
as a particular case.
