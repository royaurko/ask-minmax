Minimal $S_{3}$ invariant Higgs potential with real soft $S_{3}$ breaking
masses is investigated.
 It is required that without having a problem with triviality, all physical
Higgs bosons, except one neutral one, become heavy ~O(10) TeV in order to
sufficiently suppress flavor changing neutral currents. There exist three
nonequivalent soft mass terms that can be characterized according to their
discrete symmetries, and the one which breaks $S_{3}$ completely. The $S_{2}'$
invariant vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the Higgs fields are the most
economic VEVs in the sense that the freedom of VEVs can be completely absorbed
into the Yukawa couplings so that it is possible to derive, without referring
to the details of the VEVs, the most general form for the fermion mass matrices
in minimal $S_{3}$ extension of the standard model. We find that except for the
completely broken case of the soft terms, the $S_{2}'$ invariant VEVs are
unique VEVs that satisfy the requirement of heavy Higgs bosons. It is found
that they also correspond to a local minimum in the completely broken case.
