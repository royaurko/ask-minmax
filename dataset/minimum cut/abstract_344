We report a new type of drop instability, where the density difference
between the drop and the solvent is negative. We show that the drop falls
inside the solvent down to a minimum height, then fragmentation takes place and
secondary droplets rise up to the surface. We have developed a theoretical
model that captures the essential of the phenomenon and predicts the correct
scalings for the rise-up time and the minimum height.
