Under the hypothesis that the CP violating phase parameter \delta in the CKM
matrix V takes own value so that the radius R(\delta) of the circle
circumscribed about the unitary triangle takes its minimum value, possible
phase conventions of the CKM matrix are investigated. We find that two of the 9
phase conventions can give favorable predictions for the observed shape of the
unitary triangle. One of the successful two suggests phenomenologically
interesting structures of the quark and lepton mass matrices, which lead to
|V_{us}|\simeq \sqrt{m_d/m_s}=0.22, |V_{ub}|\simeq \sqrt{m_u/m_t} =0.0036 and
|V_{cb}|\simeq \sqrt{m_c/2m_t}=0.043 for the CKM matrix V, and to \sin^2
2\theta_{atm}=1, \tan^2 \theta_{solar} \simeq |m_{\nu 1}/m_{\nu 2}|$ and
|U_{13}|\simeq \sqrt{m_e/2 m_\tau} for the lepton mixing matrix U under simple
requirements for the textures.
