The orbit of the Chelyabinsk object is calculated, applying the least-squares
method directly to astrometric positions. The dynamical evolution of this
object in the past is studied by integrating equations of motion for particles
with orbits from the confidence region. It is found that the majority of the
Chelyabinsk clones reach the near-Sun state. 67 percent of these objects have
collisions with the Sun for 15 Myr in our numerical simulations. The
distribution of minimum solar distances shows that the most probable time for
the encounters of the Chelyabinsk object with the Sun lies in the interval from
-0.8 Myr to -2 Myr. This is consistent with the estimate of a cosmic ray
exposure age of 1.2 Myr (Popova et al 2013). A parent body of the Chelyabinsk
object should experience strong tidal and thermal effects at this time. The
possible association of the Chelyabinsk object with 86039 (1999 NC43) and 2008
DJ is discussed.
