The generalized uncertainty principle discloses a self-complete
characteristic of gravity, namely the possibility of masking any curvature
singularity behind an event horizon as a result of matter compression at the
Planck scale. In this paper we extend the above reasoning in order to overcome
some current limitations to the framework, including the absence of a
consistent metric describing such Planck-scale black holes. We implement a
minimum-size black hole in terms of the extremal configuration of a neutral
non-rotating metric, which we derived by mimicking the effects of the
generalized uncertainty principle via a short scale modified version of
Einstein gravity. In such a way, we find a self-consistent scenario that
reconciles the self-complete character of gravity and the generalized
uncertainty principle.
