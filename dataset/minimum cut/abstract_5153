An explicit formula for the ADM mass of an asymptotically AdS black hole in a
generic Lovelock gravity theory is presented, identical in form to that in
Einstein gravity, but multiplied by a function of the Lovelock coupling
constants and the AdS curvature radius. A Gauss' law type formula relates the
mass, which is an integral at infinity, to an expression depending instead on
the horizon radius. This and other thermodynamic quantities, such as the free
energy, are then analyzed in the limits of small and large horizon radius,
yielding results that are independent of the detailed choice of Lovelock
couplings. In even dimensions, the temperature diverges in both limits,
implying the existence of a minimum temperature for black holes. The negative
free energy of sufficiently large black holes implies the existence of a
Hawking-Page transition. In odd dimensions the temperature still diverges for
large black holes, which again have negative free energy. However, the
temperature vanishes as the horizon radius tends to zero and sufficiently small
black holes have positive specific heat.
