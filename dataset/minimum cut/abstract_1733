The problem of the automation of the designing of the axonometric piping
diagrams include, as the minimum, manipulations with the flat schemas of
three-dimensional wireframe objects (with dimension of 2,5). The specialized
model, methodical and mathematical approaches are required because of large
bulk of calculuss. Coordinate systems, data types, common principles of
realization of operation with data and composition of the basic operations are
described which are realised in the complex CAD system of the reconstruction of
the plants TechnoCAD GlassX.
