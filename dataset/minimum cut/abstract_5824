A famous conjecture of P\'osa from 1962 asserts that every graph on $n$
vertices and with minimum degree at least $2n/3$ contains the square of a
Hamilton cycle. The conjecture was proven for large graphs in 1996 by Koml\'os,
S\'ark\"ozy and Szemer\'edi. In this paper we prove a degree sequence version
of P\'osa's conjecture: Given any $\eta >0$, every graph $G$ of sufficiently
large order $n$ contains the square of a Hamilton cycle if its degree sequence
$d_1\leq \dots \leq d_n$ satisfies $d_i \geq (1/3+\eta)n+i$ for all $i \leq
n/3$. The degree sequence condition here is asymptotically best possible. Our
approach uses a hybrid of the Regularity-Blow-up method and the
Connecting-Absorbing method.
