Theory of Rainer and Vuorio of small objects in superfluid ^3He is applied
for calculation of the average orientational effect of a deformed aerogel on
the order parameter of 3He. The minimum deformation which stabilizes the
ordered state is evaluated both for specular and diffusive scattering of
quasiparticles by the threads of aerogel.
