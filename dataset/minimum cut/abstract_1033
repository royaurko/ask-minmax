We study the evolution of relic D3-branes after the D3/\bd-brane inflation in
string warped compactification. The motion of D3-branes can be frozen under
certain condition during the radiation/matter domination. These D3-branes can
not be released until the D3/\bd-branes potential energy becomes dominated at
late time. Subsequently they will move towards to \bd-branes, which play the
role of uplifting AdS minimum to dS minimum, near the apex of throats. The
annihilation of D3/\bd-branes leads to the disappearance of dS vacua. This
process may be regarded as a rapid decay channel of present dS vacua. We
discuss the parameter spaces required by this process and calculate the decay
time.
