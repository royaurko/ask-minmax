Supplementing the Liquid Drop Model (LDM) Hamiltonian, written in the
intrinsic reference frame, with a sextic oscillator plus a centrifugal term in
the variable $\beta$ and a potential in $\gamma$ with a minimum in
$\frac{\pi}{6}$, the Sch\"{o}dinger equation is separated for the two variables
which results in having a new description for the triaxial nuclei, called
Sextic and Mathieu Approach (SMA). SMA is applied for two non-axial nuclei,
$^{180}$Hf and $^{182}$W and results are compared with those yielded by the
Coherent State Model (CSM). As the main result of this paper we derive
analytically the equations characterizing SMA from a semi-classical treatment
of the CSM Hamiltonian. In this manner the potentials in $\beta$ and $\gamma$
variables respectively, show up in a quite natural way which contrasts their
ad-hoc choice when SMA emerges from LDM.
