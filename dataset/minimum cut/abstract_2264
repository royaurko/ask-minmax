In this paper we determine the irreducible projective representations of
sporadic simple groups over an arbitrary algebraically closed field F, whose
image contains an almost cyclic matrix of prime-power order. A matrix M is
called cyclic if its characteristic and minimum polynomials coincide, and we
call M almost cyclic if, for a suitable a in F, M is similar to diag(a Id_h,
M_1), where M_1 is cyclic and 0 <= h <= n. The paper also contains results on
the generation of sporadic simple groups by minimal sets of conjugate elements.
