Through a series of observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
we have monitored the variability of ground-state hydroxyl maser emission from
G12.889+0.489 in all four Stokes polarisation products. These observations were
motivated by the known periodicity in the associated 6.7-GHz methanol maser
emission. A total of 27 epochs of observations were made over 16 months. No
emission was seen from either the 1612 or 1720 MHz satellite line transitions
(to a typical five sigma upper limit of 0.2 Jy). The peak flux densities of the
1665 and 1667 MHz emission were observed to vary at a level of ~20% (with the
exception of one epoch which dropped by <40%). There was no distinct flaring
activity at any epoch, but there was a weak indication of periodic variability,
with a period and phase of minimum emission similar to that of methanol. There
is no significant variation in the polarised properties of the hydroxyl, with
Stokes Q and U flux densities varying in accord with the Stokes I intensity
(linear polarisation, P, varying by <20%) and the right and left circularly
polarised components varying by <33% at 1665-MHz and <38% at 1667-MHz. These
observations are the first monitoring observations of the hydroxyl maser
emission from G12.889+0.489.
