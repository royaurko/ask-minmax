We investigate the convergence rates of the trajectories generated by
implicit first and second order dynamical systems associated to the
determination of the zeros of the sum of a maximally monotone operator and a
monotone and Lipschitz continuous one in a real Hilbert space. We show that
these trajectories strongly converge with exponential rate to a zero of the
sum, provided the latter is strongly monotone. We derive from here convergence
rates for the trajectories generated by dynamical systems associated to the
minimization of the sum of a proper, convex and lower semicontinuous function
with a smooth convex one provided the objective function fulfills a strong
convexity assumption. In the particular case of minimizing a smooth and
strongly convex function, we prove that its values converge along the
trajectory to its minimum value with exponential rate, too.
