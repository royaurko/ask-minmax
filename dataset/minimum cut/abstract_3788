We show that the baryon asymmetry produced by the out of equilibrium decay of
heavy $GUT$ scalars can be the baryon asymmetry that is observed today. No
restrictions need be imposed on the initial values of $B$, $L$ and $B-L$, nor
on the neutrino masses; no new symmetries need be gauged nor new fermions
introduced. We find two mechanisms that can bring this about for any $GUT$
gauge group. Two illustrative models are discussed that are robust, and need
just two (at most four) more $GUT$ scalar fields than the minimum model. The
additional scalar fields can also help in generating an adequately large value
of the CP violation parameter and in efficiently annihilating the monopoles.
Our work should firmly re-establish heavy $GUT$ scalars as probable progenitors
of today's baryon asymmetry.
