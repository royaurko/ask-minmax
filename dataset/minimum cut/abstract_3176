We developed a three-dimensional 2-level hierarchical cosmological code with
a realistic and robust treatment of multi-species non-equilibrium ionization
and radiative cooling processes, and use it to investigate primordial star
forming regions that originate from high-\sigma perturbations in a standard CDM
dominated cosmology. We find it is possible to produce gravitationally bound
and cooled structures at very high redshift (z ~ 40) with baryonic masses as
small as ~1000Ms. The molecular hydrogen formation in these small scale
structures follows very well the analytical predictions of Abel (1995) and
Tegmark et al. (1996). We also discuss the minimum mass that cosmological
structures must have in order to be able to cool and collapse.
