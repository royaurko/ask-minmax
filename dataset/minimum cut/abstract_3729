We calculate the time delay between different relativistic images formed by
black hole gravitational lensing in the strong field limit. For spherically
symmetric black holes, it turns out that the time delay between the first two
images is proportional to the minimum impact angle. Their ratio gives a very
interesting and precise measure of the distance of the black hole. Moreover,
using also the separation between the images and their luminosity ratio, it is
possible to extract the mass of the black hole. The time delay for the black
hole at the center of our Galaxy is just few minutes, but for supermassive
black holes with M=10^8 - 10^9 solar masses in the neighbourhood of the Local
Group the time delay amounts to few days, thus being measurable with a good
accuracy.
