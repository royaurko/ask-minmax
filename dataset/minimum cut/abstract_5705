EE Cep is a unique system in which a Be star is eclipsed by a dark dusty
disk, making this star similar to the famous epsilon Aur in many respects. The
depth and the duration of the EE Cep eclipses change to a large extent. The
last two eclipses were observed in the framework of extensive international
campaigns. The joint analysis of these campaigns data and historical
photometry, enabled us to propose a model of this system, which implies a disk
precession with a period approximately 11-12 times larger than the orbital
period. This model predicts that the forthcoming eclipse should be among the
deepest observed, reaching about 2 mag. The next eclipse approaches - the
photometric minimum should occur around August 23, 2014. Here we would like to
announce a new, third international campaign with purpose to verify the disk
precession model and to put more constraints on the physical parameters of this
system.
