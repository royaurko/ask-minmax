We report precise Doppler measurements of HD 142022 obtained during the past
six years with the CORALIE echelle spectrograph at La Silla Observatory
together with a few additional observations made recently with the HARPS
echelle spectrograph. Our radial velocities reveal evidence of a planetary
companion with an orbital period P = 1928 +53-39 days, an eccentricity e = 0.53
+0.23-0.18, and a velocity semiamplitude K = 92 +102-29 m/s. The inferred
companion minimum mass is M2sini = 5.1 +2.6-1.5 MJup and the semimajor axis a =
3.03+/-0.05 AU. Only one full orbital revolution has been monitored yet, and
the periastron passage could not be observed since the star was too low on the
horizon. The eccentricity and velocity semiamplitude remain therefore quite
uncertain and the orbital solution is preliminary. HD 142022 is a
chromospherically inactive K0 dwarf, metal rich relative to the Sun, and is the
primary component of a wide binary. HD 142022 b is thus a new "planet in
binary" candidate, and its high eccentricity might be due to secular
interactions with the distant stellar companion.
