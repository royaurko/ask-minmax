The ac losses in a silver-gold alloy sheathed Bi-2223 tape were measured by
the null calorimetric method while a dc current was superimposed onto the ac
current. As expected through computer simulations, a Clem valley was observed
for the larger ac currents. A reduction of ac losses of approximately 50% at
the valley minimum is observed in accord with the calculations. At lower ac
currents, the data fit the calculated behavior with a single parameter, a
Meissner current of 21.8 A. It is shown that a surface barrier current is
incompatible with the data.
