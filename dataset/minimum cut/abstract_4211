Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is predicted for x rays in
laser-dressed neon gas. The x-ray photoabsorption cross section and
polarizability near the Ne K edge are calculated using an ab initio theory
suitable for optical strong-field problems. The laser wavelength is tuned close
to the transition between 1s^-1 3s and 1s^-1 3p (approximately 800nm). The
minimum laser intensity required to observe EIT is of the order of 10^12
W/cm^2. The ab initio results are discussed in terms of an exactly solvable
three-level model. This work opens new opportunities for research with
ultrafast x-ray sources.
