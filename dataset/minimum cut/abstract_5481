Large-scale ad hoc analytics of genomic data is popular using the
R-programming language supported by 671 software packages provided by
Bioconductor. More recently, analytical jobs are benefitting from on-demand
computing and storage, their scalability and their low maintenance cost, all of
which are offered by the cloud. While Biologists and Bioinformaticists can take
an analytical job and execute it on their personal workstations, it remains
challenging to seamlessly execute the job on the cloud infrastructure without
extensive knowledge of the cloud dashboard. How analytical jobs can not only
with minimum effort be executed on the cloud, but also how both the resources
and data required by the job can be managed is explored in this paper. An
open-source light-weight framework for executing R-scripts using Bioconductor
packages, referred to as `RBioCloud', is designed and developed. RBioCloud
offers a set of simple command-line tools for managing the cloud resources, the
data and the execution of the job. Three biological test cases validate the
feasibility of RBioCloud. The framework is publicly available from
