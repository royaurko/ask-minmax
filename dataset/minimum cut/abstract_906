A simple pathway to grow thin films of N-doped MgO (MgO:N), which has been
found experimentally to be a ferromagnetic d0 insulator, is presented. It
relies on the catalytic properties of a Mo(001) substrate using growth of Mg in
a mixed atmosphere of O2 and N2. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals that
the films are insulating and exhibit an N-induced state slightly below the
conduction band minimum.
