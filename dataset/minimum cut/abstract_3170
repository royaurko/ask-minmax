The angular distribution of GRBs is isotropic, while the brightness
distribution of bursts shows a reduced number of faint events. These
observations favor a cosmological burst origin. If GRBs are indeed at
cosmological distances and if they trace luminous matter, we must eventually
find an anisotropic distribution of bright bursts. If a significant number of
bursts originate at redshifts less than z~1, the concentration of nearby
galaxies towards the supergalactic plane is pronounced enough that we could
discover the corresponding clustering of burst locations. We used the 3B
catalog to search for a pattern visible in supergalactic coordinates. No
compelling evidence for anisotropies was found. The absence of anisotropies in
SG coordinates implies a minimum sampling distance of 200h^-1 Mpc.
