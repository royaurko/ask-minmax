Continuing previous work, we have measured the projectile scattering-angle
dependency for transfer excitation of fast protons (300-1200 keV/u) colliding
with helium (p+He $\rightarrow$ H + He$^{+ *}$). Our high-resolution fully
differential data are accompanied by calculations, performed in the plane wave
first Born approximation and the eikonal wave Born approximation.
Experimentally we find a deep minimum in the differential cross section around
0.5 $mrad$. The comparison with our calculations shows that describing the
scattering angle dependence of transfer exitation in fast collisions requires
to go beyond the first Born approximation and in addition to use initial state
wave function, which contains some degree of angular correlations.
