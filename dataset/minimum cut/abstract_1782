We measured the ambient energy in jet events using data of the CDF experiment
at center-of-mass energies of 1800 and 630 GeV by examining the transverse
momentum of charged particles in a region of the detector far away from the two
most energetic jets in the event. The energy is compared to that found in
minimum bias events. CDF data are compared to Monte Carlo predictions: neither
Herwig nor Pythia can reproduce the data in detail.
