Motivated by the Caccetta-Haggkvist Conjecture, we prove that every digraph
on n vertices with minimum outdegree 0.3465n contains an oriented triangle.
This improves the bound of 0.3532n of Hamburger, Haxell and Kostochka. The main
new tool we use in our proof is the theory of flag algebras developed recently
by Razborov.
