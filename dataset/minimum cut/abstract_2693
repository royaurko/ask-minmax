This paper considers the Cauchy problem for the quasilinear hyperbolic system
of balance laws in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\ge 2$. The source term is of the form
$Q(u) = (0,\dots, 0, Q_{r+1}(u), \dots, Q_{n}(u))^T$ with $r\ge 2$, and the
system is partially dissipative in the sense that there is an eigen-family
violating the Kawashima condition. By imposing certain supplementary degeneracy
conditions with respect to the non-dissipative eigen-family, global unique
smooth solutions near constant equilibria are constructed. The proof is based
on the introduction of the partially normalized coordinates, a delicate
structural analysis, a family of scaled energy estimates with minimum
fractional derivative counts and a refined decay estimates of the dissipative
components of the solution.
