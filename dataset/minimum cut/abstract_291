I review different methods devised to derive the age of the Galactic Disk,
namely the Radio-active Decay (RD), the Cool White Dwarf Luminosity Function
(CWDLF), old opne clusters (OOC) and the Color Magnitude Diagram (CMD) of the
stars in the solar vicinity. I argue that the disk is likely to be 8-10 Gyr
old. Since the bulk of globulars has an age around 13 Gyr, the possibility
emerges that the Galaxy experienced a minimum of Star Formation at the end of
the halo/bulge formation. This minimum might reflect the time at which the
Galaxy started to acquire material to form the disk inside-out.
