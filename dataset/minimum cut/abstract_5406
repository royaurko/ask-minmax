Many protein systems fold in a two-state manner. Random models, however,
rarely display two-state kinetics and thus such behavior should not be accepted
as a default. To date, many theories for the prevalence of two-state kinetics
have been presented, but none sufficiently explain the breadth of experimental
observations. A model, making a minimum of assumptions, is introduced that
suggests two-state behavior is likely for any system with an overwhelmingly
populated native state. We show two-state folding is emergent and strengthened
by increasing the occupancy population of the native state. Further, the model
exhibits a hub-like behavior, with slow interconversions between unfolded
states. Despite this, the unfolded state equilibrates quickly relative to the
folding time. This apparent paradox is readily understood through this model.
Finally, our results compare favorable with experimental measurements of
protein folding rates as a function of chain length and Keq, and provide new
insight into these results.
