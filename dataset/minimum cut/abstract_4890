We analysed the IGR J16465-4507 Burst Alert Teelescope survey data collected
during the first 54 months of the Swift mission. The source is in a crowded
field and it is revealed through an ad hoc imaging analysis at a significance
level of ~14 standard deviations. The 15-50 keV average flux is ~3E-11
erg/cm^2/s. The timing analysis reveals an orbital period of 30.243 +/- 0.035
days. The folded light curve shows the presence of a wide phase interval of
minimum intensity, lasting ~20% of the orbital period. This could be explained
with a full eclipse of the compact object in an extremely eccentric orbit or
with the passage of the compact source through a lower density wind at the
orbit apastron. The modest dynamical range observed during the BAT monitoring
suggests that IGR J16465-4507 is a wind-fed system, continuously accreting from
a rather homogeneous wind, and not a member of the Supergiant Fast X-ray
Transient class.
