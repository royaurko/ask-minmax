New high-throughput sequencing technologies have made it possible to pursue
the advent of genome-wide transcriptomics. That progress combined with the
recent discovery of regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) has necessitated fast
and accurate algorithms to predict RNA-RNA interaction probability and
structure. Although there are algorithms to predict minimum free energy
interaction secondary structure for two nucleic acids, little work has been
done to exploit the information invested in the base pair probabilities to
improve interaction structure prediction. In this paper, we present an
algorithm to predict the Hamming centroid of the Boltzmann ensemble of
interaction structures. We also present an efficient algorithm to sample
interaction structures from the ensemble. Our sampling algorithm uses a
balanced scheme for traversing indices which improves the running time of the
Ding-Lawrence sampling algorithm. The Ding-Lawrence sampling algorithm has
$O(n^2m^2)$ time complexity whereas our algorithm has $O((n+m)^2\log(n+m))$
time complexity, in which $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of input strands. We
implemented our algorithm in a new version of {\tt piRNA} and compared our
structure prediction results with competitors. Our centroid prediction
outperforms competitor minimum-free-energy prediction algorithms on average.
