The crossing number of a graph G is the minimum number of pairwise
intersections of edges in a drawing of G. Motivated by the recent work [Faria,
L., Figueiredo, C.M.H. de, Sykora, O., Vrt'o, I.: An improved upper bound on
the crossing number of the hypercube. J. Graph Theory 59, 145-161 (2008)], we
give an upper bound of the crossing number of n-dimensional bubble-sort graph
Bn.
