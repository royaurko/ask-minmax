The [O I] line emission of the LMC B[e] supergiant R126 is modeled with an
outflowing disk scenario. We find that hydrogen in the disk must be ionized by
less than 0.1%, meaning that the disk material is predominantly neutral. The
free-free emission is calculated from the polar wind, and the minimum density
contrast between disk and polar wind is found to be ~10.
