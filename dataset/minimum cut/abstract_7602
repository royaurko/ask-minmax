We deal with the elastic scattering by a large number $M$ of rigid bodies of
arbitrary shapes with maximum radius $a,\; 0<a<<1$ with constant Lam\'e
coefficients $\lambda$ and $\mu$. We show that, when these rigid bodies are
distributed arbitrarily (not necessarily periodically) in a bounded region
$\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$ where their number is $M:=M(a):=O(a^{-1})$ and the
minimum distance between them is $d:=d(a)\approx a^{t}$ with $t$ in some
appropriate range, as $a \rightarrow 0$, the generated far-field patterns
approximate the far-field patterns generated by an equivalent (possibly
variable) mass density. This mass density is described by two coefficients: one
modeling the local distribution of the small bodies and the other one by their
geometries. In particular, if the distributed bodies have a uniform spherical
shape then the equivalent mass density is isotropic while for general shapes it
might be anisotropic. In addition, we can distribute the small bodies in such a
way that the equivalent mass density is negative. Finally, if the background
density $\rho$ is variable in $\Omega$ and $\rho =1$ in
$\mathbb{R}^3\setminus{\overline{\Omega}}$, then if we remove from $\Omega$
appropriately distributed small bodies then the equivalent density will be
equal to unity in $\mathbb{R}^3$, i.e. the obstacle $\Omega$ characterized by
$\rho$ is approximately cloaked.
