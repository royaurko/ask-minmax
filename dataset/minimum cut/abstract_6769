We investigate in a model-independent way to what extent one can perturb
tri-bimaximal mixing in order to generate a sizable value of |U_{e3}|, while at
the same time keeping solar neutrino mixing near its measured value, which is
close to sin^2 theta_{12} = 1/3. Three straightforward breaking mechanisms to
generate |U_{e3}| of about 0.1 are considered. For charged lepton corrections,
the suppression of a sizable contribution to sin^2 theta_{12} can be achieved
if CP violation in neutrino oscillations is almost maximal. Generation of the
indicated value of |U_{e3}| of about 0.1 through renormalization group
corrections requires the neutrinos to be quasi-degenerate in mass. The
consistency with the allowed range of sin^2 theta_{12} together with large
running of |U_{e3}| forces one of the Majorana phases to be close to pi. This
implies large cancellations in the effective Majorana mass governing
neutrino-less double beta, constraining it to lie near its minimum allowed
value of m_0 cos 2 theta_{12}, where m_0 is greater than about 0.1 eV. Finally,
explicit breaking of the neutrino mass matrix in the inverted hierarchical and
quasi-degenerate neutrino mass spectrum cases is similarly correlated with the
effective Majorana mass, although to a lesser extent. The implied values for
the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle theta_{23} are given in all cases.
