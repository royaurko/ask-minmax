We are undertaking a high-frequency survey of the Galactic plane for radio
pulsars, using the 13-element multibeam receiver on the 64-m Parkes radio
telescope. We describe briefly the survey system and some of the initial
results. PSR J1811-1736, one of the first pulsars discovered with this system,
has a rotation period of 104 ms. Subsequent timing observations using the 76-m
radio telescope at Jodrell Bank show that it is in an 18.8-day,
highly-eccentric binary orbit. We have measured the rate of advance of
periastron which indicates a total system mass of 2.6 +- 0.9 Msun, and the
minimum companion mass is about 0.7 Msun. This, the high orbital eccentricity
and the recycled nature of the pulsar suggests that this system is composed of
two neutron stars, only the fourth or fifth such system known in the disk of
the Galaxy.
