We present new experimental constraints on the elastic, spin-dependent
WIMP-nucleon cross section using recent data from the XENON100 experiment,
operated in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. An analysis of
224.6 live days x 34 kg of exposure acquired during 2011 and 2012 revealed no
excess signal due to axial-vector WIMP interactions with 129-Xe and 131-Xe
nuclei. This leads to the most stringent upper limits on WIMP-neutron cross
sections for WIMP masses above 6 GeV, with a minimum cross section of 3.5 x
10^{-40} cm^2 at a WIMP mass of 45 GeV, at 90% confidence level.
