The only experimentally observed phenomenon that lies outside the standard
model of the electroweak interaction is neutrino oscillations. A way to try to
unify the extensive neutrino oscillation data is to add a phenomenological mass
term to the Lagrangian that is not diagonal in the flavor basis. The goal is
then to understand the world's data in terms of the parameters of the mixing
matrix and the differences between the squares of the masses of the neutrinos.
An outstanding question is what is the correct ordering of the masses, the
hierarchy question. We point out a broken symmetry relevant to this question,
the symmetry of the simultaneous interchange of hierarchy and the sign of
$\theta_{13}$. We first present the results of an analysis of data that well
determine the phenomenological parameters but are not sensitive to the
hierarchy. We find $\theta_{13} = 0.152\pm 0.014$, $\theta_{23} =
0.25^{+0.03}_{-0.05} \pi$ and $\Delta_{32} = 2.45\pm 0.14 \times 10^{-3}$
eV$^2$, results consistent with others. We then include data that are sensitive
to the hierarchy and the sign of $\theta_{13}$. We find, unlike others, four
isolated minimum in the $\chi^2$-space as predicted by the symmetry. Now that
Daya Bay and RENO have determined $\theta_{13}$ to be surprisingly large, the
Super-K atmospheric data produce meaningful symmetry breaking such that the
inverse hierarchy is preferred at the 97.2 % level.
