We studied the dynamical influence of a dust component on the gaseous phase
in central regions of galactic disks. Therefore, we performed two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations for flat multi-component disks embedded in a stellar
and dark matter potential. The pressure-free dust component is coupled to the
gas by a drag force depending on their velocity difference.
  It turned out that the most unstable regions are those with either a low or
near to minimum Toomre parameter or with rigid rotation, i.e. the central area.
In that regions the dust-free disks become most unstable for a small range of
high azimuthal modes (m \sim 8), whereas in dusty disks all modes have similar
amplitudes resulting in a patchy appearance. The structures in the dust have a
larger contrast between arm and inter-arm regions than those of the gas. The
dust peaks are frequently correlated with peaks of the gas distribution, but
they do not necessarily coincide with them. This leads to a large scatter in
the dust-to-gas ratios. The appearance of the dust is more cellular (i.e.
sometimes connecting different spiral features), whereas the gas is organized
in a multi-armed spiral structure.
  We found that an admixture of 2% dust (relative to the mass of the gas)
destabilizes gaseous disks substantially, whereas dust-to-gas ratios below 1%
have no influence on the evolution of the gaseous disk. For a high dust-to-gas
ratio of 10% the instabilities reach the saturation level already after 30 Myr.
