In various application fields, tensor type data are used recently and then a
typical rank is important. Although there may be more than one typical ranks
over the real number field, a generic rank over the complex number field is the
minimum number of them. The set of $n$-tensors of type $p_1\times
p_2\times\cdots\times p_n$ is called perfect, if it has a typical rank
$\max(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$. In this paper, we determine perfect types of
$n$-tensor.
