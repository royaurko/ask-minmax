We consider a generalization of the classical Art Gallery Problem, where
instead of a light source, the guards, called $k$-transmitters, model a
wireless device with a signal that can pass through at most $k$ walls. We show
it is NP-hard to compute a minimum cover of point 2-transmitters, point
$k$-transmitters, and edge 2-transmitters in a simple polygon. The point
2-transmitter result extends to orthogonal polygons. In addition, we give
necessity and sufficiency results for the number of edge 2-transmitters in
general, monotone, orthogonal monotone, and orthogonal polygons.
