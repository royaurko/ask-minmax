Linear conductance of graphene-based p-n junctions with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling is considered theoretically. A square potential step is used to model
the junctions, while the coupling is introduced in terms of the Kane-Mele model
(C.L. Kane and E.J. Mele, Phys.Rev.Lett. 95, 226801(2005)). The main objective
is a description of electronic transport in junctions where Rashba parameter is
nonuniform. Such a nonuniformity can appear when graphene is asymmetrically
covered with atomic layers, or when Rashba coupling is strongly dependent on
electric field. It is shown that conductance is significantly modified by the
considered nonuniformity, which is most clearly manifested by an anomalous
minimum at a certain potential step height.
