Minimum distance is an important parameter of a linear error correcting code.
For improved performance of binary Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, we
need to have the minimum distance grow fast with n, the codelength. However,
the best we can hope for is a linear growth in dmin with n. For binary LDPC
codes, the necessary and sufficient conditions on the LDPC ensemble parameters,
to ensure linear growth of minimum distance is well established. In the case of
non-binary LDPC codes, the structure of logarithmic weight codewords is
different from that of binary codes. We have carried out a preliminary study on
the logarithmic bound on the the minimum distance of non-binary LDPC code
ensembles. In particular, we have investigated certain configurations which
would lead to low weight codewords. A set of simulations are performed to
identify some of these configurations. Finally, we have provided a bound on the
logarithmic minimum distance of nonbinary codes, using a strategy similar to
the girth bound for binary codes. This bound has the same asymptotic behaviour
as that of binary codes.
