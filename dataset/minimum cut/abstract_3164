BV photometry is presented for 12 RR Lyr variables discovered in the
presumably young galactic globular cluster Ruprecht 106. All variables are type
RRab, and their periods span a narrow range from 0.574 to 0.652 day. We report
also on the discovery of 3 SX Phe variables among the cluster blue stragglers.
A likely background RR Lyr variable and two foreground contact binaries were
also found in the cluster field. The reddening of Ruprecht 106 is estimated at
E(B-V)=0.20 based on the (B-V) colors exhibited by the cluster RR Lyr variables
at minimum light. Analysis of the "period" versus "amplitude" and "period"
versus "rise-time" diagrams suggests similar metallicities of Ruprecht 106 and
M3. A peak (or bump) is present in the luminosity function of the red giant
branch of Ruprecht 106. Its position relative to the horizontal branch is
consistent with a cluster metallicity of [Fe/H]>= -1.6.
