Considering the need for cost/performance prediction and optimization of
superconducting maglev vehicles, we develop and validate here a 3D finite
element model to simulate superconducting linear magnetic bearings. Then we
reduce the 3D model to a 2D model in order to decrease the computing time. This
allows us to perform in a reasonable time a stochastic optimization considering
the superconductor properties and the vehicle operation. We look for the
permanent magnet guideway geometry that minimizes the cost and maximizes the
lateral force during a displacement sequence, with a constraint on the minimum
levitation force. The displacement sequence reproduces a regular maglev vehicle
operation with both vertical and lateral movements. For the sake of comparison,
our reference is the SupraTrans prototype bearing. The results of the
optimization suggest that the bearing cost could be substantially reduced,
while keeping the same performances as the initial design. Alternatively, the
performances could be significantly improved for the same original cost.
