We solve a problem posed by Ronald Graham about the minimum number, over all
2-colorings of $[1,n]$, of monochromatic $(x,y,x+ay)$ triples, $a \geq 2$. We
show that the minimum number of such triples is $\frac{n^2}{2a(a^2+2a+3)} +
O(n)$. We also find a new upper bound for the minimum number, over all
$r$-colorings of $[1,n]$, of monochromatic Schur triples, for $r \geq 3$.
