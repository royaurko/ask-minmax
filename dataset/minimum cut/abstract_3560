We describe experimental investigations of the structure of two-dimensional
spherical crystals. The crystals, formed by beads self-assembled on water
droplets in oil, serve as model systems for exploring very general theories
about the minimum energy configurations of particles with arbitrary repulsive
interactions on curved surfaces. Above a critical system size we find that
crystals develop distinctive high-angle grain boundaries, or scars, not found
in planar crystals. The number of excess defects in a scar is shown to grow
linearly with the dimensionless system size. The observed slope is expected to
be universal, independent of the microscopic potential.
