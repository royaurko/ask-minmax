We investigate the effects of the saturation boundary on small-x evolution at
the next-to-leading order accuracy and beyond. We demonstrate that the
instabilities of the next-to-leading order BFKL evolution are not cured by the
presence of the nonlinear saturation effects, and a resummation of the higher
order corrections is therefore needed for the nonlinear evolution. The
renormalization group improved resummed equation in the presence of the
saturation boundary is investigated, and the corresponding saturation scale is
extracted. A significant reduction of the saturation scale is found, and we
observe that the onset of the saturation corrections is delayed to higher
rapidities. This seems to be related to the characteristic feature of the
resummed splitting function which at moderately small values of x possesses a
minimum.
