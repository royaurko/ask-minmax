The tenth part of the OGLE-III Catalog of Variable Stars contains 125 Double
Periodic Variables (DPVs) from the Large Magellanic Cloud. DPVs are
semi-detached binaries which show additional variability with a period around
33 times longer than the orbital period. The cause of this long cycle is not
known and previous studies suggest it involves circumbinary matter. We discuss
the properties of the whole sample of the LMC DPVs and put more attention to
particularly interesting objects which may be crucial for verifying hypothesis
explaining long cycle variability. Secondary eclipses of one of the objects
disappear during some orbital cycles and primary eclipses are deeper during
long cycle minimum.
