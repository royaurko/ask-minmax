The imminent WHEN earthquake predictions are based on the correlation between
geomagnetic quakes and the incoming minimum (or maximum) of tidal gravitational
potential. The probability time window for the incoming earthquake is for the
tidal minimum approximately one day and for the maximum- two days. The
statistic evidence for reliability is based on of distributions of the time
difference between occurred and predicted earthquakes for the period 2002- 2005
for Sofia region and 2004- 2005 for Skopje. The project for complex Balkan-
Black Sea region NETWORK for earthquake prediction by using the reliable
precursors will be proposed in near future. The Project is based on the
temporary data acquisition system for preliminary archiving, testing,
visualizing and analyzing of the data with aim to prepare regional daily risk
estimation.
