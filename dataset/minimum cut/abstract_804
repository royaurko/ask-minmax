We investigate one-dimensional collisions of unharmonic chains and a rigid
wall. We find that the coefficient of restitution (COR) is strongly dependent
on the velocity of colliding chains and has a minimum value at a certain
velocity. The relationship between COR and collision velocity is derived for
low-velocity collisions using perturbation methods. We found that the velocity
dependence is characterized by the exponent of the lowest unharmonic term of
interparticle potential energy.
