In this paper we compute the sharp lower bounds for the crossing number of
$n$-string $k$-loop essential tangles. For essential tangles with only string
components, we characterise the ones with the minimum crossing number for a
given number of components, both when the tangle has knotted strings or only
unknotted strings.
