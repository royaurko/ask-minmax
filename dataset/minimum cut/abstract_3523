Measurements of the penetration depth $\lambda (T,H)$ in the presence of a DC
magnetic field were performed in $MgB_2$ wires. In as-prepared wires $\lambda
(T,H<130 Oe)$ shows a strong diamagnetic downturn below $\approx 10 K$. A DC
magnetic field of $130 Oe$ completely suppressed the downturn. The data are
consistent with proximity coupling to a surface $Mg$ layer left during
synthesis. A theory for the proximity effect in the clean limit, together with
an assumed distribution of the $Mg$ layer thickness, qualitatively explains the
field and temperature dependence of the data. Removal of the $Mg$ by chemical
etching results in an exponential temperature dependence for $\lambda (T)$ with
an energy gap of $2 \Delta (0)/T_c\approx 1.54$ ($\Delta(0) \approx 2.61 meV$),
in close agreement with recent measurements on commercial powders and single
crystals. This minimum gap is only 44% of the BCS weak coupling value, implying
substantial anisotropy.
