In this paper we study a queue with L\'evy input, without imposing any a
priori assumption on the jumps being one-sided. The focus is on computing the
transforms of all sorts of quantities related to the transient workload,
assuming the workload is in stationarity at time 0. The results are simple
expressions that are in terms of the bivariate Laplace exponents of ladder
processes. In particular, we derive the transform of the minimum workload
attained over an exponentially distributed interval.
