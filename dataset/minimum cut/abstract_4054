We fitted $C({\bf k},\tau,\epsilon) \propto exp[-\sigma({\bf
k},\epsilon)\tau]$ to time-correlation functions $C({\bf k},\tau,\epsilon)$ of
structure factors $S({\bf k}, t, \epsilon)$ of shadowgraph images of
fluctuations below a supercritical bifurcation at $V_0 = V_c$ to
electro-convection of a planar nematic liquid crystal in the presence of a
voltage $V = \sqrt{2}V_0 cos(2\pi f t) $[${\bf k}= (p,q)$ is the wave vector
and $\epsilon \equiv V_0^2/V_{c}^2 - 1$]. There were stationary oblique
(normal) rolls at small (large) $f$. Fits of a modified Swift-Hohenberg form to
$\sigma({\bf k},\epsilon)$ gave $f$-dependent critical behavior for the minimum
decay rates $\sigma_0(\epsilon)$ and the correlations lengths
$\xi_{p,q}(\epsilon)
