Recently, several charmonium-like states above $D\bar{D}$ threshold have been
discovered at the BELLE and BABAR $B$-factories. Some of these states are
produced via Initial State Radiation ({\it e.g.} Y(4260) and Y(4350)) and some
are observed in $B$ meson decays ({\it{e.g.}} X(3872), Y(3940)). The BELLE
observation of the enhancement in the $\psi(2S)\pi^-$, {\it {i.e.}} the
$Z(4430)^-$ state, has generated a great deal of interest, because such a state
must have minimum quark content ($c\bar{c}d\bar{u}$), so that it would
represent the unequivocal manifestation of a four-quark meson state. Here we
report recent BABAR results on the Y(4260), X(3872), Y(3940), and a search for
the $Z(4430)^-$.
