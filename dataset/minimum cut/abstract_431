A graph is {\em $1$-planar} if it can be drawn in the plane such that every
edge crosses at most one other edge. A connected graph $H$ is {\em strongly
light} in a family of graphs $\mathfrak{G}$, if there exists a constant
$\lambda$, such that every graph $G$ in $\mathfrak{G}$ contains a subgraph $K$
isomorphic to $H$ with $\deg_{G}(v) \leq \lambda$ for all $v \in V(K)$. In this
paper, we present some strongly light subgraphs in the family of $1$-planar
graphs with minimum degree~$7$.
