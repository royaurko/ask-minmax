We present results from an inelastic neutron scattering experiment on the
candidate Heisenberg spin ladder vanadyl pyrophosphate, (VO)2P2O7. We find
evidence for a spin-wave excitation gap of $E_{gap} = 3.7\pm 0.2$ meV, at a
band minimum near $Q=0.8 A^{-1}$. This is consistent with expectations for
triplet spin waves in (VO)2P2O7 in the spin-ladder model, and is to our
knowledge the first confirmation in nature of a Heisenberg antiferromagnetic
spin ladder.
