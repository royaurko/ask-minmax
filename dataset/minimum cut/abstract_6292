We present a high-precision I-band light curve for the Wolf-Rayet binary WR
20a, obtained as a sub-project of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment.
Rauw et al. have recently presented spectroscopy for this system, strongly
suggesting extremely large minimum masses of 70.7 +/- 4.0 Mo and 68.8 +/- 3.8
Mo for the component stars of the system, with the exact values depending
strongly on the period of the system. We detect deep eclipses of about 0.4 mag
in the light curve of WR 20a, confirming and refining the suspected period of
P=3.686 days and deriving an inclination angle of i=74.5 +/- 2 deg. Using these
photometric data and the radial velocity data of Rauw et al., we derive the
masses for the two components of WR 20a to be 83.0 +/- 5.0 Mo and 82.0 +/- 5.0
Mo. Therefore, WR 20a is confirmed to consist of two extremely massive stars
and to be the most massive binary known with an accurate mass determination.
