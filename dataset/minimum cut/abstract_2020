Computer modeling of the one-dimensional and three-dimensional nanoparticles
with Van-der-Waals interaction was performed. The arrangement of atoms was
defined on the grounds of an energy minimum. The calculations have shown that
in the presence of vacancies in a nanoparticle and the account of a relaxation
and oscillations the nanoparticle will pulse. This pulsation on distance
between atoms of a nanoparticle is observed in both one-dimensional and a
three-dimensional cases.
