The cosmological effects of the tachyon rolling down to its ground state are
discussed by coupling a simple effective field theory for the tachyon field to
Einstein gravity. As the tachyon rolls down to the minimum of its potential the
universe expands. Depending upon initial conditions, the scale factor may or
may not start off accelerating, but ultimately it ceases to do so and the final
flat spacetime is either static in the rest frame of the tachyon (if $k=0$) or
(if $k=-1$) given by the Milne model.
