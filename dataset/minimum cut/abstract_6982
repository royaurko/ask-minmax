We determine the speed of a crystallisation (or more generally, a
solidification) front as it advances into the uniform liquid phase after the
system has been quenched into the crystalline region of the phase diagram. We
calculate the front speed by assuming a dynamical density functional theory
model for the system and applying a marginal stability criterion. Our results
also apply to phase field crystal (PFC) models of solidification. As the
solidification front advances into the unstable liquid phase, the density
profile behind the advancing front develops density modulations and the
wavelength of these modulations is a dynamically chosen quantity. For shallow
quenches, the selected wavelength is precisely that of the crystalline phase
and so well-ordered crystalline states are formed. However, when the system is
deeply quenched, we find that this wavelength can be quite different from that
of the crystal, so that the solidification front naturally generates disorder
in the system. Significant rearrangement and ageing must subsequently occur for
the system to form the regular well-ordered crystal that corresponds to the
free energy minimum. Additional disorder is introduced whenever a front
develops from random initial conditions. We illustrate these findings with
results obtained from the PFC.
