The full causal ladder of spacetimes is constructed, and their updated main
properties are developed. Old concepts and alternative definitions of each
level of the ladder are revisited, with emphasis in minimum hypotheses. The
implications of the recently solved ``folk questions on smoothability'', and
alternative proposals (as recent isocausality), are also summarized.
