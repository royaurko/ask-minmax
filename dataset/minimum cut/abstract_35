The minimum distance graph of an extended Preparata code P(m) has vertices
corresponding to codewords and edges corresponding to pairs of codewords that
are distance 6 apart. The clique structure of this graph is investigated and it
is established that the minimum distance graphs of two extended Preparata codes
are isomorphic if and only if the codes are equivalent.
