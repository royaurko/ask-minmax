Determining planetary habitability is a complex matter, as the interplay
between a planet's physical and atmospheric properties with stellar insolation
has to be studied in a self consistent manner. Standardized atmospheric models
for Earth-like planets exist and are commonly accepted as a reference for
estimates of Habitable Zones. In order to define Habitable Zone boundaries,
circular orbital configurations around main sequence stars are generally
assumed. In gravitationally interacting multibody systems, such as double
stars, however, planetary orbits are forcibly becoming non circular with time.
Especially in binary star systems even relatively small changes in a planet's
orbit can have a large impact on habitability. Hence, we argue that a minimum
model for calculating Habitable Zones in binary star systems has to include
dynamical interactions.
