We measure the large-scale real-space power spectrum P(k) using a sample of
205,443 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, covering 2417 square
degrees with mean redshift z~0.1. We employ a matrix-based method using
pseudo-Karhunen-Loeve eigenmodes, producing uncorrelated minimum-variance
measurements in 22 k-bands of both the clustering power and its anisotropy due
to redshift-space distortions, with narrow and well-behaved window functions in
the range 0.02 h/Mpc < k < 0.3h/Mpc. We pay particular attention to modeling,
quantifying and correcting for potential systematic errors, nonlinear redshift
distortions and the artificial red-tilt caused by luminosity-dependent bias.
Our final result is a measurement of the real-space matter power spectrum P(k)
up to an unknown overall multiplicative bias factor. Our calculations suggest
that this bias factor is independent of scale to better than a few percent for
k<0.1h/Mpc, thereby making our results useful for precision measurements of
cosmological parameters in conjunction with data from other experiments such as
the WMAP satellite. As a simple characterization of the data, our measurements
are well fit by a flat scale-invariant adiabatic cosmological model with h
Omega_m =0.201+/- 0.017 and L* galaxy sigma_8=0.89 +/- 0.02 when fixing the
baryon fraction Omega_b/Omega_m=0.17 and the Hubble parameter h=0.72;
cosmological interpretation is given in a companion paper.
