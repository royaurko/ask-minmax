This article presents the results of a study of the longitudinal spatial
resolution of 2 m long straw tubes by means of the direct timing method (DTM).
The feasibility of achieving a coordinate resolution (r.m.s.) better than 2 cm
over full length of the straw is demonstrated. The spatial resolution
insignificantly changes when measured by detecting gammas from a Fe-55 gamma
ray source or minimum ionizing particles from a Ru-106 source. The use of the
same type of FEE for data taking both for measuring the drift time of
ionization electrons and propagation of a signal along the anode wire allows
one to construct a two-dimensional detector for precision coordinate
measurements.
