The Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory of gravity removes the constraint of
general relativity that the affine connection be symmetric by regarding its
antisymmetric part, the torsion tensor, as a dynamical variable. The minimal
coupling between the torsion tensor and Dirac spinors generates a spin-spin
interaction which is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high
densities. We show that such an interaction averts the unphysical big-bang
singularity, replacing it with a cusp-like bounce at a finite minimum scale
factor, before which the Universe was contracting. This scenario also explains
why the present Universe at largest scales appears spatially flat, homogeneous
and isotropic.
