Binaries that contain a hot subdwarf (sdB) star and a main sequence companion
may have interacted in the past. This binary population has historically helped
determine our understanding of binary stellar evolution. We have computed a
grid of binary population synthesis models using different assumptions about
the minimum core mass for helium ignition, the envelope binding energy, the
common envelope ejection efficiency, the amount of mass and angular momentum
lost during stable mass transfer, and the criteria for stable mass transfer on
the red giant branch and in the Hertzsprung gap. These parameters separately
and together can significantly change the entire predicted population of sdBs.
Nonetheless, several different parameter sets can reproduce the observed
subpopulation of sdB + white dwarf and sdB + M dwarf binaries, which has been
used to constrain these parameters in previous studies. The period distribution
of sdB + early F dwarf binaries offers a better test of different mass transfer
scenarios for stars that fill their Roche lobes on the red giant branch.
