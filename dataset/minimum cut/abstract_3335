Precision radial velocity measurements of the Gamma Cephei (HR8974) binary
system suggest the existence of a planetary companion with a minimum mass of
1.7 Jupiter-mass on an elliptical orbit with a ~2.14 AU semimajor axis and 0.12
eccentricity (hatzes et al. 2003). I present in this paper a summary of the
results of an extensive numerical study of the orbital stability of this
three-body system for different values of the semimajor axis and orbital
eccentricity of the binary, and also the orbital inclination of the planet.
Numerical integrations indicate that the system is stable for the planet's
orbital inclination ranging from 0 to 60 degrees, and for the binary's orbital
eccentricity less than 0.5. The results also indicate that for large values of
the inclination, the system may be locked in a Kozai resonance.
