We determine the asymptotic growth of planar graphs with a condition on the
minimum degree, and properties of random graphs from these classes. In
particular we show that the size of the largest tree attached to the core of a
random planar graph is of order c log(n) for an explicit constant c. These
results provide new information on the structure of random planar graphs.
