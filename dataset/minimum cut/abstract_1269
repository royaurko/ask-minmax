A "book" with k pages consists of a straight line (the "spine") and k
half-planes (the "pages"), such that the boundary of each page is the spine. If
a graph is drawn on a book with k pages in such a way that the vertices lie on
the spine, and each edge is contained in a page, the result is a k-page book
drawing (or simply a k-page drawing). The pagenumber of a graph G is the
minimum k such that G admits a k-page embedding (that is, a k-page drawing with
no edge crossings). The k-page crossing number nu_k(G) of G is the minimum
number of crossings in a k-page drawing of G. We investigate the pagenumbers
and k-page crossing numbers of complete bipartite graphs. We find the exact
pagenumbers of several complete bipartite graphs, and use these pagenumbers to
find the exact k-page crossing number of K_{k+1,n} for 3<=k<=6. We also prove
the general asymptotic estimate lim_{k->oo} lim_{n->oo}
nu_k(K_{k+1,n})/(2n^2/k^2)=1. Finally, we give general upper bounds for
nu_k(K_{m,n}), and relate these bounds to the k-planar crossing numbers of
K_{m,n} and K_n.
