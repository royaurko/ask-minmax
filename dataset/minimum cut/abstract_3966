We study the dynamics of a D3-brane moving in the background of a bulk
tachyon field of a D3-brane solution of Type-0 string theory. We show that the
dynamics on the probe D3-brane can be described by a geometrical tachyon field
rolling down its potential which is modified by a function of the bulk tachyon
and inflation occurs at weak string coupling, where the bulk tachyon condenses,
near the top of the geometrical tachyon potential. We also find a late
accelerating phase when the bulk tachyon asymptotes to zero which in the
geometrical tachyon picture corresponds to the minimum of the geometrical
potential.
