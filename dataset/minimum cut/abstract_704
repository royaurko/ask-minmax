We revisited the sunspot observations published by Johannes Hevelius in his
book Machina Coelestis (1679) corresponding to the period 1653-1675 (just in
the middle of the Maunder Minimum). We show detailed translations of the
original Latin texts describing the sunspot records and provide the general
context of these sunspot observations. From this source only, we present an
estimate of the annual values of the Group Sunspot Number based only on the
records that explicitly inform about the presence or absence of sunspots.
Although we obtain very low values of the Group Sunspot Number, in accordance
with a grand minimum of solar activity, these values are significantly higher
in general than the values provided by Hoyt and Schatten (1998) for the same
period.
