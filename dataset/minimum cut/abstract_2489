A novel construction of polar codes with dynamic frozen symbols is proposed.
The proposed codes are subcodes of extended BCH codes, which ensure
sufficiently high minimum distance. Furthermore, a decoding algorithm is
proposed, which employs estimates of the not-yet-processed bit channel error
probabilities to perform directed search in code tree, reducing thus the total
number of iterations.
