The program to construct minimum-uncertainty coherent states for general
potentials works transparently with solvable analytic potentials. However, when
an analytic potential is not completely solvable, like for a double-well or the
linear (gravitational) potential, there can be a conundrum. Motivated by
supersymmetry concepts in higher dimensions, we show how these conundrums can
be overcome.
