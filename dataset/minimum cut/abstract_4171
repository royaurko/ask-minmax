We construct wave packets for the hydrogen atom labelled by the classical
action-angle variables with the following properties. i) The time evolution is
exactly given by classical evolution of the angle variables. (The angle
variable corresponding to the position on the orbit is now non-compact and we
do not get exactly the same state after one period. However the gross features
do not change. In particular the wave packet remains peaked around the labels.)
ii) Resolution of identity using this overcomplete set involves exactly the
classical phase space measure. iii) Semi-classical limit is related to
Bohr-Sommerfield quantization. iv) They are almost minimum uncertainty wave
packets in position and momentum.
