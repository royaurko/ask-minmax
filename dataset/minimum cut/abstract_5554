At the interface between a superconductor and a ferromagnetic metal
spin-singlet Cooper pairs can penetrate into the ferromagnetic part of the
heterostructure with an oscillating and decaying spin-singlet Cooper pair
density. However, if the interface allows for a spin-mixing effect, equal-spin
spin-triplet Cooper pairs can be generated that can penetrate much further into
the ferromagnetic part of the heterostructure, known as the long-range
proximity effect. Here, we present results of spin-mixing based on
self-consistent solutions of the microscopic Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations
incorporating a tight-binding model. In particular, we include a conical magnet
into our model heterostructure to generate the spin-triplet Cooper pairs and
analyse the influence of conical and ferromagnetic layer thickness on the
unequal-spin and equal-spin spin-triplet pairing correlations. It will be show
that, in agreement with experimental observations, a minimum thickness of the
conical magnet is necessary to generate a sufficient amount of equal-spin
spin-triplet Cooper pairs allowing for the long-range proximity effect.
