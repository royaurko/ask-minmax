This fluid dynamics video provides sample experimental results focusing on
the interactions of shear layer vortices with the trailing corner in a 2D open
cavity shear layer. These interactions were investigated experimentally in a
water tunnel at a Reynolds number of 40,000. Time-resolved particle image
velocimetry (PIV) with an image sampling rate of 4500 frames per second was
used to simultaneously measure the instantaneous velocity, material
acceleration and pressure distributions. The latter was calculated by
integrating the spatial distribution of in-plane components of the material
acceleration. A large database of instantaneous realizations visualized the
dynamic changes to the shear layer vortices, such as deformation and breakup as
they impinged and climbed over the cavity trailing corner. These interactions
cause time-dependent formation of a pressure maximum as the flow impinges on
the forward facing surface of the trailing corner, and a minimum above the
corner, where large local pressure gradients dominate the generation of fresh
vorticity. Data analysis shows that interactions with the corner involve two
time scales. Intermediate Strouhal numbers (0.6-3.2) are associated with
interaction of the shear layer vortices with the corner, while vertical
flapping of the shear layer occurs at low Strouhal numbers (0.1-0.6).
