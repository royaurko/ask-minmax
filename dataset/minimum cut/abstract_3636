We have investigated magnetic, electrical and thermal transport properties
(Seebeck effect and thermal conductivity) of
LaSr$_{2}$Mn$_{2-y}$Cr$_{y}$O$_{7}$ polycrystalline samples ($y$=0.1, 0.2, 0.4
and 0.6). The Cr$^{3+}$ substitution for Mn$^{3+}$ sites causes a removal of
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital of $e_g$-electron resulting in a volume shrinkage of
lattice. Magnetic measurements reveal the appearance of a glassy behavior for
Cr-doped samples, accompanied by both a collapse of the A-type
antiferromagnetic structure and the growth of ferromagnetic clusters. Cr-doping
effect on electrical transport strongly enhances an insulating behavior over a
wide range of temperature, while it suppresses a local minimum of
thermoelectric power at lower temperatures. The phonon thermal conduction
gradually rises with increasing Cr content, which is contradictory to a typical
impurity effect on thermal conductivity. We attribute this to a suppression of
local lattice distortion through the introduction of Jahn-Teller inactive ions
of Cr$^{3+}$.
