The Parkes multibeam pulsar survey has led to the discovery of more than 700
pulsars. In this paper, we provide timing solutions, flux densities and pulse
profiles for 180 of these new discoveries. Two pulsars, PSRs J1736-2843 and
J1847-0130 have rotational periods P > 6s and are therefore among the slowest
rotating radio pulsars known. Conversely, with P = 1.8ms, PSR J1843-1113 has
the third shortest period of pulsars currently known. This pulsar and PSR
J1905+0400 (P = 3.8ms) are both solitary. We also provide orbital parameters
for a new binary system, PSR J1420-5625, which has P = 34ms, an orbital period
of 40 days and a minimum companion mass of 0.4 solar masses. The 10 degree-wide
strip along the Galactic plane that was surveyed is known to contain 264 radio
pulsars that were discovered prior to the multibeam pulsar survey. We have
redetected almost all of these pulsars and provide new dispersion measure
values and flux densities at 20cm for the redetected pulsars.
