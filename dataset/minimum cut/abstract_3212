The results of spectroscopic observations of 363 star-like objects from the
Second Byurakan Survey (SBS) are reported. This SBS's subsample has proven to
be a rich source of newly identified quasars, Seyfert type galaxies, degenerate
stars and hot subdwarfs. In the subsample here studied, we identified 35 new
QSOs, 142 White Dwarfs (WDs) the majority of which, 114 are of DA type, 55
subdwarfs (29 of which are sdB-type stars), 10 HBB, 16 NHB, 54 G-type and 25
F-type stars, two objects with composite spectra, four Cataclismic Variables
(CV), two peculiar emission line stars, 17 objects with continuous spectra, as
well as one planetary nebula. Among the 35 QSOs we have found two Broad
Absorption Line (BAL) QSOs, namely SBS 1423+500 and SBS 1435+500A. Magnitudes,
redshifts, and slit spectra for all QSOs, also some typical spectra of the
peculiar stars are presented. We estimate the minimum surface density of bright
QSOs in redshift range 0.3<z<2.2 to be 0.05 per sq. deg. for B<17.0 and 0.10
per sq. deg. for B<17.5.
