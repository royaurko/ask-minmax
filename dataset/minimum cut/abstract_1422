We present two minimum residual methods for solving sequences of shifted
linear systems, the right-preconditioned shifted GMRES and shifted Recycled
GMRES algorithms. These methods are compatible with general preconditioning of
all systems, and when restricted to right preconditioning, require no extra
applications of the operator or preconditioner. These methods perform a minimum
residual iteration for the base system while improving the approximations for
the shifted systems at little additional cost. The iteration continues until
the base system approximation is of satisfactory quality. The method is then
recursively called for the remaining unconverged systems. We present both
methods inside of a general framework which allows these techniques to be
extended to the setting of flexible preconditioning and inexact Krylov methods.
We present some analysis of such methods and numerical experiments
demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithms we have derived.
