Minimum total energy calculations, which account for both electron--lattice
and electron--electron interactions in conjugated polymers are performed for
chains with up to eight carbon atoms. These calculations are motivated in part
by recent experimental results on the spectroscopy of polyenes and conjugated
polymers and shed light on the longstanding question of the relative importance
of electron--lattice vs. electron--electron interactions in determining the
properties of these systems.
