The X-ray pulsar GX 1+4 was observed with the RXTE satellite for a total of
51ks between 1996 July 19 - 21. During this period the flux decreased smoothly
from an initial mean level of ~ 6 X 10^36 erg/s to a minimum of ~ 4 X 10^35
erg/s (2-60 keV, assuming a source distance of 10 kpc) before partially
recovering towards the initial level at the end of the observation.
 BATSE pulse timing measurements indicate that a torque reversal took place
approximately 10 d after this observation. Both the mean pulse profile and the
photon spectrum varied significantly. The observed variation in the source may
provide important clues as to the mechanism of torque reversals.
 The single best-fitting spectral model was based on a component originating
from thermal photons with kT ~ 1 keV Comptonised by a plasma of temperature kT
\~ 7 keV. Both the flux modulation with phase during the brightest interval and
the evolution of the mean spectra over the course of the observation are
consistent with variations in this model component; with, in addition, a
doubling of the column density nH contributing to the mean spectral change.
 A strong flare of duration 50 s was observed during the interval of minimum
flux, with the peak flux ~ 20 times the mean level. Although beaming effects
are likely to mask the true variation in Mdot thought to give rise to the
flare, the timing of a modest increase in flux prior to the flare is consistent
with dual episodes of accretion resulting from successive orbits of a locally
dense patch of matter in the accretion disc.
