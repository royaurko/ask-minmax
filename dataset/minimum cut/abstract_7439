We report the detection of GJ 832c, a super-Earth orbiting near the inner
edge of the habitable zone of GJ 832, an M dwarf previously known to host a
Jupiter analog in a nearly-circular 9.4-year orbit. The combination of precise
radial-velocity measurements from three telescopes reveals the presence of a
planet with a period of 35.68+/-0.03 days and minimum mass (m sin i) of
5.4+/-1.0 Earth masses. GJ 832c moves on a low-eccentricity orbit
(e=0.18+/-0.13) towards the inner edge of the habitable zone. However, given
the large mass of the planet, it seems likely that it would possess a massive
atmosphere, which may well render the planet inhospitable. Indeed, it is
perhaps more likely that GJ 832c is a "super-Venus," featuring significant
greenhouse forcing. With an outer giant planet and an interior, potentially
rocky planet, the GJ 832 planetary system can be thought of as a miniature
version of our own Solar system.
