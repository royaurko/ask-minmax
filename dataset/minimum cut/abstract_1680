We have simulated, as a showcase, the pentapeptide Met-enkephalin
(Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met) to visualize the energy landscape and investigate the
conformational coverage by the multicanonical method. We have obtained a
three-dimensional topographic picture of the whole energy landscape by plotting
the histogram with respect to energy(temperature) and the order parameter,
which gives the degree of resemblance of any created conformation with the
global energy minimum (GEM).
