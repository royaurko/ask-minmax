We show that the "ridge" phenomenon in the two-particle angular correlation
function, as observed by the CMS experiment, can be reproduced by implementing
an impact parameter dependent azimuthal correlation of the scattering planes of
individual partonic interactions. Such an approach is motivated by the
observation that even for moderate impact parameters a substantial number of
partonic interactions may be produced, while at the same time the protons are
sufficiently far apart to create a preferential direction in azimuth. A re-tune
of the Pythia6 Z2 tune based on underlying event and minimum bias distributions
measured at the LHC shows that a better description of data can be obtained
with this approach and that some tension existing between underlying event and
minimum bias distributions can be removed. We show that, even though the CMS
result on the angular correlation function itself is not used in the re-tune,
we can predict the appearance of long-range, near-side angular correlations in
proton-proton collisions.
