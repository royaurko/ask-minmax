Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$ and size $m$ and let $k\geq 1$ be an integer.
A $k$-tuple total dominating set in $G$ is called a $k$-tuple total restrained
dominating set of $G$ if each vertex $x\in V(G)-S$ is adjacent to at least $k$
vertices of $V(G)-S$. The minimum number of vertices of a such sets in $G$ are
the $k$-tuple total restrained domination number $\gamma_{\times k,t}^{r}(G)$
of $G$. The maximum number of classes of a partition of $V(G)$ such that its
all classes are $k$-tuple total restrained dominating sets in $G$, is called
the $k$-tuple total restrained domatic number of $G$.
  In this manuscript, we first find $\gamma_{\times k,t}^{r}(G)$, when $G$ is
complete graph, cycle, bipartite graph and the complement of path or cycle.
Also we will find bounds for this number when $G$ is a complete multipartite
graph. Then we will know the structure of graphs $G$ which $\gamma_{\times
k,t}^{r}(G)=m$, for some $m\geq k+1$ and give upper and lower bounds for
$\gamma_{\times k,t}^{r}(G)$, when $G$ is an arbitrary graph. Next, we mainly
present basic properties of the $k$-tuple total restrained domatic number of a
graph and give bounds for it. Finally we give bounds for the $k$-tuple total
restrained domination number of the complementary prism $G\bar{G}$ in terms on
the similar number of $G$ and $\bar{G}$ when $G$ is a regular graph or an
arbitrary graph. And then we calculate it when $G$ is cycle or path.
