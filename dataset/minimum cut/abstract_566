This papers presents a detailed analysis of pseudocodewords of Tanner graphs.
Pseudocodewords arising on the iterative decoder's computation tree are
distinguished from pseudocodewords arising on finite degree lifts. Lower bounds
on the minimum pseudocodeword weight are presented for the BEC, BSC, and AWGN
channel. Some structural properties of pseudocodewords are examined, and
pseudocodewords and graph properties that are potentially problematic with
min-sum iterative decoding are identified. An upper bound on the minimum degree
lift needed to realize a particular irreducible lift-realizable pseudocodeword
is given in terms of its maximal component, and it is shown that all
irreducible lift-realizable pseudocodewords have components upper bounded by a
finite value $t$ that is dependent on the graph structure. Examples and
different Tanner graph representations of individual codes are examined and the
resulting pseudocodeword distributions and iterative decoding performances are
analyzed. The results obtained provide some insights in relating the structure
of the Tanner graph to the pseudocodeword distribution and suggest ways of
designing Tanner graphs with good minimum pseudocodeword weight.
