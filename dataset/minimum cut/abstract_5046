The prospects for accomplishing x-ray polarization measurements of
astronomical sources have grown in recent years, after a hiatus of more than 37
years. Unfortunately, accompanying this long hiatus has been some confusion
over the statistical uncertainties associated with x-ray polarization
measurements of these sources. We have initiated a program to perform the
detailed calculations that will offer insights into the uncertainties
associated with x-ray polarization measurements. Here we describe a
mathematical formalism for determining the 1- and 2-parameter errors in the
magnitude and position angle of x-ray (linear) polarization in the presence of
a (polarized or unpolarized) background. We further review relevant
statistics-including clearly distinguishing between the Minimum Detectable
Polarization (MDP) and the accuracy of a polarization measurement.
