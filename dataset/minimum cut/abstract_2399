The standard model extended by three vector-like families with masses of
order 1 TeV -- 100 TeV allows for unification of gauge couplings. The values of
gauge couplings at the electroweak scale are highly insensitive to fundamental
parameters. The grand unification scale is large enough to avoid the problem
with fast proton decay. The electroweak minimum of the Higgs potential is
stable.
