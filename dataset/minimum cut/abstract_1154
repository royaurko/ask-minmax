We present the first measurements of the $\rho(770)^0$, $K^*$(892),
$\Delta$(1232)$^{++}$, $\Sigma$(1385), and $\Lambda$(1520) resonances in $d$+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV, reconstructed via their hadronic
decay channels using the STAR detector at RHIC. The masses and widths of these
resonances are studied as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$). We observe
that the resonance spectra follow a generalized scaling law with the transverse
mass ($m_T$). The $<p_T>$ of resonances in minimum bias collisions is compared
to the $<p_T>$ of $\pi$, $K$, and $\bar{p}$. The $\rho^0/\pi^-$, $K^*/K^-$,
$\Delta^{++}/p$, $\Sigma(1385)/\Lambda$, and $\Lambda(1520)/\Lambda$ ratios in
$d$+Au collisions are compared to the measurements in minimum bias $p+p$
interactions, where we observe that both measurements are comparable. The
nuclear modification factors ($R_{dAu}$) of the $\rho^0$, $K^*$, and $\Sigma^*$
scale with the number of binary collisions ($N_{bin}$) for $p_T >$ 1.2 GeV/$c$.
