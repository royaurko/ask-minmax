The inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decay distributions for b -> c decay
are computed in the Shifman-Voloshin limit. The inclusive decay distributions
(computed using an operator product expansion) depend on quark masses, and the
exclusive decay distributions depend on hadron masses. Nevertheless, we show
explicitly how the first two terms in the 1/m expansion match between the
inclusive and exclusive decays. Agreement between the inclusive and exclusive
decay rates requires a minimum smearing region of size Lambda_QCD before local
duality holds in QCD. The alpha_s corrections to the inclusive and exclusive
decay rates are also shown to agree to order (log m)/m^2. The alpha_s/m^2
corrections are used to obtain the alpha_s correction to Bjorken's inequality
on the slope of the Isgur-Wise function.
