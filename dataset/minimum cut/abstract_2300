The average light transmission of one-dimensional photonic media has been
studied as a function of the medium homogeneity, quantified by the
Shannon-Wiener index. We have found a decrease in the average light
transmission by increasing the Shannon-Wiener index up to minimum
(corresponding to H'=0.9375): from this point, the transmission increases
following the Shannon-Wiener index. The behaviour has been confirmed for
different pairs of materials forming the photonic structure. Nevertheless, we
have observed that the trend slope is proportional to the refractive index
ratio between the two materials (nhi/nlow).
