We employ molecular dynamic simulations to study the reduction process of
graphene-oxide (GO) in a chemically active environment enriched with hydrogen.
We examine the concentration and pressure of hydrogen gas as a function of
temperature in which abstraction of oxygen is possible with minimum damage to
C-sp$^2$ bonds hence preserving the integrity of the graphene sheet. Through
these studies we find chemical pathways that demonstrate beneficiary mechanisms
for the quality of graphene including formation of water as well as suppression
of carbonyl pair holes in favor of hydroxyl and epoxy formation facilitated by
hydrogen gas in the environment.
