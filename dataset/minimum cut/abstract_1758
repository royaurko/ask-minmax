Global topological defects produce nonzero stress-energy throughout
spacetime, and as a result can have observable gravitational influence on
surrounding matter. Gravitational effects of global strings are used to place
bounds on their cosmic abundance. The minimum separation between global strings
is estimated by considering the defects' contribution to the cosmological
energy density. More rigorous constraints on the abundance of global strings
are constructed by examining the tidal forces such defects will have on
observable astrophysical systems. The small number of observed tidally
disrupted systems indicates there can be very few of these objects in the
observable universe.
