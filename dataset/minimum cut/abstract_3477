A simple model based on atom-atom potential has been used to calculate
various bulk, structural and thermodynamic properties of pure C_{60} solid by
including implicit anharmonicity. The pressure and temperature dependent
properties such as bulk modulus, lattice and orientational structure, thermal
expansion, phonon frequency shift, Gruneisen parameters, heat capacity and
entropy have been calculated and compared with available data. Though results
for some of these properties have been calculated earlier, using improved
potential models to suit C60 solid, this paper ascertains the extent of
validity of a potential used successfully in the past explaining the observed
properties of aromatic hydrocarbons. The same potential used without
modification does reproduce, barring orientational absolute minimum
configuration, broadly, all the other calculated properties to similar degree
of accuracy. It thus provides a platform to include additional terms for
interpreting properties of doped C60 solids and polymerized C60 systems.
