We show that stable disk accretion should be very rare among low-mass X-ray
binaries and cataclysmic variables whose evolution is driven by the nuclear
expansion of the secondary star on the first giant branch. Stable accretion is
confined to neutron-star systems where the secondary is still relatively
massive, and some supersoft white dwarf accretors. All other systems, including
all black-hole systems, appear as soft X-ray transients or dwarf novae. All
long-period neutron-star systems become transient well before most of the
envelope mass is transferred, and remain transient until envelope exhaustion.
This complicates attempts to compare the numbers of millisecond pulsars in the
Galactic disk with their LMXB progenitors, and also means that the pulsar spin
rates are fixed in systems which are transient rather than steady, contrary to
common assumption. The long-period persistent sources Sco X-2, LMC X-2, Cyg X-2
and V395 Car must have minimum companion masses > 0.75 Msun if they contain
neutron stars, and still larger masses if they contain black holes. The
companion in the neutron-star transient GRO J1744-2844 must have a mass <0.87
Msun. The existence of any steady sources at all at long periods supports the
ideas that (a) the accretion disks in many, if not all, LMXBs are strongly
irradiated by the central source, and (b) mass transfer is thermally unstable
in long-period supersoft X-ray sources.
