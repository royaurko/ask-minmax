It is known that a statistically significant treatment may not be clinically
significant. A quantity that can be used to assess clinical significance is
called the minimum clinically important difference (MCID), and inference on the
MCID is an important and challenging problem. In applications, there is no
likelihood function connecting the MCID and the observed data, suggesting that
Bayesian inference is out of reach. Motivated by a representation of the MCID
as the minimizer of a suitable risk function, we construct a likelihood-free
posterior distribution for the MCID and establish its convergence rate. We also
show, numerically, that an appropriately scaled version the posterior yields
interval estimates for the MCID which are both valid and efficient even for
relatively small sample sizes.
