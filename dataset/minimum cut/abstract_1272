Independent component analysis (ICA) has been shown to be useful in many
applications. However, most ICA methods are sensitive to data contamination and
outliers. In this article we introduce a general minimum U-divergence framework
for ICA, which covers some standard ICA methods as special cases. Within the
U-family we further focus on the gamma-divergence due to its desirable property
of super robustness, which gives the proposed method gamma-ICA. Statistical
properties and technical conditions for the consistency of gamma-ICA are
rigorously studied. In the limiting case, it leads to a necessary and
sufficient condition for the consistency of MLE-ICA. This necessary and
sufficient condition is weaker than the condition known in the literature.
Since the parameter of interest in ICA is an orthogonal matrix, a geometrical
algorithm based on gradient flows on special orthogonal group is introduced to
implement gamma-ICA. Furthermore, a data-driven selection for the gamma value,
which is critical to the achievement of gamma-ICA, is developed. The
performance, especially the robustness, of gamma-ICA in comparison with
standard ICA methods is demonstrated through experimental studies using
simulated data and image data.
