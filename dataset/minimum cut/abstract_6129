We report Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared NICMOS observations of a
remarkable low-luminosity Class I (protostellar) source in the Taurus Molecular
Cloud. IRAS 04325+2402 exhibits a complex bipolar scattered light nebula. The
central continuum source is resolved and may be multiple, or may be crossed by
a small dust lane. Complex arcs seen in scattered light surround the central
source; the physical nature of these structures is not clear, but they may
reflect perturbations from multiple stellar sources or from time-dependent mass
ejection. A second, resolved continuum source is found at a projected distance
of approximately 1150 AU from the central region, near the edge of a nebular
lobe probably produced by outflow. The images indicate that this second source
is another low-luminosity young stellar object, seen nearly edge-on through a
dusty disk and envelope system with disk diameter $\sim 60$ AU. We suggest that
the scattered light ``streaks'' associated with this second source are
limb-brightened outflow cavities in the dusty envelope, possibly perturbed by
interaction with the outflow lobes of the main source. The nature of the
companion is uncertain, since it is observed mostly in scattered light, but is
most probably a very low mass star or brown dwarf, with a minimum luminosity of
$\sim 10^{-2} \lsun$. Our results show that protostellar sources may have
multiple centers of infall and non-aligned disks and outflows, even on
relatively small scales.
