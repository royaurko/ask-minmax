We give several partial positive answers to a question of Juhasz and
Szentmiklossy regarding the minimum number of discrete sets required to cover a
compact space. We study the relationship between the size of discrete sets,
free sequences and their closures with the cardinality of a Hausdorff space,
improving known results in the literature.
