In this paper we found the renormalized free energy of a interacting scalar
field on a compact hyperbolic manifold explicitly. We have shown a complete
expression of the free energy and entropy as a function of the curvature and
the temperature. Carefully analyzing the free energy we have shown that there
exist a minimum with respect to the curvature that depend on the temperature.
The principle of minimum free energy give us an estimate of the connection
between stationary curvature and temperature. As a result we obtain that the
stationary curvature increases when the temperature increases too. If we start
from an universe with very high curvature and temperature in the beginning,
because of the principle of minimum free energy, the universe will reach a new
situation of equilibrium for low temperature and low curvature. Consequently,
the flat space-time is obtained for low temperature.
