The interrelation between the cyclic structure of an ideal, i.e., a cyclic
code over Galois field $GF(q)$, $q>2$, and its classes of proportional elements
is considered. This relation is used in order to define the code's weight
structure. The equidistance conditions of irreducible nonprimitive codes over
GF(q) are given. Besides that, the minimum distance for some class of
nonprimitive cyclic codes is found.
