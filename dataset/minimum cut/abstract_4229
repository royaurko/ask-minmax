We analyse the effective supergravity model of a warped compactification with
matter on D3 and D7-branes. We find that the main effect of the warp factor is
to modify the F-terms while leaving the D-terms invariant. Hence warped models
with moduli stabilisation and a small positive cosmological constant resulting
from a large warping can only be achieved with an almost vanishing D-term and a
F-term uplifting. By studying string-motivated examples with gaugino
condensation on magnetised D7-branes, we find that even with a vanishing
D-term, it is difficult to achieve a Minkowski minimum for reasonable parameter
choices. When coupled to an ISS sector the AdS vacua is uplifted, resulting in
a small gravitino mass for a warp factor of order 10^-5.
