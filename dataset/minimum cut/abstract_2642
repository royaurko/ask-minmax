Partial cubes are graphs isometrically embeddable into hypercubes. We analyze
how isometric cycles in partial cubes behave and derive that every partial cube
of girth more than six must have vertices of degree less than three. As a
direct corollary we get that every regular partial cube of girth more than six
is an even cycle. Along the way we prove that every partial cube $G$ with girth
more than six is the so-called zone graph and therefore
$2n(G)-m(G)-i(G)+ce(G)=2$ holds, where $i(G)$ is the isometric dimension of $G$
and $ce(G)$ its convex excess.
