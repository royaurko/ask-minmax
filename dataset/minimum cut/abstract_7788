We present an analysis of the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating
Spectrometer observation of the rapidly rotating P_(rot)=0.94 d post T Tauri
(~20 Myr old) star PZ Telescopii, in the Tucana association. Using two
different methods we have derived the coronal emission measure distribution,
em(T), and chemical abundances. The em(T) peaks at log T = 6.9 and exhibits a
significant emission measure at temperatures log T > 7. The coronal abundances
are generally ~0.5 times the solar photospheric values that are presumed fairly
representative of the composition of the underlying star. A minimum in
abundance is seen at a first ionization potential (FIP) of 7-8 eV, with
evidence for higher abundances at both lower and higher FIP, similar to
patterns seen in other active stars. From an analysis of the He-like triplet of
Mg XI we have estimated electron densities of ~10^(12)-10^(13) cm^(-3). All the
coronal properties found for PZ Tel are much more similar to those of AB Dor,
which is slightly older than PZ Tel, than to those of the younger T Tauri star
TW Hya. These results support earlier conclusions that the soft X-ray emission
of TW Hya is likely dominated by accretion activity rather than by a
magnetically-heated corona. Our results also suggest that the coronae of
pre-main sequence stars rapidly become similar to those of older active
main-sequence stars soon after the accretion stage has ended.
