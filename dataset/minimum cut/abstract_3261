Using the recently completed Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, we have
detected the HI 21 cm-line absorption from the peculiar galaxy C153 in the
galaxy cluster Abell 2125. The HI absorption is at a redshift of 0.2533, with a
peak optical depth of 0.36. The full width at half minimum of the absorption
line is 100 km/s. The estimated column density of atomic Hydrogen is
0.7e22(Ts/100K) per sq. cm. The HI absorption is redshifted by ~ 400 km/s
compared to the [OIII] emission line from this system. We attribute this to an
in-falling cold gas, or to an out-flowing ionised gas, or to a combination of
both as a consequence of tidal interactions of C153 with either a cluster
galaxy or the cluster potential.
