Intersymbol interference (ISI) is a major cause of degradation in the
receiver performance of high-speed data communications systems. This arises
mainly due to limited bandwidth available. The minimum Euclidean distance
between any two symbol sequences is an important parameter in this case at
moderate to high signal to noise ratios. It is proven here that as ISI
increases the minimum distance strictly decreases when the worst case scenario
is considered. From this it follows that the minimum eigenvalue of the worst
case ISI channel of a given length is unique.
