We present new sub-mm observations and modelling of Vega excess stars, using
realistic dust grain models. For resolved disks, we find that different objects
require very different dust grain properties in order to simultaneously fit the
image data and SED. Fomalhaut and Vega require solid dust grains, whilst HR4796
and HD141569 can only be fitted using porous grains. The older stars tend to
have less porous grains than younger stars, which may indicate that collisions
have compacted the dust grains. Eps Eri appears to be deficient in small dust
grains compared to our best fitting model. This may be due to factors which
affect the size distribution of grains close to the radiation pressure blowout
limit. Alternatively, this discrepancy may be due to some external influence on
the disk (e.g. a planet). When the model is applied to unresolved targets, an
estimate of the disk size can be made. However, the large diversity in dust
composition for the resolved disks means that we cannot make a reliable
assumption as to the composition of the grains in an unresolved disk, and there
is corresponding uncertainty in the disk size. In addition, the poor fit for
Eps Eri shows that the model cannot always account for the SED even if the disk
size is known. These two factors mean that it may not be possible to determine
a disk's size without actually resolving it.
