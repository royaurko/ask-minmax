A neutral impurity atom immersed in a dilute Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
can have a bound ground state in which the impurity is self-localized. In this
small polaron-like state, the impurity distorts the density of the surrounding
BEC, thereby creating the self-trapping potential minimum. We describe the
self-localization in a strong coupling approach.
