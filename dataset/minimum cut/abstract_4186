We consider entanglement in the ground state of the XY spin model on infinite
chain. We use von Neumann entropy of a sub-system as a measure of entanglement.
The entropy of a large block of neighboring spins approaches a constant as the
size of the block increases. We prove rigorously expression for limiting
entropy which was published before. We observe that the entropy reaches minimum
at product states but increases boundlessly at phase transitions.
