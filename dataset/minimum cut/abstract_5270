The proposed hybrid message embedded scheme consists of hill cipher combined
with message embedded chaotic scheme. Message-embedded scheme using non-linear
feedback shift register as non-linear function and 1-D logistic map as chaotic
map is modified, analyzed and tested for avalanche property and strength
against known plaintext attack and brute-force attack. Parameter of logistic
map acts as a secret key. As we know that the minimum key space to resist
brute-force attack is 2100, and it is observed from analysis that key space of
the discussed method is lesser than 2100. But the identifiability test
concludes that the scheme consists of identifiable keys which are sufficient
condition to resist brute-force attack for chaotic ciphers. A complete file can
be encrypted and decrypted successfully by the method that assures security
against brute force attack. It is also concluded that the scheme has an average
key sensitivity.
