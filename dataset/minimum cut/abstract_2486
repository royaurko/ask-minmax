Violation of Bell inequality (or, Bell-type inequalities) by nonlocal
correlations is justified by relaxation of at least one of the plausible
physical constraints used to model such inequality. Based on this fact, in this
letter we present a procedure to simulate three-qubit GHZ correlation relaxing
two constraints, determinism and no signaling simultaneously. We have also
derived the minimum amount of indeterminism and signaling to be introduced in a
system. The corresponding number of signaling and local bits of mutual
information needed to communicate are also provided and thus we are able to
focus on utility of relaxation of these two constraints as useful resources.
