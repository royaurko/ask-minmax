An array low-density parity-check (LDPC) code is a quasi-cyclic LDPC code
specified by two integers $q$ and $m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \leq
q$. The exact minimum distance, for small $q$ and $m$, has been calculated, and
tight upper bounds on it for $m \leq 7$ have been derived. In this work, we
study the minimum distance of the spatially-coupled version of these codes. In
particular, several tight upper bounds on the optimal minimum distance for
coupling length at least two and $m=3,4,5$, that are independent of $q$ and
that are valid for all values of $q \geq q_0$ where $q_0$ depends on $m$, are
presented. Furthermore, we show by exhaustive search that by carefully
selecting the edge spreading or unwrapping procedure, the minimum distance
(when $q$ is not very large) can be significantly increased, especially for
$m=5$.
