LHCb presents studies of particle production in minimum bias events in pp
collisions at \sqrt{s} = 7 TeV. These studies include measurements of
strangeness production, particle ratios, baryon-antibaryon ratios and charged
particle production. The forward coverage and low pT acceptance of the
experiment makes these measurements very complementary to those performed by
the central detectors at the LHC. Further benefits arise from the powerful
particle identification capabilities provided by the LHCb RICH system. The
measurements are compared with theoretical predictions.
