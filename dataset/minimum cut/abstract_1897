We construct simple curves from immersed curves in the setting of
handlebodies and Heegaard splittings. We define a measure of complexity we call
girth for closed curves in a handlebody. We extend this complexity to Heegaard
splittings and pose a conjecture about all Heegaard splittings. We prove a test
case of this conjecture. Let S be a compact surface embedded in the boundary of
a handlebody H. Then the minimum girth over all curves in S can be achieved by
a simple closed curve. We also present algorithms to compute the girth of
curves and surfaces.
