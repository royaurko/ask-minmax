We present minimum chi-squared fits of power law and Hernquist density
profiles to F-turnoff stars in eight 2.5 deg wide stripes of SDSS data: five in
the North Galactic Cap and three in the South Galactic cap. Portions of the
stellar Galactic halo that are known to contain large streams of tidal debris
or other lumpy structure, or that may include significant contamination from
the thick disk, are avoided. The data strongly favor a model that is not
symmetric about the Galaxy's axis of rotation. If included as a free parameter,
the best fit to the center of the spheroid is surprisingly approx 3 kpc from
the Galactic center in the direction of the Sun's motion. The model fits favor
a low value of the density of halo stars at the solar position. The alternative
to a non-axisymmetric stellar distribution is that our fits are contaminated by
previously unidentified lumpy substructure.
