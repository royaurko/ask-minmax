In this paper we compare data to theory. We use a compilation of the most
recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements to constrain Hubble's
constant h, the baryon fraction Omega_b, and the cosmological constant lambda.
We fit h-, Omega_b- and lambda-dependent power spectra to the data. The models
we consider are flat cold dark matter (CDM) dominated universes with flat (n=1)
power spectra, thus the results obtained apply only to these models. CMB
observations can exclude more than half of the h - Omega_b parameter space
explored. The CMB data favor low values of Hubble's constant; h \approx 0.35.
Low values of Omega_b are preferred (Omega_b ~ 0.03) but the chi-squared
minimum is shallow and we obtain Omega_b < 0.28. A model with h \approx 0.40,
Omega_b \approx 0.15 and Omega_CDM \approx 0.85 is permitted by constraints
from the CMB data, BBN, cluster baryon fractions and the shape parameter Gamma
derived from the mass density power spectra of galaxies and clusters. For
flat-lambda models, the CMB data, combined with BBN constraints exclude most of
the h - lambda plane. Models with Omega_o \approx 0.3, lambda \approx 0.7 with
h \approx 0.75 are fully consistent with the CMB data but are excluded by the
strict new q_{o} limits from supernovae (Perlmutter et al. 1996). A combination
of CMB data goodness-of-fit statistics, BBN and supernovae constraints in the
h-lambda plane, limits Hubble's constant to the interval 0.23 < h < 0.72.
