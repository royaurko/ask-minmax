We study the stability of spinless Fermions with power law hopping $H_{ij}
\propto |i - j|^{-\alpha}$. It is shown that at precisely $\alpha_c =2$, the
dispersive inflection point coalesces with the band minimum and the charge
carriers exhibit a transition into negative effective mass regime, $m_\alpha^*
< 0$ characterized by retarded transport in the presence of an electric field.
Moreover, bands with $\alpha < 2$ must be accompanied by counter-carriers with
$m_\alpha^* > 0$, having a positive band curvature, thus stabilizing the system
in order to maintain equilibrium conditions and a proper electrical response.
We further examine the semi-classical transport and response properties,
finding an infrared divergent conductivity for 1/r hopping($\alpha =1$). The
analysis is generalized to regular lattices in dimensions $d$ = 1, 2, and 3.
