It is shown that QCD with vector gluons predicts drastically different
multiplicity distributions compared to the scalar $\lambda\varphi^3$-model (in
6 dimensions). In particular, the QCD predicted minimum of cumulant moments of
the distributions at ranks about $5\div7$ does not reveal itself in the scalar
model. The oscillations at higher ranks survive only. Thus, the experimental
fact of that minimum at ranks about $5\div7$ supports the vector nature of
gluons and singular kernels in QCD and gluodynamics.
