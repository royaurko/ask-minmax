Polar Grassmann codes of orthogonal type have been introduced in I. Cardinali
and L. Giuzzi, \emph{Codes and caps from orthogonal Grassmannians}, {Finite
Fields Appl.} {\bf 24} (2013), 148-169. They are subcodes of the Grassmann code
arising from the projective system defined by the Pl\"ucker embedding of a
polar Grassmannian of orthogonal type. In the present paper we fully determine
the minimum distance of line polar Grassmann Codes of orthogonal type for $q$
odd.
