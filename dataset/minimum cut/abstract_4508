The liquid-liquid phase separation of a binary solvent can be arrested by
colloidal particles trapped at the interface [K. Stratford et al., Science 309,
5744 (2005)]. We show experimentally that the colloidal network so formed can
remain stable after fully remixing the liquids, creating a new type of gel in
which colloids in a single-phase solvent have locally planar coordination. We
argue that this structure is likely maintained by primary-minimum DLVO bonding
of our charged colloids, created under strong compression by capillary forces.
We present simulation evidence that the combination of a short-ranged
attraction with a repulsive barrier can strongly stabilize such locally planar
gels.
