We report a memory resistance (memristor) behavior with nonlinear
current-voltage characteristics and bipolar hysteretic resistance switching in
the nanocolumnar manganite (LSMO) films. The switching from a high (HRS) to a
low (LRS) resistance occurs at a bias field ~1 MV/cm. Applied electric field
drops mostly at the insulating interfacial LSMO layer and couples to correlated
polarons at the LSMO(111)/LSMO(111) vertical interfaces. The observed
memristance behaviour has an electronic (polaronic) origin and is caused by an
electric-field-controlled Jahn-Teller (JT) effect, followed by the orbital
reconstruction and formation of a metastable orbitally disordered interfacial
phase (LRS). Compared to the earlier reported ionic memristor in Ti-O films, an
electronic (polaronic) nano-sized LSMO memristor shows an additional
(re-entrant) LRS-HRS switching at higher fields because of the second minimum
in the elastic energy of a JT system.
