A set $D \subseteq V(G)$ is a \emph{dominating set} of a graph $G$ if every
vertex of $G$ not in $D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. A
\emph{minimum dominating set} of $G$, also called a $\gamma(G)$-set, is a
dominating set of $G$ of minimum cardinality. For each vertex $v \in V(G)$, we
define the \emph{domination value} of $v$ to be the number of $\gamma(G)$-sets
to which $v$ belongs. In this paper, we find the total number of minimum
dominating sets and characterize the domination values for $P_2 \square P_n$
and $P_2 \square C_n$.
