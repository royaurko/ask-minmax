The vacuum effective potential of three-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge
theory in an applied color-magnetic field is computed over a wide range of
field strengths. The background field is induced by an external current, as in
continuum field theory. Scaling and finite volume effects are analyzed
systematically. The first evidence from lattice simulations is obtained of the
existence of a nontrivial minimum in the effective potential. This supports a
``ferromagnetic'' picture of gluon condensation, proposed by Savvidy on the
basis of a one-loop calculation in (3+1)-dimensional QCD.
