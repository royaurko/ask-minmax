We present a formula that relates the variations of the area of extreme
throat initial data with the variation of an appropriate defined mass
functional. From this expression we deduce that the first variation, with fixed
angular momentum, of the area is zero and the second variation is positive
definite evaluated at the extreme Kerr throat initial data. This indicates that
the area of the extreme Kerr throat initial data is a minimum among this class
of data. And hence the area of generic throat initial data is bounded from
below by the angular momentum. Also, this result strongly suggests that the
inequality between area and angular momentum holds for generic asymptotically
flat axially symmetric black holes. As an application, we prove this inequality
in the non trivial family of spinning Bowen-York initial data.
