In this work we investigate the entropic information-measure in the context
of braneworlds with non-constant curvature. The braneworld entropic information
is studied for gravity modified by the squared of the Ricci scalar, besides the
usual Einstein-Hilbert term. We showed that the minimum value of the brane
configurational entropy provides a stricter bound on the parameter that is
responsible for the $F(R)$ model to differ from the Einstein-Hilbert standard
one. Our results are moreover consistent to a negative bulk cosmological
constant.
