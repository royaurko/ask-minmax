In this work we study an SO(10) GUT model with minimum Higgs representations
belonging only to the 210 and 16 dimensional representations of SO(10). We add
a singlet fermion S in addition to the usual 16 dimensional representation
containing quarks and leptons. There are no Higgs bi-doublets and so charged
fermion masses come from one-loop corrections. Consequently all the fermion
masses, Dirac and Majorana, are of the see-saw type. We minimize the Higgs
potential and show how the left-right symmetry is broken in our model where it
is assumed that a D-parity odd Higgs field gets a vacuum expectation value at
the grand unification scale. From the renormalization group equations we infer
that in our model unification happens at 10^{15} GeV and left-right symmetry
can be extended up to some values just above 10^{11} GeV. The Yukawa sector of
our model is completely different from most of the standard grand unified
theories and we explicitly show how the Yukawa sector will look like in the
different phases and briefly comment on the running of the top quark mass. We
end with a brief analysis of lepton number asymmetry generated from the
interactions in our model.
