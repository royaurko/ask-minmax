It is well-known that asymptotic stability (AS) of homogeneous polynomial
vector fields of degree one (i.e., linear systems) can be decided in polynomial
time e.g. by searching for a quadratic Lyapunov function. Since homogeneous
vector fields of even degree can never be AS, the next interesting degree to
consider is equal to three. In this paper, we prove that deciding AS of
homogeneous cubic vector fields is strongly NP-hard and pose the question of
determining whether it is even decidable. As a byproduct of the reduction that
establishes our NP-hardness result, we obtain a Lyapunov-inspired technique for
proving positivity of forms. We also show that for asymptotically stable
homogeneous cubic vector fields in as few as two variables, the minimum degree
of a polynomial Lyapunov function can be arbitrarily large. Finally, we show
that there is no monotonicity in the degree of polynomial Lyapunov functions
that prove AS; i.e., a homogeneous cubic vector field with no homogeneous
polynomial Lyapunov function of some degree $d$ can very well have a
homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov function of degree less than $d$.
