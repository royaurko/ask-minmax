This article is concerned with Gaussian process quadratures, which are
numerical integration methods based on Gaussian process regression methods, and
sigma-point methods, which are used in advanced non-linear Kalman filtering and
smoothing algorithms. We show that many sigma-point methods can be interpreted
as Gaussian quadrature based methods with suitably selected covariance
functions. We show that this interpretation also extends to more general
multivariate Gauss--Hermite integration methods and related spherical cubature
rules. Additionally, we discuss different criteria for selecting the
sigma-point locations: exactness for multivariate polynomials up to a given
order, minimum average error, and quasi-random point sets. The performance of
the different methods is tested in numerical experiments.
