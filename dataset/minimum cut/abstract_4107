A large area Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) with a total active surface of
160x10 cm2 was built and tested. The surface was segmented in two 5 cm wide
strips readout on both ends with custom, very high frequency, front end
electronics.
  A timing resolution between 50 and 75 ps sigma with an efficiency for Minimum
Ionizing Particles (MIPs) larger than 95% was attained over the whole active
area, in addition with a position resolution along the strips of 1.2 cm.
  Despite the large active area per electronic channel, the observed timing
resolution is remarkably close to the one previously obtained (50 ps sigma)
with much smaller chambers of about 10 cm2 area. These results open
perspectives of extending the application of timing RPCs to large area arrays
exposed to moderate particle multiplicities, where the low cost, good time
resolution, insensitivity to the magnetic field and compact mechanics may be
attractive when compared with the standard scintillator-based Time-of-Flight
(TOF) technology.
