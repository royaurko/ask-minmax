LHC searches for the standard model Higgs Boson in di-photon or di-tau decay
modes place strong constraints on the light top-pion state predicted in
technicolor models that include colored technifermions. Compared with the
standard Higgs Boson, the top-pions have an enhanced production rate (largely
because the technipion decay constant is smaller than the weak scale) and also
enhanced branching ratios into di-photon and di-tau final states (largely due
to the suppression of WW decays of the technipions). These factors combine to
make the technipions more visible in both channels than a standard model Higgs
would be. Hence, the recent ATLAS and CMS searches for Higgs bosons exclude the
presence of technipions with masses from 110 GeV to nearly twice the top-quark
mass in technicolor models that (a) include colored technifermions (b) feature
topcolor dynamics and (c) have technicolor groups with three or more
technicolors. For certain models, the limits also apply out to higher
technipion masses or down to the minimum number of technicolors. The limits may
be softened somewhat in models where extended technicolor plays a signi?cant
role in producing the top quark's mass. Additional LHC data on di-tau and
di-photon final states will be extremely valuable in further exploring
technicolor parameter space.
