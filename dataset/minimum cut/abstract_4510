A time series of the Martian south ice polar cap mean diameter for the period
July-December 1924 is investigated. The data are based on the high quality
pictures, which are obtained by visual observations of 60 cm telescope in
Hamburg Observatory during the great opposition of Mars in AD 1924. After
removing of the seasonal trend (caused by the springtime regression of the cap)
quasi 36 and 80-82 days cycles in residuals has been obtained. The sunspot
activity spectra for the corresponding period is almost the same one. The local
maximums of polar cap area residuals has been occured of about 10 days after
the corresponding minimums of sunspot activity. The so obtained results are
briefly discussed.
