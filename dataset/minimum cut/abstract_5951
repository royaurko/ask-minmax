From pulsar scintillations we infer the presence of sheet-like structures in
the ISM; it has been suggested that these are current sheets. Current sheets
probably play an important role in heating the solar corona, and there is
evidence for their presence in the solar wind. Such magnetic discontinuities
have been found in numerical simulations with particular boundary conditions,
as well as in simulations using an incompressible equation of state. Here, I
investigate their formation under more general circumstances by means of
topological considerations as well as numerical simulations of the relaxation
of an arbitrary smoothly-varying magnetic field. The simulations are performed
with a variety of parameters and boundary conditions: in low, high and
of-order-unity plasma-$\beta$ regimes, with periodic and fixed boundaries, with
and without a friction force, at various resolutions and with various
diffusivities. Current sheets form, over a dynamical timescale, under {\it all}
conditions explored. At higher resolution they are thinner, and there is a
greater number of weaker current sheets. The magnetic field eventually relaxes
into a smooth minimum energy state, the energy of which depends on the magnetic
helicity, as well as on the nature of the boundaries.
