Protein amyloid fibrils are a form of linear protein aggregates that are
implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we study the dynamics of
amyloid fibril elongation by performing Langevin dynamic simulations on a
coarse-grained model of peptides. Our simulation results suggest that the
elongation process is dominated by a series of local minimum due to frustration
in monomer-fibril interactions. This rugged energy landscape picture indicates
that the amount of recycling of monomers at the fibrils' ends before being
fibrilized is substantially reduced in comparison to the conventional two-step
elongation model. This picture, along with other predictions discussed, can be
tested with current experimental techniques.
