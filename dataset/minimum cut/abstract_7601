This paper addresses the problem of exploiting interference among
simultaneous multiuser transmissions in the downlink of multiple-antenna
systems. Using symbol-level precoding, a new approach towards addressing the
multiuser interference is discussed through jointly utilizing the channel state
information (CSI) and data information (DI). The interference among the data
streams is transformed under certain conditions to a useful signal that can
improve the signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) of the downlink
transmissions and as a result the system's energy efficiency. In this context,
new constructive interference precoding techniques that tackle the transmit
power minimization (min power) with individual SINR constraints at each user's
receiver have been proposed. In this paper, we generalize the CI precoding
design under the assumption that the received MPSK symbol can reside in a
relaxed region in order to be correctly detected. Moreover, a weighted
maximization of the minimum SNR among all users is studied taking into account
the relaxed detection region. Symbol error rate analysis (SER) for the proposed
precoding is discussed to characterize the tradeoff between transmit power
reduction and SER increase due to the relaxation. Based on this tradeoff, the
energy efficiency performance of the proposed technique is analyzed. Finally,
extensive numerical results show that the proposed schemes outperform other
state-of-the-art techniques.
