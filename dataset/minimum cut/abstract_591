We investigate the time-asymptotic properties of solutions of the
differential equation x''(t) + a(t)x'(t) + g(x(t)) = 0 in a Hilbert space,
where a(.) is non-increasing and g is the gradient of a potential G. If the
coefficient a(.) is constant and positive, we recover the so-called ``Heavy
Ball with Friction'' system. On the other hand, when a(t)=1/(t+1) we obtain the
trajectories associated to some averaged gradient system.
  Our analysis is mainly based on the existence of some suitable energy
function. When the potential G is convex and the coeffient a is non-integrable
at infinity, the energy function converges to its minimum. A more stringent
condition is required to obtain the convergence of the trajectories of toward
some minimum point of the potential. In the one-dimensional setting, a precise
description of the convergence of solutions is given for a general coercive
non-convex potentials with many local minima and maxima. We show that in this
case the set of initial conditions for which solutions converge to a local
minimum is open and dense.
