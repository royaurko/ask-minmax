We provide an explicit calculation of the evolution of the cosmic
entanglement entropy in the early universe before the matter dominant era. This
is made possible by invoking the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model, which
has the advantage of preserving unitarity and providing a smooth transition
between the inflation epoch and the radiation dominant era. The dynamics of the
universe is described by the quantization in the minisuperspace of the GCG
model, following the prescription proposed by Wheeler and DeWitt. Two sources
of contribution to the cosmic entanglement entropy are considered: one from the
homogeneous background where the observable and the unobservable regions of the
universe are entangled and the other from the inhomogeneous cosmological
perturbations where different modes are entangled. We find that the homogeneous
contribution grows exponentially at the very beginning of the inflation, but
decreases during the radiation dominant era. Conversely, that from the
cosmological perturbation is found to decrease at first and then increase after
reaching a minimum value. The net result is that the total entanglement entropy
reaches a minimum at an early stage of the inflation and then increases
throughout most of the inflation and the entire radiation dominant era.
