Modelling multiple partonic interactions in hadronic events is vital for
understanding minimum-bias physics, as well as the underlying event of hard
processes. A brief overview of the current Pythia 8 multiple interactions (MI)
model is given, before looking at two additional effects which can be included
in the MI framework. With rescattering, a previously scattered parton is
allowed to take part in another subsequent scattering, while with enhanced
screening, the effects of varying initial-state fluctuations are modelled.
