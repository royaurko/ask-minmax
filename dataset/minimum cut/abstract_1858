Vacuum structure and global cosmic strings are analyzed in the effective
theory of self-interacting O(2) scalar fields on (3+1)-manifolds with conical
singularities. In the context of one-loop effective action computed by
heat-kernel methods with $\zeta$-function regularization, we find an
inhomogeneous vacuum of minimum energy and suggest some reason why low-energy
global strings are likely to be generated at the conical singularities.
