By using the spin torque model in ferromagnets, we compare the response of
vortex and transverse walls to the electrical current. For a defect-free sample
and a small applied current, the steady state wall mobility is independent of
the wall structure. In the presence of defects, the minimum current required to
overcome the wall pinning potential is much smaller for the vortex wall than
for the transverse wall. During the wall motion, the vortex wall tends to
transform to the transverse wall. We construct a phase diagram for the wall
mobility and the wall transformation driven by the current.
