The rock mechanical design of gas storage cavern in salt requires the
analysis of the stability and the usability of the cavern over the planned
operating time period. The design includes the build up of a rock mass model
and a numerical model taking into account the geological situation, load
condition, geometrical condition, and material parameters. In this paper
multiple caverns in salt formation with geological and geomechanical situation
in Qom (central part of Iran) was investigated a using creep model. Minimum
safe center to center distances (CTCD) of multiple horizontal caverns also were
studied. CTCD of caverns interact at less than two times of cavern diameter.
With increasing the CTCD to 2.5 times cavern diameters, diminish most
interaction.
