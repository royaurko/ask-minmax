We examine dynamical mass generation in QCD with large current mass quarks. A
renormalization group analysis is performed to separate fermion self-mass into
a dynamical and a kinematical part. It is shown that the energy scale og the
Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation and the effective gauge coupling are fixed by the
current mass. The dynamical self-mass satisfies a homogeneous SD equation which
has a trivial solution when the current mass exceeds a critical value. We
therefore suggest that the quark condensate, as the function of the current
mass, observes a local minimum around 2.7\Lambda_(QCD).
