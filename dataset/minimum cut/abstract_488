Water supercooling has received considerable research attention. The
parameters influencing supercooling include the initial temperature of the
water and the temperature of the chilling medium. In this study, we
investigated an additional parameter, the type of chilling medium. We
correlated the occurrence of supercooling with the minimum temperature anywhere
in the water. If the minimum temperature is higher, ice nucleation is unlikely
and supercooling will take place. Besides distilled water, we also investigated
supercooling of water found in nature, and found that impurities in such water
do not facilitate ice nucleation.
