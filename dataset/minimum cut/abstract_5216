We study the (3+1) dimensional p-wave holographic superconductors with Weyl
corrections both numerically and analytically. We describe numerically the
behavior of critical temperature $T_{c}$ with respect to charge density $\rho$
in a limited range of Weyl coupling parameter $\gamma$ and we find in general
the condensation becomes harder with the increase of parameter $\gamma$. In
strong coupling limit of Yang-Mills theory, we show that the minimum value of
$T_{c}$ obtained from analytical approach is in good agreement with the
numerical results, and finally show how we got remarkably a similar result in
the critical exponent 1/2 of the chemical potential $\mu$ and the order
parameter$<J^1_x>$ with the numerical curves of superconductors.
