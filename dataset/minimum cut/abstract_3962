We consider D7 brane probes embedded in deformed AdS5 x S5 supergravity
backgrounds which are non-supersymmetric in the interior. In the context of the
generalised AdS/CFT correspondence, these setups are dual to QCD-like theories
with fundamental matter which display chiral symmetry breaking by a quark
condensate. Evaluating the D7 action for a surface instanton configuration
gives rise to an effective potential for the scalar Higgs vev in the dual field
theory. We calculate this potential for two specific supergravity backgrounds.
For a metric due to Constable and Myers, we find that the potential is
asymptotically bounded by a 1/Q^4 behaviour and has a minimum at zero vev. For
the Yang-Mills* background we find that the Higgs potential scales
quadratically with the Higgs vev. This corresponds to a canonical mass term and
the embedding is again stable.
