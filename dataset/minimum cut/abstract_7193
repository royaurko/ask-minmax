We review integrated dynamical approaches to describe heavy ion reaction as a
whole at ultrarelativistic energies. Since final observables result from all
the history of the reaction, it is important to describe all the stages of the
reaction to obtain the properties of the quark gluon plasma from experimental
data. As an example of these approaches, we develop an integrated dynamical
model, which is composed of a fully (3+1) dimensional ideal hydrodynamic model
with the state-of-the-art equation of state based on lattice QCD, and
subsequent hadronic cascade in the late stage. Initial conditions are obtained
employing Monte Carlo versions of the Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi model (MC-KLN) or
the Glauber model (MC-Glauber). Using this integrated model, we first simulate
relativistic heavy ion collisions at the RHIC and LHC energies starting from
conventional smooth initial conditions. We next utilise each Monte Carlo
samples of initial conditions on an event-by-event basis and perform
event-by-event dynamical simulations to accumulate a large number of minimum
bias events. A special attention is paid to performing the flow analysis as in
experiments toward consistent comparison of theoretical results with
experimental data.
