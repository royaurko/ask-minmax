We investigate the alignment-dependent high-order harmonic spectrum generated
from nonadiabatically aligned molecules around the first half rotational
revival. It is found that the evolution of the molecular alignment is encoded
in the structural minima. To reveal the relation between the molecular
alignment and the structural minimum in the high-order harmonic spectrum, we
perform an analysis based on the two-center interference model. Our analysis
shows that the structural minimum position depends linearly on the inverse of
the alignment parameter $<\cos^2\theta>$. This linear relation indicates the
possibility of probing the rotational wave-packet dynamics by measuring the
spectral minima.
