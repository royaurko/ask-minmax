The su(2)-algebraic many-fermion model is formulated so as to be able to get
the unified understanding of the structures of three simple models: the
single-level pairing, the isoscalar proton-neutron pairing and the two-level
Lipkin model. Basic idea is to introduce an auxiliary su(2)-algebra, any
generator of which commutes with any generator of the starting su(2)-algebra.
With the aid of this algebra, the minimum weight states are completely
determined in a simple forms. Further, concerning the two algebras, boson
realization is presented. Through this formulation, the behavior of the total
fermion in the Lipkin model is notably different of those in the other two
models. As supplementary problem, the boson-fermion realization and the Lipkin
model in the isovector pairing model are investigated.
