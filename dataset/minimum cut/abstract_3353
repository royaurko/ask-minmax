The parameter-free model of diffusion in the atmospheres of HgMn stars
(Michaud 1986; Michaud et al 1979) predicts that helium should sink below the
He II ionization zone in order that diffusion of other elements may take place,
and that all HgMn stars should have deficits of helium in their photospheres,
with a minimum deficit of 0.3 dex. In this study, the Smith & Dworetsky (1993)
sample of HgMn stars and normal comparison stars is examined, and the helium
abundances determined by spectrum synthesis using echelle spectra taken at Lick
Observatory and the AAT. The prediction is confirmed; all HgMn stars are
deficient in He by as much as 1.5 dex. Also, two HgMn stars, HR7361 and HR7664,
show clear evidence of helium stratification.
