Tensor and scalar unparticle couplings to matter have been shown to enhance
gravitational interactions and provide corrections to the Schwarzschild metric
and associated black hole structure. We derive an exact solution to the
Einstein equations for vector unparticles, and conclusively demonstrate that
these induce Riessner-Nordstr\"om (RN)-like solutions where the role of the
"charge" is defined by a composite of unparticle phase space parameters. These
black holes admit double-horizon structure, although unlike the RN metric these
solutions have a minimum inner horizon value. In the extremal limit, the
Hawking temperature is shown to vanish. As with the scalar/tensor case, the
(outer) horizon is shown via entropy considerations to behave like a fractal
surface of spectral dimension $d_H = 2\du$.
