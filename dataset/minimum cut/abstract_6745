We present photometry of the first reported superoutburst of the dwarf nova
VSX J074727.6+065050 during 2008 January and February. At its brightest the
star reached magnitude 11.4 and this was followed by a slow decline at 0.09
mag/d for 19 days, corresponding to the plateau phase. There was then a rapid
decline at 1.66 mag/d to a temporary minimum at magnitude 16.6 where it stayed
for 2 to 3 days after which there were six remarkable echo outbursts before the
star gradually faded back towards quiescence at ~magnitude 19.5. The overall
outburst amplitude was at least 8 magnitudes and it lasted more than 80 days.
During the plateau phase we observed common superhumps with Psh = 0.06070(6) d,
but the period increased to Psh = 0.06151(5) d coinciding with the end of the
plateau phase and the onset of the rapid decline. This corresponds to a
continuous period change with P^dot = +4.4(9) x 10-5. During the echo outbursts
there was a superhump regime with Psh = 0.06088(49) d. Evidence is presented
which is consistent with the star being a member of the WZ Sge family of dwarf
novae.
