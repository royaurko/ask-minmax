We show that the position and width of the plasmon resonance in Silver are
correctly predicted by ab--initio calculations including self--energy effects
within the GW approximation. Unlike in simple metals and semiconductors,
quasiparticle corrections play a key role and are essential to obtain Electron
Energy Loss in quantitative agreement with the experimental data. The sharp
reflectance minimum at 3.92 eV, that cannot be reproduced within DFT--LDA, is
also well described within GW.The present results solve two unsettled drawbacks
of linear response calculations for Silver.
