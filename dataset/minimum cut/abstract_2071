For electron-phonon Hamiltonians with the couplings linear in the phonon
operators we construct a class of unitary transformations that separate the
normal modes into two groups. The modes in the first group interact with the
electronic degrees of freedom directly. The modes in the second group interact
directly only with the modes in the first group but not with the electronic
system. We show that for the $n$-level electronic system the minimum number of
modes in the first group is $n_s=(n^2+n-2)/2$. The separation of the normal
modes into two groups allows one to develop new approximation schemes. We apply
one of such schemes to study exitonic relaxation in a model semiconducting
molecular heterojuction.
