We present the first study of the energy dependence of $p_t$ angular
correlations inferred from event-wise mean transverse momentum $<p_{t} >$
fluctuations in heavy ion collisions. We compare our large-acceptance
measurements at CM energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 19.6, 62.4, 130 and 200 GeV to
SPS measurements at 12.3 and 17.3 GeV. $p_t$ angular correlation structure
suggests that the principal source of $p_t$ correlations and fluctuations is
minijets (minimum-bias parton fragments). We observe a dramatic increase in
correlations and fluctuations from SPS to RHIC energies, increasing linearly
with $\ln \sqrt{s_{NN}}$ from the onset of observable jet-related $<p_{t}>$
fluctuations near 10 GeV.
