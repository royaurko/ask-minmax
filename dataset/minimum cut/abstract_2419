We investigate properties and describe examples of tilt-stable objects on a
smooth complex projective threefold. We give a structure theorem on slope
semistable sheaves of vanishing discriminant, and describe certain Chern
classes for which every slope semistable sheaf yields a Bridgeland semistable
object of maximal phase. Then, we study tilt stability as the polarisation
$\omega$ gets large, and give sufficient conditions for tilt-stability of
sheaves of the following two forms: 1) twists of ideal sheaves or 2)
torsion-free sheaves whose first Chern class is twice a minimum possible value.
