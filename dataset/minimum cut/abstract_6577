We present high cadence, high precision multi-band photometry of the young,
M1Ve, debris disk star, AU Microscopii. The data were obtained in three
continuum filters spanning a wavelength range from 4500\AA to 6600\AA, plus
H$\alpha$, over 28 nights in 2005. The lightcurves show intrinsic stellar
variability due to starspots with an amplitude in the blue band of 0.051
magnitudes and a period of 4.847 days. In addition, three large flares were
detected in the data which all occur near the minimum brightness of the star.
We remove the intrinsic stellar variability and combine the lightcurves of all
the filters in order to search for transits by possible planetary companions
orbiting in the plane of the nearly edge-on debris disk. The combined final
lightcurve has a sampling of 0.35 minutes and a standard deviation of 6.8
millimags (mmag). We performed Monte Carlo simulations by adding fake transits
to the observed lightcurve and find with 95% significance that there are no
Jupiter mass planets orbiting in the plane of the debris disk on circular
orbits with periods, P $\le 5$ days. In addition, there are no young
Neptune-like planets (with radii 2.5$\times$ smaller than the young Jupiter) on
circular orbits with periods, P $\le 3$ days.
