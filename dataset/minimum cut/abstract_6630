This paper defines a new invariant of virtual knots and links that we call
the extended bracket polynomial, and denote by <<K>> for a virtual knot or link
K. This invariant is a state summation over bracket states of the oriented
diagram for K. Each state is reduced to a virtual 4-regular graph in the plane
and the polynomial takes values in the module generated by these reduced graphs
over the ring Q[A,A^{-1}]. The paper is relatively self-contained, with
background information about virtual knots and long virtual knots. We give
numerous examples applying the extended bracket, including a new proof of the
non-triviality of the Kishino diagram and the flat Kishino diagram and
non-classicality of single crossing virtualizations. The paper has a section on
the estimation of virtual crossing number using the extended bracket state sum.
Examples are given of virtual knots with arbitrary minimal embedding genus and
arbitrarily high positive difference between the virtual crossing number and
the minimal embedding genus. A simplification of <<K>> is introduced and
denoted by A[K]. This simplified extended bracket, the arrow polynomial, is a
polynomial in an infinite set of variables. It is quite strong (detecting the
flat Kishino diagram for example) and easily computable. The paper contains a
description of a computer algorithm for A[K] and uses the arrow polynomial, in
conjunction with the extended bracket polynomial to determine the minimum genus
surfaces on which some virtual knots can be represented.
