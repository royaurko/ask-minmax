We solve Einstein equations coupled to a complex scalar field with infinitely
large self-interaction, degenerate fermions, and a negative cosmological
constant in $(2+1)$ dimensions. Exact solutions for static boson-fermion stars
are found when circular symmetry is assumed. We find that the minimum binding
energy of boson-fermion star takes a negative value if the value of the
cosmological constant is sufficiently small.
