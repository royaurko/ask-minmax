The stability of strange quark matter is studied within the Nambu
Jona-Lasinio model with three different parameter sets. The model Lagrangian
contains 4-fermion (with and without vector interaction) and 6-fermion terms;
the minimum energy per baryon number as a function of the strangeness fraction
of the system is compared to the masses of hyperons having the same strangeness
fraction, and coherently calculated in the same version of the model, and for
the same parameter set. The results show that in none of the different
parameter sets strangelets are stable, and in some cases a minimum in the
energy per baryon does not even exist.
