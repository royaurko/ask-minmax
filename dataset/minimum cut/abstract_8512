NASA's Kepler Mission has revealed two transiting planets orbiting Kepler-68.
Follow-up Doppler measurements have established the mass of the innermost
planet and revealed a third jovian-mass planet orbiting beyond the two
transiting planets. Kepler-68b, in a 5.4 day orbit has mass 8.3 +/- 2.3 Earth,
radius 2.31 +/- 0.07 Earth radii, and a density of 3.32 +/- 0.92 (cgs), giving
Kepler-68b a density intermediate between that of the ice giants and Earth.
Kepler-68c is Earth-sized with a radius of 0.953 Earth and transits on a 9.6
day orbit; validation of Kepler-68c posed unique challenges. Kepler-68d has an
orbital period of 580 +/- 15 days and minimum mass of Msin(i) = 0.947 Jupiter.
Power spectra of the Kepler photometry at 1-minute cadence exhibit a rich and
strong set of asteroseismic pulsation modes enabling detailed analysis of the
stellar interior. Spectroscopy of the star coupled with asteroseismic modeling
of the multiple pulsation modes yield precise measurements of stellar
properties, notably Teff = 5793 +/- 74 K, M = 1.079 +/- 0.051 Msun, R = 1.243
+/- 0.019 Rsun, and density 0.7903 +/- 0.0054 (cgs), all measured with
fractional uncertainties of only a few percent. Models of Kepler-68b suggest it
is likely composed of rock and water, or has a H and He envelope to yield its
density of about 3 (cgs).
