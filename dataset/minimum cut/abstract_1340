A Glasma flux-tube model has been proposed to explain strong elongation on
pseudorapidity $\eta$ of the same-side 2D peak in minimum-bias angular
correlations from $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV \auau collisions. The same-side
peak or "soft ridge" is said to arise from coupling of flux tubes to radial
flow. Gluons radiated transversely from flux tubes are boosted by radial flow
to form a narrow structure or ridge on azimuth. In this study we test the
conjecture by comparing predictions for particle production, spectra and
correlations from the Glasma model and conventional fragmentation processes
with measurements. We conclude that the Glasma model is contradicted by
measured hadron yields, spectra and correlations, whereas a two-component model
of hadron production, including minimum-bias parton fragmentation, provides a
quantitative description of most data, although $\eta$ elongation remains
unexplained.
