We investigate the ground states of a Bose-Einstein condensate of indirect
excitons coupled to an electron gas. We show that in a properly designed
system, the crossing of a roton minimum into the negative energy domain can
result in the appearance of the supersolid phase, characterized by periodicity
in both real and reciprocal space. Accounting for the spin-dependent exchange
interaction of excitons we obtain ferromagnetic supersolid domains. The Fourier
spectra of excitations of weakly perturbed supersolids show pronounced
diffraction maxima which may be detected experimentally.
