We consider a ring of strongly interacting electrons connected to two
external leads by tunnel junctions. By studying the positions of conductance
resonances as a function of gate voltage and magnetic flux the interaction
parameter $g$ can be determined experimentally. For a finite ring the minimum
conductance is strongly influenced by device geometry and electron-electron
interactions. In particular, if the tunnel junctions are close to one another
the interaction-related orthogonality catastrophe is suppressed and the valley
current is unexpectedly large.
