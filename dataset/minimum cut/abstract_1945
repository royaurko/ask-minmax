In this paper we study the process of fragmentation of highly excited
Lennard-Jones drops by introducing the concept of emitted fragments (clusters
recognizable in configuration space which live more than a minimum lifetime).
We focus on the dynamics and thermodynamics of the emitted sources, and show,
among other things, that this kind of process can not be cast into a sequential
or simultaneous one, and how a local equilibrium scenario comes up, allowing us
to define and explore a local temperature, which turns out to be a strongly
time-dependent quantity.
