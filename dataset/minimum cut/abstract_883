New measurements are presented from proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7
TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Minimum bias distributions are
measured in distinct phase-space regions and compared with Monte Carlo model
predictions. Activity in the underlying event is measured with respect to the
track with the highest tranverse momentum in the event. Angular correlations
between charged particles are studied to provide model-sensitive measurements.
