We present new spatially resolved 1.3 mm imaging with CARMA of the GV Tau
system. GV Tau is a Class I binary protostar system in the Taurus Molecular
Cloud, the components of which are separated by 1.2". Each protostar is
surrounded by a protoplanetary disk, and the pair may be surrounded by a
circumbinary envelope. We analyze the data using detailed radiative transfer
modeling of the system. We create synthetic protostar model spectra, images,
and visibilities and compare them with CARMA 1.3 mm visibilities, an HST
near-infrared scattered light image, and broadband SEDs from the literature to
study the disk masses and geometries of the GV Tau disks. We show that the
protoplanetary disks around GV Tau fall near the lower end of estimates of the
Minimum Mass Solar Nebula, and may have just enough mass to form giant planets.
When added to the sample of Class I protostars from \citet{Eisner2012} we
confirm that Class I protostars are on average more massive than their Class II
counterparts. This suggests that substantial dust grain processing occurs
between the Class I and Class II stages, and may help to explain why the Class
II protostars do not appear to have, on average, enough mass in their disks to
form giant planets.
