The temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients of interstitial helium atom
in $\alpha$-Ti are predicted using the transition state theory. The microscopic
parameters in the pre-factor and activation energy of the impurity diffusion
coefficients are obtained from first-principles total energy and phonon
calculations including the full coupling between the vibrational modes of the
diffusing atom and the host lattice. The climbing image nudged elastic band
(CINEB) method is used to search for the minimum energy pathways and associated
saddle point structures. It is demonstrated that the diffusion coefficients
within the \emph{xy} plane ($D_{xy}$) is always higher than that along the
\emph{z} axis ($D_{z}$), showing remarkable anisotropy. Also, it is found that
the formation of helium dimer centered at the octahedral site reduces the total
energy and confines the diffusion of helium atoms.
