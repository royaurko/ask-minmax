Meteorological parameters, such as temperature, rainfall, pressure etc.,
exhibit selfsimilar space-time fractal fluctuations generic to dynamical
systems in nature such as fluid flows, spread of forest fires, earthquakes,
etc. The power spectra of fractal fluctuations display inverse power-law form
signifying long-range correlations. The contributor has developed a general systems
theory which predicts universal inverse power-law form incorporating the golden
mean for the fractal fluctuations of all size scales, i.e., small, large and
extreme values. The model predicted distribution is in close agreement with
observed fractal fluctuations in the historic month-wise temperature (maximum
and minimum) and rainfall in the UK region. The present study suggests that
fractal fluctuations result from the superimposition of an eddy continuum
fluctuations. The observed extreme values result from superimposition of maxima
(or minima) of dominant eddies (waves) in the eddy continuum.
