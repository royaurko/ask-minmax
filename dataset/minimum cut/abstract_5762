We study the luminous mass as a function of the dynamical mass inside the
effective radius (r_e) of early-type galaxies (ETGs) to search for differences
between these masses. We assume Newtonian dynamics and that any difference
between these masses is due to the presence of dark matter. We use several
samples of ETGs -ranging from 19 000 to 98 000 objects- from the ninth data
release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We perform Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations of galaxy samples and compare them with real samples. The main
results are: i) MC simulations show that the distribution of the dynamical vs.
luminous mass depends on the mass range where the ETGs are distributed
(geometric effect). This dependence is caused by selection effects and
intrinsic properties of the ETGs. ii) The amount of dark matter inside r_e is
approximately 7% +- 22%. iii) This amount of dark matter is lower than the
minimum estimate (10%) found in the literature and four times lower than the
average (30%) of literature estimates. However, if we consider the associated
error, our estimate is of the order of the literature average.
