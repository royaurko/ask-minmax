Both bright and dark traveling, locked, intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) have
been generated with a spatially uniform driver at a frequency in the acoustic
spectrum of a nonlinear micromechanical cantilever array. Complementary
numerical simulations show that a minimum density of modes, hence array size,
is required for the formation of such locked smoothly running excitations.
Additional simulations on a small 1-D antiferromagnetic spin system are used to
illustrate that such uniformly driven running ILMs should be a generic feature
of a nanoscale atomic lattice.
