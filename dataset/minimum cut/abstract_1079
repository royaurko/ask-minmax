An axis-parallel b-dimensional box is a Cartesian product $R_1 \times R_2
\times ... \times R_b$ where each $R_i$ (for $1 \leq i \leq b$) is a closed
interval of the form $[a_i,b_i]$ on the real line. The boxicity of any graph
$G$, box(G) is the minimum positive integer b such that G can be represented as
the intersection graph of axis parallel b-dimensional boxes. A b-dimensional
cube is a Cartesian product $R_1 \times R_2\times ... \times R_b$, where each
$R_i$ (for $1 \leq i \leq b$) is a closed interval of the form [$a_i$,$a_i$+1]
on the real line. When the boxes are restricted to be axis-parallel cubes in
b-dimension, the minimum dimension b required to represent the graph is called
the cubicity of the graph (denoted by cub(G)). In this paper we prove that
$cub(G)\leq \lceil \log n \rceil \boxi(G)$} where n is the number of vertices
in the graph. This upper bound is tight.
