We present time-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of the dwarf nova SBSS
1108+574, obtained during the 2012 outburst. Its quiescent spectrum is
unusually rich in helium, showing broad, double-peaked emission lines from the
accretion disc. We measure a line flux ratio HeI 5875/Halpha = 0.81 +/- 0.04, a
much higher ratio than typically observed in cataclysmic variables (CVs). The
outburst spectrum shows hydrogen and helium in absorption, with weak emission
of Halpha and HeI 6678, as well as strong HeII emission.
  From our photometry, we find the superhump period to be 56.34 +/- 0.18
minutes, in agreement with the previously published result. The spectroscopic
period, derived from the radial velocities of the emission lines, is found to
be 55.3 +/- 0.8 minutes, consistent with a previously identified photometric
orbital period, and significantly below the normal CV period minimum. This
indicates that the donor in SBSS 1108+574 is highly evolved. The superhump
excess derived from our photometry implies a mass ratio of q = 0.086 +/- 0.014.
Our spectroscopy reveals a grazing eclipse of the large outbursting disc. As
the disc is significantly larger during outburst, it is unlikely that an
eclipse will be detectable in quiescence. The relatively high accretion rate
implied by the detection of outbursts, together with the large mass ratio,
suggests that SBSS 1108+574 is still evolving towards its period minimum.
