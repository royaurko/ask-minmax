The purpose of this article is to improve existing lower bounds on the
chromatic number chi. Let mu_1,...,mu_n be the eigenvalues of the adjacency
matrix sorted in non-increasing order.
  First, we prove the lower bound chi >= 1 + max_m {sum_{i=1}^m mu_i / -
sum_{i=1}^m mu_{n-i+1}} for m=1,...,n-1. This generalizes the Hoffman lower
bound which only involves the maximum and minimum eigenvalues, i.e., the case
$m=1$. We provide several examples for which the new bound exceeds the {\sc
Hoffman} lower bound.
  Second, we conjecture the lower bound chi >= 1 + S^+ / S^-, where S^+ and S^-
are the sums of the squares of positive and negative eigenvalues, respectively.
To corroborate this conjecture, we prove the weaker bound chi >= S^+/S^-. We
show that the conjectured lower bound is tight for several families of graphs.
We also performed various searches for a counter-example, but none was found.
  Our proofs rely on a new technique of converting the adjacency matrix into
the zero matrix by conjugating with unitary matrices and use majorization of
spectra of self-adjoint matrices.
  We also show that the above bounds are actually lower bounds on the
normalized orthogonal rank of a graph, which is always less than or equal to
the chromatic number. The normalized orthogonal rank is the minimum dimension
making it possible to assign vectors with entries of modulus one to the
vertices such that two such vectors are orthogonal if the corresponding
vertices are connected.
  All these bounds are also valid when we replace the adjacency matrix A by W *
A where W is an arbitrary self-adjoint matrix and * denotes the Schur product,
that is, entrywise product of W and A.
