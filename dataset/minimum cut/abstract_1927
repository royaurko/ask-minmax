Using the multidimensional dynamic--programming method (MDPM) in the
four--dimensional deformation space $\{\beta_{\lambda}\}$ with $\lambda$=2, 4,
35 and 6 we were able to study evolution of the action integral for the
fissioning nucleus $^{258}$Fm. We found the second minimum on the
cross--section of the action integral for $\beta_2 \approx 1$ , what we
interpret as the dynamical evidence of the bimodal fission in this heavy Fm
isotope.
