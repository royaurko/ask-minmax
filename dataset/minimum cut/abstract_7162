We generalize the list decoding algorithm for Hermitian codes proposed by Lee
and O'Sullivan based on Gr\"obner bases to general one-point AG codes, under an
assumption weaker than one used by Beelen and Brander. By using the same
principle, we also generalize the unique decoding algorithm for one-point AG
codes over the Miura-Kamiya $C_{ab}$ curves proposed by Lee, Bras-Amor\'os and
O'Sullivan to general one-point AG codes, without any assumption. Finally we
extend the latter unique decoding algorithm to list decoding, modify it so that
it can be used with the Feng-Rao improved code construction, prove equality
between its error correcting capability and half the minimum distance lower
bound by Andersen and Geil that has not been done in the original proposal, and
remove the unnecessary computational steps so that it can run faster.
