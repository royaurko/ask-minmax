We present the first observations of cylindrical symmetry breaking in highly
excited diamagnetic hydrogen with a small crossed electric field, and we give a
semiclassical interpretation of this effect. As the small perpendicular
electric field is added, the recurrence strengths of closed orbits decrease
smoothly to a minimum, and revive again. This phenomenon, caused by
interference among the electron waves that return to the nucleus, can be
computed from the azimuthal dependence of the classical closed orbits.
