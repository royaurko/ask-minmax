We discuss risk measures representing the minimum amount of capital a
financial institution needs to raise and invest in a pre-specified eligible
asset to ensure it is adequately capitalized. Most of the literature has
focused on cash-additive risk measures, for which the eligible asset is a
risk-free bond, on the grounds that the general case can be reduced to the
cash-additive case by a change of numeraire. However, discounting does not work
in all financially relevant situations, typically when the eligible asset is a
defaultable bond. In this paper we fill this gap allowing for general eligible
assets. We provide a variety of finiteness and continuity results for the
corresponding risk measures and apply them to risk measures based on
Value-at-Risk and Tail Value-at-Risk on $L^p$ spaces, as well as to shortfall
risk measures on Orlicz spaces. We pay special attention to the property of
cash subadditivity, which has been recently proposed as an alternative to cash
additivity to deal with defaultable bonds. For important examples, we provide
characterizations of cash subadditivity and show that, when the eligible asset
is a defaultable bond, cash subadditivity is the exception rather than the
rule. Finally, we consider the situation where the eligible asset is not
liquidly traded and the pricing rule is no longer linear. We establish when the
resulting risk measures are quasiconvex and show that cash subadditivity is
only compatible with continuous pricing rules.
