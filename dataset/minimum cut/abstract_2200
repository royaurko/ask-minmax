Visible and infra-red light emitted at a Ag-Ag(111) junction has been
investigated from tunneling to single atom contact conditions with a scanning
tunneling microscope. The light intensity varies in a highly nonlinear fashion
with the conductance of the junction and exhibits a minimum at conductances
close to the conductance quantum. The data are interpreted in terms of current
noise at optical frequencies, which is characteristic of partially open
transport channels.
