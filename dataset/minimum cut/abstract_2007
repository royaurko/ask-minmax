Following an approach based on generating function method phase space
characteristics of Landau system are studied in the autonomous framework of
deformation quantization. Coherent state property of generating functions is
established and marginal probability densities along canonical coordinate lines
are derived. Well defined analogs of inner product, Cauchy-Bunyakowsy-Schwarz
inequality and state functional have been defined in phase space and they have
been used in analyzing the uncertainty structures. The general form of the
uncertainty relation for two real-valued functions is derived and uncertainty
products are computed in states described by Wigner functions. Minimum
uncertainty state property of the standard coherent states is presented and
uncertainty structures in the case of phase space generalized coherent states
are analyzed.
