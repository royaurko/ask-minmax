The main problem in liquid porosimetry, which prevents to see the pore sizes
smaller than 2 microns in diameter, is direct gas diffusion flow through a
micro-porous membrane. This diffusion causes bubbles formation below the
membrane and that spoils extrusion (intrusion) data, as one cannot distinguish
the volume of extrusion (intrusion) liquid from the volume of formatted
bubbles. The suggested below method cures the problem by creating the liquid
flow below the membrane. The flow washes out all of the small bubbles
preventing them to grow. That allows using the membrane at higher differential
pressures, even higher than minimum bubble point of the membrane, without
spoiling data.
