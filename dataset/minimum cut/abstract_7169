We propose a model of dark matter: galaxy-sized 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic
monopoles in a new, extraordinarily weakly coupled SU(2) gauge sector with an
adjoint Higgs field and two flavors of fundamental fermions. We fit the
parameters by asserting that the dark matter halos of the lightest dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxies consist of a single charge Q=1 monopole. Lensing and
wide binary bounds are then easily satisfied and the monopoles form in time to
help with CMB fluctuations. In this model dSph and low surface brightness (LSB)
halos automatically have (1) A minimum mass - Dirac quantization solves the
missing satellite problem, (2) A constant density core (r<r_1), (3) An
intermediate regime (r_1<r<r_2) with density proportional to 1/r^2. The model
predicts that (A) r_1 is proportional to the stellar rotational/dispersion
velocities at r_1<r<r_2, (B) r_2 is reasonably Q independent and so dSph halos
extend at least ten times farther than their half-light and tidal radii, (C)
The minimal stellar dispersion is 1/sqrt{2} times the next-smallest allowed
value. A serious potential problem with our proposal is that non-BPS monopoles
are repulsive. The Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism yields four species of monopoles, and
we assume that, for some choice of Yukawa couplings, one species is light and
serves only to screen the repulsive interactions of another.
