A technique is presented to evaluate the performance of a wireless link with
a multi-antenna linear Minimum-Mean-Square Error (MMSE) receiver in the
presence of interferers distributed according to non-homogeneous Poisson
processes or Poisson cluster processes on the plane. The Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) of the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio
(SINR) of a representative link is derived for both types of networks assuming
independent Rayleigh fading between antennas. Several representative spatial
node distributions are considered, for which the derived CDFs are verified by
numerical simulations. In addition, for non-homogeneous Poisson networks, it is
shown that the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) converges to a deterministic
non-zero value if the number of antennas at the representative receiver
increases linearly with the nominal interferer density. This indicates that to
the extent that the system assumptions hold, it is possible to scale such
networks by increasing the number of receiver antennas linearly with user
density. The results presented here are useful in characterizing the
performance of multiantenna wireless networks with non-homogenous spatial node
distributions and networks with clusters of users which often arise in
practice, but for which few results are available.
