Emission line galaxies are an invaluable tool for our understanding of the
evolution of galaxies in the Universe. Imaging of deep fields with narrow-band
filters allows not only the selection of these objects, but also to infer the
line flux and the equivalent width of the emission line with some assumptions.
The narrow-band filter technique provides homogeneous samples of galaxies in
small comoving volumes in the sky. We present an analysis of the selection of
emission-line galaxies using narrow-band filters. Different methods of
observation are considered: broad-band -- narrow-band filters and two
broad-band and one narrow-band filters.
  We study also the effect of several lines entering simultaneously inside the
filters (this is the case of Halpha). In each case the equations to obtain the
equivalent width and line flux from the photometry are obtained. Candidates to
emission-line objects are selected by their color excess in a magnitude-color
diagram. For different narrow-band filters, we compute the mean colors of stars
and galaxies, showing that, apart from galaxies, some types of stars could be
selected with certain filter sets. We show how to compute the standard
deviation of the colors of the objects even in the usual case when there are
not enough objects to determine the standard deviation from the data. We
present also helpful equations to compute the narrow-band and the broad-band
exposure times in order to obtain minimum dispersion in the ratio of fluxes of
both bands with minimum total exposure time.
