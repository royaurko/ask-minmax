We investigate glassy dynamical properties of one component three-dimensional
system of particles interacting via pair repulsive potential by the molecular
dynamic simulation in the wide region of densities. The glass state is
superfragile and it has high glassforming ability. The glass transition
temperature Tg has pronounced minimum at densities where the frustration is
maximal.
