The impossibility of attaining equilibrium for cyclic chemical reaction
networks with irreversible steps is apparently due to a divergent entropy
production rate. A deeper reason seems to be the violation of the detailed
balance condition. In this work, we discuss how the standard theoretical
framework can be adapted to include irreversible cycles, avoiding the
divergence. With properly redefined force terms, such systems are also seen to
reach and sustain equilibria that are characterized by the vanishing of the
entropy production rate, though detailed balance is not maintained. Equivalence
of the present formulation with Onsager's original prescription is established
for both reversible and irreversible cycles, with a few adjustments in the
latter case. Further justification of the attainment of true equilibrium is
provided with the help of the minimum entropy production principle. All the
results are generalized for an irreversible cycle comprising of N number of
species.
