We discuss the Donsker-Varadhan theory of large deviations in the framework
of Hamiltonian systems thermostated by a Gaussian stochastic coupling. We
derive a general formula for the Donsker-Varadhan large deviation functional
for dynamics which satisfy natural properties under time reversal. Next, we
discuss the characterization of the stationary state as the solution of a
variational principle and its relation to the minimum entropy production
principle. Finally, we compute the large deviation functional of the current in
the case of a harmonic chain thermostated by a Gaussian stochastic coupling.
