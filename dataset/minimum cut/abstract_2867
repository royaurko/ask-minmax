Let k be a positive integer and let f be a map from V(G) to the set of all
subsets of {1,2,3,...,k}. The function f is called a k-rainbow dominating
function of G provided that whenever u is a vertex of G such that f(u) is the
empty set, then for each integer r in {1,2,3,...,k} there is a neighbor x of u
such that f(x) contains r. The k-rainbow domination number of G is the minimum
sum (over all the vertices of G) of the cardinalities of the subsets assigned
by a k-rainbow dominating function of G. The k-rainbow domination number of G
is the ordinary domination number of the Cartesian product of G and a complete
graph of order k.
  We focus on the 2-rainbow domination number of the lexicographic product of
graphs and prove sharp lower and upper bounds for this number. In fact, we
prove the exact value of the 2-rainbow domination number of the lexicographic
product of G with H in terms of domination invariants of G, except for the case
when H has 2-rainbow domination number 3 and there is a minimum 2-rainbow
dominating function of H such that some vertex in H is assigned the label
{1,2}.
