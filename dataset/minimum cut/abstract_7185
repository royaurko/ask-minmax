We re-analyse the HARPS radial velocities of HD 10180 and calculate the
probabilities of models with differing numbers of periodic signals in the data.
We test the significance of the seven signals, corresponding to seven
exoplanets orbiting the star, in the Bayesian framework and perform comparisons
of models with up to nine periodicities. We use posterior samplings and
Bayesian model probabilities in our analyses together with suitable prior
probability densities and prior model probabilities to extract all the
significant signals from the data and to receive reliable uncertainties for the
orbital parameters of the six, possibly seven, known exoplanets in the system.
According to our results, there is evidence for up to nine planets orbiting HD
10180, which would make this this star a record holder in having more planets
in its orbits than there are in the Solar system. We revise the uncertainties
of the previously reported six planets in the system, verify the existence of
the seventh signal, and announce the detection of two additional statistically
significant signals in the data. If of planetary origin, these two additional
signals would correspond to planets with minimum masses of 5.1$^{+3.1}_{-3.2}$
and 1.9$^{+1.6}_{-1.8}$ M$_{\oplus}$ on orbits with 67.55$^{+0.68}_{-0.88}$ and
9.655$^{+0.022}_{-0.072}$ days periods (denoted using the 99% credibility
intervals), respectively.
