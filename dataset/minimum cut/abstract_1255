A Roman dominating function on a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a function $f: V\to
\{0,1,2\}$ satisfying the condition that every vertex $u$ with $f(u)=0$ is
adjacent to at least one vertex $v$ with $f(v)=2$. The weight of a Roman
dominating function is the value $f(G)=\sum_{u\in V} f(u)$. The Roman
domination number of $G$ is the minimum weight of a Roman dominating function
on $G$. The Roman bondage number of a nonempty graph $G$ is the minimum number
of edges whose removal results in a graph with the Roman domination number
larger than that of $G$. This paper determines the exact value of the Roman
bondage numbers of two classes of graphs, complete $t$-partite graphs and
$(n-3)$-regular graphs with order $n$ for any $n\ge 5$.
