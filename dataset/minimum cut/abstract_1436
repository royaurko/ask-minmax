We apply a recently developed technique of calculating the minimum jet
kinetic power to the major mass ejections of the black-hole binary GRS 1915+105
observed in radio wavelengths in 1994 and 1997. We derive for them the
distance-dependent minimum power, and the corresponding mass flow rate and the
total energy and mass content. We find that a fast increase of the jet power
with the increasing distance combined with the jet power estimates based on the
bolometric luminosity imply the source distance is <10 kpc. If the jet in GRS
1915 contains ions, their bulk motion dominates the jet power, which was either
neglected or not properly taken into account earlier. We also reconsider the
parameters of the binary, and derive the current best estimates of the
distance-dependent black-hole mass and the inclination based on existing
measurements combined with the kinematic constraints from the mass ejections.
We also find the measurement of the donor radius of Steeghs et al. implies the
distance to the system of <10 kpc, in agreement with the estimate from the jet
power.
