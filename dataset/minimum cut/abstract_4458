We report the detection of a substellar companion orbiting the G5 dwarf HD
16760 from the N2K sample. Precise Doppler measurements of the star from Subaru
and Keck revealed a Keplerian velocity variation with a period of 466.47+-0.35
d, a semiamplitude of 407.71+-0.84 m/s, and an eccentricity of 0.084+-0.003.
Adopting a stellar mass of 0.78+-0.05 M_Sun, we obtain a minimum mass for the
companion of 13.13+-0.56 M_JUP, which is close to the planet/brown-dwarf
transition, and the semimajor axis of 1.084+-0.023 AU. The nearly circular
orbit despite the large mass and intermediate orbital period makes this
companion unique among known substellar companions.
