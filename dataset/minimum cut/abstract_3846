Equations of state for strange quark matter in beta equilibrium at high
densities are used to investigate the structure (mass and radius) of compact
objects. The chromodielectric model is used as a general framework for the
quark interactions, which are mediated by chiral mesons, $\sigma$ and $\vec
\pi$, and by a confining chiral singlet dynamical field, $\chi$. Using a
quartic potential for $\chi$, two equations of state for the same set of model
parameters are obtained, one with a minimum at around the nuclear matter
density $\rho_0$ and the other at $\rho \sim 5 \rho_0$. Using the latter
equation of state in the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations we found
solutions corresponding to compact objects with $R\sim 5 - 8$ km and $M\sim
M_\odot$. The phenomenology of recently discovered X-ray sources is compatible
with the type of quark stars that we have obtained.
