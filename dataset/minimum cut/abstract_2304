In this paper we propose task swapping networks for task reassignments by
using task swappings in distributed systems. Some classes of task reassignments
are achieved by using iterative local task swappings between software agents in
distributed systems. We use group-theoretic methods to find a minimum-length
sequence of adjacent task swappings needed from a source task assignment to a
target task assignment in a task swapping network of several well-known
topologies.
