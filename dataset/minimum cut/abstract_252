This paper is a twofold contribution. First, it contributes to the problem of
enumerating some classes of simple games and in particular provides the number
of weighted games with minimum and the number of weighted games for the dual
class as well. Second, we focus on the special case of bipartite complete games
with minimum, and we compare and rank these games according to the behavior of
some efficient power indices of players of type 1 (or of type 2). The main
result of this second part establishes all allowable rankings of these games
when the Shapley-Shubik power index is used on players of type 1.
