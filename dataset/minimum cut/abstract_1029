A numerical analysis shows that a class of scalar-tensor theories of gravity
with a scalar field minimally and nonminimally coupled to the curvature allows
static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with scalar-field hair in
asymptotically flat spacetimes. In the limit when the horizon radius of the
black hole tends to zero, regular scalar solitons are found. The asymptotically
flat solutions are obtained provided that the scalar potential $V(\phi)$ of the
theory is not positive semidefinite and such that its local minimum is also a
zero of the potential, the scalar field settling asymptotically at that
minimum. The configurations for the minimal coupling case, although unstable
under spherically symmetric linear perturbations, are regular and thus can
serve as counterexamples to the no-scalar-hair conjecture. For the nonminimal
coupling case, the stability will be analyzed in a forthcoming paper.
