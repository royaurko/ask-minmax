We report on H-alpha spectroscopy of the 2009.0 spectroscopic event of eta
Carinae collected via SMARTS observations using the CTIO 1.5 m telescope and
echelle spectrograph. Our observations were made almost every night over a two
month interval around the predicted minimum of eta Car. We observed a
significant fading of the line emission that reached a minimum seven days after
the X-ray minimum. About 17 d prior to the H-alpha flux minimum, the H-alpha
profile exhibited the emergence of a broad, P Cygni type, absorption component
(near a Doppler shift of -500 km/s) and a narrow absorption component (near
-144 km/s and probably associated with intervening gas from the Little
Homunculus Nebula). All these features were observed during the last event in
2003.5 and are probably related to the close periastron passage of the
companion. We argue that these variations are consistent with qualitative
expectations about changes in the primary star's stellar wind that result from
the wind-wind collision with a massive binary companion and from atmospheric
eclipses of the companion.
