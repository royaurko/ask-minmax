We present time-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of CSS
120422:111127+571239 (= SBS1108+574), a recently discovered SU UMa-type dwarf
nova whose 55-minute orbital period is well below the CV period minimum of ~78
minutes. In contrast with most other known CVs, its spectrum features He I
emission of comparable strength to the Balmer lines, implying a hydrogen
abundance less than 0.1 of long period CVs---but still at least 10 times higher
than than in AM CVn stars. Together, the short orbital period and remarkable
helium-to-hydrogen ratio suggest that mass transfer in "CSS 1204" began near
the end of the donor star's main-sequence lifetime, meaning that the system is
probably an AM CVn progenitor as described by Podsiadlowski, Han, and Rappaport
(2003). Moreover, a Doppler tomogram of the Halpha line reveals two distinct
regions of enhanced emission. While one is the result of the stream-disk
impact, the other is probably attributable to spiral disk structure generated
when material in the outer disk achieves a 2:1 orbital resonance with respect
to the donor.
