We propose a mechanism for instanton induced chiral symmetry breaking in QCD
with fundamental scalars. The model Lagragian that we use has the same symmetry
properties as QCD. The scalar fields develop vacuum expectation values at a
non-trivial minimum and generate masses for thhe light quarks. The minimization
condition is also used to break the $SU(N_f)$ flavour symmetry in order to make
the $s$ quark heavier than the two lighter ones. Thus a vacuum of the theory
that is not chirally invariant is obtained.
