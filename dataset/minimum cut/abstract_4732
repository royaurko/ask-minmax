We investigate a system of fermions on a two-dimensional optical square
lattice in the strongly repulsive coupling regime. In this case, the
interactions can be controlled by laser intensity as well as by Feshbach
resonance. We compare the energetics of states with resonating valence bond
d-wave superfluidity, antiferromagnetic long range order and a homogeneous
state with coexistence of superfluidity and antiferromagnetism. We show that
the energy density of a hole $e_{hole}(x)$ has a minimum at doping $x=x_c$ that
signals phase separation between the antiferromagnetic and d-wave paired
superfluid phases. The energy of the phase-separated ground state is however
found to be very close to that of a homogeneous state with coexisting
antiferromagnetic and superfluid orders. We explore the dependence of the
energy on the interaction strength and on the three-site hopping terms and
compare with the nearest neighbor hopping {\it t-J} model.
