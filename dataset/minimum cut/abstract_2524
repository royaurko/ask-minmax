The Schr\"odinger equation for a charged particle in the field of a
nonrelativistic electric quadrupole in two dimensions is known to be separable
in spherical coordinates. We investigate the occurrence of bound states of
negative energy and find that the particle can be bound by a quadrupole of any
magnitude. This result is remarkably different from the one for a charged
particle in the field of a nonrelativistic electric dipole in three dimensions
where a minimum value of the dipole strength is necessary for capture. Present
results differ from those obtained earlier by other contributor.
