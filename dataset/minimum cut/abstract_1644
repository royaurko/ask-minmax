Coalition setting among a set of actors (countries, firms, individuals) is
studied using concepts from the theory of spin glasses. Given the distribution
of respective bilateral propensities to either cooperation or conflict, the
phenomenon of local aggregation is modeled. In particular the number of
coalitions is determined according to a minimum conflict principle. It is found
not to be always two. Along these lines, previous studies are revisited and are
found not to be consistent with their own principles. The model is then used to
describe the fragmentation of former Yugoslavia. Results are compared to the
actual situation.
