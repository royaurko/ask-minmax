A total of 137 upward stopping muons of minimum energy 1.6 GeV are observed
by Super-Kamiokande during 516 detector live days. The measured muon flux is
0.39+/-0.04(stat.)+/-0.02(syst.)x10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1} compared to an
expected flux of 0.73+/-0.16(theo.)x10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}. Using our
previously-published measurement of the upward through-going muon flux, we
calculate the stopping/through-going flux ratio R}, which has less theoretical
uncertainty. The measured value of R=0.22+/-0.02(stat.)+/-0.01(syst.) is
significantly smaller than the value 0.37^{+0.05}_{-0.04}(theo.) expected using
the best theoretical information (the probability that the measured R is a
statistical fluctuation below the expected value is 0.39%). A simultaneous
fitting to zenith angle distributions of upward stopping and through-going
muons gives a result which is consistent with the hypothesis of neutrino
oscillations with the parameters sin^2 2\theta >0.7 and 1.5x10^{-3} < \Delta
m^2 < 1.5x10^{-2} eV^2 at 90% confidence level, providing a confirmation of the
observation of neutrino oscillations by Super-Kamiokande using the contained
atmospheric neutrino events.
