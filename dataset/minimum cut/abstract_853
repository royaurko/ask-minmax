The Rosen fractions are an infinite set of continued fraction algorithms,
each giving expansions of real numbers in terms of certain algebraic integers.
For each, we give a best possible upper bound for the minimum in appropriate
consecutive blocks of approximation coefficients (in the sense of Diophantine
approximation by continued fraction convergents). We also obtain metrical
results for large blocks of ``bad'' approximations.
