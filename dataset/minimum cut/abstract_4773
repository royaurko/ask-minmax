In 1978, Chv\'atal and Thomassen showed that every bridgeless graph with
diameter 2 has an orientation with diameter at most 6. They also gave general
bounds on the smallest value $f(d)$ such that every bridgeless graph $G$ with
diameter $d$ has an orientation with diameter at most $f(d)$. For $d=3$, they
proved that $8\leq f(d)\leq 24$. Until recently, Kwok, Liu and West improved
the above bounds by proving $9\leq f(3)\leq 11$ in [P.K. Kwok, Q. Liu and D.B.
West, Oriented diameter of graphs with diameter 3, J. Combin. Theory Ser.B
100(2010), 265-274]. In this paper, we determine the oriented diameter among
the bridgeless graphs with diameter 3 that have minimum number of edges.
