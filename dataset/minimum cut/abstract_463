We present a new bound for the minimum distance of a general primary linear
code. For affine variety codes defined from generalised C_{ab} curves the new
bound often improves dramatically on the Feng-Rao bound for primary codes. The
method does not only work for the minimum distance but can be applied to any
generalised Hamming weight
