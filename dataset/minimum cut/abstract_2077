The concordance genus of a knot K is the minimum three-genus among all knots
concordant to K. For prime knots of 10 or fewer crossings there have been three
knots for which the concordance genus was unknown. Those three cases are now
resolved. Two of the cases are settled using invariants of Levine's algebraic
concordance group. The last case depends on the use of twisted Alexander
polynomials, viewed as Casson-Gordon invariants.
