The production of charmonia in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is
investigated including two sources. These are a primordial contribution coupled
with various phases of dissociation, and a statistical coalescence of $c$ and
$\bar{c}$ quarks at the hadronization phase transition. Within a schematic
fireball evolution, SPS data on $J/\Psi$ production can be reasonably well
reproduced. Remaining discrepancies in the $\Psi'/\Psi$ ratio are discussed.
Predictions for the $J/\Psi$ centrality dependence at RHIC energies are
confronted with first data from PHENIX. The pertinent excitation function of
the $N_{J/\Psi}/N_{c\bar{c}}$ ratio exhibits a characteristic minimum structure
signaling the transition from the standard $J/\Psi$ suppression scenario (SPS)
to predominantly statistical production (RHIC).
