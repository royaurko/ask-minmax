In this paper, we present our spectrum sharing algorithm between a
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar and Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular
system with multiple base stations (BS)s. We analyze the performance of MIMO
radars in detecting the angle of arrival, propagation delay and Doppler angular
frequency by projecting orthogonal waveforms onto the null-space of
interference channel matrix. We compare and analyze the radar's detectable
target parameters in the case of the original radar waveform and the case of
null-projected radar waveform. Our proposed spectrum-sharing algorithm causes
minimum loss in radar performance by selecting the best interference channel
that does not cause interference to the i'th LTE base station due to the radar
signal. We show through our analytical and simulation results that the loss in
the radar performance in detecting the target parameters is minimal when our
proposed spectrum sharing algorithm is used to select the best channel onto
which radar signals are projected.
