Let K be a finite field and let X be a subset of a projective space, over the
field K, which is parameterized by monomials arising from the edges of a
clutter. We show some estimates for the degree-complexity, with respect to the
revlex order, of the vanishing ideal I(X) of X. If the clutter is uniform, we
classify the complete intersection property of I(X) using linear algebra. We
show an upper bound for the minimum distance of certain parameterized linear
codes along with certain estimates for the algebraic invariants of I(X).
