We present a summary of measurements of strange particles performed by the
experiment NA49 in inelastic p+p interactions, as well as semi-central C+C and
Si+Si, central Pb+Pb, and minimum bias Pb+Pb collisions in the energy range
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 6.3 - 17.3 GeV. New results on $\pi^{-}$, $K^{+}$ and $K^{-}$
production in minimum bias Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 8.7 and 17.3
are shown. Furthermore the strangeness enhancement factor at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =
17.3 GeV is presented and compared to the results from NA57 and STAR. Energy
dependence of strange particle yields normalized to pion yields is presented.
New data on $<K^{*}(892)^{0}>$ production are shown at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 17.3
GeV. Furthermore we present the energy dependence of $K/\pi$ and $K/p$
fluctuations. The data are compared with model predictions.
