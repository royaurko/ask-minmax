We apply a recently introduced method for global optimization to determine
the ground state energy and configuration for model metallic clusters. The
global minimum for a given N-atom cluster is found by following the damped
dynamics of the N particle system on an evolving potential energy surface. In
this application, the time dependent interatomic potential interpolates
adiabatically between the Lennard-Jones (LJ) and the Sutton-Chen (SC) forms.
Starting with an ensemble of initial conditions corresponding to the ground
state configuration of the Lennard-Jones cluster, the system asymptotically
reaches the ground state of the Sutton-Chen cluster. We describe the method
and present results for specific cluster size N=15, when the ground state
symmetry of LJ$_N$ and SC$_N$ differ.
