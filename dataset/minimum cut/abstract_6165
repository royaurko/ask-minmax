Observations of the rho Ophiuchi star forming region with VLT ANTU and ISAAC
under 0.35" seeing conditions reveal two bipolar reflection nebulosities
intersected by central dust lanes. The sources (OphE-MM3 and CRBR 2422.8-3423)
can be identified as spatially resolved circumstellar disks viewed close to
edge-on, similar to edge-on disk sources discovered previously in the Taurus
and Orion star forming regions. Millimeter continuum fluxes yield disk masses
of the order of 0.01 Mo, i.e. about the mass deemed necessary for the minimum
solar nebula. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with SUBARU and CISCO show
that both disk sources exhibit featureless continua in the K-band. No accretion
or outflow signatures were detected. The slightly less edge-on orientation of
the disk around CRBR 2422.8-3423 compared to HH 30 leads to a dramatic
difference in the flux seen in the ISOCAM 4.5 mu to 12 mu bands. The
observations confirm theoretical predictions on the effect of disk geometry and
inclination angle on the spectral energy distribution of young stellar objects
with circumstellar disks.
