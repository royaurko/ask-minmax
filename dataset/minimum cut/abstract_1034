A measurement of the first four moments of the hadronic mass distribution in
B->Xc lv decays is presented for minimum lepton momenta varying between 0.9 and
1.6 GeV, using data recorded with the BaBar detector. Furthermore, a
measurement of the inclusive electron energy spectrum for semileptonic B decays
together with a measurement of its first, second and third moments for minimum
electron energies between 0.6 and 1.5 GeV is reported. We determine the
inclusive B->Xc lv branching fraction, B_clv, the CKM matrix element |V_cb|,
and other heavy-quark parameters from a simultaneous fit to the measured
moments.
