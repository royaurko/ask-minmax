We use the solutions of the noncommutative Wheeler-De Witt equation arising
from a Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model to compute thermodynamic properties
of the Schwarzschild black hole. We show that the noncommutativity in the
momentum sector introduces a quadratic term in the potential function of the
black hole minisuperspace model. This potential has a local minimum and thus
the partition function can be computed by resorting to a saddle point
evaluation in the neighbourhood of the minimum. The temperature and the entropy
of the black hole are derived, and they have an explicit dependence on the
inverse of the momentum noncommutative parameter, $\eta$. Moreover, we study
the $t=r=0$ singularity in the noncommutative regime and show that in this case
the wave function of the system vanishes in the neighbourhood of $t=r=0$.
