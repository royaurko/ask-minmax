Proper scoring rules are methods for encouraging honest assessment of
probability distributions. Just like likelihood, a proper scoring rule can be
applied to supply an unbiased estimating equation for any statistical model,
and the theory of such equations can be applied to understand the properties of
the associated estimator. In this paper we develop some basic scoring rule
estimation theory, and explore robustness and interval estimation properties by
means of theory and simulations.
