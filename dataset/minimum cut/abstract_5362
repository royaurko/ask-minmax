We study the electric conductivity of hot QCD matter at various temperatures
T within the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics transport approach for
interacting partonic, hadronic or mixed systems in a finite box with periodic
boundary conditions. The response of the strongly interacting system in
equilibrium to an external electric field defines the electric conductivity
sigma_0. We find a sizable temperature dependence of the ratio sigma_0/T well
in line with calculations in a relaxation time approach for Tc<T<2.5Tc. The
ratio drops in the hadronic phase with T, shows a minimum close to Tc, and
becomes approximately constant (~0.3) above ~5Tc. Our findings imply that the
QCD matter even at T=Tc is a much better electric conductor than Cu or Ag (at
room temperature).
