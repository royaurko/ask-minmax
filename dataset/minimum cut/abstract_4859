We prove a unique continuation principle or uncertainty relation valid for
Schr\"odinger operator eigenfunctions, or more generally solutions of a
Schr\"odinger inequality, on cubes of side $L\in 2\NN+1$. It establishes an
equi-distribution property of the eigenfunction over the box: the total
$L^2$-mass in the box of side $L$ is estimated from above by a constant times
the sum of the $L^2$-masses on small balls of a fixed radius $\delta>0$ evenly
distributed throughout the box. The dependence of the constant on the various
parameters entering the problem is given explicitly. Most importantly, there is
no $L$-dependence.
  This result has important consequences for the perturbation theory of
eigenvalues of Schr\"odinger operators, in particular random ones. For
so-called Delone-Anderson models we deduce Wegner estimates, a lower bound for
the shift of the spectral minimum, and an uncertainty relation for spectral
projectors.
