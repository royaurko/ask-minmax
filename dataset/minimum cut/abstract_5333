The energy landscape and diffusion barriers of protonic defects in Gd-doped
BaCeO3, a compound candidate as electrolyte for protonic ceramic fuel cells,
have been investigated by density functional theory calculations, starting from
a previously computed energy landscape consisting of 16 kinds of stable sites
(8 close to dopants and 8 far from them). The simplified string method has been
used to determine accurately the Minimum Energy Paths between those sites, that
might imply either proton reorientations, intra-octahedral or inter-octahedral
hopping mechanisms. At contrast with simple cubic perovskites such as barium
stannate or barium zirconate, very different values for energy barriers (from
0.02 eV to 0.58 eV) are found in this highly distorted orthorhombic perovskite,
and no specific process appears to be clearly rate-limiting. Some
inter-octahedral hoppings (when possible) are found to be more favourable than
the intra-octahedral ones, while reorientations exhibit a wide range of energy
barriers.
