Recently, the precise performance of the Generalized LASSO algorithm for
recovering structured signals from compressed noisy measurements, obtained via
i.i.d. Gaussian matrices, has been characterized. The analysis is based on a
framework introduced by Stojnic and heavily relies on the use of Gordon's
Gaussian min-max theorem (GMT), a comparison principle on Gaussian processes.
As a result, corresponding characterizations for other ensembles of measurement
matrices have not been developed. In this work, we analyze the corresponding
performance of the ensemble of isotropically random orthogonal (i.r.o.)
measurements. We consider the constrained version of the Generalized LASSO and
derive a sharp characterization of its normalized squared error in the
large-system limit. When compared to its Gaussian counterpart, our result
analytically confirms the superiority in performance of the i.r.o. ensemble.
Our second result, derives an asymptotic lower bound on the minimum conic
singular values of i.r.o. matrices. This bound is larger than the corresponding
bound on Gaussian matrices. To prove our results we express i.r.o. matrices in
terms of Gaussians and show that, with some modifications, the GMT framework is
still applicable.
