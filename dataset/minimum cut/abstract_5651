CDS (credit default swap) contracts that were initiated some time ago
frequently have spreads and/or maturities that are not available on the current
market of CDSs, and are thus illiquid. This article introduces an
incomplete-market approach to valuing illiquid CDSs that, in contrast to the
risk-neutral approach of current market practice, allows a dealer who buys an
illiquid CDS from an investor to determine ask and bid prices (which differ) in
such a way as to guarantee a minimum positive expected rate of return on the
deal. An alternative procedure, which replaces the expected rate of return by
an analogue of the Sharpe ratio, is also discussed. The approach to pricing
just described belongs to the good-deal category of approaches, since the
dealer decides what it would take to make an appropriate expected rate of
return, and sets the bid and ask prices accordingly. A number of different
hedges are discussed and compared within the general framework developed in the
article. The approach is implemented numerically, and example plots of
important quantities are given. The paper also develops a useful result in
linear programming theory in the case that the cost vector is random.
