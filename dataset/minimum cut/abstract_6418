Using the functional renormalization group (FRG) we study the thermal
fluctuations of elastic objects, described by a displacement field u and
internal dimension d, pinned by a random potential at low temperature T, as
prototypes for glasses. A challenge is how the field theory can describe both
typical (minimum energy T=0) configurations, as well as thermal averages which,
at any non-zero T as in the phenomenological droplet picture, are dominated by
rare degeneracies between low lying minima. We show that this occurs through an
essentially non-perturbative *thermal boundary layer* (TBL) in the (running)
effective action Gamma[u] at T>0 for which we find a consistent scaling ansatz
to all orders. The TBL resolves the singularities of the T=0 theory and
contains rare droplet physics. The formal structure of this TBL is explored
around d=4 using a one loop Wilson RG. A more systematic Exact RG (ERG) method
is employed and tested on d=0 models. There we obtain precise relations between
TBL quantities and droplet probabilities which are checked against exact
results. We illustrate how the TBL scaling remains consistent to all orders in
higher d using the ERG and how droplet picture results can be retrieved.
Finally, we solve for d=0,N=1 the formidable "matching problem" of how this T>0
TBL recovers a critical T=0 field theory. We thereby obtain the beta-function
at T=0, *all ambiguities removed*, displayed here up to four loops. A
discussion of d>4 case and an exact solution at large d are also provided.
