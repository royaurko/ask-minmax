It is shown that the generation linewidth of an auto-oscillator with a
nonlinear frequency shift (i.e. an auto-oscillator in which frequency depends
on the oscillation amplitude) is substantially larger than the linewidth of a
conventional quasi-linear auto-oscillator due to the renormalization of the
phase noise caused by the nonlinearity of the oscillation frequency. The
developed theory, when applied to a spin-torque nano-contact auto-oscillator,
predicts a minimum of the generation linewidth when the nano-contact is
magnetized at a critical angle to its plane, corresponding to the minimum
nonlinear frequency shift, in good agreement with recent experiments.
