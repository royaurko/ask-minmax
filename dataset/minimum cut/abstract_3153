The formation of the resonance lines of neutral boron in solar-type stellar
atmospheres is investigated taking into account effects of departures from
local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE effects). The latter are due to a
combination of overionisation and optical pumping in resonance lines, both
caused by the hot, non-local, ultraviolet radiation fields in the line-forming
regions. They lead to an underestimation of the boron abundance when analysis
methods assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are used. The abundance
correction, for the 249.7~nm resonance line, amounts to $+$0.6 dex for the
metal-poor star HD140283 and $+$0.4 dex for Procyon. No significant NLTE
effects are predicted for the Sun. Applying the abundance correction on the
results for HD140283 of Duncan et al. (1992) leads to a B/Be ratio well above
the minimum value required by spallation production of beryllium. The
reliability of the results in view of atomic and atmospheric uncertainties is
discussed. With the possible exception of photospheric inhomogeneity, it seems
unlikely that these could remove the effect for HD140283.
