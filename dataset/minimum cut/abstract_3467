Recent work on the mechanism of polymer crystallization has led to a proposal
for the mechanism of thickness selection which differs from those proposed by
the surface nucleation theory of Lauritzen and Hoffman and the entropic barrier
model of Sadler and Gilmer. This has motivated us to reexamine the model used
by Sadler and Gilmer. We again find a fixed-point attractor which describes the
dynamical convergence of the crystal thickness to a value just larger than the
minimum stable thickness, l_min. This convergence arises from the combined
effect of two constraints on the length of stems in a layer: it is unfavourable
for a stem to be shorter than l_min and for a stem to overhang the edge of the
previous layer. The relationship between this new mechanism and the explanation
given by Sadler and Gilmer in terms of an entropic barrier is discussed. We
also examine the behaviour of the Sadler-Gilmer model when an energetic
contribution from chain folds is included.
