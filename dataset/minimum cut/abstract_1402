By regarding the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy of Schwarzschild black hole
horizons as a non-extensive Tsallis entropy, its formal logarithm, the R\'enyi
entropy, is considered. The resulting temperature - horizon-radius relation has
the same form as the one obtained from a 3+1-dimensional black hole in anti-de
Sitter space using the original entropy formula. In both cases the temperature
has a minimum. A semi-classical estimate of the horizon radius at this minimum
leads to a Bekenstein bound for the q-parameter in the R\'enyi entropy of micro
black holes, (q >= 1 + 2/pi^2), which is surprisingly close to fitted
q-parameters of cosmic ray spectra and power-law distribution of quarks
coalescing to hadrons in high energy accelerator experiments.
