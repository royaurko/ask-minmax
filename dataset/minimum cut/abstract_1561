We describe calculations of the evolution of an ensemble of small
planetesimals in the outer solar system. In a solar nebula with a mass of
several times the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula, objects with radii of 100-1000 km
can form on timescales of 10-100 Myr. Model luminosity functions derived from
these calculations agree with current observations of bodies beyond the orbit
of Neptune (Kuiper Belt objects). New surveys with current and planned
instruments can place better constraints on the mass and dynamics of the solar
nebula by measuring the luminosity function at red magnitudes of 28 or larger.
