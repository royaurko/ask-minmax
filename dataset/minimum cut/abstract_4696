In this work we investigate gravitational lensing effect in strong field
region around a dilaton black holes in an anti de Sitter (ADS) space. We also
analyse the dependence of the radius of the photon sphere and deflection angle
on dilaton coupling and cosmological constant in this black hole space time.
Finally the values of minimum impact parameter, the separation between the
first and the other images as well as the ratio between the flux of the first
image and the flux coming from all the other images are determined to
characterize some possible distinct signatures of such black holes.
