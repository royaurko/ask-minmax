We establish several new stylised facts concerning the intra-day
seasonalities of stock dynamics. Beyond the well known U-shaped pattern of the
volatility, we find that the average correlation between stocks increases
throughout the day, leading to a smaller relative dispersion between stocks.
Somewhat paradoxically, the kurtosis (a measure of volatility surprises)
reaches a minimum at the open of the market, when the volatility is at its
peak. We confirm that the dispersion kurtosis is a markedly decreasing function
of the index return. This means that during large market swings, the
idiosyncratic component of the stock dynamics becomes sub-dominant. In a
nutshell, early hours of trading are dominated by idiosyncratic or sector
specific effects with little surprises, whereas the influence of the market
factor increases throughout the day, and surprises become more frequent.
