We investigate theoretically the influence of laser phase noise on the
cooling and heating of a generic cavity optomechanical system. We derive the
back-action damping and heating rates and the mechanical frequency shift of the
radiation pressure-driven oscillating mirror, and derive the minimum phonon
occupation number for small laser linewidths. We find that in practice laser
phase noise does not pose serious limitations to ground state cooling. We then
consider the effects of laser phase noise in a parametric cavity driving scheme
that minimizes the back-action heating of one of the quadratures of the
mechanical oscillator motion. Laser linewidths narrow compared to the decay
rate of the cavity field will not pose any problems in an experimental setting,
but broader linewidths limit the practicality of this back-action evasion
method.
