In this paper we deal with the problem of finding the smallest and the
largest elements of a totally ordered set of size $n$ using pairwise
comparisons if $k$ of the comparisons might be erroneous where $k$ is a fixed
constant. We prove that at least $(k+1.5)n+\Theta(k)$ comparisons are needed in
the worst case thus disproving the conjecture that $(k+1+\epsilon)n$
comparisons are enough.
