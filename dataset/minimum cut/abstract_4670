The conventional way to search for long-lived CHArged Massive Particles
(CHAMPs) is to identify slow (small $\beta$) tracks using delayed time of
flight and high ionization energy loss. But at the 7-14 TeV center of mass
energy of the LHC, a CHAMP may be highly boosted (high $\beta$) and therefore
look more like a minimum ionizing particle, while for high momentum muons (more
than $\sim$500 GeV/c) the radiative effect dominates energy deposition. This
suggests a new strategy to search for CHAMPs at the LHC. Using energy
deposition from different detector components, we construct a boosted decision
tree discriminant to separate high momentum CHAMPs from high momentum muons.
This method increases substantially the CHAMP search potential and it can be
used to distinguish possible di-CHAMP or CHAMP-muon resonance models from
di-muon resonance models. We illustrate the new method using a mGMSB model and
a recently proposed di-CHAMP model and we give updated CHAMP mass limits for
these two models using the recent CDF CHAMP results.
