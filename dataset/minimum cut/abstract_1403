Relative variations in the number of sunspots and sunspot groups in activity
cycles have been analyzed based on data from the Kislovodsk Mountain
Astronomical Station and international indices. The following regularities have
been established: (1) The relative fraction of small sunspots decreases
linearly and that of large sunspots increase with increasing activity cycle
amplitude. (2) The variation in the average number of sunspots in one group has
a trend, and this number decreased from 12 in cycle 19 to 7.5 in cycle 24. (3)
The ratio of the sunspot index (Ri) to the sunspot group number index (Ggr)
varies with a period of about 100 years. (4) An analysis of the sunspot group
number index (Ggr) from 1610 indicates that the Gnevyshev-Ohl rule reverses at
the minimums of secular activity cycles. (5) The ratio of the total sunspot
area to the umbra area shows a long-term variation with a period about eight
cycles and minimum in cycles 16-17. (6) It has been indicated that the magnetic
field intensity and sunspot area in the current cycle are related to the
amplitude of the next activity cycle.
