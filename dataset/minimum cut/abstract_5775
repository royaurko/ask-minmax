To each supersimple $2-(n,4,\lambda)$ design $\mathcal{D}$ one associates a
`Conway groupoid,' which may be thought of as a natural generalisation of
Conway's Mathieu groupoid associated to $M_{13}$ which is constructed from
$\mathbb{P}_3$.
  We show that $\operatorname{Sp}_{2m}(2)$ and
$2^{2m}.\operatorname{Sp}_{2m}(2)$ naturally occur as Conway groupoids
associated to certain designs. It is shown that the incidence matrix associated
to one of these designs generates a new family of completely transitive
$\mathbb{F}_2$-linear codes with minimum distance 4 and covering radius 3,
whereas the incidence matrix of the other design gives an alternative
construction to a previously known family of completely transitive codes.
  We also give a new characterization of $M_{13}$ and prove that, for a fixed
$\lambda > 0,$ there are finitely many Conway groupoids for which the set of
morphisms does not contain all elements of the full alternating or symmetric
group.
