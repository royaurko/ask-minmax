An integer additive set-indexer is defined as an injective function
$f:V(G)\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0}$ such that the induced function $g_f:E(G)
\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0}$ defined by $g_f (uv) = f(u)+ f(v)$ is also
injective. An integer additive set-indexer is said to be $k$-uniform if
$|g_f(uv)|=k$ for all $u,v\in V(G)$. An integer additive set-indexer $f$ is
said to be a weak IASI if $|g_f(uv)|=max(|f(u)|,|f(v)|)$ for all $u,v\in V(G)$.
The sparing number of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of edges in $G$ with
singleton set-labels, so that $G$ admits a weak integer additive set-indexer.
In this paper, we study the admissibility of weak integer additive set-indexers
by certain graph classes and certain associated graphs of given graphs.
