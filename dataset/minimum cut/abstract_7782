We have discovered three globular clusters beyond the Holmberg radius in
Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys images of the gas-rich dark
matter dominated blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC2915. The clusters, all of which
start to resolve into stars, have M_{V606} = -8.9 to -9.8 mag, significantly
brighter than the peak of the luminosity function of Milky Way globular
clusters. Their colors suggest a metallicity [Fe/H] ~ -1.9 dex, typical of
metal-poor Galactic globular clusters. The specific frequency of clusters is at
a minimum normal, compared to spiral galaxies. However, since only a small
portion of the system has been surveyed it is more likely that the luminosity
and mass normalized cluster content is higher, like that seen in elliptical
galaxies and galaxy clusters. This suggests that NGC2915 resembles a key phase
in the early hierarchical assembly of galaxies - the epoch when much of the old
stellar population has formed, but little of the stellar disk. Depending on the
subsequent interaction history, such systems could go on to build-up larger
elliptical galaxies, evolve into normal spirals, or in rare circumstances
remain suspended in their development to become systems like NGC2915.
