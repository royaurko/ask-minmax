We analyze a conservative market model for the competition among economic
agents in a close society. A minimum dynamics ensures that the poorest agent
has a chance to improve its economic welfare. After a transient, the system
self-organizes into a critical state where the wealth distribution have a
minimum threshold, with almost no agent below this poverty line, also, very few
extremely rich agents are stable in time. Above the poverty line the
distribution follows an exponential behavior. The local solution exhibits a low
Gini index, while the mean field solution of the model generates a wealth
distribution similar to welfare states like Sweden.
