We present a new model for simulating exclusive final states in minimum-bias
collisions between hadrons. In a series of papers we have developed a Monte
Carlo model based on Mueller's dipole picture of BFKL-evolution, supplemented
with non-leading corrections, which has shown to be very successful in
describing inclusive and semi-inclusive observables in hadron collisions. In
this paper we present a further extension of this model to also describe
exclusive final states. This is a highly non-trivial extension, and we have
encountered many details that influence the description, and for which no
guidance from perturbative QCD could be found. Hence we have had to make many
choices based on semi-classical and phenomenological arguments. The end result
is a new event generator called DIPSY which can be used to simulate complete
minimum-bias non-diffractive hadronic collision events. Although the
description of data from the Tevatron and LHC is not quite as good as for
PYTHIA, the most advanced of the general purpose event generator programs for
these processes, our results are clearly competitive, and can be expected to
improve with careful tuning. In addition, as our model is very different from
conventional multiple scattering scenaria, the DIPSY program can be used to
gain deeper insight in the soft and semi-hard processes involved both in
hadronic and heavy ion collisions.
