The region of moduli space of string theories which is most likely to
describe the "real world" is where the string coupling is about unity and the
volume of extra compact dimensions is about the same size as the string volume.
Here we map the landscape of this "central" region in a model-independent way,
assuming only that the string coupling and compact volume moduli are chiral
superfields of N=1 supergravity in 4 dimensions, and requiring only widely
accepted conditions: that the supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scale is about the
weak scale and that the cosmological constant be of acceptably small magnitude.
We find that the superpotential has (in the supersymmetric limit) a fourth
order zero in the SUSY breaking direction. The potential near the minimum is
very steep in the SUSY preserving directions, and very flat in the SUSY
breaking direction, consequently the SUSY breaking field has a weak scale mass,
while other moduli are heavy. We also argue that there will be additional near
by minima with a large negative cosmological constant.
