For a continuous function $f \in \mathcal{C}([0,1])$, define the Vervaat
transform $V(f)(t):=f(\tau(f)+t \mod1)+f(1)1_{\{t+\tau(f) \geq
1\}}-f(\tau(f))$, where $\tau(f)$ corresponds to the first time at which the
minimum of $f$ is attained. Motivated by recent study of quantile transforms
for random walks and Brownian motion, we study the Vervaat transform of
Brownian motion and Brownian bridges with arbitary endpoints. When the two
endpoints of the bridge are not the same, the Vervaat transform is not
Markovian. We describe its distribution by path decompositions and study its
semimartingale properties. The expectation and variance of the Vervaat
transform of Brownian motion are also derived.
