We discuss a computational mechanism for the generation of a stationary dark
soliton, or black soliton, in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate using the
Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation for both attractive and repulsive interaction.
It is demonstrated that the black soliton with a "notch" in the probability
density with a zero at the minimum is a stationary eigenstate of the GP
equation and can be efficiently generated numerically as a nonlinear
continuation of the first vibrational excitation of the GP equation in both
attractive and repulsive cases in one and three dimensions for pure harmonic as
well as harmonic plus optical-lattice traps. We also demonstrate the stability
of this scheme under different perturbing forces.
