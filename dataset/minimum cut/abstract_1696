A new theory is proposed to interpret nuclear spin-lattice relaxation-time
(T_1_) measurements on the spin-1 quasi-one-dimensional Heisenberg
antiferromagnet Ni(C_2_H_8_N_2_)_2_NO_2_(ClO_4_) (NENP). While Sagi and Affleck
pioneeringly discussed this subject in terms of field-theoretical languages,
there is no theoretical attempt yet to explicitly simulate the novel
observations of 1/T_1_ reported by Fujiwara et al.. By means of modified spin
waves, we solve the minimum of 1/T_1_ as a function of an applied field,
pending for the past decade.
