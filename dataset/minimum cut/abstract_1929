Processes of direct cluster photodisintegration of 4He nucleus into p3H and
n3He channels are considered on the base of two-cluster potential models.
Intercluster interactions being in agreement with elastic scattering phase
shifts and characteristics of the bound state of a nucleus have, in some cases,
forbidden states. The scattering phase shifts and potentials are separated in
the channels with minimum spin on the base of Young schemes and isospin states.
