There are several known data structures that answer distance queries between
two arbitrary vertices in a planar graph. The tradeoff is among preprocessing
time, storage space and query time. In this paper we present three data
structures that answer such queries, each with its own advantage over previous
data structures. The first one improves the query time of data structures of
linear space. The second improves the preprocessing time of data structures
with a space bound of O(n^(4/3)) or higher while matching the best known query
time. The third data structure improves the query time for a similar range of
space bounds, at the expense of a longer preprocessing time. The techniques
that we use include modifying the parameters of planar graph decompositions,
combining the different advantages of existing data structures, and using the
Monge property for finding minimum elements of matrices.
