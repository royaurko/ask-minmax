The charged particle production in proton-proton collisions is studied with
the LHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of ${\sqrt{s} =7}$TeV in different
intervals of pseudorapidity $\eta$. The charged particles are reconstructed
close to the interaction region in the vertex detector, which provides high
reconstruction efficiency in the $\eta$ ranges $-2.5<\eta<-2.0$ and
$2.0<\eta<4.5$. The data were taken with a minimum bias trigger, only requiring
one or more reconstructed tracks in the vertex detector. By selecting an event
sample with at least one track with a transverse momentum greater than 1 GeV/c
a hard QCD subsample is investigated. Several event generators are compared
with the data; none are able to describe fully the multiplicity distributions
or the charged particle density distribution as a function of $\eta$. In
general, the models underestimate the charged particle production.
