In this paper, we present standard Johnson UBV photometry of the eclipsing
binary BD+36 3317 which is known as a member of Delta Lyrae (Stephenson 1)
cluster. We determined colors and brightness of the system, calculated E(B - V)
color excess. We discovered that the system shows total eclipse in secondary
minimum. Using this advantage, we found that the primary component of the
system has B9 - A0 spectral type. Although there is no published orbital
solution, we tried to estimate the physical properties of the system from
simultaneous analysis of UBV light curves with 2003 version of Wilson-Devinney
code. Then we considered photometric solution results together with
evolutionary models and estimated the masses of the components as M1 = 2.5 Msun
and M2 = 1.6 Msun. Those estimations gave the distance of the system as 353 pc.
Considering the uncertainties in distance estimation, resulting distance is in
agreement with the distance of Delta Lyrae cluster.
