A mechanism of the replication of proto-RNAs in oligomer world is proposed.
The replication is carried out by a minimum cycle which is sustained by a
ligase and a helicase. We expect that such a cycle actually worked in the
primordial soup and can be constructed in vitro. By computer simulation the
products of the replication acquires diversity and complexity. Such diversity
and complexity are the bases of the evolution.
