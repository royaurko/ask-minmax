We present an iteration method to derive exact rotation curves (RC) of spiral
galaxies from observed position-velocity diagrams (PVD), which comprises the
following procedure. An initial rotation curve, RC0, is adopted from an
observed PV diagram (PV0), obtained by any simple method such as the
peak-intensity method. Using this rotation curve and an observed radial
distribution of intensity (emissivity), we construct a simulated PV diagram
(PV1). The difference between a rotation curve obtained from this PV1 and the
original RC (e.g., difference between peak-intensity velocities) is used to
correct the initial RC to obtain a corrected rotation curve, RC1. This RC1 is
used to calculated another PVD (PV2) using the observed intensity distribution,
and to obtain the second iterated RC (RC2). This iteration is repeated until
PV$i$ converges to PV0, so that the differences between PV$i$ and PV0 becomes
minimum. Finally RC$i$ is adopted as the most reliable rotation curve. We apply
this method to some observed PVDs of nearby galaxies, and show that the
iteration successfully converges to give reliable rotation curves. We show that
the method is powerful to detect central massive objects.
