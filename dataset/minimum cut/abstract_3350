We propose a new non-parametric algorithm that can be implemented to study
and characterize stellar clusters. The scheme attempts to simultaneously
recover the stellar distribution function and the cluster potential by using
projected radii and velocity information about the cluster members. The pair of
these functions that is most consistent with the input data is detected by the
Metropolis algorithm. In this work, the cluster characteristics recovered by
CHASSIS are calibrated against the N-body realizations of two clusters, namely
Hyades and Arches. The cluster mass and line-of-sight projected velocity
dispersion profiles are correctly reproduced by the algorithm when the cluster
obeys the assumption used in the code, namely isotropy in phase space. The
results recovered by the code are shown to be insensitive to the choice of the
initial parameters. The results are also not influenced by increasing the
number of input data points as long as this number exceeds a minimum value
which is moderately low for an input data set that obeys the assumptions of
isotropy and sphericity.
