We use a randomised embedding method to prove that for all \alpha>0 any
sufficiently large oriented graph G with minimum in-degree and out-degree
\delta^+(G),\delta^-(G)\geq (3/8+\alpha)|G| contains every possible orientation
of a Hamilton cycle. This confirms a conjecture of H\"aggkvist and Thomason.
