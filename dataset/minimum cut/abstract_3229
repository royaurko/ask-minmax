Low-state spectrophotometry of the short-period polar EF Eridani (Porb=81
min) found the system at V=18.0 with no trace of the companion (Wheatley and
Ramsay 1998). We show that the lack of such spectral features implies that the
companion to the white dwarf in EF Eri has a spectral type later than M9 and is
either a transition object at the brink of hydrogen burning or a brown dwarf.
The optical low state spectrum indicates a temperature of the white dwarf of
Teff=9500+-500K. This is one of the coldest white dwarfs in cataclysmic
variables, implying a cooling age t_cool>=10e9 yrs or accretional heating at a
rate as given by gravitational radiation. The large age of the system excludes
a warm brown dwarf as companion. EF Eri has either just passed through the
period minimum of cataclysmic variable stars or has started mass transfer from
an old brown dwarf secondary.
