The most complete catalogue of nearby stars (Gliese and Jarheiss, 1991) has
been used to search for the stars whose photospheric thermal emission can be
detected by the future millimeter array ALMA. We found that 446 nearby stars
with spectral types ranging from A to M are detectable. A long-term astrometric
observation programme (> 10 yr) of these stars with ALMA (theoretical
astrometric precision = 0.1 milliarcsecond) would be sensitive to wobbles
caused by the gravitational pull of possible unseen planets. Such a programme
would probe minimum planetary masses as low as 0.1 Jupiter for an orbital
period of 10 years. We provide histogrammes of these minimum masses and of ALMA
integration times for these 446 ALMA stars.
