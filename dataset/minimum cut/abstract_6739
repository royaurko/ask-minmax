The Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER) is a rocket-borne absolute
photometry imaging and spectroscopy experiment optimized to detect signatures
of first-light galaxies present during reionization in the unresolved IR
background. CIBER-I consists of a wide-field two-color camera for fluctuation
measurements, a low-resolution absolute spectrometer for absolute EBL
measurements, and a narrow-band imaging spectrometer to measure and correct
scattered emission from the foreground zodiacal cloud. CIBER-I was successfully
flown on February 25th, 2009 and has one more planned flight in early 2010. We
propose, after several additional flights of CIBER-I, an improved CIBER-II
camera consisting of a wide-field 30 cm imager operating in 4 bands between 0.5
and 2.1 microns. It is designed for a high significance detection of unresolved
IR background fluctuations at the minimum level necessary for reionization.
With a FOV 50 to 2000 times largerthan existing IR instruments on satellites,
CIBER-II will carry out the definitive study to establish the surface density
of sources responsible for reionization.
