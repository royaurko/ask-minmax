Extensive interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations at 327 MHz obtained
between 1983 and 2009 clearly show a steady and significant drop in the
turbulence levels in the entire inner heliosphere starting from around ~1995.
We believe that this large-scale IPS signature, in the inner heliosphere,
coupled with the fact that solar polar fields have also been declining since
~1995, provide a consistent result showing that the buildup to the deepest
minimum in 100 years actually began more than a decade earlier.
