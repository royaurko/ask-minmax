Original paper: We revisit the probability that any two consecutive events in
a Poisson process N on [0,t] are separated by a time interval which is greater
than s(<t) (a particular scan statistic probability), and the closely related
probability (recently introduced by Todinov [8], who denotes it as p_MFFOP)
that before any event of N in [0,t] there exists an event-free interval greater
than s. Both probabilities admit simple explicit expressions, which, however,
become intractable for very large values of t/s. Our main objective is to
demonstrate that these probabilities can be approximated extremely well for
large values of t/s by some very tractable and attractive expressions
(actually, already for t larger than a few multiples of s).
  Erratum/Addendum: In this addendum, we further discuss numerical issues
concerning the computation of the probability denoted \phi(s,t;\lambda) in the
original paper. In particular, and most importantly, we correct the naive claim
made in the abstract of the original paper that the explicit expression of
\phi(s,t;\lambda) becomes intractable for very large values of t/s; rather, we
show that it may not be applicable for large values of \lambda*t.
