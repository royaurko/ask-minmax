Quadratic operators are used in transforming the model Hamiltonian (H) of one
correlated and dispersive band in an unique positive semidefinite form coopting
both the kinetic and interacting part of H. The expression is used in deducing
exact ground states which are minimum energy eigenstates only of the full
Hamiltonian. It is shown in this frame that at half filling, also dispersive
bands can provide ferromagnetism in exact terms by correlation effects .
