We address the forces exerted by the electromagnetic ?eld emitted by a planar
uctuating source on dielectric particles that have arose much interest because
of their recently shown magnetodielectric behavior. In this context, we analyze
as a particular case the modi?cation of the Casimir and Van der Waals forces.
We study the e?ect of the source coherence length as well as the interplay
between the force from the radiated ?eld and that from the electric and
magnetic dipoles induced on the particle. This allows a control of these
interactions as well as of the weight and interference e?ects between the ?elds
from both kinds of induced dipoles, in particular when large changes in their
di?erential scattering cross section occur due to Kerker minimum forward or
zero backward conditions; thus opening new paths to nanoparticle ensembling and
manipulation. The influence of surface waves of the source is also studied.
