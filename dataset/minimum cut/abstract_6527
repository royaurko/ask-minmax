We investigate the stability of asymptotically anti-de Sitter gravity coupled
to tachyonic scalar fields with mass at or slightly above the
Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. The boundary conditions in these ``designer
gravity'' theories are defined in terms of an arbitrary function W. Previous
work had suggested that the energy in designer gravity is bounded below if i) W
has a global minimum and ii) the scalar potential admits a superpotential P.
More recently, however, certain solutions were found (numerically) to violate
the proposed energy bound. We resolve the discrepancy by observing that a given
scalar potential can admit two possible branches of the corresponding
superpotential, P_{\pm}. When there is a P_- branch, we rigorously prove a
lower bound on the energy; the P_+ branch alone is not sufficient. Our
numerical investigations i) confirm this picture, ii) confirm other critical
aspects of the (complicated) proofs, and iii) suggest that the existence of P_-
may in fact be necessary (as well as sufficient) for the energy of a designer
gravity theory to be bounded below.
