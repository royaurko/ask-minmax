We study the one-loop potential of large-N QCD with adjoint Dirac fermions.
Space-time is a discretization of R^3 x S^1 where the compact direction
consists of a single lattice site. We use Wilson fermions with different values
of the quark mass m and set the lattice spacings in the compact and non-compact
directions to be a_t and a_s respectively. Extending the results of JHEP
0906:091,2009, we prove that if the ratio xi = a_s/a_t obeys 0<xi<2, then the
minimum of the one-loop lattice potential for one or more Dirac flavors is Z_N
symmetric at the chiral point. For xi=0 our formulas reduce to those obtained
in a continuum regularization of the R^3, and our proof holds in that case as
well. As we increase m from zero, we find a cascade of transitions where Z_N
breaks to Z_K. For very small masses, K ~ 1/(a_t m) >> 1, while for large
masses K ~ O(1). Despite certain UV sensitivities of the lattice one-loop
potential, this phase structure is similar to the one obtained in the continuum
works of Kovtun-Unsal-Yaffe, Myers-Ogilvie, and Hollowood-Myers. We explain the
physical origin of the cascade of transitions and its relation to the embedding
of space-time into color space.
