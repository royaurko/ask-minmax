We consider a system of interacting Brownian particles in R^d with a pairwise
potential, which is radially symmetric, of finite range and attains a unique
minimum when the distance of two particles becomes a>0. The asymptotic behavior
of the system is studied under the zero temperature limit from both microscopic
and macroscopic aspects. If the system is rigidly crystallized, namely if the
particles are rigidly arranged in an equal distance a, the crystallization is
kept under the evolution in macroscopic time scale.
 Then, assuming that the crystal has a definite limit shape under a macroscopic
spatial scaling, the translational and rotational motions of such shape are
characterized.
