We present the Monte Carlo generator tuning strategy followed, and the tools
developed, by the MCnet CEDAR project. We also present new tuning results for
the Pythia 6.4 event generator which are based on event shape and hadronisation
observables from e+e- experiments, and on underlying event and minimum bias
data from the Tevatron. Our new tunes are compared to existing tunes and to
Peter Skands' new "Perugia" tunes.
