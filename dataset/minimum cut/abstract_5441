The BVR photometric light curves of the eclipsing binary BD And were obtained
in 2008 and 2009. We estimated the mass ratio of the system as 0.97 and the
photometric solutions were derived. The results show that BD And is a detached
binary system, whose components have a little temperature difference of about
40 K. By analyzing photometric available light minimum times, we also derived
an update ephemeris and found for the first time a possible periodic
oscillation with an amplitude of 0.011 days and a period of 9.6 years. The
results indicate that the periodic oscillation could be caused by a third
component physically attached to the eclipsing binary. After removing the light
variations due to the eclipses and proximity effects, the light-curve
distortions are further explained by the pulsation of the primary component
with a dominant period of 1 day. In accordance with the position of the primary
component on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and its pulsation period, the
primary component of BD And could be an excellent gamma Doradus candidate. It
is rarely phenomenon that a component of the eclipsing binary system is a gamma
Doradus variable.
