The spectral efficiency of a representative uplink of a given length, in
interference-limited, spatially-distributed wireless networks with hexagonal
cells, simple power control, and multiantenna linear Minimum-Mean-Square-Error
receivers is found to approach an asymptote as the numbers of base-station
antennas N and wireless nodes go to infinity. An approximation for the
area-averaged spectral efficiency of a representative link (averaged over the
spatial base-station and mobile distributions), for Poisson distributed base
stations, is also provided. For large N, in the interference-limited regime,
the area-averaged spectral efficiency is primarily a function of the ratio of
the product of N and the ratio of base-station to wireless-node densities,
indicating that it is possible to scale such networks by linearly increasing
the product of the number of base-station antennas and the relative density of
base stations to wireless nodes, with wireless-node density. The results are
useful for designers of wireless systems with high inter-cell interference
because it provides simple expressions for spectral efficiency as a function of
tangible system parameters like base-station and wireless-node densities, and
number of antennas. These results were derived combining infinite random matrix
theory and stochastic geometry.
