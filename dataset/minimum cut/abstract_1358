We measure the oscillations of a standing wave of phonons in a Bose-Einstein
condensate, thus obtaining the dispersion relation. We present the technique of
short Bragg pulses, which stimulates the standing wave. The subsequent
oscillations are observed in situ. It is seen that the phonons undergo a 3D to
1D transition, when their wavelength becomes longer than the transverse radius
of the condensate. The 1D regime contains an inflection point in the dispersion
relation, which should decrease the superfluid critical velocity according to
the Landau criterion. The inflection point also represents a minimum in the
group velocity, although the minimum is not deep enough to result in a roton.
The 3D-1D transition also results in an increase in the lifetime of the
standing-wave oscillations, and a breakdown of the local density approximation.
In addition, the static structure factor is measured in the long-wavelength
regime. The measurements are enabled by the high sensitivity of the new
technique.
