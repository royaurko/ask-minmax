As a result of multiple mini-jet production, initial conditions of the QCD
plasma formed in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions may be inhomogeneous,
with large fluctuations of the local energy density (hot spots), and turbulent,
with a chaotic initial transverse velocity field. Assuming rapid local
thermalization, the evolution of such plasmas is computed using longitudinal
boost-invariant 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamics. We compare the evolution in case
that the speed of sound in the plasma is constant to one resulting from an
equation of state involving a strong first order transition, with a minimum of
the velocity of sound as a function of energy density. We find that azimuthally
asymmetric fluctuations and correlations of the transverse energy flow can
develop in both cases due to the initial inhomogeneities. Hot spots also
enhance significantly high-transverse momenta direct photon yields. In the case
with a phase transition, the hadronization surface evolves into an unusual
foam-like structure. Also in that case, we find that hadronization is
considerably delayed relative to the ideal gas case, just as previous studies
have found for homogeneous initial conditions. The time-delay signature of a
rapid cross-over transition region in the QCD equation of state (as observable
via meson interferometry) is thus found to be remarkably robust to
uncertainties in the initial conditions in heavy-ion reactions.
