Based on the time-dependent Gutzwiller approximation for the extended Hubbard
model we calculate the energy and momentum dependence of spin excitations for
striped ground states. Our starting point correctly reproduces the observed
doping dependence of the incommensurability in La-based cuprates and the
dispersion of magnetic modes in the insulating parent compound. This allows us
to make quantitative predictions for the doping evolution of the dispersion of
magnetic modes in the stripe phase including the energy and intensity of the
resonance peak as well as the velocity of the spin-wave like Goldstone mode. In
the underdoped regime $n_h<1/8$ we find a weak linear dependence of
$\omega_{res}$ on doping whereas the resonance energy significantly shifts to
higher values when the charge concentration in the stripes starts to deviate
from half-filling for $n_h>1/8$. The velocity $c$ is non-monotonous with a
minimum at 1/8 in coincidence with a well known anomaly in $T_c$. Our
calculations are in good agreement with available experimental data. We also
compare our results with analogous computations based on linear spin-wave
theory.
