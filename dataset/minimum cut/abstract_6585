The static Coulomb potential of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is calculated
in the presence of a strong magnetic field in the lowest Landau level (LLL)
approximation using two different methods. First, the vacuum expectation value
of the corresponding Wilson loop is calculated perturbatively in two different
regimes of dynamical mass $m_{dyn.}$, {\it i.e.}, $|{\mathbf{q}}_{\|}^{2}|\ll
m_{dyn.}^{2}\ll |eB|$ and $m_{dyn.}^{2}\ll |\mathbf{q}_{\|}^{2}|\ll|eB|$, where
$\mathbf{q}_{\|}$ is the longitudinal components of the momentum relative to
the external magnetic field $B$. The result is then compared with the static
potential arising from Born approximation. Both results coincide. Although the
arising potentials show different behavior in the aforementioned regimes, a
novel dependence on the angle $\theta$ between the particle-antiparticle's axis
and the direction of the magnetic field is observed. In the regime
$|{\mathbf{q}}_{\|}^{2}|\ll m_{dyn.}^{2}\ll |eB|$, for strong enough magnetic
field and depending on the angle $\theta$, a qualitative change occurs in the
Coulomb-like potential; Whereas for $\theta=0,\pi$ the potential is repulsive,
it exhibits a minimum for angles $\theta\in]0,\pi[$.
