For any graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset $S\subseteq V$ $dominates$ $G$ if all
vertices are contained in the closed neighborhood of $S$, that is $N[S]=V$. The
minimum cardinality over all such $S$ is called the domination number, written
$\gamma(G)$. In 1963, V.G. Vizing conjectured that $\gamma(G \square H) \geq
\gamma(G)\gamma(H)$ where $\square$ stands for the Cartesian product of graphs.
In this note, we prove that if $\left|G\right|\geq \gamma(G)\gamma(H)$ and
$\left|H\right|\geq \gamma(G)\gamma(H)$, then the conjecture holds. This result
quickly implies Vizing's conjecture for almost all pairs of graphs $G,H$ with
$\left|G\right|\geq \left|H\right|$, satisfying $\left|G\right|\leq
q^{\frac{\left|H\right|}{\log_q\left|H\right|}}$ for $q=\frac{1}{1-p}$ and $p$
the edge probability of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph.
