In this paper, joint transceiver design for dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF)
MIMO relay systems with Gaussian distributed channel estimation errors in both
two hops is investigated. Due to the fact that various linear transceiver
designs can be transformed to a weighted linear minimum mean-square-error
(LMMSE) transceiver design with specific weighting matrices, weighted mean
square error (MSE) is chosen as the performance metric. Precoder matrix at
source, forwarding matrix at relay and equalizer matrix at destination are
jointly designed with channel estimation errors taken care of by Bayesian
philosophy. Several existing algorithms are found to be special cases of the
proposed solution. The performance advantage of the proposed robust design is
demonstrated by the simulation results.
