A topological approach to stratification learning is developed for point
cloud data drawn from a stratified space. Given such data, our objective is to
infer which points belong to the same strata. First we define a multi-scale
notion of a stratified space, giving a stratification for each radius level. We
then use methods derived from kernel and cokernel persistent homology to
cluster the data points into different strata, and we prove a result which
guarantees the correctness of our clustering, given certain topological
conditions; some geometric intuition for these topological conditions is also
provided. Our correctness result is then given a probabilistic flavor: we give
bounds on the minimum number of sample points required to infer, with
probability, which points belong to the same strata. Finally, we give an
explicit algorithm for the clustering, prove its correctness, and apply it to
some simulated data.
