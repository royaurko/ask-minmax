We present work in progress concerning spectral synthesis calculations of the
solar UV/EUV in spherical symmetry carried out with the Solar Radiation
Physical Modeling (SRPM) project. We compare the synthetic irradiance spectrum
for the quiet Sun with the recent solar minimum spectrum taken with the EVE
rocket instrument. The good agreement of the synthetic spectrum with the
observation shows that the employed atmosphere structures are suitable for
irradiance calculations.
