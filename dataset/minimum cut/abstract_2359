Use of inclusive MT2 distribution for sparticle mass determination is
discussed. We define new parameters MT2(min) and MT2mod(min), which are a kind
of minimum of sub-systerm MT2 values. Their endpoints are less affected by
initial state radiations. We demonstrate that both masses of squark and gluino
can be extracted from the endpoints of the distributions in the wide region of
parameter space expected in CMSSM. We also present a comparison with MTGen
distributions.
