We consider the effect of the presence of a hypermagnetic field at the
electroweak phase transition. Screening of the Z-component inside a bubble of
the broken phase delays the phase transition and makes it stronger first order.
We show that the sphaleron constraint can be evaded for m_H up to 100 GeV if a
B_Y\gsim 0.3 T^2 exists at the time of the EW phase transition, thus
resurrecting the possibility for baryogenesis within the minimal standard model
(provided enough CP violation can be obtained). We estimate that for m_H\gsim
100 GeV the Higgs condendsate behaves like a type II superconductor with
Z-vortices penetrating the bubble. Also, for such high Higgs masses the minimum
B_Y field required for a strong first order phase transition is large enough to
render the W-field unstable towards forming a condensate which changes the
simple picture of the symmetry breaking.
