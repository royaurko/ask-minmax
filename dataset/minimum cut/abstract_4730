We show that the warped de Sitter compactifications are possible under
certain conditions in D-dimensional gravitational theory coupled to a dilaton,
a form field strength, and a cosmological constant. We find that the solutions
of field equations give de Sitter spacetime with the warped structure, and
discuss cosmological models directly obtained from these solutions. We also
construct a cosmological model in the lower-dimensional effective theory. If
there is a field strength having non-vanishing components along the internal
space, the moduli can be fixed at the minimum of the effective potential where
a de Sitter vacuum can be obtained.
