The {\it sigma chromatic number} of a graph $G$, denoted by $\sigma(G)$, is
the minimum number $k$ that the vertices can be partitioned into $k$ disjoint
sets $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ such that for every two adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$
there is an index $i$ that $u$ and $v$ have different numbers of neighbors in
$V_i$.
  We show that, it is $ \mathbf{NP} $-complete to decide for a given 3-regular
graph $G$, whether $ \sigma(G)=2$. Also, we prove that for every $k\geq 3$, it
is {\bf NP}-complete to decide whether $\sigma(G)= k$ for a given graph $G$.
Furthermore, for planar $3$-regular graphs with $\sigma=2$, we show that the
problem of minimizing the size of a set is $ \mathbf{NP} $-hard.
