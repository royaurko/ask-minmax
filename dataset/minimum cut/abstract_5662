Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) promises improved spectral
efficiency, coverage, and range, compared to conventional (small-scale) MIMO
wireless systems. Unfortunately, these benefits come at the cost of
significantly increased computational complexity, especially for systems with
realistic antenna configurations. To reduce the complexity of data detection
(in the uplink) and precoding (in the downlink) in massive MIMO systems, we
propose to use conjugate gradient (CG) methods. While precoding using CG is
rather straightforward, soft-output minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection
requires the computation of the post-equalization
signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR). To enable CG for soft-output
detection, we propose a novel way of computing the SINR directly within the CG
algorithm at low complexity. We investigate the performance/complexity
trade-offs associated with CG-based soft-output detection and precoding, and we
compare it to exact and approximate methods. Our results reveal that the
proposed method outperforms existing algorithms for massive MIMO systems with
realistic antenna configurations.
