A detailed investigation of electronic-transport properties of Nd0.5Sr0.5CoO3
has been carried out as a function of grain size ranging from micrometer order
down to an average size of 28 nm. Interestingly, we observe a size induced
metal-insulator transition in the lowest grain size sample while the bulk-like
sample is metallic in the whole measured temperature regime. An analysis of the
temperature dependent resistivity in the metallic regime reveals that the
electron-electron interaction is the dominating mechanism while other processes
like electron-magnon and electron-phonon scatterings are also likely to be
present. The fascinating observation of enhanced low temperature upturn and
minimum in resistivity on reduction of grain size is found due to
electron-electron interaction (quantum interference effect). This effect is
attributed to enhanced disorder on reduction of grain size. Interestingly, we
observed a cross over from positive to negative magnetoresistance in the low
temperature regime as the grain size is reduced. This observed sign reversal is
attributed to enhanced phase separation on decreasing the grain size of the
cobaltite.
