We consider various data-analysis queries on two-dimensional points. We give
new space/time tradeoffs over previous work on geometric queries such as
dominance and rectangle visibility, and on semigroup and group queries such as
sum, average, variance, minimum and maximum. We also introduce new solutions to
queries less frequently considered in the literature such as two-dimensional
quantiles, majorities, successor/predecessor, mode, and various top-$k$
queries, considering static and dynamic scenarios.
