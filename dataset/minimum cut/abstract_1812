Gluon and quark contributions to the thermodynamic potential (free energy) of
a (2+1)-dimensional QCD model at finite temperature in the background of a
constant homogeneous chromomagnetic field H combined with A_0 condensate are
calculated. The role of the tachyonic mode in the gluon energy spectrum is
discussed. A possibility of the free energy global minimum generation at
nonzero values of H and A_0 condensates is investigated.
