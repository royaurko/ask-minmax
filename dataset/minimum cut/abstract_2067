A mechanism of extraction of tubular membranes from a lipid vesicle is
presented. A concentration gradient of anchoring amphiphilic polymers generates
tubes from bud-like vesicle protrusions. We explain this mechanism in the
framework of the Canham-Helfrich model. The energy profile is analytically
calculated and a tube with a fixed length, corresponding to an energy minimum,
is obtained in a certain regime of parameters. Further, using a phase-field
model, we corroborate these results numerically. We obtain the growth of tubes
when a polymer source is added, and the bud-like shape after removal of the
polymer source, in accordance with recent experimental results.
