The variabile star Delta Scorpii is in conjunction with the Sun at the end of
November each year. We studied its magnitude by averaging the observations of
28 Nov - 1 Dec from 1996 to 2013 using the coronograph LASCO C3 on-board the
SOHO Satellite and we extended of four years, i.e. 25 % of the total light
curve, back to 1996, with respect to the present AAVSO dataset on this star.
The 0.2 magnitude scatters of the single measurements have been studied and the
sources of such disturbances are vignetting and diffraction patterns from the
coronograph. The new data collected on Delta Scorpii show its minimum at mv=2.5
magnitudes for 1996 and 1997, confirming the values observed during the minimum
of 2009, and the main periodicity of 11 years in the stellar variability.
