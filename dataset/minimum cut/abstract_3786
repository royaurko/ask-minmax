The structure of gauged R supergravity Lagrangians is reviewed, and we
consider models with a hidden sector plus light fields of the MSSM. A simple
potential for the hidden sector is presented which has a global minimum with
zero cosmological constant and spontaneously broken SUSY and R-symmetry. The
$\rm U(1)_R$ vector multiplet acquires a Planck scale mass through the Higgs
mechanism, and it decouples at low energy. Due to very interesting
cancellations, the $\rm U(1)_R$ D-terms also drop out at low energy. Thus no
direct effects of the gauging of R-symmetry remain in the low energy effective
Lagrangian, and this result is model independent, requiring only that
R-symmetry be broken at the Planck scale and $<D> = 0$, where $D$ is the
auxiliary field of the $\rm U(1)_R$ vector multiplet. The low energy theory is
fairly conventional with soft SUSY breaking terms for the MSSM fields. As a
remnant of the gauging of R-symmetry, it also contains light fields, some
required to cancel R-anomalies and others from the hidden sector.
