The hydration phase diagram for sodium cobalt oxyhydrate, Na0.3CoO2*yH2O
(y=0, 0.6, 1.3), was determined as a function of relative humidity at 298K. It
is found that greater than 75% relative humidity is needed for complete
hydration of anhydrous Na0.3CoO2 to the superconducting phase Na0.3CoO2*1.3H2O.
Dehydration studies show that a minimum of 43% relative humidity is needed to
maintain the stability of the fully hydrated superconducting phase. The
intermediate hydrate, Na0.3CoO2*0.6H2O, is stable between 10% and 50% relative
humidity on hydration, and 35% to 0% relative humidity on dehydration.
