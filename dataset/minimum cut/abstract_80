Flat directions in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) can
become unstable due to radiative corrections, and the global minimum of the
(zero temperature) potential can lie at large values of the squark and/or
slepton fields. Here we show that, in inflationary models of early cosmology,
the universe is very likely to be in the domain of attraction of this global
minimum at the end of inflation. While the minimum at the origin of field space
is global at sufficiently high temperatures, depending on details of the model,
the universe may be trapped in the non-zero minimum until it becomes the global
minimum at low temperatures. Parameter values leading to this scenario are
therefore ruled out.
