We investigate the RPA normal-mode coordinates in the pairing-plus-quadrupole
model, with an eye on simplifying the application of large amplitude collective
motion techniques. At the Hartree-Bogoliubov minimum, the RPA modes are exactly
the cranking operators of the collective coordinate approach. We examine the
possibility of representing the self-consistent cranking operator by linear
combinations of a limited number of one-body operators. We study the Sm nuclei
as an example, and find that such representations exist in terms of operators
that are state-dependent in a characteristic manner.
