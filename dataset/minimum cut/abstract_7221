A new architecture called integer-forcing (IF) linear receiver has been
recently proposed for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels,
wherein an appropriate integer linear combination of the received symbols has
to be computed as a part of the decoding process. In this paper, we propose a
method based on Hermite-Korkine-Zolotareff (HKZ) and Minkowski lattice basis
reduction algorithms to obtain the integer coefficients for the IF receiver. We
show that the proposed method provides a lower bound on the ergodic rate, and
achieves the full receive diversity. Suitability of complex
Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) lattice reduction algorithm (CLLL) to solve the
problem is also investigated. Furthermore, we establish the connection between
the proposed IF linear receivers and lattice reduction-aided MIMO detectors
(with equivalent complexity), and point out the advantages of the former class
of receivers over the latter. For the $2 \times 2$ and $4\times 4$ MIMO
channels, we compare the coded-block error rate and bit error rate of the
proposed approach with that of other linear receivers. Simulation results show
that the proposed approach outperforms the zero-forcing (ZF) receiver, minimum
mean square error (MMSE) receiver, and the lattice reduction-aided MIMO
detectors.
