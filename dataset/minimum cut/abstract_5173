Using the finite-size scaling, we have investigated the percolation phase
transitions of evolving random networks under a generalized Achlioptas process
(GAP). During this GAP, the edge with minimum product of two connecting cluster
sizes is taken with a probability $p$ from two randomly chosen edges. This
model becomes the Erd\H os-R\'enyi network at $p=0.5$ and the random network
under the Achlioptas process at $p=1$. Using both the fixed point of $s_2/s_1$
and the straight line of $\ln s_1$, where $s_1$ and $s_2$ are the reduced sizes
of the largest and the second largest cluster, we demonstrate that the phase
transitions of this model are continuous for $0.5 \le p \le 1$. From the slopes
of $\ln s_1$ and $\ln (s_2/s_1)'$ at the critical point we get the critical
exponents $\beta$ and $\nu$, which depend on $p$. Therefore the universality
class of this model should be characterized by $p$ also.
