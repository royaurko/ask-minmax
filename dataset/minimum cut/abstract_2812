In this paper we present a two-field inflation model, which distinguishes
itself with a non-canonical kinetic lagrangian and comes from the large volume
approach to the moduli stabilization in flux compactification of type IIB
superstring on a Calabi-Yau orientifold of $h^{(1,2)} > h^{(1,1)}\geq 4$. The
K\"ahler moduli are classified as volume modulus, heavy moduli and two light
moduli. The axion-dilaton, complex structure moduli and all heavy K\"ahler
moduli including the volume modulus are frozen by nonperturbatively corrected
flux superpotential and the $\alpha^\prime$-corrected K\"ahler potential in the
large volume limit. The minimum of the scalar potential at which the heavy
moduli are stabilized provides the dominant potential energy for the survived
light K\"ahler moduli. We consider a simplified case where the axionic
components in the light K\"ahler moduli are further stabilized at the potential
minimum and only the geometrical components are taken as the scalar fields to
drive an assisted-like inflation. For a certain range of moduli stabilization
parameters and inflation initial conditions, we obtain a nearly flat power
spectrum of the curvature perturbation, with $n_s\approx 0.96$ at Hubble-exit,
and an inflationary energy scale of $3 \times 10^{14}$ GeV. In our model,
significant correlation exists between the curvature and isocurvature
perturbations on super-Hubble scales so that at the end of inflation a great
deal of the curvature power spectrum originates from this correlation.
