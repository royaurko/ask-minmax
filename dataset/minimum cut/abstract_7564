The neutrino minimal Standard Model ({\nu}MSM) is the minimum extension of
the standard model. In this model, the Dodelson-Widrow mechanism (DW) produces
the keV sterile neutrino dark matter, the degenerate GeV heavy Majorana
neutrinos leads to the leptogenesis. However, the DW has been excluded from
Lyman-{\alpha} bounds and X-ray constraints. A scenario, where the sterile
neutrino DM is generated by thermal freeze-in mechanism via a singlet scalar
has been proposed and it is possible to evade these bounds. In this paper, we
consider the Higgs sector extension of the {\nu}MSM to improve dark matter
sectors and leptogenesis scenarios with focusing on the thermal freeze-in
production mechanism. We discuss various thermal freeze-in production scenarios
of the keV-MeV sterile neutrino DM with a singlet scalar, and reinvestigate the
Lyman-{\alpha} bounds and the X-rays constraints on the parameter regions.
Furthermore, we propose thermal freeze-in leptogenesis scenarios in the
extended {\nu}MSM. The singlet scalar needs to be TeV scale in order to
generate the observed DM relic density or baryon number density with the
thermal freeze-in production mechanism.
