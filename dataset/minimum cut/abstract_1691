Ordered states on spheres require a minimum number of topological defects.
For the case of crystalline order, triangular lattices must be interrupted by
an array of at least 12 five-fold disclination defects, typically sitting at
the vertices of an icosahedron. For R>>a, where R is the sphere radius and a
the particle spacing, the energy associated with these defects is very large.
This energy can be lowered, however, either by buckling, as appears to be the
case for large viruses, or by introducing unusual finite length grain boundary
scars. The latter have been observed recently for colloidal particles adsorbed
onto water droplets in oil.
