We discuss a simple Casimir-type device for which the rotational energy
reaches its global minimum when the device rotates about a certain axis rather
than remains static. This unusual property is a direct consequence of the fact
that the moment of inertia of zero-point vacuum fluctuations is a negative
quantity (the rotational vacuum effect). Moreover, the device does not produce
any work despite the fact that its equilibrium ground state corresponds to a
permanent rotation. Counterintuitively, the device has no internally moving
mechanical parts while its very existence is consistent with the laws of
thermodynamics. We point out that such devices may possibly be constructed
using carbon nanotubes. We call this "zero-point-driven" device as the
perpetuum mobile of the fourth kind.
