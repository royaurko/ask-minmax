We present a summary of work done on dense hadronic matter, based on the
Skyrme model, which provides a unified approach to high density, valid in the
large $N_c$ limit. In our picture, dense hadronic matter is described by the
{\em classical} soliton configuration with minimum energy for the given baryon
number density. By incorporating the meson fluctuations on such ground state we
obtain an effective Lagrangian for meson dynamics in a dense medium. Our
starting point has been the Skyrme model defined in terms of pions, thereafter
we have extended and improved the model by incorporating other degrees of
freedom such as dilaton, kaons and vector mesons.
