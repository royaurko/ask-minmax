We consider supersymmetric extensions of the standard model with two pairs of
Higgs doublets. We study the possibility that CP violation is generated
spontaneously in the scalar sector via vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the
Higgs fields. Using a simple geometrical interpretation of the minimum
conditions we prove that the minimum of the tree-level scalar potential for
these models is allways real. We show that complex VEVs can appear once
radiative corrections and/or explicit {\it soft} CP violating terms are added
to the effective potential.
