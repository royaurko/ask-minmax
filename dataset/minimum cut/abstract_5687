We investigate the properties of 367 ultra-short period binary candidates
selected from 31,000 sources recently identified from Catalina Surveys data.
Based on light curve morphology, along with WISE, SDSS and GALEX multi-colour
photometry, we identify two distinct groups of binaries with periods below the
0.22 day contact binary minimum. In contrast to most recent work, we
spectroscopically confirm the existence of M-dwarf+M-dwarf contact binary
systems. By measuring the radial velocity variations for five of the
shortest-period systems, we find examples of rare cool-white dwarf+M-dwarf
binaries. Only a few such systems are currently known. Unlike warmer white
dwarf systems, their UV flux and their optical colours and spectra are
dominated by the M-dwarf companion. We contrast our discoveries with previous
photometrically-selected ultra-short period contact binary candidates, and
highlight the ongoing need for confirmation using spectra and associated radial
velocity measurements. Overall, our analysis increases the number of
ultra-short period contact binary candidates by more than an order of
magnitude.
