We consider surfaces of class $C^1$ in the $3$-dimensional sub-Riemannian
Heisenberg group ${\mathbb H}^1$. Assuming the surface is area-stationary,
i.e., a critical point of the sub-Riemannian perimeter under compactly
supported variations, we show that its regular part is foliated by horizontal
straight lines. In case the surface is complete and oriented, without singular
points, and stable, i.e., a second order minimum of perimeter, we prove that
the surface must be a vertical plane. This implies the following Bernstein type
result: a complete locally area-minimizing intrinsic graph of a $C^1$ function
in ${\mathbb H}^1$ is a vertical plane.
