We present new high-resolution ($\sim$0\farcs09) $H$-band imaging
observations of the circumstellar disk around the T Tauri star SU Aur. Our
observations with Subaru-HiCIAO have revealed the presence of scattered light
as close as 0\farcs15 ($\sim$20 AU) to the star. Within our image, we identify
bright emission associated with a disk with a minimum radius of $\sim$90 AU, an
inclination of $\sim$35\degr from the plane of the sky, and an approximate P.A.
of 15\degr for the major axis. We find a brightness asymmetry between the
northern and southern sides of the disk due to a non-axisymmetric disk
structure. We also identify a pair of asymmetric tail structures extending east
and west from the disk. The western tail extends at least 2\farcs5 (350 AU)
from the star, and is probably associated with a reflection nebula previously
observed at optical and near-IR wavelengths. The eastern tail extends at least
1\arcsec (140 AU) at the present signal-to-noise. These tails are likely due to
an encounter with an unseen brown dwarf, but our results do not exclude the
explanation that these tails are outflow cavities or jets.
