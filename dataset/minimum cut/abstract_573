In the SU(2)_{L} x U(1)_{Y} standard electroweak theory coupled with the
Einstein gravity, new topological configurations naturally emerge, if the
spatial section of the universe is globally a three-sphere(S^3) with a small
radius. The SU(2)_L gauge fields and Higgs fields wrap the space nontrivially,
residing at or near a local minimum of the potential. As the universe expands,
however, the shape of the potential rapidly changes and the local minimum
eventually disappears. The fields then start to roll down towards the absolute
minimum. In the absence of the U(1)_Y gauge interaction the resulting space is
a homogeneous and isotropic S^3, but the U(1)_Y gauge interaction necessarily
induces anisotropy while preserving the homogeneity of the space. Large
magnetic fields are generically produced over a substantial period of the
rolling-over transition. The magnetic field configuration is characterized by
the Hopf map.
