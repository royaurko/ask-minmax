We study the minimization of potential enstrophy at fixed circulation and
energy in an oceanic basin with arbitrary topography. For illustration, we
consider a rectangular basin and a linear topography h=by which represents
either a real bottom topography or the beta-effect appropriate to oceanic
situations. Our minimum enstrophy principle is motivated by different arguments
of statistical mechanics reviewed in the article. It leads to steady states of
the quasigeostrophic (QG) equations characterized by a linear relationship
between potential vorticity q and stream function psi. For low values of the
energy, we recover Fofonoff flows [J. Mar. Res. 13, 254 (1954)] that display a
strong westward jet. For large values of the energy, we obtain geometry induced
phase transitions between monopoles and dipoles similar to those found by
Chavanis and Sommeria [J. Fluid Mech. 314, 267 (1996)] in the absence of
topography. In the presence of topography, we recover and confirm the results
obtained by Venaille and Bouchet [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 104501 (2009)] using a
different formalism. In addition, we introduce relaxation equations towards
minimum potential enstrophy states and perform numerical simulations to
illustrate the phase transitions in a rectangular oceanic basin with linear
topography (or beta-effect).
