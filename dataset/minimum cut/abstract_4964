The classical Cauchy-Davenport theorem implies the lower bound n+1 for the
number of distinct subsums that can be formed from a sequence of n elements of
the cyclic group Z_p (when p is prime and n<p). We generalize this theorem to a
conjecture for the minimum number of distinct subsums that can be formed from
elements of a multiset in (Z_p)^m; the conjecture is expected to be valid for
multisets that are not "wasteful" by having too many elements in nontrivial
subgroups. We prove this conjecture in (Z_p)^2 for multisets of size p+k, when
k is not too large in terms of p.
