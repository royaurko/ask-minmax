It was shown in a number of papers that the gravitational potential
calculated by using the propagator that follows from the minimum-length
deformed QFT implies the existence of black-hole remnants of the order of the
Planck-mass. Here we examine the behaviour of the potential that follows from
the Planck-length deformed QFT, which in general does not entail the concept of
the minimum length, and analyse whether the existence of the black hole
remnants is intimately related to the concept of the minimum length or not. The
answer to this question turns out to be negative.
