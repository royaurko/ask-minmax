We present new limits on low mass accelerator-produced point-like Dirac
magnetic monopoles trapped and bound in matter surrounding the D\O collision
region of the Tevatron at Fermilab (experiment E-882). In the context of a
Drell-Yan mechanism, we obtain cross section limits for the production of
monopoles with magnetic charge values of 1, 2, 3, and 6 times the minimum Dirac
charge of the order of picobarns, some hundred times smaller than found in
similar previous Fermilab searches. Mass limits inferred from these cross
section limits are presented.
