We report an enhancement of the decay rate of the survival probability when
non-local initial conditions in position space are considered in the Quantum
Walk on the line. It is shown how this interference effect can be understood
analytically by using previously derived results. Within a restricted position
subspace, the enhanced decay is correlated with a maximum asymptotic
entanglement level while the normal decay rate corresponds to initial relative
phases associated to a minimum entanglement level.
