Shimada and Zhang studied the existence of polarizations on some
supersingular $K3$ surfaces by reducing the existence of the polarizations to
that of ternary $[12,5]$ codes satisfying certain conditions. In this note, we
give a classification of ternary $[12,5]$ codes satisfying the conditions. To
do this, ternary $[10,5]$ codes are classified for minimum weights $3$ and $4$.
