Pseudocodewords of q-ary LDPC codes are examined and the weight of a
pseudocodeword on the q-ary symmetric channel is defined. The weight definition
of a pseudocodeword on the AWGN channel is also extended to two-dimensional
q-ary modulation such as q-PAM and q-PSK. The tree-based lower bounds on the
minimum pseudocodeword weight are shown to also hold for q-ary LDPC codes on
these channels.
