CF Tau is now known to be an eclipsing triple star with relatively deep total
and annular eclipses. New light and radial velocity curves as well as new times
of minima were obtained and used for further modeling of the system. Very
accurate (better than 0.9%) masses and radii of the eclipsing pair are
determined from analysis of the two new light curves, the radial velocity
curve, and the times of minimum light. The mass and luminosity of the distant
third component is accurately determined as well. Theoretical models of the
detached, evolved eclipsing pair match the observed absolute properties of the
stars at an age of about 4.3 Gy and [Fe/H] = -0.14.
