Current experiments collecting high statistics in ultra-high energy cosmic
rays (UHECRs) are opening a new window on the universe facing the possibility
to perform UHECR astronomy. Here we discuss a large scale structure (LSS) model
for the UHECR origin for which we evaluate the expected large scale anisotropy
in the UHECR arrival distribution. Employing the IRAS PSCz catalogue as tracer
of the LSS, we derive the minimum statistics needed to reject or assess the
correlation of the UHECRs with the baryonic distribution in the universe, in
particular providing a forecast for the Auger experiment.
