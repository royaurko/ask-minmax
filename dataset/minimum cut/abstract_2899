Graph pebbling is a network optimization model for transporting discrete
resources that are consumed in transit: the movement of two pebbles across an
edge consumes one of the pebbles. The pebbling number of a graph is the fewest
number of pebbles t so that, from any initial configuration of t pebbles on its
vertices, one can place a pebble on any given target vertex via such pebbling
steps. It is known that deciding if a given configuration on a particular graph
can reach a specified target is NP-complete, even for diameter two graphs, and
that deciding if the pebbling number has a prescribed upper bound is
\Pi_2^P-complete.
  On the other hand, for many families of graphs there are formulas or
polynomial algorithms for computing pebbling numbers; for example, complete
graphs, products of paths (including cubes), trees, cycles, diameter two
graphs, and more. Moreover, graphs having minimum pebbling number are called
Class 0, and many contributors have studied which graphs are Class 0 and what graph
properties guarantee it, with no characterization in sight.
  In this paper we investigate an important family of diameter three chordal
graphs called split graphs; graphs whose vertex set can be partitioned into a
clique and an independent set. We provide a formula for the pebbling number of
a split graph, along with an algorithm for calculating it that runs in
O(n^\beta) time, where \beta=2\omega/(\omega+1)\cong 1.41 and \omega\cong 2.376
is the exponent of matrix multiplication. Furthermore we determine that all
split graphs with minimum degree at least 3 are Class 0.
