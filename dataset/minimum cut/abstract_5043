Numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis have been carried out
to study the percolation behavior of straight rigid rods of length $k$
($k$-mers) on two-dimensional square lattices. The $k$-mers, containing $k$
identical units (each one occupying a lattice site), were adsorbed at
equilibrium on the lattice. The process was monitored by following the
probability $R_{L,k}(\theta)$ that a lattice composed of $L \times L$ sites
percolates at a concentration $\theta$ of sites occupied by particles of size
$k$. A nonmonotonic size dependence was observed for the percolation threshold,
which decreases for small particles sizes, goes through a minimum, and finally
asymptotically converges towards a definite value for large segments. This
striking behavior has been interpreted as a consequence of the
isotropic-nematic phase transition occurring in the system for large values of
$k$. Finally, the universality class of the model was found to be the same as
for the random percolation model.
