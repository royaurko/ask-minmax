Percolation in an information-theoretically secure graph is considered where
both the legitimate and the eavesdropper nodes are distributed as Poisson point
processes. For both the path-loss and the path-loss plus fading model, upper
and lower bounds on the minimum density of the legitimate nodes (as a function
of the density of the eavesdropper nodes) required for non-zero probability of
having an unbounded cluster are derived. The lower bound is universal in
nature, i.e. the constant does not depend on the density of the eavesdropper
nodes.
