Heterogeneous Distributed Storage Systems (DSS) are close to real world
applications for data storage. Internet caching system and peer-to-peer storage
clouds are the examples of such DSS. In this work, we calculate the capacity
formula for such systems where each node store different number of packets and
each having a different repair bandwidth (node can be repaired by contacting a
specific set of nodes). The tradeoff curve between storage and repair bandwidth
is studied for such heterogeneous DSS. By analyzing the capacity formula new
minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) and minimum storage regenerating (MBR)
points are obtained on the curve. It is shown that in some cases these are
better than the homogeneous DSS.
