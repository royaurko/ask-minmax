This paper attempts to find the most accurate classification method among
parallelepiped, minimum distance and chain methods. Moreover, this study also
challenges to find the suitable combination of bands, which can lead to better
results in case combinations of bands occur. After comparing these three
methods, the chain method over perform the other methods with 79% overall
accuracy. Hence, it is more accurate than minimum distance with 67% and
parallelepiped with 65%. On the other hand, based on bands features, and also
by combining several researchers' findings, a table was created which includes
the main objects on the land and the suitable combination of the bands for
accurately detecting of landcover objects. During this process, it was observed
that band 4 (out of 7 bands of Landsat 5TM) is the band, which can be used for
increasing the accuracy of the combined bands in detecting objects on the land.
