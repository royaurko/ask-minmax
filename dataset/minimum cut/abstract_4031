Given a configuration of pebbles on the vertices of a connected graph G, a
pebbling move is defined as the removal of two pebbles from some vertex, and
the placement of one of these on an adjacent vertex. We introduce the notion of
domination cover pebbling, obtained by combining graph cover pebbling with the
theory of domination in graphs. The domination cover pebbling number, psi(G),
of a graph G is the minimum number of pebbles that must be placed on V(G) such
that after a sequence of pebbling moves, the set of vertices with pebbles forms
a dominating set of G, regardless of the initial configuration of pebbles. We
discuss basic results and determine psi(G) for paths, cycles and complete
binary trees.
