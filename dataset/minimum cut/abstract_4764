In the context of Type IIB compactified on a large volume Swiss-Cheese
orientifold in the presence of a mobile space-time filling D3-brane and stacks
of fluxed D7-branes wrapping the "big" divisor Sigma_B of a Swiss-Cheese Calabi
Yau in WCP^4 [1,1,1,6,9], we explore various implications of moduli dynamics
and discuss their couplings and decay into MSSM (-like) matter fields early in
the history of universe to reach thermal equilibrium. Like finite temperature
effects in O'KKLT, we observe that the local minimum of zero-temperature
effective scalar potential is stable against any finite temperature corrections
(up to two-loops) in large volume scenarios as well. Also, we find that moduli
are heavy enough to avoid any cosmological moduli problem.
