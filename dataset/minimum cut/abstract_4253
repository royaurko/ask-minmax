Neutral spin texture ST excitations at nu=1/3 are directly observed for the
first time by resonant inelastic light scattering. They are determined to
involve two simultaneous spin- flips. At low magnetic fields, the ST energy is
below that of the magneto-roton minimum. With increasing in-plane magnetic
field these modes energies cross at a critical ratio of the Zeeman and Coulomb
energies of eta_c=0.020 +- 0.001. Surprisingly, the intensity of the ST mode
grows with temperature in the range in which the magneto-roton modes collapse.
The temperature dependence is interpreted in terms of a competition between
coexisting phases supporting different excitations. We consider the role of the
ST excitations in activated transport at nu=1/3.
