Extending the knowledge about the properties of solar cycles into the past is
essential for understanding the solar dynamo. This paper aims at estimating
areas of sunspots observed by Schwabe in 1825-1867 and at calculating the tilt
angles of sunspot groups. The sunspot sizes in Schwabe's drawings are not to
scale and need to be converted into physical sunspot areas. We employed a
statistical approach assuming that the area distribution of sunspots was the
same in the 19th century as it was in the 20th century. Umbral areas for about
130,000 sunspots observed by Schwabe were obtained, as well as the tilt angles
of sunspot groups assuming them to be bipolar. There is, of course, no polarity
information in the observations. The annually averaged sunspot areas correlate
reasonably with sunspot number. We derived an average tilt angle by attempting
to exclude unipolar groups with a minimum separation of the two alleged
polarities and an outlier rejection method which follows the evolution of each
group and detects the moment it turns unipolar at its decay. As a result, the
tilt angles, although displaying considerable scatter, place the leading
polarity on average 5.85+-0.25 closer to the equator, in good agreement with
tilt angles obtained from 20th-century data sets. Sources of uncertainties in
the tilt angle determination are discussed and need to be addressed whenever
different data sets are combined. The sunspot area and tilt angle data are
provided online.
