A nonrelativistic charged particle moving in an anisotropic harmonic
oscillator potential plus a homogeneous static electromagnetic field is
studied. Several configurations of the electromagnetic field are considered.
The Schr\"odinger equation is solved analytically in most of the cases. The
energy levels and wave functions are obtained explicitly. In some of the cases,
the ground state obtained is not a minimum wave packet, though it is of the
Gaussian type. Coherent and squeezed states and their time evolution are
discussed in detail.
