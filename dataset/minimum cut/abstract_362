Minimum-uncertainty squeezed states, related to a broad class of observables,
are analyzed. Methods for characterizing such states are developed, which are
based on numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations. As typical
examples we deal with nonlinear generalizations of quadrature squeezed states
and deformed nonlinear squeezed states. In this manner one may derive those
squeezed states which are directly related to given observables. This can be
useful for optimized measurements at a reduced level of quantum-noise.
