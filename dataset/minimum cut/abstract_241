The economic life of an asset is the optimum length of its usefulness, which
is the moment that the asset's expenses are minimum. In this paper, the
economic life of physical assets, such as industry machine and equipment, can
be interpreted as the moment that the minimum is reached by its equivalent
property cost function, defined as the sum of all equivalent capital and
maintenance costs during its life.
  Many contributors in classical papers have used principles of engineering economic
to solve the assets replacement problem. However, in the literature, the main
attributes found were proved with intuitive ideas instead mathematical
analysis. Therefore, in this paper the main goal is to study these principles
of engineering economic with mathematical techniques.
  Here, is used non-smooth analysis to classify all the possibilities for the
minimum of a class of equivalent property cost functions of assets. The minimum
of these function gives the optimum moment for the asset to be replaced, i.e.,
its economic life.
