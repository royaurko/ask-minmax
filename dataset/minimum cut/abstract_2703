The induced gravity theory is a variant of Jordan--Brans--Dicke theory where
the `dilaton' field possesses a potential. It has the unusual feature that in
the presence of a false vacuum there is a {\em stable} static solution with the
dilaton field displaced from the minimum of its potential, giving perfect de
Sitter expansion. We demonstrate how this solution can be used to implement the
open inflationary universe scenario. The necessary second phase of inflation
after false vacuum decay by bubble nucleation is driven by the dilaton rolling
from the static point to the minimum of its potential. Because the static
solution is stable whilst the false vacuum persists, the required evolution
occurs for a wide range of initial conditions. As the exterior of the bubble is
perfect de Sitter space, there is no problem with fields rolling outside the
bubble, as in one of the related models considered by Linde and Mezhlumian, and
the expansion rates before and after tunnelling may be similar which prevents
problematic high-amplitude super-curvature modes from being generated. Once
normalized to the microwave background anisotropies seen by the COBE satellite,
the viable models form a one-parameter family for each possible $\Omega_0$.
