We investigate the collapse of an axisymmetric cavity or bubble inside a
fluid of small viscosity, like water. Any effects of the gas inside the cavity
as well as of the fluid viscosity are neglected. Using a slender-body
description, we show that the minimum radius of the cavity scales like $h_0
\propto t'^{\alpha}$, where $t'$ is the time from collapse. The exponent
$\alpha$ very slowly approaches a universal value according to $\alpha=1/2 +
1/(4\sqrt{-\ln(t')})$. Thus, as observed in a number of recent experiments, the
scaling can easily be interpreted as evidence of a single non-trivial scaling
exponent. Our predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations.
