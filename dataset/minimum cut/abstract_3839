Recent results from Belle and BaBar Collaborations hint at a small
$\sin2\phi_1$, while the measured $B\to\pi\pi$ rate also seems to be on the low
side. Supersymmetric (SUSY) models with down squark mixings can account for the
deficits in both cases. By studying the origin of SUSY contributions that could
impact on $B^0_d$--$\bar B^0_d$ mixing and $B\to\pi\pi$ decay, we find that the
former would most likely arise from left-left or right-right squark mixings,
while the latter would come from left-right squark mixings. These two processes
in general are not much correlated in the Minimum Supersymmetric Standard
Model. If the smallness of $B\to\pi\pi$ is due to SUSY models, one would likely
have large $B\to\rho\gamma$ from chiral enhancement, and the rate could be
within present experimental reach. Even if $B\to\rho\gamma$ is not greatly
enhanced, it could have large mixing dependent CP violation.
