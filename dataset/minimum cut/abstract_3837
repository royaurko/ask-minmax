The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has recently been measured to be in
conflict with the Standard Model prediction with an excess of 2.6 sigma. Taking
the excess at face value as a measurement of the supersymmetric contribution,
we find that at 95% confidence level it imposes an upper bound of 500 GeV on
the neutralino mass and forbids higgsinos as being the bulk of cold dark
matter. Other implications for the astrophysical detection of neutralinos
include: an accessible minimum direct detection rate, lower bounds on the
indirect detection rate of neutrinos from the Sun and the Earth, and a
suppression of the intensity of gamma-ray lines from neutralino annihilations
in the galactic halo.
