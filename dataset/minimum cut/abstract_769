In this paper we examine the elemental composition of the 0.1-1 MeV/nucleon
interplanetary heavy ions from H to Fe in corotating interaction regions (CIRs)
measured by the SIT (Suprathermal Ion Telescope) instrument. We use
observations taken on board the STEREO spacecraft from January 2007 through
December 2010, which included the unusually long solar minimum following solar
cycle 23. During this period instruments on STEREO observed more than 50 CIR
events making it possible to investigate CIR ion abundances during solar
minimum conditions with unprecedented high statistics. The observations reveal
annual variations of relative ion abundances in the CIRs during the 2007-2008
period as indicated by the He/H, He/O and Fe/O elemental ratios. We discuss
possible causes of the variability in terms of the helium focusing cone passage
and heliolatitude dependence. The year 2009 was very quiet in CIR event
activity. In 2010 the elemental composition in CIRs were influenced by sporadic
solar energetic particle (SEP) events. The 2010 He/H and He/O abundance ratios
in CIRs show large event to event variations with values resembling the
SEP-like composition. This finding points out that the suprathermal SEPs could
be the source population for CIR acceleration.
