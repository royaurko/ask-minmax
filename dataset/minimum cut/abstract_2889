We use the framework of the HIJING/B\=B v2.0 model to simulate
high-multiplicity (HM) $p+p$ collision events at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) to study observables sensitive to possible collective phenomena, such as
strong longitudinal color fields (SLCF) modeled by an enhanced string tension
($\kappa$). We focus on the hyperon/meson yield ratios at center-of-mass (c.m.)
energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, in the transverse momentum region, $1 < p_T < 4 $
GeV/{\it c}. For minimum bias events these ratios are well described assuming
an energy dependence $\kappa = \kappa(s)= \kappa_{0} (s/s_{0})^{0.04} {\rm
GeV/fm}$ ($\kappa_{0}$= 1 GeV/fm), giving a value $\kappa = 2$ GeV/fm at
$\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. We compare minimum bias (MB) events to simulated HM events
assuming that $\kappa(MB)=2$ GeV/fm could grow to an extreme value of
$\kappa(HM)=5$ GeV/fm that saturates the strangeness suppression factor. With
this assumption the model predicts a very strong enhancement of (multi)strange
baryon/meson ratios in HM events. If observed, such an enhancement could be
also interpreted as a possible signature for formation in HM $p+p$ collision
events of a deconfined but out of local thermal equilibrium {\em mini
quark-gluon plasma} (mQGP).
