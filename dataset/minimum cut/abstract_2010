We examine instantons and solitons of the effective action of probe D8-branes
in the background of $N_c$ D4-branes which has served as a holographic
description of QCD. We show that the 4d instantons sit at the minimum of the
Euclidean 5d action. Restricting to the static solitons of the five-dimensional
model we are led to consider monopoles in a 3-dimensional curved space. Since
the background metric depends only on the fifth coordinate, it is possible to
reduce the monopole equations to the ones in flat space and write down the
explicit solutions.
