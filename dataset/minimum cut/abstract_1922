A simultaneous measurement of the $\phi$ meson via its $K^{+} K^{-} $ and
$e^{+} e^{-}$ decay channels was performed in Au + Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at mid-rapidity by the PHENIX experiment. The
preliminary minimum bias yields $dN_{\phi}/dy$ in the kaon and electron
channels are $2.01 \pm 0.22 (stat.) ^{+1.01}_{-0.52} (syst.)$ and $5.4 \pm 2.5
(stat) ^{+3.4}_{-2.8} (syst.)$, respectively. The centrality dependence of the
yield in the $K^{+} K^{-} $ channel is presented.
