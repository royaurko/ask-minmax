We present a parallel implementation of a map-making algorithm for CMB
anisotropy experiments which is both fast and efficient. We show for the first
time a Maximum Likelihood, minimum variance map obtained by processing the
entire data stream expected from the Planck Surveyor, under the assumption of a
symmetric beam profile. Here we restrict ourselves to the case of the 30 GHz
channel of the Planck Low Frequency Instrument. The extension to Planck higher
frequency channels is straightforward. If the satellite pointing periodicity is
good enough to average data that belong to the same sky circle, then the code
runs very efficiently on workstations. The serial version of our code also runs
on very competitive time-scales the map-making pipeline for current and
forthcoming balloon borne experiments.
