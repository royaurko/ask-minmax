In this paper, we consider compressed sensing (CS) of block-sparse signals,
i.e., sparse signals that have nonzero coefficients occurring in clusters. An
efficient algorithm, called zero-point attracting projection (ZAP) algorithm,
is extended to the scenario of block CS. The block version of ZAP algorithm
employs an approximate $l_{2,0}$ norm as the cost function, and finds its
minimum in the solution space via iterations. For block sparse signals, an
analysis of the stability of the local minimums of this cost function under the
perturbation of noise reveals an advantage of the proposed algorithm over its
original non-block version in terms of reconstruction error. Finally, numerical
experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other state of the art
methods for the block sparse problem in various respects, especially the
stability under noise.
