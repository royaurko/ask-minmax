With the unique database from Michelson Doppler Imager aboard the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory in an interval embodying solar cycle 23, the cyclic
behavior of solar small-scale magnetic elements is studied. More than 13
million small-scale magnetic elements are selected, and the following results
are unclosed. (1) The quiet regions dominated the Sun\textsf{'}s magnetic flux
for about 8 years in the 12.25 year duration of Cycle 23. They contributed
(0.94 -- 1.44) $\times 10^{23}$ Mx flux to the Sun from the solar minimum to
maximum. The monthly average magnetic flux of the quiet regions is 1.12 times
that of active regions in the cycle. (2) The ratio of quiet region flux to that
of the total Sun equally characterizes the course of a solar cycle. The 6-month
running-average flux ratio of quiet region had been larger than 90.0% for 28
continuous months from July 2007 to October 2009, which characterizes very well
the grand solar minima of Cycles 23-24. (3) From the small to large end of the
flux spectrum, the variations of numbers and total flux of the network elements
show no-correlation, anti-correlation, and correlation with sunspots,
respectively. The anti-correlated elements, covering the flux of (2.9 -
32.0)$\times 10^{18}$ Mx, occupies 77.2% of total element number and 37.4% of
quiet Sun flux. These results provide insight into reason for anti-correlated
variations of small-scale magnetic activity during the solar cycle.
