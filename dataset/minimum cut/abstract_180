Let be the following strategy to construct a walk in a labeled digraph: at
each vertex, we follow the unvisited arc of minimum label. In this work we
study for which languages, applying the previous strategy over the
corresponding de Bruijn graph, we finish with an Eulerian cycle, in order to
obtain the minimal de Bruijn sequence of the language.
