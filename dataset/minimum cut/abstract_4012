This article introduces the conjecture that "mathematics, logic and related
disciplines may usefully be understood as information compression (IC) by
'multiple alignment', 'unification' and 'search' (ICMAUS)".
  As a preparation for the two main sections of the article, concepts of
information and information compression are reviewed. Related areas of research
are also described including IC in brains and nervous systems, and IC in
relation to inductive inference, Minimum Length Encoding and probabilistic
reasoning. The ICMAUS concepts and a computer model in which they are embodied
are briefly described.
  The first of the two main sections describes how many of the commonly-used
forms and structures in mathematics, logic and related disciplines (such as
theoretical linguistics and computer programming) may be seen as devices for
IC. In some cases, these forms and structures may be interpreted in terms of
the ICMAUS framework.
  The second main section describes a selection of examples where processes of
calculation and inference in mathematics, logic and related disciplines may be
understood as IC. In many cases, these examples may be understood more
specifically in terms of the ICMAUS concepts.
