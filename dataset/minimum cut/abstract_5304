Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is a greedy algorithm widely used for the
recovery of sparse signals from compressed measurements. In this paper, we
analyze the minimum number of iterations required for the OMP algorithm to
ensure the exact recovery of sparse signals. Our analysis shows that OMP can
accurately recover all $K$-sparse signals within $\lceil 2.8 K \rceil$
iterations when the measurement matrix satisfies the restricted isometry
property (RIP). Our result improves upon the recent result of Zhang and is also
close to the fundamental limit under which the exact recovery of $K$-sparse
signals cannot be uniformly guaranteed.
