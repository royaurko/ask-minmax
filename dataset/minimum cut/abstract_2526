The purpose of this paper is to explore a new way of autonomous mapping.
Current systems using perception techniques like LAZER or SONAR use
probabilistic methods and have a drawback of allowing considerable uncertainty
in the mapping process. Our approach is to break down the environment,
specifically indoor, into reachable areas and objects, separated by boundaries,
and identifying their shape, to render various navigable paths around them.
This is a novel method to do away with uncertainties, as far as possible, at
the cost of temporal efficiency. Also this system demands only minimum and
cheap hardware, as it relies on only Infra-Red sensors to do the job.
