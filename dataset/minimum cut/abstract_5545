Single crystals of Cu$_{13}$Ba were successfully grown out of Ba-Cu self
flux. Temperature dependent magnetization, $M(T)$, electrical resistivity,
$\rho(T)$, and specific heat, $C_p(T)$, data are reported. Isothermal
magnetization measurements, $M(H)$, show clear de Haas-van Alphen oscillations
at $T$ = 2 K for applied fields as low as $\mu_0H$ = 1T. An anomalous behavior
of the magnetic susceptibility is observed up to $T$ ~ 50K reflecting the
effect of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations at fairly high temperatures. The
field- and temperature-dependencies of the magnetization indicate the presence
of diluted magnetic impurities with a concentration of the order of 0.01at.%.
Accordingly, the minimum and lower temperature rise observed in the electrical
resistivity at and below $T$ = 15K is attributed to the Kondo impurity effect.
