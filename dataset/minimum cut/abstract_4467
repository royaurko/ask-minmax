We describe the design and function of a circular magnetic waveguide produced
from wires on a microchip for atom interferometry using deBroglie waves. The
guide is a two-dimensional magnetic minimum for trapping weak-field seeking
states of atoms or molecules with a magnetic dipole moment. The design consists
of seven circular wires sharing a common radius. We describe the design, the
time-dependent currents of the wires and show that it is possible to form a
circular waveguide with adjustable height and gradient while minimizing
perturbation resulting from leads or wire crossings. This maximal area geometry
is suited for rotation sensing with atom interferometry via the Sagnac effect
using either cold atoms, molecules and Bose-condensed systems.
