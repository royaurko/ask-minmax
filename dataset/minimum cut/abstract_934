We study the blow-up behaviour of minimizing sequences for the singular
Moser-Trudinger functional on compact surfaces. Assuming non-existence of
minimum points, we give an estimate for the infimum value of the functional.
This result can be applied to give sharp Onofri-type inequalities on the sphere
in the presence of at most two singularities.
