We study the field millisecond pulsar (MSP) population to infer its intrinsic
distribution in spin period and luminosity and to determine its spatial
distribution within the Galaxy. Our likelihood analysis on data from extant
surveys (22 pulsars with periods <20 ms) accounts for important selection
effects. We infer a minimum period cutoff P(min) > 0.65 ms (99% confidence), a
period distribution proportional to P^{-2.0 +- 0.33} and a pseudo-luminosity
distribution proportional to L_p^{-2.0 +- 0.2} (where L_p = flux density times
distance^2, for L_p >= 1.1 mJy kpc^2). We find a vertical scale height
0.65{+0.16,-0.12} kpc. We use our results to estimate the total number and
birthrate of MSPs in the disk of the Galaxy. We limit the density contribution
of a diffuse halo-like component to <1% of the midplane value. The MSP velocity
dispersion is smaller that that of young, long-period pulsars by about a factor
of 5. Our best estimate of the 1D velocity kick that is unique to MSP evolution
is approximately 40 km s^-1. We discuss the evolutionary relationship of MSPs
and low-mass X-ray binaries and prospects for future searches for MSPs.
