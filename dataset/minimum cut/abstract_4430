We study magnetic fields in the charged condensate that we have previously
argued should be present in helium-core white dwarf stars. We show that below a
certain critical value the magnetic field is entirely expelled from the
condensate, while for larger values it penetrates the condensate within
flux-tubes that are similar to Abrikosov vortex lines; yet higher fields lead
to the disruption of the condensate. We find the solution for the vortex lines
in both relativistic and nonrelativistic theories that exhibit the charged
condensation. We calculate the energy density of the vortex solution and the
values of the critical magnetic fields. The minimum magnetic field required for
vortices to penetrate the helium white dwarf cores ranges from roughly 10^7 to
10^9 Gauss. Fields of this strength have been observed in white dwarfs. We also
calculate the London magnetic field due to the rotation of a dwarf star and
show that its value is rather small.
