We study the size of clusters formed by water molecules possessing large
enough tetrahedrality with respect to their nearest neighbors. Using Monte
Carlo simulation of the SPC/E model of water, together with a geometric
analysis based on Voronoi tessellation, we find that regions of lower density
than the bulk are formed by accretion of molecules into clusters exceeding a
minimum size. Clusters are predominantly linear objects and become less compact
as they grow until they reach a size beyond which further accretion is not
accompanied by a density decrease. The results suggest that the formation of
"ice-like" regions in liquid water is cooperative.
