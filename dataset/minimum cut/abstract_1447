The present article studies the finite Zariski tangent spaces to an affine
variety X as linear codes, in order to characterize their typical or
exceptional properties by global geometric conditions on X. The discussion
concerns the generic minimum distance of a tangent code to X, its lower
semi-continuity under a deformation of X, as well as the existence of Zariski
tangent spaces to X with exceptional minimum distance. Tangent codes are shown
to admit simultaneous decoding. The duals of the tangent codes to X are
realized by gradients of polynomials from the ideal of X. We provide
constructions of affine varieties with near MDS, cyclic or Hamming tangent
codes. Puncturing, shortening and extending finite Zariski tangent spaces are
related to the corresponding operations on affine varieties. The (u|u+v)
construction of tangent codes is associated with a fibered product of
varieties. Explicit constructions realize linear Hamming isometries as
differentials of morphisms of affine varieties.
