The results of dc magnetization, heat capacity, electrical resistivity (rho)
and magnetoresistance measurements are reported in detail for the compounds,
RCuAs2 for R= Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er, crystallizing in HfCuSi2-type
tetragonal structure, with the aim of bringing out anomalies among 'normal'
(that is, other than Ce and Yb) rare-earths. The results establish that all
these compounds order antiferromagnetically at low temperatures with deviations
from de Gennes scaling. Isothermal magnetization (M) data below respective Neel
temperatures (TN) reveal the existence of field-induced metamagnetic-like
transitions for most of the compounds (except R= Sm and Gd), whereas in Sm and
Gd compounds M varies essentially linearly with magnetic field. With respect to
the rho behavior, there appears to be a subtle difference in the temperature
dependence beyond 50 K between Sm on the one hand and the rest on the other. In
addition, the unexpected rho(T) minimum reported recently for R = Sm, Gd, Tb
and Dy in the paramagnetic state (around 20 to 30 K) is essentially absent for
R = Ho and Er. The results overall reveal that the normal rare-earths in this
series present an interesting situation in magnetism, warranting a new
theoretical approach to describe the transport behavior in the paramagnetic
state particularly in the vicinity of TN.
