The percolation phase transitions of two-dimensional lattice networks under a
generalized Achlioptas process (GAP) are investigated. During the GAP, two
edges are chosen randomly from the lattice and the edge with minimum product of
the two connecting cluster sizes is taken as the next occupied bond with a
probability $p$. At $p=0.5$, the GAP becomes the random growth model and leads
to the minority product rule at $p=1$. Using the finite-size scaling analysis,
we find that the percolation phase transitions of these systems with $0.5 \le p
\le 1$ are always continuous and their critical exponents depend on $p$.
Therefore, the universality class of the critical phenomena in two-dimensional
lattice networks under the GAP is related to the probability parameter $p$ in
addition.
