The length dependence is computed of the resistance of a disordered
normal-metal wire attached to a superconductor. The scaling of the transmission
eigenvalue distribution with length is obtained exactly in the metallic limit,
by a transformation onto the isobaric flow of a two-dimensional ideal fluid.
The resistance has a minimum for lengths near l/Gamma, with l the mean free
path and Gamma the transmittance of the superconductor interface.
