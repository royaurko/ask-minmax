In arXiv:1210.3178 it was shown that subgroup depth may be computed from the
permutation module of the left or right cosets: this holds more generally for a
Hopf subalgebra, from which we note in this paper that finite depth of a Hopf
subalgebra R < H is equivalent to the H-module coalgebra Q = H/R^+H
representing an algebraic element in the Green ring of H or R. This approach
shows that subgroup depth and the subgroup depth of the corefree quotient lie
in the same closed interval of length one. We also establish a previous claim
that the problem of determining if R has finite depth in H is equivalent to
determining if H has finite depth in its cross product Q* # H. A necessary
condition is obtained for finite depth from stabilization of a descending chain
of annihilator ideals of tensor powers of Q. As an application of these topics
to a centerless finite group G, we prove that the minimum depth of its group
complex algebra in the Drinfeld double D(G) is an odd integer, which determines
the least tensor power of the adjoint representation Q that is a faithful
complex G-module.
