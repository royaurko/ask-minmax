Two CCD epochs of light minimum and a complete R light curve of SS Ari are
presented. The light curve obtained in 2007 was analyzed with the 2003 version
of the W-D code. It is shown that SS Ari is a shallow contact binary system
with a mass ratio $q=3.25$ and a degree of contact factor f=9.4(\pm0.8%). A
period investigation based on all available data shows that there may exist two
distinct solutions about the assumed third body. One, assuming eccentric orbit
of the third body and constant orbital period of the eclipsing pair results in
a massive third body with $M_3=1.73M_{\odot}$ and P_3=87.0$yr. On the contrary,
assuming continuous period changes of the eclipsing pair the orbital period of
tertiary is 37.75yr and its mass is about $0.278M_{\odot}$. Both of the cases
suggest the presence of an unseen third component in the system.
