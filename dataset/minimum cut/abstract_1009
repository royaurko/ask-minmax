The depletion potential between two hard spheres in a solvent of thin hard
disclike platelets is investigated by using either the Derjaguin approximation
or density functional theory. Particular attention is paid to the density
dependence of the depletion potential. A second-order virial approximation is
applied, which yields nearly exact results for the bulk properties of the
hard-platelet fluid at densities two times smaller than the density of the
isotropic fluid at isotropic-nematic phase coexistence. As the platelet density
increases, the attractive primary minimum of the depletion potential deepens
and an additional small repulsive barrier at larger sphere separations
develops. Upon decreasing the ratio of the radius of the spheres and the
platelets, the primary minimum diminishes and the position of the small
repulsive barrier shifts to smaller values of the sphere separation.
