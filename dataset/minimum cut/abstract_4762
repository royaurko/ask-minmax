The two dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model in the presence of a
propagating magnetic field wave (with well defined frequency and wavelength) is
studied by Mone Carlo simulation. This study differs from all of the earlier
studies done so far, where the oscillating magnetic field was considered to be
uniform in space. The time average magnetisation over a full cycle (the time
period) of the propagating magnetic field acts as the dynamic order parameter.
The dynamical phase transition is observed. The temperature variation of the
dynamic order parameter, the mean square deviation of the dynamic order
parameter, the dynamic specific heat and the derivative of the dynamic order
parameter are studied. The mean square deviation of the dynamic order
parameter, dynamic specific heat show sharp maxima near the transition point.
The derivative of dynamic order parameter shows sharp minimum near the
transition point. The transition temperature is found to depend also on the
speed of propagation of the magnetic field wave.
