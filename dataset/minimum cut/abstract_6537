Suppose that $\omega\subset\Omega\subset R^2$. In the annular domain
$A=\Omega\setminus\bar\omega$ we consider the class $J$ of complex valued maps
having degree 1 on $\partial \Omega$ and on $\partial\omega$.
  It was conjectured by Berlyand and Mironescu ('04), that he existence of
minimizers of the Ginzburg-Landau energy $E_\kappa$ in $J$ is completely
determined by the value of the $H^1$-capacity $cap(A)$ of the domain and the
value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa$.
  The existence of minimizers of $E_\kappa$ for all $\kappa$ when
$cap(A)\geq\pi$ (domain $A$ is ``thin'') and for small $\kappa$ when
$cap(A)<\pi$ (domain $A$ is ``thick'') was established by Berlyand and
Mironescu ('04).
  Here we provide the answer for the remaining case of large $\kappa$ when
$cap(A)<\pi$. We prove that, when $cap(A)<\pi$, there exists a finite threshold
value $\kappa_1$ of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa$ such that the
minimum of the Ginzburg-Landau energy $E_\kappa$ is not attained in $J$ when
$\kappa>\kappa_1$ while it is attained when $\kappa<\kappa_1$.
