A transformation network describes how one set of resources can be
transformed into another via technological processes. Transformation networks
in economics are useful because they can highlight areas for future
innovations, both in terms of new products, new production techniques, or
better efficiency. They also make it easy to detect areas where an economy
might be fragile. In this paper, we use computational simulations to
investigate how the density of a transformation network affects the economic
performance, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), of an artificial
economy. Our results show that on average, the GDP of our economy increases as
the density of the transformation network increases. We also find that while
the average performance increases, the maximum possible performance decreases
and the minimum possible performance increases.
