Dijet production has been measured in pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon
centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. A data sample corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 35 inverse nanobarns was collected using the Compact Muon
Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The dijet transverse momentum
balance, azimuthal angle correlations, and pseudorapidity distributions are
studied as a function of the transverse energy in the forward calorimeters
(ETHFfour). For pPb collisions, the dijet transverse momentum ratio and the
width of the distribution of dijet azimuthal angle difference are comparable to
the same quantities obtained from a simulated pp reference and insensitive to
ETHFfour. In contrast, the mean value of the dijet pseudorapidity is found to
change monotonically with increasing ETHFfour, indicating a correlation between
the energy emitted at large pseudorapidity and the longitudinal motion of the
dijet frame. The pseudorapidity distribution of the dijet system in minimum
bias pPb collisions is compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD
predictions obtained from both nucleon and nuclear parton distribution
functions, and the data more closely match the latter.
