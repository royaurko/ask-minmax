Spatially coupled (SC) interleaving is proposed to improve the performance of
iterative multiuser detection and decoding (MUDD) for quasi-static fading
multiple-input multiple-output systems. The linear minimum mean-squared error
(LMMSE) demodulator is used to reduce the complexity and to avoid error
propagation. Furthermore, sliding window MUDD is proposed to circumvent an
increase of the decoding latency due to SC interleaving. Theoretical and
numerical analyses show that SC interleaving can improve the performance of the
iterative LMMSE MUDD for regular low-density parity-check codes.
