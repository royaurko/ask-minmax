We present a new analysis of the light curve for the secondary star in the
eclipsing binary millisecond pulsar system PSR B1957+20. Combining previous
data and new data points at minimum from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have
100% coverage in the R-band. We also have a number of new K_s-band data points,
which we use to constrain the infrared magnitude of the system. We model this
with the Eclipsing Light Curve code (ELC). From the modelling with the ELC code
we obtain colour information about the secondary at minimum light in BVRI and
K. For our best fit model we are able to constrain the system inclination to 65
+/- 2 degrees for pulsar masses ranging from 1.3 -- 1.9 M_sun. The pulsar mass
is unconstrained. We also find that the secondary star is not filling its Roche
lobe. The temperature of the un-irradiated side of the companion is in
agreement with previous estimates and we find that the observed temperature
gradient across the secondary star is physically sustainable.
