Consider a high-dimensional data set, such that for every data-point there is
incomplete information. Each object in the data set represents a real entity,
which models as a point in high-dimensional space. We assume that all real
entities are embedded in the same space, which means they have the same
dimension. We model the lack of information for a given object as affine
subspace in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with dimension $k$.
  Our goal in this paper is to find clusters of objects. The main problem is to
cope with the partial information. We studied a simple algorithm we call
\emph{Data clustering using flats minimum distances}, using the following
assumptions: 1) There are $m$ clusters. 2) Each cluster is modeled as a ball in
$\mathbb{R}^d$. 3) Each cluster contains a $\frac{n}{m}$, $k$-dimensional
affine subspaces . 4) All $k$-dimensional affine subspaces, which belong in the
same cluster, are intersected with the ball of the cluster. 5) Each
$k$-dimensional affine subspace, that belong to a cluster, is selected
uniformly among all $k$-dimensional affine subspaces that intersect the ball's
cluster. A data set that satisfy these assumptions will be called
\textit{separable data}.
  Our suggested algorithm calculates pair-wise projection of the data. We use
probabilistic considerations to prove the algorithm correctness. These
probabilistic results are of independent interest, as can serve to better
understand the geometry of high dimensional objects.
