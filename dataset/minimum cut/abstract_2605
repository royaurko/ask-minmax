Image width is important for image understanding. We propose a novel method
to estimate widths for JPEG images when their widths are not available. The key
idea is that the distance between two decoded MCUs (Minimum Coded Unit)
adjacent in the vertical direction is usually small, which is measured by the
average Euclidean distance between the pixels from the bottom row of the top
MCU and the top row of the bottom MCU. On PASCAL VOC 2010 challenge dataset and
USC-SIPI image database, experimental results show the high performance of the
proposed approach.
