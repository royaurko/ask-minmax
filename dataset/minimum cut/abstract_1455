In a smart grid environment, we study coalition formation of prosumers that
aim at entering the energy market. It is paramount for the grid operation that
the energy producers are able to sustain the grid demand in terms of stability
and minimum production requirement. We design an algorithm that seeks to form
coalitions that will meet both of these requirements: a minimum energy level
for the coalitions and a steady production level which leads to finding
uncorrelated sources of energy to form a coalition. We propose an algorithm
that uses graph tools such as correlation graphs or clique percolation to form
coalitions that meet such complex constraints. We validate the algorithm
against a random procedure and show that, it not only performs better in term
of social welfare for the power grid, but also that it is more robust against
unforeseen production variations due to changing weather conditions for
instance.
