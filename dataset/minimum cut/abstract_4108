In a recent paper, we have used the dark-spot Zeeman tuned slowing technique
[Phys. Rev. A 62, 013404-1, (2000)] to measure the capture velocity as a
function of laser intensity for a sodium magneto optical trap. Due to technical
limitation we explored only the low light intensity regime, from 0 to 27
mW/cm^2. Now we complement that work measuring the capture velocity in a
broader range of light intensities (from 0 to 400 mW/cm^2). New features,
observed in this range, are important to understant the escape velocity
behavior, which has been intensively used in the interpretation of cold
collisions. In particular, we show in this brief report that the capture
velocity has a maximum as function of the trap laser intensity, which would
imply a minimum in the trap loss rates.
