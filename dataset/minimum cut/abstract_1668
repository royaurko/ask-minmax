Inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the relaxor ferroelectric
PbMg$_{1 / 3}$Nb$_{2 / 3}$O$_{3}$ (PMN) in the temperature range
490~K$<$T$<$880~K directly observe the soft mode (SM) associated with the
Curie-Weiss behavior of the dielectric constant $\varepsilon $(T). The results
are treated within the framework of the coupled SM and transverse optic (TO1)
mode and the temperature dependence of the SM frequency at q=0.075 a* is
determined. The parameters of the SM are consistent with the earlier estimates
and the frequency exhibits a minimum near the Burns temperature ($\approx $
650K)
