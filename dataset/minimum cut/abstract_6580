We propose a new concept for a very low background multi-ton liquid xenon
Dark Matter experiment. The detector consists of two concentric spheres and a
charge readout device in the centre. Xenon between the two spheres forms a
self-shield and veto device. The inner surface of the central sphere is coated
with CsI to form an internal photocathode with minimum of 2\pi coverage for any
event in the active volume. Photoelectrons from the CsI photocathode drift
toward the charge readout micro-structure in the centre of the detector. Both
scintillation and ionisation are measured simultaneously for background
rejection and 3-D event mapping. In addition to external shielding, the low
background is achieved by eliminating PMTs and by using low radioactivity pure
materials throughout the detector. We present detailed calculations of the
charge readout system and design details. The detector is expected to probe the
full SUSY parameter space.
