Fo-ATP synthase (Fo) is a rotary motor that converts potential energy from
ions, usually protons, moving from high- to low-potential sides of a membrane
into torque and rotary motion. Here we propose a mechanism whereby electric
fields emanating from the proton entry and exit channels act on asymmetric
charge distributions in the c-ring, due to protonated and deprotonated sites,
and drive it to rotate. The model predicts a scaling between time-averaged
torque and proton motive force, which can be hindered by mutations that
adversely affect the channels. The torque created by the c-ring of Fo drives
the gamma-subunit to rotate within the ATP-producing complex (F1) overcoming,
with the aid of thermal fluctuations, an opposing torque that rises and falls
with angular position. Using the analogy with thermal Brownian motion of a
particle in a tilted washboard potential, we compute ATP production rates vs.
proton motive force. The latter shows a minimum, needed to drive ATP
production, which scales inversely with the number of proton binding sites on
the c-ring.
