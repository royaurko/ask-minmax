We introduce the notion of watching systems in graphs, which is a
generalization of that of identifying codes. We give some basic properties of
watching systems, an upper bound on the minimum size of a watching system, and
results on the graphs which achieve this bound; we also study the cases of the
paths and cycles, and give complexity results.
