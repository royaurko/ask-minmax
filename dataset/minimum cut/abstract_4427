We report photometry of V358 Lyr during its 2008 November outburst, the first
confirmed outburst since 1965. At its brightest the star was V=15.9 and the
outburst amplitude was at least 7.3 magnitudes and lasted at least 23 days. The
first 4 days of the outburst corresponded to the plateau phase and the star
then faded at 0.13 mag/d over the next 7 days. There was then a drop in
brightness to a temporary minimum at mag 19.5, which lasted less than 4 days,
after which the star recovered to its previous brightness. The final stages of
the outburst were poorly covered. Time resolved photometry during the outburst
revealed no obvious large-scale modulations such as superhumps. Although some
small apparently periodic signals were detected, their significance is
uncertain. Our observations, and those of previous researchers, support V358
Lyr being a dwarf nova and are consistent with it being a member of the WZ Sge
family.
