The pp -> {pp}_s pi0 differential cross section has been measured with the
ANKE spectrometer at COSY-Juelich for seven proton beam energies T_p between
0.5 and 1.97 GeV. By selecting proton pairs with an excitation energy of less
than 3 MeV it is ensured that the final {pp}_s system is in the 1S0 state. In
the measured region of theta_{pp}^{cm} < 18 deg, the data reveal a forward dip
for T_p =< 1.4 GeV whereas a forward peaking is seen at 1.97 GeV. The energy
dependence of the forward cross section shows a broad peak in the 0.6-0.8 GeV
region, probably associated with Delta(1232) excitation, and a minimum at 1.4
GeV. Some of these features are similar to those observed for the spin-isospin
partner reaction, pp -> d pi+. However, the ratio of the forward differential
cross sections of the two reactions shows a significant suppression of single
pion production associated with a spin--singlet final nucleon pair.
