The infiltration of molten silicon into carbon preforms is a widespread
technique employed in the industry in order to enhance the thermal and
mechanical properties of the final ceramic products. A proper understanding of
this phenomenon is quite challenging since it stems from the reciprocal action
and reaction between fluid flow, the transition to wetting, mass transport,
precipitation, surface growth as well as heat transfer. As a result, the
exhaustive modeling of such problem is an involved task. Lattice Boltzmann
simulations in 2D for capillary infiltration are carried out in the isothermal
regime taking into account surface reaction and subsequent surface growth.
Precisely, for a single capillary in the linear Washburn regime, special
attention is paid to the retardation for the infiltration process induced by
the thickening of the surface behind the contact line of the invading front.
Interestingly, it turns out that the process of surface growth leading to pore
closure marginally depends on the infiltration velocity. We conclude that
porous matrices with straight and wide pathways represent the optimal case for
impregnation. Our analysis includes also a comparison between the radii
characterizing the infiltration process (i.e., minimum, hydraulic, average and
effective radii).
