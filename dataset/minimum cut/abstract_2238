This summarizes our latest understanding and results about the algorithms for
enumerating Tanner Graphs that have a regular structure called Balanced Tanner
Graphs. Enumeration algorithms for Balanced Tanner Graphs based upon Cyclic
Permutation Groups have been developed in this paper. A constrained enumeration
algorithm that enumerates Balanced Tanner Graphs that have a relatively larger
length of minimum cycle has been described.
