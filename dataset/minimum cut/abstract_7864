We have identified a complex galaxy cluster system in the COSMOS field via a
wide angle tail (WAT) radio galaxy consistent with the idea that WAT galaxies
can be used as tracers of clusters. The WAT galaxy, CWAT-01, is coincident with
an elliptical galaxy resolved in the HST-ACS image. Using the COSMOS
multiwavelength data set, we derive the radio properties of CWAT-01 and use the
optical and X-ray data to investigate its host environment. The cluster hosting
CWAT-01 is part of a larger assembly consisting of a minimum of four X-ray
luminous clusters within ~2 Mpc distance. We apply hydrodynamical models that
combine ram pressure and buoyancy forces on CWAT-01. These models explain the
shape of the radio jets only if the galaxy's velocity relative to the
intra-cluster medium (ICM) is in the range of about 300-550 km/s which is
higher than expected for brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in relaxed systems.
This indicates that the CWAT-01 host cluster is not relaxed, but is possibly
dynamically young. We argue that such a velocity could have been induced
through subcluster merger within the CWAT-01 parent cluster and/or
cluster-cluster interactions. Our results strongly indicate that we are
witnessing the formation of a large cluster from an assembly of multiple
clusters, consistent with the hierarchical scenario of structure formation. We
estimate the total mass of the final cluster to be approximately 20% of the
mass of the Coma cluster.
