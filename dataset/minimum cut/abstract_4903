We prove a theorem on the magnetic energy minimum in a system of perfect, or
ideal, conductors. It is analogous to Thomson's theorem on the equilibrium
electric field and charge distribution in a system of conductors. We first
prove Thomson's theorem using a variational principle. Our new theorem is then
derived by similar methods. We find that magnetic energy is minimized when the
current distribution is a surface current density with zero interior magnetic
field; perfect conductors are perfectly diamagnetic. The results agree with
currents in superconductors being confined near the surface. The theorem
implies a generalized force that expels current and magnetic field from the
interior of a conductor that loses its resistivity. Examples of solutions that
obey the theorem are presented.
