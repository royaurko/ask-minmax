We consider observational tests for the nature of Ultraluminous X-ray sources
(ULXs). These must distinguish between thermal-timescale mass transfer on to
stellar-mass black holes leading to anisotropic X-ray emission, and accretion
on to intermediate-mass black holes. We suggest that long-term transient
behavior via the thermal-viscous disk instability could discriminate between
these two possibilities for ULXs in regions of young stellar populations.
Thermal-timescale mass transfer generally produces stable disks and persistent
X-ray emission. In contrast, mass transfer from massive stars to black holes
produces unstable disks and thus transient behavior, provided that the black
hole mass exceeds some minimum value. This minimum mass depends primarily on
the donor mass and evolutionary state. We show that it exceeds 50 solar masses
for a large fraction (greater than 90%) of the mass-transfer lifetime for the
most likely donors in young clusters. Thus if long-term monitoring reveals a
large transient fraction among ULXs in a young stellar population, these
systems would be good candidates for intermediate-mass black holes in a
statistical sense; information about the donor star is needed to make this
identification secure in any individual case. A transient ULX population would
imply a much larger population of quiescent systems of the same type.
