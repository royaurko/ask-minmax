Long-term records of sunspot number and concentrations of cosmogenic
radionuclides (10Be and 14C) on the Earth reveal the variation of the Sun's
magnetic activity over hundreds and thousands of years. We identify several
clear periods in sunspot, 10Be, and 14C data as 1000, 500, 350, 200 and 100
years. We found that the periods of the first five spherical harmonics of the
slow magnetic Rossby mode in the presence of a steady toroidal magnetic field
of 1200-1300 G in the lower tachocline are in perfect agreement with the time
scales of observed variations. The steady toroidal magnetic field can be
generated in the lower tachocline either due to the steady dynamo magnetic
field for low magnetic diffusivity or due to the action of the latitudinal
differential rotation on the weak poloidal primordial magnetic field, which
penetrates from the radiative interior. The slow magnetic Rossby waves lead to
variations of the steady toroidal magnetic field in the lower tachocline, which
modulate the dynamo magnetic field and consequently the solar cycle strength.
This result constitutes a key point for long-term prediction of the cycle
strength. According to our model, the next deep minimum in solar activity is
expected during the first half of this century.
