Interplanetary Lyman alpha line profiles are derived from the SWAN H cell
data measurements. The measurements cover a 6-year period from solar minimum
(1996) to after the solar maximum of 2001. This allows us to study the
variations of the line profiles with solar activity. These line profiles were
used to derive line shifts and line widths in the interplanetary medium for
various angles of the LOS with the interstellar flow direction. The SWAN data
results were then compared to an interplanetary background upwind spectrum
obtained by STIS/HST in March 2001. We find that the LOS upwind velocity
associated with the mean line shift of the IP \lya line varies from 25.7 km/s
to 21.4 km/s from solar minimum to solar maximum. Most of this change is linked
with variations in the radiation pressure. LOS kinetic temperatures derived
from IP line widths do not vary monotonically with the upwind angle of the LOS.
This is not compatible with calculations of IP line profiles based on hot model
distributions of interplanetary hydrogen. We also find that the line profiles
get narrower during solar maximum. The results obtained on the line widths (LOS
temperature) show that the IP line is composed of two components scattered by
two hydrogen populations with different bulk velocities and temperature. This
is a clear signature of the heliospheric interface on the line profiles seen at
1 AU from the sun.
