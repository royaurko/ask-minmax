We discuss spectral properties of the self-adjoint operator \[ -d^2/dt^2 +
(t^{k+1}/(k+1)-\alpha)^2 \] in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ for odd integers $k$. We prove
that the minimum over $\alpha$ of the ground state energy of this operator is
attained at a unique point which tends to zero as $k$ tends to infinity.
Moreover, we show that the minimum is non-degenerate. These questions arise
naturally in the spectral analysis of Schr\"{o}dinger operators with magnetic
field. This extends or clarifies previous results by Pan-Kwek, Helffer-Morame,
Aramaki, Helffer-Kordyukov and Helffer.
