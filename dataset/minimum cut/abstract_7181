We present recent polarimetric images of the highly variable star R CrB using
ExPo and archival WFPC2 images from the HST. We observed R CrB during its
current dramatic minimum where it decreased more than 9 mag due to the
formation of an obscuring dust cloud. Since the dust cloud is only in the
line-of-sight, it mimics a coronograph allowing the imaging of the star's
circumstellar environment. Our polarimetric observations surprisingly show
another scattering dust cloud at approximately 1.3" or 2000 AU from the star.
We find that to obtain a decrease in the stellar light of 9 mag and with 30% of
the light being reemitted at infrared wavelengths (from R CrB's SED) the grains
in R CrB's circumstellar environment must have a very low albedo of
approximately 0.07%. We show that the properties of the dust clouds formed
around R CrB are best fitted using a combination of two distinct populations of
grains size. The first are the extremely small 5 nm grains, formed in the low
density continuous wind, and the second population of large grains (~0.14
{\mu}m) which are found in the ejected dust clouds. The observed scattering
cloud, not only contains such large grains, but is exceptionally massive
compared to the average cloud.
