Turbulent magnetic fields fill most of the volume of the solar atmosphere.
However, their spatial and temporal variations are still unknown. Since 2007,
during the current solar minimum, we are periodically monitoring several
wavelength regions in the solar spectrum to search for variations of the
turbulent magnetic field in the quiet Sun. These fields, which are below the
resolution limit, can be detected via the Hanle effect which influences the
scattering polarization signatures (Q/I) in the presence of magnetic fields. We
present a description of our program and first results showing that such a
synoptic program is complementary to the daily SOHO magnetograms for monitoring
small-scale magnetic fields.
