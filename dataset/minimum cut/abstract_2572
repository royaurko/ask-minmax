Energy and momentum loss of jets in heavy ion collisions can affect the fluid
dynamic evolution of the medium. We determine realistic event-by-event averages
and correlation functions of the local energy-momentum transfer from hard
particles to the soft sector using the jet-quenching Monte-Carlo code JEWEL
combined with a hydrodynamic model for the background. The expectation values
for source terms due to jets in a typical (minimum bias) event affect the fluid
dynamic evolution mainly by their momentum transfer. This leads to a small
increase in flow. The presence of hard jets in the event constitutes only a
minor correction.
