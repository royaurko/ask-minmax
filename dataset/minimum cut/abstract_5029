The Integrated Completed Likelihood (ICL) criterion has been proposed by
Biernacki et al. (2000) in the model-based clustering framework to select a
relevant number of classes and has been used by statisticians in various
application areas. A theoretical study of this criterion is proposed. A
contrast related to the clustering objective is introduced: the conditional
classification likelihood. This yields an estimator and a model selection
criteria class. The properties of these new procedures are studied and ICL is
proved to be an approximation of one of these criteria. We oppose these results
to the current leading point of view about ICL, that it would not be
consistent. Moreover these results give insights into the class notion
underlying ICL and feed a reflection on the class notion in clustering. General
results on penalized minimum contrast criteria and on mixture models are
derived, which are interesting in their own right.
