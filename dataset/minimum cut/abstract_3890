We discuss possible destinations from the chromomagnetic instability in color
superconductors with Fermi surface mismatch $\delta\mu$. In the two-flavor
superconducting (2SC) phase we calculate the effective potential for color
vector potentials $A_\alpha$ which are interpreted as the net momenta $q$ of
pairing in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrel (LOFF) phase. When
$1/\sqrt{2}<\delta\mu/\Delta<1$ where $\Delta$ is the gap energy, the effective
potential suggests that the instability leads to a LOFF-like state which is
characterized by color-rotated phase oscillations with small $q$. In the
vicinity of $\delta\mu/\Delta=1/\sqrt{2}$ the magnitude of $q$ continuously
increases from zero as the effective potential has negative larger curvature at
vanishing $A_\alpha$ that is the Meissner mass squared. In the gapless 2SC
(g2SC) phase, in contrast, the effective potential has a minimum at
$gA_\alpha\sim\delta\mu\sim\Delta$ even when the negative Meissner mass squared
is infinitesimally small. Our results imply that the chromomagnetic instability
found in the gapless phase drives the system toward the LOFF state with
$q\sim\delta\mu$.
