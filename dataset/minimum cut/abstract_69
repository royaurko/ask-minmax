Minimum phase functions are fundamental in a range of applications, including
control theory, communication theory and signal processing. A basic
mathematical challenge that arises in the context of geophysical imaging is to
understand the structure of linear operators preserving the class of minimum
phase functions. The heart of the matter is an inverse problem: to reconstruct
an unknown minimum phase preserving operator from its value on a limited set of
test functions. This entails, as a preliminary step, ascertaining sets of test
functions that determine the operator, as well as the derivation of a
corresponding reconstruction scheme. In the present paper we exploit a recent
breakthrough in the theory of stable polynomials to solve the stated inverse
problem completely. We prove that a minimum phase preserving operator on the
half line can be reconstructed from data consisting of its value on precisely
two test functions. And we derive an explicit integral representation of the
unknown operator in terms of this data. A remarkable corollary of the solution
is that if a linear minimum phase preserving operator has rank at least two,
then it is necessarily injective.
