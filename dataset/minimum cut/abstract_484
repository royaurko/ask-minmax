We study bound states generated by a unique potential minimum, in particular
the situation where the system is confined to a bounded region containing the
minimum. In the latter case, the eigenvalues of the confined system depart from
those of the unconfined system by an exponentially small quantity in the
semiclassical limit. An asymptotic expansion for this shift is established. The
formulas are evaluated explicitly for the harmonic oscillator, and an
application to the Coulomb potential at a fixed angular momentum is given.
