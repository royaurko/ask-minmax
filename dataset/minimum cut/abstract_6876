We have examined in detail the nonrestoration of symmetry at high temperature
in a finite-temperature Littlest Higgs model, without and with T-parity, by
evaluating the one-loop-order finite-temperature integrals of the effective
potential numerically, without the high-temperature approximation, We observe
that in the model without T-parity it is not possible to find a transition
temperature within the allowed temperature range of the model (0<T<4f) if the
UV completion factors are those which give the Standard Model electroweak
minimum, as the effective potential always increases with temperature in the
positive direction. However, in the case of the model with T-parity, it is
possible to find a transition temperature with the same set of UV completion
factors, as, with the increase of temperature, the effective potential
decreases in magnitude in the positive side, becomes negative, and increases in
magnitude in the negative side, indicating symmetry breaking at high
temperature. This type of symmetry nonrestoration at high temperature has been
observed earlier in some models involving pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The
behaviour of the global structure of the effective potential with T-parity in
the theory indicates a strong first order electroweak phase transition,
conducive to baryogenesis in the early universe.
