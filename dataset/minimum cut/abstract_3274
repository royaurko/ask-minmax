Ten new low mass companions have emerged from the Keck precision Doppler
velocity survey, with minimum (msini) masses ranging from 0.8 mjup to 0.34
msun. Five of these are planet candidates with msini < 12 mjup, two are brown
dwarf candidates with msini ~30 mjup, and three are low mass stellar
companions. Hipparcos astrometry reveals the orbital inclinations and masses
for three of the (more massive) companions, and it provides upper limits to the
masses for the rest. A new class of extrasolar planet is emerging,
characterized by nearly circular orbits and orbital radii greater than 1 AU.
The planet HD 4208b appears to be a member of this new class. The mass
distribution of extrasolar planets continues to exhibit a rapid rise from 10
mjup toward the lowest detectable masses near 1 msat.
