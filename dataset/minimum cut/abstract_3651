We use a time-dependent dynamical mean-field-hydrodynamic model to study the
formation of fermionic dark solitons in a trapped degenerate fermi gas mixed
with a Bose-Einstein condensate in a harmonic as well as a periodic
optical-lattice potential. The dark soliton with a "notch" in the probability
density with a zero at the minimum is simulated numerically as a nonlinear
continuation of the first vibrational excitation of the linear
mean-field-hydrodynamic equations, as suggested recently for pure bosons. We
study the free expansion of these dark solitons as well as the consequent
increase in the size of their central notch and discuss the possibility of
experimental observation of the notch after free expansion.
