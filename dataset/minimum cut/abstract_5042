A radiation detector based on plasma display panel technology, which is the
principal component of plasma television displays is presented. Plasma Panel
Sensor (PPS) technology is a variant of micropattern gas radiation detectors.
The PPS is conceived as an array of sealed plasma discharge gas cells which can
be used for fast response (O(5ns) per pixel), high spatial resolution detection
(pixel pitch can be less than 100 micrometer) of ionizing and minimum ionizing
particles. The PPS is assembled from non-reactive, intrinsically radiation-hard
materials: glass substrates, metal electrodes and inert gas mixtures. We report
on the PPS development program, including simulations and design and the first
laboratory studies which demonstrate the usage of plasma display panels in
measurements of cosmic ray muons, as well as the expansion of experimental
results on the detection of betas from radioactive sources.
