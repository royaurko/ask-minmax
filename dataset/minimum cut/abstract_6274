We present new observations at three frequencies (326 MHz, 615 MHz, and 1281
MHz) of the radio lobe spiral galaxy, NGC 3079, using the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope. These observations are consistent with previous data obtained at
other telescopes and reveal the structure of the nuclear radio lobes in
exquisite detail. In addition, new features are observed, some with HI
counterparts, showing broad scale radio continuum emission and extensions. The
galaxy is surrounded by a radio halo that is at least 4.8 kpc in height. Two
giant radio extensions/loops are seen on either side of the galaxy out to
$\sim$ 11 kpc from the major axis, only slightly offset from the direction of
the smaller nuclear radio lobes. If these are associated with the nuclear
outflow, then the galaxy has experienced episodic nuclear activity. Emission
along the southern major axis suggests motion through a local IGM (not yet
detected) and it may be that NGC 3079 is itself creating this local
intergalactic gas via outflows. We also present maps of the minimum energy
parameters for this galaxy, including cosmic ray energy density, electron
diffusion length, magnetic field strength, particle lifetime, and power.
