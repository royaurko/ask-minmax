We investigate the renormalization group(RG) evolution for the neutral scalar
field theory in the broken symmetry phase. By using the minimum condition of
the vacuum expectation value(VEV), we show that the RG evlution of the
effective potential in the broken symmetry phase is governed by the same RG
functions in case of the symmetric phase.
