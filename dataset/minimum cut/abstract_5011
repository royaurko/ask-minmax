Enhanced electron cooling is demonstrated in a
strained-silicon/superconductor tunnel junction refrigerator of volume 40 um^3.
The electron temperature is reduced from 300 mK to 174 mK, with the enhancement
over an unstrained silicon control (300 mK to 258 mK) being attributed to the
smaller electron-phonon coupling in the strained case. Modeling and the
resulting predictions of silicon-based cooler performance are presented.
Further reductions in the minimum temperature are expected if the junction
sub-gap leakage and tunnel resistance can be reduced. However, if only tunnel
resistance is reduced, Joule heating is predicted to dominate.
