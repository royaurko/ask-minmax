We report results of a search for planets around 500 main sequence stars
using the Keck high resolution spectrometer which has provided Doppler
precision of 3 m/s during the past 3 yr. We report 6 new strong planet
candidates having complete Keplerian orbits, with periods ranging from 24 d to
3 yr. We also provide updated orbital parameters for 4 previously announced
planets. Four of the six newly discovered planets have minimum Msini masses
less than 2 Mjup, while the remaining two have Msini $\sim$ 5 Mjup. The
distribution of planetary masses continues to exhibit a rise toward lower
masses. The orbital eccentricities of the new planets range from 0.12 to 0.71
which also continues the ubiquity of high eccentricities. All 18 known
extrasolar planets orbiting beyond 0.2 AU have eccentricities greater than
$\sim$0.1. The current limiting Doppler precision of the Keck Doppler survey is
3 m/s per observation as determined from observations of both stable stars and
residuals to Keplerian fits.
