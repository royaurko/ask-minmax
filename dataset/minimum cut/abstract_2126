Using a variant of parallel tempering, we study the changes in sampling
within a simulation when the all-atom model is coupled to a Go-like potential.
We find that the native structure is not the lowest-energy configuration in the
all-atom force field. Adding a Go-term deforms the energy landscape in a way
that the native configuration becomes the global minimum.
