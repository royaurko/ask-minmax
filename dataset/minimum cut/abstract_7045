We present the discovery of substellar-mass companions to three giant stars
by the ongoing Penn State-Toru\'n Planet Search (PTPS) conducted with the 9.2 m
Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The most massive of the three stars, K2-giant HD
240237, has a 5.3 MJ minimum mass companion orbiting the star at a 746-day
period. The K0-giant BD +48 738 is orbited by a > 0.91 MJ planet which has a
period of 393 days and shows a non-linear, long-term radial velocity trend that
indicates a presence of another, more distant companion, which may have a
substellar mass or be a low-mass star. The K2-giant HD 96127, has a > 4.0 MJ
mass companion in a 647-day orbit around the star. The two K2-giants exhibit a
significant RV noise that complicates the detection of low-amplitude, periodic
variations in the data. If the noise component of the observed RV variations is
due to solar-type oscillations, we show, using all the published data for the
substellar companions to giants, that its amplitude is anti-correlated with
stellar metallicity.
