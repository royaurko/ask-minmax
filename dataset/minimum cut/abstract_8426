Initially designed to discover short-period planets, the N2K campaign has
since evolved to discover new worlds at large separations from their host
stars. Detecting such worlds will help determine the giant planet occurrence at
semi-major axes beyond the ice line, where gas giants are thought to mostly
form. Here we report four newly-discovered gas giant planets (with minimum
masses ranging from 0.4 to 2.1 MJup) orbiting stars monitored as part of the
N2K program. Two of these planets orbit stars already known to host planets: HD
5319 and HD 11506. The remaining discoveries reside in previously-unknown
planetary systems: HD 10442 and HD 75784. The refined orbital period of the
inner planet orbiting HD 5319 is 641 days. The newly-discovered outer planet
orbits in 886 days. The large masses combined with the proximity to a 4:3 mean
motion resonance make this system a challenge to explain with current formation
and migration theories. HD 11506 has one confirmed planet, and here we confirm
a second. The outer planet has an orbital period of 1627.5 days, and the
newly-discovered inner planet orbits in 223.6 days. A planet has also been
discovered orbiting HD 75784 with an orbital period of 341.7 days. There is
evidence for a longer period signal; however, several more years of
observations are needed to put tight constraints on the Keplerian parameters
for the outer planet. Lastly, an additional planet has been detected orbiting
HD 10442 with a period of 1043 days.
