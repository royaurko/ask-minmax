We show that the usual dilaton dominance scenario, derived from the tree
level K\"ahler potential, can never correspond to a global minimum of the
potential at $V=0$. Similarly, it cannot correspond to a local minimum either,
unless a really big conspiracy of different contributions to the superpotential
$W(S)$ takes place. These results, plus the fact that the K\"ahler potential is
likely to receive sizeable string non-perturbative contributions, strongly
suggest to consider a more general scenario, leaving the K\"ahler potential
arbitrary. In this way we obtain generalized expressions for the soft breaking
terms but a predictive scenario still arises. Finally, we explore the
phenomenological capability of some theoretically motivated forms for
non-perturbative K\"ahler potentials, showing that it is easy to stabilize the
dilaton at the realistic value $S\sim 2$ with just one condensate and no
fine-tuning.
