Formation of planets in the 47 UMa system is followed in an evolving
protoplanetary disk composed of gas and solids. The evolution of the disk is
calculated from an early stage, when all solids, assumed to be high-temperature
silicates, are in the dust form, to the stage when most solids are locked in
planetesimals. The simulation of planetary evolution starts with a solid embryo
of ~1 Earth mass, and proceeds according to the core accretion -- gas capture
model. Orbital parameters are kept constant, and it is assumed that the
environment of each planet is not perturbed by the second planet. It is found
that conditions suitable for both planets to form within several Myr are easily
created, and maintained throughout the formation time, in disks with $\alpha
\approx 0.01$. In such disks, a planet of 2.6 Jupiter masses (the minimum for
the inner planet of the 47 UMa system) may be formed at 2.1 AU from the star in
\~3 Myr, while a planet of 0.89 Jupiter masses (the minimum for the outer
planet) may be formed at 3.95 AU from the star in about the same time. The
formation of planets is possible as a result of a significant enhancement of
the surface density of solids between 1.0 and 4.0 AU, which results from the
evolution of a disk with an initially uniform gas-to-dust ratio of 167 and an
initial radius of 40 AU.
