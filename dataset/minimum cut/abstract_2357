We report a detailed investigation on the generation of pulse pairs during
the readout of a coherence grating stored in a cold atomic ensemble. The pulse
shapes and the split of the retrieved energy between the two pulses are studied
as a function of the relative intensities of the two reading fields, and a
minimum is observed for the total retrieved energy. We introduce a simplified
analytical theory for the process, considering a three-level atomic system,
which explains all the most striking experimental features.
