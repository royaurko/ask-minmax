We show that for (systematic) linear codes the time complexity of unique
decoding is O(n^{2}q^{nRH(delta/2/R)}) and the time complexity of minimum
distance decoding is O(n^{2}q^{nRH(delta/R)}). The proposed algorithm inspects
all error patterns in the information set of the received message of weight
less than d/2 or d, respectively.
