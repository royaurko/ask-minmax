We present the discovery of two Saturn-mass companions to HD108147 and
HD168746. Both belong to the lightest ever discovered planets. The minimum mass
of the companion to HD168746 is of only 0.77 the mass of Saturn and its orbital
period is 6.4 days. The companion to HD108147 orbits its parent star in 10.9
days and its minimum mass is 1.34 that of Saturn. Its orbit is characterized by
a high eccentricity, e=0.50, indicating possibly the presence of a second
companion. The detection of Saturn-mass planets by means of the Doppler
technique demands high radial-velocity measurement precision. The two new
candidates were discovered by means of the CORALIE echelle spectrograph. The
instrumental accuracy of CORALIE combined with the simultaneous ThAr-reference
technique has reached a level better than 3m/s. On many observed objects the
precision is now limited by photon noise. We present in this paper the weighted
cross-correlation technique, which leads to an improvement in the photon noise
of the computed radial velocity. We discuss as well a modification of the
numerical cross-correlation mask which reduces significantly the residual
perturbation effects produced by telluric absorption lines.
