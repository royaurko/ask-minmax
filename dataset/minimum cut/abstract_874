Bounds on the minimum degree and on the number of vertices at- taining it
have been much studied for finite edge-/vertex-minimally k-
connected/k-edge-connected graphs. We give an overview of the results known for
finite graphs, and show that most of these carry over to infinite graphs if we
consider ends of small degree as well as vertices.
