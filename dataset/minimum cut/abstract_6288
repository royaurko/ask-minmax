We present results on the physical states of three high-redshift powerful
radio galaxies (3C 292 at z=0.7, 3C 184 at z=1, and 3C322 at z=1.7). They were
obtained by combining radio measurements with X-ray measurements from
XMM-Newton that separate spectrally and/or spatially radio-related and hot-gas
X-ray emission. Originally observed as part of a programme to trace clusters of
galaxies at high redshift, none of the sources is found to lie in a rich
X-ray-emitting environment similar to those of some powerful radio galaxies at
low redshift, although the estimated gas pressures are sufficient to confine
the radio lobes. The weak gas emission is a particularly interesting result for
3C 184, where a gravitational arc is seen, suggesting the presence of a very
massive cluster. Here Chandra data complement the XMM-Newton measurements in
spatially separating X-ray extended emission from that associated with the
nucleus and rather small radio source. 3C 292 is the source for which the
X-ray-emitting gas is measured with the greatest accuracy, and its temperature
of 2 keV and luminosity of 6.5E43 erg/s are both characteristic of a poor
cluster. This source allows the most accurate measurement of inverse-Compton
X-ray emission associated with the radio lobes. In all structures where the
magnetic-field strength can be estimated through combining measurements of
radio-synchrotron and inverse-Compton-X-ray emission, the field strengths are
consistent with sources being in a state of minimum total energy.
