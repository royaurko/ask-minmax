Non-Fermi liquid behaviour in single-crystalline U2Pt2In has been studied by
means of resistivity experiments (I||c) under hydrostatic pressure (P<1.5 GPa).
At ambient pressure the resistivity rho(T) follows a power law rho~T^alpha with
alpha~0.5. Upon applying pressure alpha increases. For P>1 GPa a minimum
develops in rho(T). A study of the field dependence of the minimum confirms its
magnetic origin. The ratio c/a is proposed as the effective control parameter,
rather than the unit cell volume.
