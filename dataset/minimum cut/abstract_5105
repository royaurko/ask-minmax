We study a recently proposed running kinetic inflation model in which the
inflaton potential becomes flat due to rapid growth of the kinetic term at
large inflaton field values. As concrete examples, we build a variety of
chaotic inflation models in supergravity with e.g. quadratic, linear, and
fractional-power potentials. The power of the potential generically increases
after inflation, and the inflaton is often massless at the potential minimum in
the supersymmetric limit, which leads to many interesting phenomena. First, the
light inflaton mass greatly relaxes severe thermal and non-thermal gravitino
problems. Secondly, the kination epoch is naturally present after inflation,
which may enhance the gravity waves. Thirdly, since the inflaton is light, it
is likely coupled to the Higgs sector for successful reheating. The inflaton
and its superpartner, inflatino, may be produced at the LHC. Interestingly, the
inflatino can be dark matter, if it is the lightest supersymmetric particle.
