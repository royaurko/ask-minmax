The finite intrinsic nature of the most distributed algorithms gives us this
ability to use model checking tools for verification of this type of
algorithms. In this paper, I attempt to use NuSMV as a model checking tool for
verifying necessary properties of Peterson's algorithm for leader election
problem in a unidirectional asynchronous ring topology. Peterson's algorithm
for an asynchronous ring supposes that each node in the ring has a unique ID
and also a queue for dealing with storage problem. By considering that the
queue can have any combination of values, a constructed model for a ring with
only four nodes will have more than a billion states. Although it seems that
model checking is not a feasible approach for this problem, I attempt to use
several effective limiting assumptions for hiring formal model checking
approach without losing the correct functionality of the Peterson's algorithm.
These enforced limiting assumptions target the degree of freedom in the model
checking process and significantly decrease the CPU time, memory usage and the
total number of page faults. By deploying these limitations, the number of
nodes can be increased from four to eight in the model checking process with
NuSMV.
