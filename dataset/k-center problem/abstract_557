Multi-agent systems are currently applied to solve complex problems. The
security of networks is an eloquent example of a complex and difficult problem.
A new model-concept Hybrid Sensitive Robot Metaheuristic for Intrusion
Detection is introduced in the current paper. The proposed technique could be
used with machine learning based intrusion detection techniques. The new model
uses the reaction of virtual sensitive robots to different stigmergic variables
in order to keep the tracks of the intruders when securing a sensor network.
