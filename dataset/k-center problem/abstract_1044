The numerical integration of the Nose-Hoover dynamics gives a deterministic
method that is used to sample the canonical Gibbs measure. The Nose-Hoover
dynamics extends the physical Hamiltonian dynamics by the addition of a
"thermostat" variable, that is coupled nonlinearly with the physical variables.
The accuracy of the method depends on the dynamics being ergodic. Numerical
experiments have been published earlier that are consistent with non-ergodicity
of the dynamics for some model problems. The contributors recently proved the
non-ergodicity of the Nose-Hoover dynamics for the one-dimensional harmonic
oscillator.
  In this paper, this result is extended to non-harmonic one-dimensional
systems. It is also shown for some multidimensional systems that the averaged
dynamics for the limit of infinite thermostat "mass" have many invariants, thus
giving theoretical support for either non-ergodicity or slow ergodization.
Numerical experiments for a two-dimensional central force problem and the
one-dimensional pendulum problem give evidence for non-ergodicity.
