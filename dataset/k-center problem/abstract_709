In this paper we establish some bounds on the complexity of disjunctive
normal forms of boolean function from narrow subclasses (e.g. functions takes
value 0 in a limited number of points). The bounds are obtained by reduction
the initial problem to a simple set covering problem. The nature of the
complexity bounds provided is tightly connected with Shannon effect and
semi-effect for this classes.
