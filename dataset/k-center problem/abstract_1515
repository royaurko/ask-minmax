The development of fast numerical methods for multilevel radiative transfer
(RT) applications often leads to important breakthroughs in astrophysics,
because they allow the investigation of problems that could not be properly
tackled using the methods previously available. Probably, the most familiar
example is the so-called Multilevel Accelerated $\Lambda$-Iteration (MALI)
technique of Rybicki & Hummer for the case of a local approximate operator,
which is based on Jacobi iteration. However, there are superior
operator-splitting methods, based on Gauss-Seidel (GS) and Successive
Overrelaxation (SOR) iteration, which provide a dramatic increase in the speed
with which non-LTE multilevel transfer problems can be solved in one, two and
three-dimensional geometries. Such RT methods, which were introduced by
Trujillo Bueno & Fabiani Bendicho ten years ago, are the main subject of the
first part of this paper. We show in some detail how they can be applied for
solving multilevel RT problems in spherical geometry, for both atomic and
molecular line transitions. The second part of the article addresses the issue
of the calculation of the molecular number densities when the approximation of
instantaneous chemical equilibrium turns out to be inadequate, which happens to
be the case whenever the dynamical time scales of the astrophysical plasma
under consideration are much shorter than the time needed by the molecules to
form.
