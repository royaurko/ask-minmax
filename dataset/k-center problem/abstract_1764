Random walks in random environments (RWRE's) have been a source of surprising
phenomena and challenging problems since they began to be studied in the 70's.
Hitting times and, more recently, certain regeneration structures, have played
a major role in our understanding of RWRE's. We review these and provide some
hints on current research directions and challenges.
