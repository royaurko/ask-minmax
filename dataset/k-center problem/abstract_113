The recent progress in the understanding of the landscape of string theory
vacua hints that the hierarchy problem might be the problem of a
super-selection rule. The attractor mechanism gives a possibility to explain
the choice of a vacuum. We consider a toy model of self-interacting membranes
and show that for a very generic interaction there are attractor solutions.
