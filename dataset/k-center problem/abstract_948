Injecting spins into a semiconductor channel and transforming the spin
information into a significant electrical output signal is a long standing
problem in spintronics. Actually, this is the prerequisite of several concepts
of spin transistor. In this tutorial article, we discuss the general problem of
spin transport in a nonmagnetic channel between source and drain. Two problems
must be mastered: i) In the diffusive regime, the injection of a spin polarized
current from a magnetic metal beyond the ballistic transport zone requires the
insertion of a spin dependent and large enough interface resistance. ii) In
both the diffusive and ballistic regimes, and whatever the metallic or
semiconducting character of the source/drain, a small enough interface
resistance is the condition to keep the dwell time shorter than the spin
lifetime and thus to conserve the spin accumulation-induced output signal at an
optimum level. Practically, the main difficulties come from the second
condition. In our presentation of experimental results, we show why the
transformation of spin information into a large electrical signal has been more
easily achieved with carbon nanotubes than with semiconductors and we discuss
how the situation could be improved in the later case.
