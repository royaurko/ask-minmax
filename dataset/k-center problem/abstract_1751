Results on singular products of the distributions $x_{\pm}^{-p}$ and $x^{-p}$
for natural $p$ are derived when the products are balanced so that their sum
exists in the distribution space. These results follow the pattern of a known
distributional product published by Jan Mikusi\'nski in 1966. The results are
obtained in Colombeau algebra of generalized functions, which is most relevant
algebraic construction for tackling nonlinear problems of Schwartz
distributions.
