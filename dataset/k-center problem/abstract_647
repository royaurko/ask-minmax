We study cohomological obstructions to the existence of global conserved
quantities. In particular, we show that, if a given local variational problem
is supposed to admit global solutions, certain cohomology classes cannot appear
as obstructions. Vice versa, we obtain a new type of cohomological obstruction
to the existence of global solutions for a variational problem.
