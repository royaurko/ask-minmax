We address problem of determining edge weights on a graph using
non-backtracking closed walks from a vertex. We show that the weights of all of
the edges can be determined from any starting vertex exactly when the graph has
minimum degree at least three. We also determine the minimum number of walks
required to reveal all edge weights.
