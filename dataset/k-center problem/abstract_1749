For certain real hypersurfaces in the projective space, of signature (1,n),
we study the filling problem for small deformations of the CR structure (the
other signatures being well understood). We characterize the deformations which
are fillable, and prove that they have infinite codimension in the set of all
CR structures. This result generalizes the cases of the 3-sphere and of
signature (1,1) to higher dimension.
