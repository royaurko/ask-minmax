We add a divergence-free drift with increasing magnitude to the fractional
Laplacian on a bounded smooth domain, and discuss the behavior of the principal
eigenvalue for the Dirichlet problem. The eigenvalue remains bounded if and
only if the drift has non-trivial first integrals in the domain of the
quadratic form of the fractional Laplacian.
