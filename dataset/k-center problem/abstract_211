We formulate the problem of the Fermi Edge Singularity in non-equilibrium
states of a Fermi gas as a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem with an integrable
kernel. This formulation is the most suitable for studying the singular
behavior at each edge of non-equilibrium Fermi states by means of the method of
steepest descent, and also reveals the integrable structure of the problem. We
supplement this result by extending the familiar approach to the problem of the
Fermi Edge Singularity via the bosonic representation of the electronic
operators to non-equilibrium settings. It provides a compact way to extract the
leading asymptotes.
