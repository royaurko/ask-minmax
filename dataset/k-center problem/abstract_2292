Extended objects in GR are often modelled using distributional solutions of
the Einstein equations with point-like sources, or as the limit of
infinitesimally small "test" objects. In this note, I will consider models of
finite self-gravitating extended objects, which make it possible to give a
rigorous treatment of the initial value problem for (finite) extended objects.
