Stewart reduced the problem of determining all Lucas and Lehmer sequences
whose $n$-th element does not have a primitive divisor to solving certain Thue
equations. Using the method of Tzanakis and de Weger for solving Thue
equations, we determine such sequences for $n \leq 30$. Further computations
lead us to conjecture that, for $n > 30$, the $n$-th element of such sequences
always has a primitive divisor.
