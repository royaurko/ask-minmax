We consider a generalized version of Knuth's parking problem, in which
caravans consisting of a number of cars arrive at random on the unit circle.
Then each car turns clockwise until it finds a free space to park. Extending a
recent work by Chassaing and Louchard, we relate the asymptotics for the sizes
of blocks formed by occupied spots with the dynamics of the additive
coalescent. According to the behavior of the caravan's size tail distribution,
several qualitatively different versions of eternal additive coalescent are
involved.
