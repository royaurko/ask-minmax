We study the dynamics of the two-point statistics of the Kraichnan ensemble
which describes the transport of a passive pollutant by a stochastic turbulent
flow characterized by scale invariant structure functions. The fundamental
equation of this problem consists in the Fokker-Planck equation for the
two-point correlation function of the density of particles performing spatially
correlated Brownian motions with scale invariant correlations. This problem is
equivalent to the stochastic motion of an effective particle driven by a
generic multiplicative noise. In this paper we propose an alternative and more
intuitive approach to the problem than the original one leading to the same
conclusions. The general features of this new approach make possible to fit it
to other more complex contexts.
