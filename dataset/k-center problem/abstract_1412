By means of a linear scaling of the variables we convert a singular
bifurcation equation in $\R^n$ into an equivalent equation to which the
classical implicit function theorem can be directly applied. This allows to
deduce the existence of a unique branch of solutions as well as a relevant
property of the spectrum of the derivative of the singular bifurcation equation
along the branch. We use these results to show the existence, uniqueness and
the asymptotic stability of periodic solutions of a $T$-periodically perturbed
autonomous system bifurcating from a $T$-periodic limit cycle of the autonomous
unperturbed system. This problem is classical, but the novelty of the method
proposed is that it allows us to solve the problem without any reduction of the
dimension of the state space as it is usually done in the literature by means
of the Lyapunov-Schmidt method.
