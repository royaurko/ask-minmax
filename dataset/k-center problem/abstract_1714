I present an overview of the standard model, concentrating on its global
continuous symmetries, both exact and approximate. There are four lectures,
dedicated to spacetime symmetry, flavor symmetry, custodial symmetry, and scale
symmetry. Topics include Weyl, Majorana, and Dirac spinors; massive neutrinos;
electroweak symmetry breaking; effective field theory; and the hierarchy
problem.
