We develop a new theory for treating boundary problems for linear ordinary
differential equations whose fundamental system may have a singularity at one
of the two endpoints of the given interval. Our treatment follows an algebraic
approach, with (partial) implementation in the Theorema software system (which
is based on Mathematica). We study an application to graded Kirchhoff plates
for illustrating a typical case of such boundary problems.
