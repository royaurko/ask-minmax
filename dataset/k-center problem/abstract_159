In this article we introduce a new class of non-Archimedean
pseudodifferential equations of Klein-Gordon type and study the corresponding
Cauchy problem for these equations. A remarkable fact is that the
non-Archimedean Klein-Gordon equations exhibit many similar properties to the
classical Klein-Gordon equations.
