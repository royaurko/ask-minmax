We outline the modified formulation of baryon chiral effective field theory
for nucleon-nucleon scattering and discuss the issue of a possible power
counting violation by the nucleon mass. We also present the results for the
quark mass dependence of the $^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$ scattering lengths and the
deuteron binding energy at leading order.
