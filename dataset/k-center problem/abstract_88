This paper provides a probabilistic approach to solve boundary value problems
involving Caputo and Riemann-Liouville type derivatives. Using the
probabilistic interpretation of these operators as generators of interrupted
Feller processes, we obtain well-posedness results and explicit solutions (in
terms of the transition densities of the underlying stochastic processes) for
these problems. The problems studied here include fractional linear
differential equations, well analyzed in the literature, as well as their far
reaching extensions.
