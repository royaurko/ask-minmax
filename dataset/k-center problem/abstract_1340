The workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) asks whether there exists an
assignment of contributorised users to the steps in a workflow specification,
subject to certain constraints on the assignment. (Such an assignment is called
valid.) The problem is NP-hard even when restricted to the large class of
user-independent constraints. Since the number of steps $k$ is relatively small
in practice, it is natural to consider a parametrisation of the WSP by $k$. We
propose a new fixed-parameter algorithm to solve the WSP with user-independent
constraints. The assignments in our method are partitioned into equivalence
classes such that the number of classes is exponential in $k$ only. We show
that one can decide, in polynomial time, whether there is a valid assignment in
an equivalence class. By exploiting this property, our algorithm reduces the
search space to the space of equivalence classes, which it browses within a
backtracking framework, hence emerging as an efficient yet relatively
simple-to-implement or generalise solution method. We empirically evaluate our
algorithm against the state-of-the-art methods and show that it clearly wins
the competition on the whole range of our test problems and significantly
extends the domain of practically solvable instances of the WSP.
