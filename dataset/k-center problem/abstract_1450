This paper presents a novel shooting algorithm for solving two-point Boundary
Value Problems (BVPs) for ordinary differential equations. The algorithm
includes the following steps: First, a value for the initial condition at the
first boundary is guessed and a forward numerical integration of the
differential equation is performed so that an Initial Value Problem (IVP)
solution, called a shooting trajectory, is obtained. The shooting trajectory
starts from the first boundary constraint but typically does not end at the
second boundary constraint. Next, the shooting trajectory is transformed into a
projection trajectory that is an approximate BVP solution. The projection
trajectory satisfies both boundary constraints and has the same second
derivative as the shooting trajectory. Finally, the projection trajectory is
used to correct the value of the initial condition and the procedure is
repeated until convergence.
