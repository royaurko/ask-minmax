By analytical mapping of the eigenvalue problem in rough billiards on to a
band random matrix model a new regime of Wigner ergodicity is found. There the
eigenstates are extended over the whole energy surface but have a strongly
peaked structure. The results of numerical simulations and implications for
level statistics are also discussed.
