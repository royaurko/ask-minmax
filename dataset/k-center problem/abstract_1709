We address the problem of baryon number violation in Randall-Sundrum
backgrounds and provide a solution leading to a stable light Kaluza--Klein
fermion in warped GUT. This adds to the list of dark matter candidates which
stability can follow from ensuring proton stability in weak scale extensions of
the Standard Model
