We consider an SDE in R^m of the type dX(t)=a(X(t))dt+dU(t) with a L\'evy
process U and study the problem for the distribution of a solution to be
regular in various senses. We do not impose any specific conditions on the
L\'evy measure of the noise, and this is the main difference between our method
and the known methods by J.Bismut or J.Picard. The main tool in our approach is
the stochastic calculus of variations for a L\'evy process, based on the
time-stretching transformations of the trajectories. Three problems are solved
in this framework. First, we prove that if the drift coefficient a is
non-degenerated in an appropriate sense, then the law of the solution to the
Cauchy problem for the initial equation is absolutely continuous, as soon as
the L\'evy measure of the noise satisfies one of the rather weak intensity
conditions, for instance the so-called wide cone condition. Secondly, we
provide the sufficient conditions for the density of the distribution of the
solution to the Cauchy problem to be smooth in the terms of the family of the
so-called order indices of the L\'evy measure of the noise (the drift again is
supposed to be non-degenerated). At last, we show that an invariant
distribution to the initial equation, if exists, possesses a C^\infty-density
provided the drift is non-degenerated and the L\'evy measure of the noise
satisfies the wide cone condition.
