The use of Levi-Civita transformation allows us to formulate the problem of
two-dimensional screened donor states in a magnetic field as that of
two-dimensional anharmonic oscillator. Therefore, the operator method can be
directly used for the first problem and the exact solutions of Schrodinger
equation are obtained correspondently. In our approach, wave-functions are
constructed in the representation of annihilation and creation operators, which
permits one to use purely algebraic method in further calculations of other
characteristics. The considered problem is related to the motion of 2D electron
gas in GaAs/AlGaAs multiple-quantum well structures with the presence of a
magnetic field, which continues to provide new and fascinating phenomena.
