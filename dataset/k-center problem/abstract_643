We study existence and regularity properties of stable positive solutions to
the nonvariational problem - Delta u - b(x)|nabla u|^2 = lambda g(u) in a
bounded smooth domain. In the case where b is constant, by means of a Hopf-Cole
transformation, the problem can be taken to a variational form, for which there
are classical results of Crandall-Rabinowitz, Mignot-Puel and Brezis-Vazquez.
In this paper we obtain results for a general bounded function b=b(x) which
coincide with the classical ones in the constant b case.
