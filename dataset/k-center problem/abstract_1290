Time-stepping $hp$-versions discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the
numerical solution of fractional subdiffusion problems of order $-\alpha$ with
$-1<\alpha<0$ will be proposed and analyzed. Generic $hp$-version error
estimates are derived after proving the stability of the approximate solution.
For $h$-version DG approximations on appropriate graded meshes near$t=0$, we
prove that the error is of order$O(k^{\max\{2,p\}+\frac{\alpha}{2}})$, where
$k$ is the maximum time-step size and $p\ge 1$ is the uniform degree of the DG
solution. For $hp$-version DG approximations, by employing geometrically
refined time-steps and linearly increasing approximation orders, exponential
rates of convergence in the number of temporal degrees of freedom are shown.
  Finally, some numerical tests are given.
