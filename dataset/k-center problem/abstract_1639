Although indirect evidence for the presence of magnetic fields in high-mass
stars is regularly reported in the literature, the detection of these fields
remains an extremely challenging observational problem. We review the recent
discoveries of magnetic fields in different types of massive stars and briefly
discuss strategies for spectropolarimetric observations to be carried out in
the future.
