We proof existence theorems for the Dirichlet problem for hypersurfaces of
constant special Lagrangian curvature in Hadamard manifolds. The first results
are obtained using the continuity method and approximation and then refined
using two iterations of the Perron method. The a-priori estimates used in the
continuity method are valid in any ambient manifold.
