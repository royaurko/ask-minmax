A trademark of nonlinear, time-dependent, convection-dominated problems is
the spontaneous formation of non-smooth macro-scale features, like shock
discontinuities and non-differentiable kinks, which pose a challenge for
high-resolution computations. We overview recent developments of modern
computational methods for the approximate solution of such problems. In these
computations, one seeks piecewise smooth solutions which are realized by finite
dimensional projections. Computational methods in this context can be
classified into two main categories, of local and global methods. Local methods
are expressed in terms of point-values (-- Hamilton-Jacobi equations), cell
averages (-- nonlinear conservation laws), or higher localized moments. Global
methods are expressed in terms of global basis functions. High resolution
central schemes will be discussed as a prototype example for local methods. The
family of central schemes offers high-resolution ``black-box-solvers'' to an
impressive range of such nonlinear problems. The main ingredients here are
detection of spurious extreme values, non-oscillatory reconstruction in the
directions of smoothness, numerical dissipation and quadrature rules. Adaptive
spectral viscosity will be discussed as an example for high-resolution global
methods. The main ingredients here are detection of edges in spectral data,
separation of scales, adaptive reconstruction, and spectral viscosity.
