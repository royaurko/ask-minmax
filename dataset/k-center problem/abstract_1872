In this paper we consider the inverse scattering problem at a fixed energy
for the Schr\"odinger equation with a long-range potential in $\ere^d, d\geq
3$. We prove that the long-range part can be uniquely reconstructed from the
leading forward singularity of the scattering amplitude at some positive
energy.
