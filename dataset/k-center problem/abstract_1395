We here investigate a cosmological model in which three fluids interact with
each other involving certain coupling parameters and energy exchange rates. The
motivation of the problem stems from the puzzling `triple coincidence problem'
which naively asks why the cosmic energy densities of matter, radiation and
dark energy are almost of the same order of magnitude at the present time. In
our model, we determine the conditions under triple interacting fluids will
cross the phantom divide.
