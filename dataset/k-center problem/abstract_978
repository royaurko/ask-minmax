In the distributed coding of correlated sources, the problem of
characterizing the joint probability distribution of a pair of random variables
satisfying an n-letter Markov chain arises. The exact solution of this problem
is intractable. In this paper, we seek a single-letter necessary condition for
this n-letter Markov chain. To this end, we propose a new data processing
inequality on a new measure of correlation by means of spectrum analysis. Based
on this new data processing inequality, we provide a single-letter necessary
condition for the required joint probability distribution. We apply our results
to two specific examples involving the distributed coding of correlated
sources: multi-terminal rate-distortion region and multiple access channel with
correlated sources, and propose new necessary conditions for these two
problems.
