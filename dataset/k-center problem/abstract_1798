This paper deals with variety of problems in pcf theory and infinitary
combinatorics. We look at normal filters and prc, measures of the size of
[lambda]^{<kappa}, pcf-inaccessibility, entangled orders (and narrow Boolean
Algebras), measuring prod_{i<kappa}f(i) by a family of ideals and a family of
sequences <B_i:i<kappa> with |B_i|<mu_i, and finally we deal with the existence
of strongly almost disjoint families.
