In this paper, we will use results developed by Ansari and Enflo in the
theory of bounded linear operators with dense range. We define two maps, with
regards to some parameters, that control surjectivity default of a given
operator, and prove analycity for the first one and global continuity for the
other one. Minimisation results are also obtained in relation to this study.
