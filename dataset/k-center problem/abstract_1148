Taking into account the asymptotic behavior of some Wright functions and the
existence of bounds for the Mainardi and the Wright function
$W(-x,\frac{\alpha}{2}, 1)$ in $\mathbb{R}^+$ , three different
initial-boundary-value problems for the time-fractional diffusion equation in
the quarter plane, where the time-fractional derivative is taken in the Caputo
sense of order $\alpha$ $\in (0,1)$ are solved. Moreover, the limit when
$\alpha \nearrow 1$ of the respective solutions are analyzed, recovering the
respective solutions of the classical boundary-value problems when $\alpha=1$
and the fractional diffusion equation becomes the heat equation.
