Materials aspects of cuprate high-temperature superconductors (HTS) are
reviewed with respect to technical applications. The structural chemistry
common to all HTS and their critical temperatures for the onset of
superconductivity are presented. Intrinsic problems for the production of
technically applicable HTS materials are discussed and how these problems have
been overcome for a number of technically applicable HTS materials.
