We consider the degree-diameter problem for Cayley graphs of dihedral groups.
We find upper and lower bounds on the maximum number of vertices of such a
graph with diameter 2 and degree $d$. We completely determine the asymptotic
behaviour of this class of graphs by showing that both limits are
asymptotically $d^2/2$.
