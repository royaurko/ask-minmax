We consider the Cauchy problem for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equations (NLS) on the real line with a special subclass of almost periodic
functions as initial data. In particular, we prove global existence of
solutions to NLS with limit periodic functions as initial data under some
regularity assumption.
