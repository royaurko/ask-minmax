In this paper, using of the rigorous statement and rigorous proof the Maxwell
distribution as an example, we establish estimates of the distribution
depending on the parameter $N$, the number of particles. Further, we consider
the problem of the occurrence of dimers in a classical gas as an analog of Bose
condensation and establish estimates of the lower level of the analog of Bose
condensation. Using of the dequantization principles we find the relationship
of this level to "capture" theory in the scattering problem corresponding to an
interaction of the form of the Lennard-Jones potential. This also solves the
problem of the Gibbs paradox.
  We derive the equation of state for a nonideal gas as a result of pair
interactions of particles in Lennard-Jones models and, for classical gases,
discuss the $\lambda$-transition to the condensed state (the state in which
$V_{\text{sp}}$ does not vary with increasing pressure; for heat capacity, this
is the $\lambda$-point).
