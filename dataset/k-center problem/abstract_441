The mechanism responsible for the emergence of chaotic behavior has been
identified analytically within a class of three-dimensional dynamical systems
which generalize the well-known E.N. Lorenz 1963 system. The dynamics in the
phase space has been reformulated in terms of a first-exit-time problem. Chaos
emerges due to discontinuous solutions of a transcendental problem ruling the
time for a particle to cross a potential wall. Numerical results point toward
the genericity of the new found mechanism.
