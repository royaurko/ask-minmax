In the present note we discuss in details the Riemann problem for a
one--dimensional hyperbolic conservation law subject to a point constraint. We
investigate how the regularity of the constraint operator impacts the
well--posedness of the problem, namely in the case, relevant for numerical
applications, of a discretized exit capacity. We devote particular attention to
the case in which the constraint is given by a non--local operator depending on
the solution itself. We provide several explicit examples. We also give the
detailed proof of some results announced in the paper [Andreainov, Donadello,
Rosini, "Crowd dynamics and conservation laws with non--local point constraints
and capacity drop", which is devoted to existence and stability for a more
general class of Cauchy problems subject to Lipschitz continuous non--local
point constraints.
