Now no web search engine can cover more than 60 percent of all the pages on
Internet. The update interval of most pages database is almost one month. This
condition hasn't changed for many years. Converge and recency problems have
become the bottleneck problem of current web search engine. To solve these
problems, a new system, search engine based on DNS is proposed in this paper.
This system adopts the hierarchical distributed architecture like DNS, which is
different from any current commercial search engine. In theory, this system can
cover all the web pages on Internet. Its update interval could even be one day.
The original idea, detailed content and implementation of this system all are
introduced in this paper.
