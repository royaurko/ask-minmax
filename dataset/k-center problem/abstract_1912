We investigate Fano-type anomalous transmission of energy of plane waves
across lossless slab scatterers with periodic structure in the presence of
non-robust guided modes. Our approach is based on rigorous analytic
perturbation of the scattering problem near a guided mode and applies to very
general structures, continuous and discrete.
