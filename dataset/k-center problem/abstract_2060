Two boundary value problems for an elliptic equation in divergence form with
bounded discontinuous coefficient are studied in a bidomain. On the interface,
generalized dynamic boundary conditions such as of the Wentzell-type and
Signorini-type transmission are considered in a subdifferential form. Several
non-constant coefficients and nonlinearities are the main objective of the
present work. Generalized solutions are built via time discretization.
