It has been conjectured that a complete set of mutually unbiased bases in a
space of dimension d exists if and only if there is an affine plane of order d.
We introduce affine constellations and compare their existence properties with
those of mutually unbiased constellations, mostly in dimension six. The
observed discrepancies make a deeper relation between the two existence
problems unlikely.
