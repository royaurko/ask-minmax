Demixing refers to the challenge of identifying two structured signals given
only the sum of the two signals and prior information about their structures.
Examples include the problem of separating a signal that is sparse with respect
to one basis from a signal that is sparse with respect to a second basis, and
the problem of decomposing an observed matrix into a low-rank matrix plus a
sparse matrix. This paper describes and analyzes a framework, based on convex
optimization, for solving these demixing problems, and many others. This work
introduces a randomized signal model which ensures that the two structures are
incoherent, i.e., generically oriented. For an observation from this model,
this approach identifies a summary statistic that reflects the complexity of a
particular signal. The difficulty of separating two structured, incoherent
signals depends only on the total complexity of the two structures. Some
applications include (i) demixing two signals that are sparse in mutually
incoherent bases; (ii) decoding spread-spectrum transmissions in the presence
of impulsive errors; and (iii) removing sparse corruptions from a low-rank
matrix. In each case, the theoretical analysis of the convex demixing method
closely matches its empirical behavior.
