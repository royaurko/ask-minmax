We study one-dimensional motions of polytropic gas governed by the
compressible Euler equations. The problem on the half space under a constant
gravity gives an equilibrium which has free boundary touching the vacuum and
the linearized approximation at this equilibrium gives time periodic solutions.
But it is not easy to justify the existence of long-time true solutions for
which this time periodic solution is the first approximation. The situation is
in contrast to the problem of free motions without gravity. The reason is that
the usual iteration method for quasilinear hyperbolic problem cannot be used
because of the loss of regularities which causes from the touch with the
vacuum. Interestingly, the equation can be transformed to a nonlinear wave
equation on a higher dimensional space, for which the space dimension, being
larger than 4, is related to the adiabatic exponent of the original
one-dimensional problem. We try to find a family of solutions expanded by a
small parameter. Applying the Nash-Moser theory, we justify this expansion.The
application of the Nash-Moser theory is necessary for the sake of conquest of
the trouble with loss of regularities, and the justification of the
applicability requires a very delicate analysis of the problem.
