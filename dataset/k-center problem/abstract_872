This paper treats the problem of screening a p-variate sample for strongly
and multiply connected vertices in the partial correlation graph associated
with the the partial correlation matrix of the sample. This problem, called hub
screening, is important in many applications ranging from network security to
computational biology to finance to social networks. In the area of network
security, a node that becomes a hub of high correlation with neighboring nodes
might signal anomalous activity such as a coordinated flooding attack. In the
area of computational biology the set of hubs of a gene expression correlation
graph can serve as potential targets for drug treatment to block a pathway or
modulate host response. In the area of finance a hub might indicate a
vulnerable financial instrument or sector whose collapse might have major
repercussions on the market. In the area of social networks a hub of observed
interactions between criminal suspects could be an influential ringleader. The
techniques and theory presented in this paper permit scalable and reliable
screening for such hubs. This paper extends our previous work on correlation
screening [arXiv:1102.1204] to the more challenging problem of partial
correlation screening for variables with a high degree of connectivity. In
particular we consider 1) extension to the more difficult problem of screening
for partial correlations exceeding a specified magnitude; 2) extension to
screening variables whose vertex degree in the associated partial correlation
graph, often called the concentration graph, exceeds a specified degree.
