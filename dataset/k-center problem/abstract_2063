The stability question of the Lane-Emden stationary gaseous star
configurations is an interesting problem arising in astrophysics. We establish
both linear and nonlinear dynamical instability results for the Lane-Emden
solutions in the framework of the Navier-Stokes-Poisson system with adiabatic
exponent $6/5 < \gamma < 4/3$.
