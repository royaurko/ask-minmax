We discuss the possibility of deriving an H-theorem for the nonlinear
discrete time evolution known as Ulam's redistribution of energy problem. In
this model particles are paired at random and then their total energy is
redistributed between them according to some probability law. It appears
possible to obtain the proper H-function which always increases during the
relaxation only for a special set of redistribution laws, given by symmetric
beta distributions. This H-function differs from the usual entropy by an
additional term that vanishes only for the uniform redistribution law. But for
arbitrary redistribution the evolution has some features of relaxation to a
non-equilibrium steady state and the H-function is still unknown.
