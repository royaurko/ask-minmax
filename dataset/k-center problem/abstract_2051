We put forward a formal model of anonymous systems. And we concentrate on the
anonymous failure detectors in our model. In particular, we give three examples
of anonymous failure detectors and show that they can be used to solve the
consensus problem and that they are equivalent to their classic counterparts.
Moreover, we show some relationship among them and provide a simple
classification of anonymous failure detectors.
