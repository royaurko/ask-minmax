These notes are based on a mini-course given during the conference Particle
systems and PDE's - II which held at the Center of Mathematics of the
University of Minho in December 2013. We discuss the problem of normal and
anomalous diffusion of energy in systems of coupled oscillators perturbed by a
stochastic noise conserving energy.
