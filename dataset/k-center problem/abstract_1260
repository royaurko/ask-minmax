The relativistic three-nucleon problem is formulated by constructing a
dynamical unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group on the three-nucleon
Hilbert space. Two-body interactions are included that preserve the Poincar\'e
symmetry, lead to the same invariant two-body S-matrix as the corresponding
non-relativistic problem, and result in a three-body S-matrix satisfying
cluster properties. The resulting Faddeev equations are solved by direct
integration, without partial waves for both elastic and breakup reactions at
laboratory energies up to 2 Gev.
