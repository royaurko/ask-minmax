We present a new efficient algortithm for construction of linear latent
structure (LLS) models. This algorithm reduces a problem of estimation of model
parameters to a sequence of problems of linear algebra, which assures a low
computational complexity and ability to handle on desktop computers data that
involve up to thousands of variables.
