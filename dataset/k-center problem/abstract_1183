The recent paper by Mohr and Phillips (arXiv:1409.2794) describes several
problems relating to the treatment of angle measurement within SI, the unit
hertz, and quantities that can be considered countable (rather than
measureable). However, the proposals that they put forward bring new problems
of their own. This paper proposes alternative suggestions that solve the
problems less painfully. Specifically, clarifying the text on angle in the SI
brochure; relegating the hertz to a "Non-SI unit accepted for use with the
International System of Units", with specific application only for "revolutions
or cycles per second"; and encouraging countable quantities to be presented as
pure numbers, while requiring that a sufficient description of the quantity
being counted is given in the accompanying text.
