We consider $\G$-graded commutative algebras, where $\G$ is an abelian group.
Starting from a remarkable example of the classical algebra of quaternions and,
more generally, an arbitrary Clifford algebra, we develop a general viewpoint
on the subject. We then give a recent classification result and formulate an
open problem.
