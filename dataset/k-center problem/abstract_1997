The existence and multiplicity of positive periodic solutions for second
order non-autonomous singular dynamical systems are established with
superlinearity or sublinearity assumptions at infinity for an appropriately
chosen parameter. Our results provide a unified treatment for the problem and
significantly improve several results in the literature. The proof of our
results is based on the Krasnoselskii fixed point theorem in a cone.
