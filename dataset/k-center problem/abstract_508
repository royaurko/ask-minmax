We consider the motion of two superposed immiscible, viscous, incompressible,
capillary fluids that are separated by a sharp interface which needs to be
determined as part of the problem. Allowing for gravity to act on the fluids,
we prove local well-posedness of the problem. In particular, we obtain
well-posedness for the case where the heavy fluid lies on top of the light one,
that is, for the case where the Rayleigh-Taylor instability is present.
Additionally we show that solutions become real analytic instantaneously.
