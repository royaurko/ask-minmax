We study linear extremal problems in the Bergman space $A^p$ of the unit disc
for $p$ an even integer. Given a functional on the dual space of $A^p$ with
representing kernel $k \in A^q$, where $1/p + 1/q = 1$, we show that if the
Taylor coefficients of $k$ are sufficiently small, then the extremal function
$F \in H^{\infty}$. We also show that if $q \le q_1 < \infty$, then $F \in
H^{(p-1)q_1}$ if and only if $k \in H^{q_1}$. These results extend and provide
a partial converse to a theorem of Ryabykh.
