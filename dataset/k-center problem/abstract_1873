Various theoretical and algorithmic aspects of inverse problems in discrete
tomography of planar Penrose model sets are discussed. These are motivated by
the demand of materials science for the reconstruction of quasicrystalline
structures from a small number of images produced by quantitative high
resolution transmission electron microscopy.
