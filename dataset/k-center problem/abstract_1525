The use of an effective intermolecular potential often involves a compromise
between more accurate, complex functional forms and more tractable simple
representations. To study this choice in detail, we systematically derive
coarse-grained isotropic pair potentials that accurately reproduce the
oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function of the TIP4P-Ew water model at state
points over density ranges from 0.88-1.30g/cc and temperature ranges from
235K-310K. Although by construction these effective potentials correctly
represent the isothermal compressibility of TIP4P-Ew water, they do not
accurately resolve other thermodynamic properties such as the virial pressure,
the internal energy or thermodynamic anomalies. Because at a given state point
the pair potential that reproduces the pair structure is unique, we have
therefore explicitly demonstrated that it is impossible to simultaneously
represent the pair-structure and several key equilibrium thermodynamic
properties of water with state-point dependent radially symmetric pair
potentials. We argue that such representability problems are related to, but
different from, more widely acknowledged transferability problems, and discuss
in detail the implications this has for the modeling of water and other liquids
by coarse-grained potentials. Nevertheless, regardless of thermodynamic
inconsistencies, the state-point dependent effective potentials for water do
generate structural and dynamical anomalies.
