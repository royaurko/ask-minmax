We show, using a ranbow construction for cylindric algebras, that for any
class K between diagonal free cylindric algebras and polyadic equality algebras
of finite dimension > 2, there is no finite variable universal axiomatization
for the class of representable algebras. This solves an old open problem in
algebraic logic, formulated by Sain and Thompson back in 1990.
