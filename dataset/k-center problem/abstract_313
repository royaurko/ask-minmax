A single model is presented which represents both of the two apparently
unrelated localisation problems of the title. The phase diagram of this model
is examined using scaling ideas and numerical simulations. It is argued that
the localisation length in a spin-degenerate Landau level diverges at two
distinct energies, with the same critical behaviour as in a spin-split Landau
level, and that all states of a charged particle moving in two dimensions, in a
random magnetic field with zero average, are localised.
