We analyze an integro-differential initial value problem obtained as a
shadow-type limit from a system of reaction-diffusion-ODE equations modeling
pattern formation. We show that nonlocal terms in such models induce a
destabilization of stationary solutions, which may lead to a blowup of
spatially inhomogeneous solutions, either in finite or infinite time.
