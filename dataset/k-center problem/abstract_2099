In this note we look at the interdependences between James' theorem and the
boundary problem. To do so we show a variant of James' sup-theorem for
C(K)-spaces conjectured by Godefroy: in order to know that a bounded weakly
closed subset of a C(K)- space is weakly compact it is enough to test the
sup-attainment only for measures with countable support.
