At this project considers the problem of analysis temperature deformation of
elastic elements of the spacecraft. Spacecraft periodically appears in the
earth's shadow on the sunny side when moving from the orbit. Abruptly changing
the temperature field of large elastic elements can affect the dynamic
characteristics of the spacecraft. This is important when dealing with the
implementation of the gravity-sensitive processes on board.
