We study the well-posedness of the initial value problem for a wide class of
singular evolution equations. We prove a general well-posedness theorem under
three assumptions easy to check: the first controls the singular part of the
equation, the second the behavior of the nonlinearities, and the third one
assumes that an energy estimate can be found for the linearized system. We
allow losses of derivatives in this energy estimate and therefore construct a
solution by a Nash-Moser iterative scheme. As an application to this general
theorem, we prove the well-posedness of the Serre and Green-Naghdi equation and
discuss the problem of their validity as asymptotic models for the water-waves
equations.
