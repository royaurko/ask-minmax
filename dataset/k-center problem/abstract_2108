We consider the Cahn-Hilliard equation in one space dimension with scaling a
small parameter \epsilon and a non-convex potential W. In the limit \espilon
\to 0, under the assumption that the initial data are energetically
well-prepared, we show the convergence to a Stefan problem. The proof is based
on variational methods and exploits the gradient flow structure of the
Cahn-Hilliard equation.
