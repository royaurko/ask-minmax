The time-frequency content of a signal can be measured by the Gabor transform
or windowed Fourier transform. This is a function defined on phase space that
is computed by taking the Fourier transform of the product of the signal
against a translate of a fixed window. The problem of finding signals with
Gabor transform that are maximally concentrated within a given region of phase
space is discussed. It is well known that such problems give rise to an
eigenvalue problem for an associated self-adjoint, positive {\em concentration}
operator that has its spectrum contained in the unit interval. In this paper,
the asymptotic behavior of these eigenvalues as the concentration region gets
large is studied. The smoothness of the eigenfunctions is also examined.
