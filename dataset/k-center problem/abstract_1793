In Diophantine approximation, inhomogeneous problems are linked with
homogeneous ones by means of the so-called Transference Theorems. We revisit
this classical topic by introducing new exponents of Diophantine approximation.
We prove that the exponent of approximation to a generic point in R^n by a
system of n linear forms is equal to the inverse of the uniform homogeneous
exponent associated to the system of dual forms.
