A solution of the doublet-triplet splitting problem in the supersymmetric
$SU(6)$ gauge theory is suggested. The `missing doublet' multiplet -- 175-plet
of the $SU(6)$ group as well as the custodial $SU(2)_{cus}$ global symmetry
play crucial role for achieving the doublet-triplet hierarchy. Two examples in
which the doublet-triplet splitting occurs naturally are presented.
