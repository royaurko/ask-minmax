The problem of pattern formation in resonantly-enhanced near-field
lithography by the use of dielectric or plasmonic planar resonators is
investigated. Sub-diffraction-limited bright or dark spots can be produced by
taking advantage of the rotational invariance of planar resonators. To increase
the spatial bandwidth of the resonant enhancement, an array of coupled planar
resonators can open up a band of Bloch resonances, analogous to
coupled-resonator optical waveguides.
