The main purpose of this paper is to present new families of test statistics
for studying the problem of goodness-of-fit of some data to a latent class
model for binary data. The families of test statistics introduced are based on
phi-divergence measures, a natural extension of maximum likelihood. We also
treat the problem of testing a nested sequence of latent class models for
binary data. For these statistics, we obtain their asymptotic distribution. We
shall consider consistent estimators introduced in Felipe et al (2014) for
solving the problem of estimation. Finally, a simulation study is carried out
in order to compare the efficiency, in the sense of the level and the power, of
the new statistics considered in this paper for sample sizes that are not big
enough to apply the asymptotical results.
