We study a two-stage mixed-integer linear program (MILP) with more than 1
million binary variables in the second stage. We develop a two-level approach
by constructing a semi-coarse model (coarsened with respect to variables) and a
coarse model (coarsened with respect to both variables and constraints). We
coarsen binary variables by selecting a small number of pre-specified daily
on/off profiles. We aggregate constraints by partitioning them into groups and
summing over each group. With an appropriate choice of coarsened profiles, the
semi-coarse model is guaranteed to find a feasible solution of the original
problem and hence provides an upper bound on the optimal solution. We show that
solving a sequence of coarse models converges to the same upper bound with
proven finite steps. This is achieved by adding violated constraints to coarse
models until all constraints in the semi-coarse model are satisfied. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in cogeneration for buildings.
The coarsened models allow us to obtain good approximate solutions at a
fraction of the time required by solving the original problem. Extensive
numerical experiments show that the two-level approach scales to large problems
that are beyond the capacity of state-of-the-art commercial MILP solvers.
