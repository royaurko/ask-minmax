A method for obtaining simple criteria for instabilities in kinetic theory is
described and outlined, specifically for the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell
system. An important ingredient of the method is an analysis of a parametrized
set of averaging operators along trajectories. This leads to a connection with
similar problems in ergodic theory. In particular the rate of convergence in
the ergodic theorem is a common feature which is studied.
