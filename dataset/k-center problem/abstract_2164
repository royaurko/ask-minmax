Some affirmative answers are given to Huneke's problems. The calculation of
local cohomology modules with respect to an arbitrary pair of ideals $I,J$ can
be reduced to calculation of local cohomology modules with respect to a pair of
ideala whose first ideal is generated by any $k$-regular sequence in $I$.
