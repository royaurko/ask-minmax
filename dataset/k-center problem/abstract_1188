In general, a Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence establishes an isomorphism
between a moduli space of stable algebraic geometric objects and a moduli space
of solutions of a certain (generalized) Hermite-Einstein equation. We believe
that, for a large class of moduli problems, this correspondence respects the
virtual fundamental classes defined in the two categories.
  We prove this statement in an interesting case, namely the moduli problem
associated with the symplectic factorization problem which yields the complete
toric varieties. Therefore, our main objects are the moduli spaces of "twisted"
linear sigma models associated with this symplectic factorization problem. We
describe these moduli spaces in both gauge theoretic and algebraic geometric
frameworks and we identify the correponding virtual fundamental classes.
