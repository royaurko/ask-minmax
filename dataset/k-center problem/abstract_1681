Domain Resource Integrated System (DRIS) is introduced in this paper. DRIS is
a hierarchical distributed Internet information retrieval system. This system
will solve some bottleneck problems such as long update interval, poor coverage
in current web search system. DRIS will build the information retrieval
infrastructure of Internet, but not a commercial search engine. The protocol
series of DRIS are also detailed in this paper.
