The paper is devoted to the penalty cell-centered finite element scheme
(pFECC)on general meshes for the stationary Stokes problems with an
incompressible variable viscosity and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the
objectives of this work, we show the rigorous mathematical analysis including
the existence, the uniqueness of a discrete solution of the problem, the
symmetric and the positive de?nite sti?ness matrix, convergence of the pFECC
scheme.
