Trust has been explored by many researchers in the past as a successful
solution for assisting recommender systems. Even though the approach of using a
web-of-trust scheme for assisting the recommendation production is well
adopted, issues like the sparsity problem have not been explored adequately so
far with regard to this. In this work we are proposing and testing a scheme
that uses the existing ratings of users to calculate the hypothetical trust
that might exist between them. The purpose is to demonstrate how some basic
social networking when applied to an existing system can help in alleviating
problems of traditional recommender system schemes. Interestingly, such schemes
are also alleviating the cold start problem from which mainly new users are
suffering. In order to show how good the system is in that respect, we measure
the performance at various times as the system evolves and we also contrast the
solution with existing approaches. Finally, we present the results which
justify that such schemes undoubtedly work better than a system that makes no
use of trust at all.
