The change of conformal moduli of polygonal quadrilaterals under some
geometric transformations is studied. We consider the motion of one vertex when
the other vertices remain fixed, the rotation of sides, polarization,
symmetrization, and averaging transformation of the quadrilaterals. Some open
problems are formulated.
