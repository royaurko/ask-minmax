We consider two problems arising in the study of the Schr\"odinger-Newton
equations. The first is to find their Lie point symmetries. The second, as an
application of the first, is to investigate an approximate solution
corresponding to widely separated lumps of probability. The lumps are found to
move like point particles under a mutual inverse-square law of attraction.
