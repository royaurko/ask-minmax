We consider the two-dimensional sorted range reporting problem. Our data
structure requires O(n lglg n) words of space and O(lglg n + k lglg n) query
time, where k is the number of points in the query range. This data structure
improves a recent result of Nekrich and Navarro [8] by a factor of O(lglg n) in
query time, and matches the state of the art for unsorted range reporting [1].
