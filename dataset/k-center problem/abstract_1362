The Inductive Logic Programming community has considered proof-complexity and
model-complexity, but, until recently, size-complexity has received little
attention. Recently a challenge was issued "to the international computing
community" to discover low size-complexity Prolog programs for classifying
trains. The challenge was based on a problem first proposed by Ryszard
Michalski, 20 years ago. We interpreted the challenge as a problem in
cost-sensitive classification and we applied a recently developed
cost-sensitive classifier to the competition. Our algorithm was relatively
successful (we won a prize). This paper presents our algorithm and analyzes the
results of the competition.
