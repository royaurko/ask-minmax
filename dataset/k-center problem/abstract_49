The weighted Fermat-Torricelli problem for four non-collinear points in R^2
states that: Given four non-collinear points A_1, A_2, A_3,A_4 and a positive
real number (weight) B_i which correspond to each point A_i, for i = 1, 2, 3,
4, find a fifth point such that the sum of the weighted distances to these four
points is min- imized. We present an analytical solution for the weighted
Fermat-Torricelli problem for convex quadrilaterals in R2 for the following two
cases: (a) B_1 = B_2 and B_3 = B_4, for B1 > B4 and (b) B_1 = B_3 and B_2 =
B_4.
