A numerical method to solve the direct scattering problem for the
Zakharov-Shabat system associated to the initial value problem for the
nonlinear Schroedinger equation is proposed. The method involves the numerical
solution of Volterra integral systems with structured kernels and the
identification of coefficients and parameters appearing in monomial-exponential
sums. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
technique.
