We discuss the possibility of a dynamical solution to the cosmological
constant problem in the contaxt of six-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. A
definite answer requires an understanding of the full bulk cosmology in the
early universe, in which the bulk has time-dependent size and shape. We comment
on the special properties of codimension two as compared to higher
codimensions.
