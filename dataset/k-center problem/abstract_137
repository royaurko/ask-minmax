We determine the general form of the asymptotics for Dirichlet eigenvalues of
the one-dimensional linear damped wave operator. As a consequence, we obtain
that given a spectrum corresponding to a constant damping term this determines
the damping term in a unique fashion. We also derive a trace formula for this
problem.
