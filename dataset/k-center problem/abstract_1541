Dynamical dark energy (DE) has been proposed to explain various aspects of
the cosmological constant (CC) problem(s). For example, it is very difficult to
accept that a strictly constant Lambda-term constitutes the ultimate
explanation for the DE in our Universe. It is also hard to acquiesce in the
idea that we accidentally happen to live in an epoch where the CC contributes
an energy density value right in the ballpark of the rapidly diluting matter
density. It should perhaps be more plausible to conceive that the vacuum
energy, is actually a dynamical quantity as the Universe itself. More
generally, we could even entertain the possibility that the total DE is in fact
a mixture of vacuum energy and other dynamical components (e.g. fields, higher
order terms in the effective action etc) which can be represented collectively
by an effective entity X (dubbed the ``cosmon''). The ``cosmon'', therefore,
acts as a dynamical DE component different from the vacuum energy. While it can
actually behave phantom-like by itself, the overall DE fluid may effectively
appear as standard quintessence, or even mimic at present an almost exact CC
behavior. Thanks to the versatility of such cosmic fluid we can show that a
composite DE system of this sort (``LXCDM'') may have a key to resolving the
mysterious coincidence problem.
