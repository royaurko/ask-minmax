We show that it is consistent with ordinary set theory ZFC and the
generalized continuum hypothesis that there exist two separable abelian groups
of cardinality aleph_1 which are filtration equivalent and one is a Whitehead
group but the other is not. This solves one of the open problems of Eklof and
Mekler.
