A classical open problem involving the Laplace operator on symmetric domains
in Rn, such as balls and cubes, is whether all its Dirichlet eigenvalues vary
smoothly upon one-parameter C1 perturbations of the domain. We provide a fairly
complete answer to this question in dimension n = 2 on disks and squares and
also for the second eigenvalue on balls in Rn with n>=3. The proofs are based
on a suitable framework of problem and on a new degenerate implicit function
theorem on Banach spaces.
