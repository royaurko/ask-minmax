Codimension two branes play an interesting role in attacking the cosmological
constant problem. Recently, in order to handle some problems in codimension two
branes in Einstein gravity, Bostock {\it et al.} have proposed using
six-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity instead of six-dimensional
Einstein gravity. In this paper, we present the solutions of codimension two
branes in six-dimensional EGB gravity. We show that Einstein's equations take a
"factorizable" form for a factorized metric tensor ansatz even in the presence
of the higher-derivative Gauss-Bonnet term. Especially, a new feature of the
solution is that the deficit angle depends on the brane geometry. We discuss
the implication of the solution to the cosmological constant problem. We also
comment on a possible problem of inflation model building on codimension two
branes.
