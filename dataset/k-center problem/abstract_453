Motivated by the theory of self-duality which provides a variational
formulation and resolution for non self-adjoint partial differential equations
\cite{G1, G2}, we propose new templates for solving large non-symmetric linear
systems. The method consists of combining a new scheme that simultaneously
preconditions and symmetrizes the problem, with various well known iterative
methods for solving linear and symmetric problems. The approach seems to be
efficient when dealing with certain ill-conditioned, and highly non-symmetric
systems.
