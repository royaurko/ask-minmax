The paper deals with various centering problems for probability measures on
finite dimensional vector spaces. We show that for every such measure there
exists a vector $h$ satisfying $\mu*\delta(h)=S(\mu*\delta (h))$ for each
symmetry $S$ of $\mu$, generalizing thus Jurek's result obtained for full
measures. An explicit form of the $h$ is given for infinitely divisible $\mu$.
The main result of the paper consists in the analysis of quasi-decomposable
(operator-semistable and operator-stable) measures and finding conditions for
the existence of a `universal centering' of such a measure to a strictly
quasi-decomposable one.
