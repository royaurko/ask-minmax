In this work we use variational methods to show the existence of weak
solutions for a nonlinear problem of the type elliptic. This problem was
initially study by the contributors Ahmad, Lazer and Paul (see \cite{ALP})
considering the space $\Omega\subset\Rset^n$ a bounded domains. In this work we
extend your result now considering the domain $\Rset^n$. Indeed, the main
theorems in this paper constitute an extension to $\Rset^n$ of your previous
results in bounded domains.
