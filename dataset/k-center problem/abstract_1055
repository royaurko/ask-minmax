Todays ride sharing services still mimic a better billboard. They list the
offers and allow to search for the source and target city, sometimes enriched
with radial search. So finding a connection between big cities is quite easy.
These places are on a list of designated origin and distination points. But
when you want to go from a small town to another small town, even when they are
next to a freeway, you run into problems. You can't find offers that would or
could pass by the town easily with little or no detour. We solve this
interesting problem by presenting a fast algorithm that computes the offers
with the smallest detours w.r.t. a request. Our experiments show that the
problem is efficiently solvable in times suitable for a web service
implementation. For realistic database size we achieve lookup times of about
5ms and a matching rate of 90% instead of just 70% for the simple matching
algorithms used today.
