A realistic nuclear mean-field hamiltonian with pairing has been diagonalized
using Fock space representation that allows for nearly exact treatment of the
problem. Calculations were performed for all the even-even nuclei with Z in
(20, 100), whose pairing gaps were possible to extract out of the experimental
masses. The optimal values of the pairing strength constants for the protons
and neutrons have been found.
