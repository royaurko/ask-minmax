In this article, we adapt the definition of viscosity solutions to the
obstacle problem for fully nonlinear path-dependent PDEs with data uniformly
continuous in $(t,\omega)$, and generator Lipschitz continuous in
$(y,z,\gamma)$. We prove that our definition of viscosity solutions is
consistent with the classical solutions, and satisfy a stability result. We
show that the value functional defined via the second order reflected backward
stochastic differential equation is the unique viscosity solution of the
variational inequalities.
