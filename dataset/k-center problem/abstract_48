In this work we address the complexity problem of the isogeometric Boundary
Element Method by proposing a collocation scheme for practical problems in
linear elasticity and the application of hierarchical matrices. For mixed
boundary value problems, a block system of matrices similar to Galerkin
formulations is constructed allowing an effective application of that matrix
format. We introduce a strategy for the geometric bisection of surfaces based
on NURBS patches. The approximation of system matrices is carried out by means
of kernel interpolation. Numerical results are shown that prove the success of
the formulation.
