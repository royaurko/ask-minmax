It is attempted to obtain the masses of the celestial bodies, the initial
conditions of their motion, and the constant of gravitation, by a global
parameter optimization. First, a numerical solution of the N-bodies problem for
mass points is described and its high accuracy is verified. The osculating
elements are also accurately computed. This solution is implemented in the
Gauss iterative algorithm for solving nonlinear least-squares problems. This
algorithm is summarized and its efficiency for the inverse problem in celestial
mechanics is checked on a 3-bodies problem. Then it is used to assess the
accuracy to which a Newtonian calculation may reproduce the DE403 ephemeris,
that involves general-relativistic corrections. The parameter optimization
allows to reduce the norm and angular differences between the Newtonian
calculation and DE403 by a factor 10 (Mercury, Pluto) to 100 (Venus). The
maximum angular difference on the heliocentric positions of Mercury is ca. 220"
per century before the optimization, and ca. 20" after it. The latter is still
far above the observational accuracy. On the other hand, Mercury's longitude of
the perihelion is not affected by the optimization: it keeps the linear advance
of 43" per century.
