I show that with simple extensions of the shower algorithms in Monte Carlo
programs, one can implement NLO corrections to the hardest emission that
overcome the problems of negative weighted events found in previous
implementations.
  Simple variants of the same method can be used for an improved treatment of
matrix element corrections in Shower Monte Carlo programs.
