We consider the Cauchy problem for a family of semilinear defocusing
Schr\"odinger equations with monomial nonlinearities in one space dimension. We
establish global well-posedness and scattering. Our analysis is based on a
four-particle interaction Morawetz estimate giving \emph{a priori} $L^8_{t,x}$
spacetime control on solutions.
