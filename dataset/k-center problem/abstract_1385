This book has six chapters. The first chapter gives a brief introduction
about HIV/AIDS among rural women in Tamil Nadu. Chapter 2 is an analysis of the
situation using fuzzy theory in general and Fuzzy Relational Maps (FRM)in
particular. The FRM tool is specially chosen for two reasons: It can give the
hidden pattern of the dynamical system and as the socio-economic condition of
women infected with HIV/AIDS is interdependent we choose this special fuzzy
tool called FRM. In Chapter 3, we use Fuzzy Associative Memories (FAM) to
analyze the problem because FAM is the only fuzzy tool that can give the
gradations of each of the nodes/concepts. In Chapter 4 for the first time we
use neutrosophic theory in general and neutrosophic relational maps (NRM) in
particular to analyze this problem. Interested readers can compare and analyze
the two models FRM and NRM. This chapter introduces the notion of Neutrosophic
Associative Memories (NAMs) that is an analogous model of Fuzzy Associative
Memories. NAMs are applied to this problem and conclusions are based on this
analysis. The sixth chapter gives the translated version of the verbatim
interviews of the 101 HIV/AIDS infected, rural, uneducated, and poor women of
Tamil Nadu.
