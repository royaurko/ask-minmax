Understanding the space of possible theoretical explanations for the observed
cosmic acceleration is a central challenge of modern cosmology. This brief
document sketches selected aspects of approaches to this problem, focusing on
the possibility that a modification to General Relativity is responsible for
acceleration, as presented as a plenary talk at the ICHEP 2012 conference.
