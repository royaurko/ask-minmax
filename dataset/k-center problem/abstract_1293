We construct solutions to a Yamabe type problem on a Riemannian manifold M
without boundary and of dimension greater than 2, with nonlinearity close to
higher critical Sobolev exponents. These solutions concentrate their mass
around a non degenerate minimal submanifold of M, provided a certain geometric
condition involving the sectional curvatures is satisfied. A connection with
the solution of a class of P.D.E.'s on the submanifold with a singular term of
attractive or repulsive type is established.
