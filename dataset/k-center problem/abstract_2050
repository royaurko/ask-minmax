The spectral problem for the high order differential operator with singular
weight is considered. If the weight is a generalized derivative of self-similar
function with zero spectral degree the asymptotics of eigenvalues is obtained.
They are proved to have exponential growth and depend on the order of
differential operator and self-similarity parameters.
