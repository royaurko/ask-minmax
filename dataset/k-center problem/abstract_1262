Homogenization of a spectral problem in a bounded domain with a high contrast
in both stiffness and density is considered. For a special critical scaling,
two-scale asymptotic expansions for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are
constructed. Two-scale limit equations are derived and relate to certain
non-standard self-adjoint operators. In particular they explicitly display the
first two terms in the asymptotic expansion for the eigenvalues, with a
surprising bound for the error of order \epsilon^{5/4} proved.
