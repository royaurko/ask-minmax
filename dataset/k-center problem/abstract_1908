Monte-Carlo simulations are routinely used for estimating the scaling
exponents of complex systems. However, due to finite-size effects, determining
the exponent values is often difficult and not reliable. Here we present a
novel technique of dealing the problem of finite-size scaling. The efficiency
of the technique is demonstrated on two data sets.
