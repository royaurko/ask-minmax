A fundamental problem in program verification concerns the termination of
simple linear loops of the form x := u ; while Bx >= b do {x := Ax + a} where x
is a vector of variables, u, a, and c are integer vectors, and A and B are
integer matrices. Assuming the matrix A is diagonalisable, we give a decision
procedure for the problem of whether, for all initial integer vectors u, such a
loop terminates. The correctness of our algorithm relies on sophisticated tools
from algebraic and analytic number theory, Diophantine geometry, and real
algebraic geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first substantial
advance on a 10-year-old open problem of Tiwari (2004) and Braverman (2006).
