This paper introduces two forms of modular inverses and proves their
reciprocity formulas respectively. These formulas are then applied to formulate
new and generalized algorithm for computing these modular inverses. The same
algorithm is also shown to be applicable for the Chinese Remainder problem,
i.e., simultaneous linear congruence equations, for co-prime moduli as well as
non-co-prime moduli.
