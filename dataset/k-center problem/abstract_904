In this work the dynamic compressive sensing (CS) problem of recovering
sparse, correlated, time-varying signals from sub-Nyquist, non-adaptive, linear
measurements is explored from a Bayesian perspective. While there has been a
handful of previously proposed Bayesian dynamic CS algorithms in the
literature, the ability to perform inference on high-dimensional problems in a
computationally efficient manner remains elusive. In response, we propose a
probabilistic dynamic CS signal model that captures both amplitude and support
correlation structure, and describe an approximate message passing algorithm
that performs soft signal estimation and support detection with a computational
complexity that is linear in all problem dimensions. The algorithm, DCS-AMP,
can perform either causal filtering or non-causal smoothing, and is capable of
learning model parameters adaptively from the data through an
expectation-maximization learning procedure. We provide numerical evidence that
DCS-AMP performs within 3 dB of oracle bounds on synthetic data under a variety
of operating conditions. We further describe the result of applying DCS-AMP to
two real dynamic CS datasets, as well as a frequency estimation task, to
bolster our claim that DCS-AMP is capable of offering state-of-the-art
performance and speed on real-world high-dimensional problems.
