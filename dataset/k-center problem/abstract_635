We study a free interface problem of finding the optimal energy configuration
for mixtures of two conducting materials with an additional perimeter
penalization of the interface. We employ the regularity theory of linear
elliptic equations to study the possible opening angles of Taylor cones and to
give a different proof of a partial regularity result by Fan Hua Lin.
