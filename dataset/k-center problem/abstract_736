Some recent developments to handle the numerical sign problem in QCD and
related theories at nonzero density are reviewed. In this contribution I focus
on changing the integration order to soften the severity of the sign problem,
the density of states, and the extension into the complex plane (complex
Langevin dynamics and Lefshetz thimbles).
