Difference schemes for the time-fractional diffusion equation with variable
coefficients and nonlocal boundary conditions containing real parameters
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are considered. By the method of energy inequalities, for
the solution of the difference problem, we obtain a priori estimates, which
imply the stability and convergence of these difference schemes.
