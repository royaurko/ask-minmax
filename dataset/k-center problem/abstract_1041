We consider in this paper an urn and ball problem with replacement, where
balls are with different colors and are drawn uniformly from a unique urn. The
numbers of balls with a given color are i.i.d. random variables with a heavy
tailed probability distribution, for instance a Pareto or a Weibull
distribution. We draw a small fraction $p\ll 1$ of the total number of balls.
The basic problem addressed in this paper is to know to which extent we can
infer the total number of colors and the distribution of the number of balls
with a given color. By means of Le Cam's inequality and Chen-Stein method,
bounds for the total variation norm between the distribution of the number of
balls drawn with a given color and the Poisson distribution with the same mean
are obtained. We then show that the distribution of the number of balls drawn
with a given color has the same tail as that of the original number of balls.
We finally establish explicit bounds between the two distributions when each
ball is drawn with fixed probability $p$.
