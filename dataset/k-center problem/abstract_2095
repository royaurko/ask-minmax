We consider the problem of reconstructing binary images from their horizontal
and vertical projections. For any reconstruction we define the length of the
boundary of the image. In this paper we assume that the projections are
monotone, and we construct an image satisfying these projections that has a
relatively small boundary. We also give families of examples for which we show
that no smaller boundary is possible.
