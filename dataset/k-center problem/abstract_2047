We announce some new results on the convergence of Chebyshev--Pad\'e
approximations to real-valued algebraic function given on the segment $[-1,1]$.
The rate of convergence on the segment and in the corresponding maximal domain
of meromorphity of a given function is charactirized in terms of a theoretical
potential equilibrium problem.
