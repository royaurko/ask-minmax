We consider the following open question in the spirit of Ramsey theory: Given
an aperiodic infinite word $w$, does there exist a finite coloring of its
factors such that no factorization of $w$ is monochromatic? We show that such a
coloring always exists whenever $w$ is a Sturmian word or a standard
episturmian word.
