We consider the mathematical model of photoacoustic and thermoacoustic
tomography in media with a variable sound speed. When the sound speed is known,
the explicit reconstruction formula by P. Stefanov and G. Uhlmann (Inverse
Problems, 25(7):075011, 16, 2009) can be used. We study how a modelling error
in the sound speed affects the reconstruction formula and quantify the effect
in terms of a stability estimate.
