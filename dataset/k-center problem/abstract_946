The two-magnon problem for the frustrated XXZ spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian
and external magnetic fields exceeding the saturation field Bs is considered.
We show that the problem can be exactly mapped onto an effective tight-binding
impurity problem. It allows to obtain explicit exact expressions for the
two-magnon Green's functions for arbitrary dimension and number of
interactions. We apply this theory to a quasi-one dimensional helimagnet with
ferromagnetic nearest neighbor J1 < 0 and antiferromagnetic next-nearest
neighbor J2 > 0 interactions. An outstanding feature of the excitation spectrum
is the existence of two-magnon bound states. This leads to deviations of the
saturation field Bs from its classical value Bs(classical) which coincides with
the one-magnon instability. For the refined frustration ratio |J2/J1|> 0.374661
the minimum of the two-magnon spectrum occurs at the boundary of the Brillouin
zone. Based on the two-magnon approach, we propose general analytic expressions
for the saturation field Bs, confirming known previous results for
one-dimensional isotropic systems, but explore also the role of interchain and
long-ranged intrachain interactions as well as of the exchange anisotropy.
