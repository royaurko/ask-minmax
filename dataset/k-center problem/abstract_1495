In this paper, we consider the problem of synthesizing
correct-by-construction controllers for discrete-time dynamical systems. A
commonly adopted approach in the literature is to abstract the dynamical system
into a Finite Transition System (FTS) and thus convert the problem into a two
player game between the environment and the system on the FTS. The controller
design problem can then be solved using synthesis tools for general linear
temporal logic or generalized reactivity(1) specifications. In this article, we
propose a new abstraction algorithm. Instead of generating a single FTS to
represent the system, we generate two FTSs, which are under- and
over-approximations of the original dynamical system. We further develop an
iterative abstraction scheme by exploiting the concept of winning sets, i.e.,
the sets of states for which there exists a winning strategy for the system.
Finally, the efficiency of the new abstraction algorithm is illustrated by
numerical examples.
