As in our previous work [1] we address the problem to determine the splitting
of the normal bundle of rational curves. With apolarity theory we are able to
characterize some particular subvarieties in some Hilbert scheme of rational
curves, defined by the splitting type of the normal bundle and the restricted
tangent bundle.
