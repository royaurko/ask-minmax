Based on discrete truncated powers, the beautiful Popoviciu's formulation for
restricted integer partition function is generalized. An explicit formulation
for two dimensional multivariate truncated power functions is presented.
Therefore, a simplified explicit formulation for two dimensional vector
partition functions is given. Moreover, the generalized Frobenius problem is
also discussed.
