In this paper we present the latent signal analysis problem as a recasting of
the complex extension problem. Almost universally, the approach has been to use
the Hilbert Transform (HT) to construct Gabor's analytic signal. This approach
depends on harmonic correspondence and forces the use of simple harmonic
components in the analysis, which may lead to incorrect Instantaneous Amplitude
(IA) and Instantaneous Frequency (IF) parameters. We show that by relaxing the
harmonic correspondence condition, the resulting complex extension can still be
an analytic function and we can arrive at alternate IA/IF parameterizations
which may be more accurate at describing the latent signal. However, in
relaxing the harmonic correspondence condition there is no longer a unique rule
for the complex extension. In addition, we discuss the problems associated with
the use of the HT as an AM--FM demodulator for the latent signal. Finally we
provide solutions to an example latent signal analysis problem.
