The surface current method known in the theory of electromagnetic waves
diffraction is generalized to be applied for the problems of diffraction
radiation generated by a charged particle moving nearby an ideally-conducting
screen in vacuum. An expression for induced surface current density leading to
the exact results in the theory of transition radiation is derived, and by
using this expression several exact solutions of diffraction radiation problems
are found. Limits of applicability for the earlier known models based on the
surface current conception are indicated. Properties of radiation from a
semi-plane and from a slit in cylinder are investigated at the various
distances to observer.
