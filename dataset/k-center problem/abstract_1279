We prove a double binomial sum identity which differs from most binomial sum
identities in that the summands involve the absolute value function. The
identity is of interest because it can be used in proofs of lower bounds for
the Hadamard maximal determinant problem. Our proof of the identity uses a
two-variable variant of the method of telescoping sums.
