We derive a priori $C^2$ estimates for a class of complex Monge-Ampere type
equations on Hermitian manifolds. As an application we solve the Dirichlet
problem for these equations under the assumption of existence of a subsolution;
the existence result, as well as the second order boundary estimates, is new
even for bounded domains in $\bfC^n$.
