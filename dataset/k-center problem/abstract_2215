We study the relation between the vanishing of Andre-Quillen homology and
complete intersection dimensions. As an application, we solve a problem of
Avramov and Iyengar related to Quillen's conjecture. We also extend some of the
existing results in the literature and give a characterization of algebra
retracts of finite Andre-Quillen dimension with respect to complete
intersection dimensions.
