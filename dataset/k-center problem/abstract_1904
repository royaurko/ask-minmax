In this paper, we investigate the action of pseudogroup of all point
transformations on the natural bundle of equations
$y''=a^3(x,y)(y')^3+a^2(x,y)(y')^2+a^1(x,y)y'+a^0(x,y)$. We construct
differential invariants of this action and solve the equivalence problem for
some classes of these equations in particular for generic equations.
