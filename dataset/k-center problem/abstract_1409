A typical problem with the conventional Galerkin approach for the
construction of finite-mode models is to keep structural properties unaffected
in the process of discretization. We present two examples of finite-mode
approximations that in some respect preserve the geometric attributes inherited
from their continuous models: a three-component model of the barotropic
vorticity equation known as Lorenz' maximum simplification equations [Tellus,
\textbf{12}, 243--254 (1960)] and a six-component model of the two-dimensional
Rayleigh--B\'{e}nard convection problem. It is reviewed that the Lorenz--1960
model respects both the maximal set of admitted point symmetries and an
extension of the noncanonical Hamiltonian form (Nambu form). In a similar
fashion, it is proved that the famous Lorenz--1963 model violates the
structural properties of the Saltzman equations and hence cannot be considered
as the maximum simplification of the Rayleigh--B\'{e}nard convection problem.
Using a six-component truncation, we show that it is again possible retaining
both symmetries and the Nambu representation in the course of discretization.
The conservative part of this six-component reduction is related to the
Lagrange top equations. Dissipation is incorporated using a metric tensor.
