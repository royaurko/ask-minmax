Conditions for the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for a class of
nonlinear nonlocal degenerate parabolic equations are established. The
asymptotic behaviour of the solutions as time tends to infinity are also
studied. In particular, the finite time extinction and polynomial decay
properties are proved.
