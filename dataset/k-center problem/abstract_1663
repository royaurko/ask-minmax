The coincidence problem for three-dimensional discrete structures with
icosahedral symmetry is reinvestigated. We present a parametric description of
the coincidence rotations based on special quaternions, called icosian numbers.
In particular, we give a characterization of the possible coincidence indices
(Sigma-factors) and present a complete list of the possible rotations with
Sigma < 100.
