Harary and Palmer announced an enumeration problem of labelled
self-complementary graphs at the end of their book (Graphical Enumeration,
Academic Press, New York and London, 1973). This paper resolves this problem. A
method for solving this problem leads to the derivation of following formulas:
(a) A formula on the number of labelled graphs with the given order of
automorphism groups of those graphs. (b) A formula on the number of unlabelled
graphs with the given order of automorphism groups of those graphs. (c) A
formula on the number of labelled self-complementary graphs with the given
order of automorphism groups of those graphs. (d) A formula on the number of
unlabelled self-complementary graphs with the given order of automorphism
groups of those graphs.
