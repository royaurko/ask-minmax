I shall argue that the high Tc problem is the problem of doping into a Mott
insulator. Furthermore, the well documented pseudo-gap phenomenon in underdoped
cuprates holds the key to understanding this physics. Phase fluctuation alone
cannot explain this phenomenon, but there is a clear need to identify a
competing state which lives in the vortex core. The staggered flux state is a
good candidate for the competing state and experimental tests of these ideas
will be discussed.
