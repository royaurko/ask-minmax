We present the solution to an inverse problem arising in the context of
finding a distribution function for a specific collisionless plasma
equilibrium. The inverse problem involves the solution of two integral
equations, each having the form of a Weierstrass transform. We prove that
inverting the Weierstrass transform using Hermite polynomials leads to
convergent infinite series. We also show that the resulting solutions are
non-negative and bounded as required for a distribution function. Whilst
applied to a specific magnetic field, the inversion techniques used in this
paper as well as the convergence and positivity criteria derived, are of a
general nature, and are applicable to other smooth pressure functions.
