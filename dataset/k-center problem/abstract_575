In this paper we study extension theorems associated with general varieties
in two dimensional vector spaces over finite fields. Applying Bezout's theorem,
we obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions on general curves where sharp
$L^p-L^r$ extension estimates hold. Our main result can be considered as a nice
generalization of works by Mochenhaupt and Tao and Iosevich and Koh. As an
application of our sharp extension estimates, we also study the Falconer
distance problems in two dimensions.
