The partial representation extension problem is a recently introduced
generalization of the recognition problem. A circle graph is an intersection
graph of chords of a circle. We study the partial representation extension
problem for circle graphs, where the input consists of a graph G and a partial
representation R' giving some pre-drawn chords that represent an induced
subgraph of G. The question is whether one can extend R' to a representation R
of the entire G, i.e., whether one can draw the remaining chords into a
partially pre-drawn representation.
  Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for partial representation
extension of circle graphs. To show this, we describe the structure of all
representation a circle graph based on split decomposition. This can be of an
independent interest.
