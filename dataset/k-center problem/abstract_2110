This article revisits the historiography of the problem of inertial frames.
Specifically, the case of the twins in the clock paradox is considered to see
that some resolutions implicitly assume inertiality for the non-accelerating
twin. If inertial frames are explicitly identified by motion with respect to
the large scale structure of the universe, it makes it possible to consider the
relative inertiality of different frames.
