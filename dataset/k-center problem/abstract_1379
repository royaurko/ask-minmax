Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) is a prominent specification formalism for
real-time systems. In this paper, we show that the satisfiability problem for
MTL over finite timed words is decidable, with non-primitive recursive
complexity. We also consider the model-checking problem for MTL: whether all
words accepted by a given Alur-Dill timed automaton satisfy a given MTL
formula. We show that this problem is decidable over finite words. Over
infinite words, we show that model checking the safety fragment of MTL--which
includes invariance and time-bounded response properties--is also decidable.
These results are quite surprising in that they contradict various claims to
the contrary that have appeared in the literature.
