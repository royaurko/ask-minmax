This paper is concerned with the problem of scattering of time-harmonic
electromagnetic waves from an impenetrable obstacle in a piecewise homogeneous
medium. The well-posedness of the direct problem is established, employing the
integral equation method. Inspired by a novel idea developed by Hahner [11], we
prove that the penetrable interface between layers can be uniquely determined
from a knowledge of the electric far field pattern for incident plane waves.
Then, using the idea developed by Liu and Zhang [21], a new mixed reciprocity
relation is obtained and used to show that the impenetrable obstacle with its
physical property can also be recovered. Note that the wave numbers in the
corresponding medium may be different and therefore this work can be considered
as a generalization of the uniqueness result of [20].
