A. Silverberg (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 49, 2003) proposed a question on
the equivalence of identifiable parent property and traceability property for
Reed-Solomon code family. Earlier studies on Silverberg's problem motivate us
to think of the stronger version of the question on equivalence of separation
and traceability properties. Both, however, still remain open. In this article,
we integrate all the previous works on this problem with an algebraic way, and
present some new results. It is notable that the concept of subspace subcode of
Reed-Solomon code, which was introduced in error-correcting code theory,
provides an interesting prospect for our topic.
