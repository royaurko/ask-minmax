Self-organization of heterogeneous particle swarms is rich in its dynamics
but hard to design in a traditional top-down manner, especially when many types
of kinetically distinct particles are involved. In this chapter, we discuss how
we have been addressing this problem by (1) utilizing and enhancing interactive
evolutionary design methods and (2) realizing spontaneous evolution of self
organizing swarms within an artificial ecosystem.
