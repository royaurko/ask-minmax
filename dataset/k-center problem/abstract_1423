We consider the problem of estimating the fractional order of a L\'{e}vy
process from low frequency historical and options data. An estimation
methodology is developed which allows us to treat both estimation and
calibration problems in a unified way. The corresponding procedure consists of
two steps: the estimation of a conditional characteristic function and the
weighted least squares estimation of the fractional order in spectral domain.
While the second step is identical for both calibration and estimation, the
first one depends on the problem at hand. Minimax rates of convergence for the
fractional order estimate are derived, the asymptotic normality is proved and a
data-driven algorithm based on aggregation is proposed. The performance of the
estimator in both estimation and calibration setups is illustrated by a
simulation study.
