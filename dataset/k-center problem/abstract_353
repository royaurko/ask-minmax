A first order inflation model where a gauge coupling constant runs as the
universe inflates is investigated. This model can solve the graceful-exit
problem within Einstein gravity by varying the bubble formation rate. The
sufficient expansion condition gives group theoretical constraints on the
inflaton field, while the appropriate density perturbation requires an
additional scalar field or cosmic strings.
