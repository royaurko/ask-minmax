We obtain explicit solutions for the density $\varphi_T$ of the first-time
$T$ that a one-dimensional Brownian process $B$ reaches the twice, continuously
differentiable moving boundary $f$ and such that $f''(t)\geq 0$ for all $t\in
\mathbb{R}^+$. We do so by finding the expected value of some functionals of a
3-dimensional Bessel bridge $\tilde{X}$ and exploiting its relationship with
first-passage time problems as pointed out by Kardaras (2007). It turns out
that this problem is related to Schr\"odinger's equation with time-dependent
linear potential, see Feng (2001).
