During the last years, low-rank tensor approximation has been established as
a new tool in scientific computing to address large-scale linear and
multilinear algebra problems, which would be intractable by classical
techniques. This survey attempts to give a literature overview of current
developments in this area, with an emphasis on function-related tensors.
