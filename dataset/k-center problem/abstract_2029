We characterize obstruction sets in caterpillar dualities in terms of regular
languages, and give a construction of the dual of a regular family of
caterpillars. We show that these duals correspond to the constraint
satisfaction problems definable by a monadic linear Datalog program with at
most one EDB per rule.
