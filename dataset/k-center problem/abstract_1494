We consider some fundamental model-theoretic questions that can be asked
about a given algebraic structure (a group, a ring, etc.), or a class of
structures, to understand its principal algebraic and logical properties. These
Tarski type questions include: elementary classification and decidability of
the first-order theory.
  We describe solutions to Tarski's problems in the class of free associative
algebras, and some open problems. We will show that unlike free groups, two
free associative algebras of finite rank over the same field are elementarily
equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic. Two free associative algebras of
finite rank over different infinite fields are elementarily equivalent if and
only if the fields are equivalent in the weak second order logic, and the ranks
are the same. We will show that if a ring B, which has at least one Noetherian
proper centralizer, is first-order equivalent to a free associative algebra of
finite rank over an infinite field , then B is also a free associative algebra
over a field with a finite basis. We will also show that for any field the
theory of a free associative algebra is undecidable.
