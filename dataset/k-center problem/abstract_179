Averaging problems are ubiquitous in Finance with the valuation of the
so-called Asian options on arithmetic averages as their most conspicuous form.
There is an abundance of numerical work on them, and their stochastic structure
has been extensively studied by Yor and his school. However, the analytical
structure of these problems is largely unstudied. Our philosophy now is that
such valuation problems should be considered as an extension of the theory of
special functions: they lead to new problems about new classes of special
functions which should be studied in terms of and using of the methods of
special functions and their theory. This is exemplified by deriving integral
representations for the Black-Scholes prices based on Yor's Laplace transform
ansatz to their valuation. They are obtained by analytic Laplace inversion
using complex analytic methods. The analysis ultimately rests on the gamma
function which in this sense is found to be at the base of Asian options. The
results improve on those of Yor and have served us a as starting point for
deriving first time benchmark prices for these options.
