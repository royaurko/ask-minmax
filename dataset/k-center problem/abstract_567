We solve a class of boundary value problems for the stationary axisymmetric
Einstein equations corresponding to a disk of dust rotating uniformly around a
central black hole. The solutions are given explicitly in terms of theta
functions on a family of hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces of genus 4. In the
absence of a disk, they reduce to the Kerr black hole. In the absence of a
black hole, they reduce to the Neugebauer-Meinel disk.
