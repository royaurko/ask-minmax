In the present work the linearized problem of plasma wave reflection from a
boundary of a half--space is solved analytically. Specular accommodative
conditions of plasma wave reflection from plasma boundary are taken into
consideration. Wave reflectance is found as function of the given parameters of
the problem, and its dependence on the normal electron momentum accommodation
coefficient is shown by the contributors. The case of resonance when the frequency
of self-consistent electric field oscillations is close to the proper
(Langmuir) plasma oscillations frequency, namely, the case of long wave limit
is analyzed. Refs. 17. Figs. 6.
