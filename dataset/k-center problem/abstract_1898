R. M. Brown's theorem on mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions is
extended in two ways for the special case of polyhedral domains. A (1) more
general partition of the boundary into Dirichlet and Neumann sets is used on
(2) manifold boundaries that are not locally given as the graphs of functions.
Examples are constructed to illustrate necessity and other implications of the
geometric hypotheses.
