We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the doubly nonlinear
parabolic systems with mixed boundary conditions. Due to the unilateral
constraint the problem comes as a variational inequality. We apply the penalty
method and Gronwall's technique to prove the existence and uniqueness of the
variational solution.
