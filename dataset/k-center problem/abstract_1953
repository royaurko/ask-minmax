Alternative iterative methods for a nonexpansive mapping in a Banach space
are proposed and proved to be convergent to a common solution to a fixed point
problem and a variational inequality. We give rates of asymptotic regularity
for such iterations using proof-theoretic techniques. Some applications of the
convergence results are presented.
