This paper constructs tridiagonal random matrix models for general
($\beta>0$) $\beta$-Hermite (Gaussian) and $\beta$-Laguerre (Wishart)
ensembles. These generalize the well-known Gaussian and Wishart models for
$\beta = 1,2,4$. Furthermore, in the cases of the $\beta$-Laguerre ensembles,
we eliminate the exponent quantization present in the previously known models.
  We further discuss applications for the new matrix models, and present some
open problems.
