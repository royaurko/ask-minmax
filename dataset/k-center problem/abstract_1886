We review the main properties of shell models for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
turbulence. After a brief account on shell models with nearest neighbour
interactions, the paper focuses on the most recent results concerning dynamical
properties and intermittency of a model which is a generalization to MHD of the
Gledzer-Yamada-Okhitani (GOY) model for hydrodynamic. Applications to
astrophysical problems are also discussed.
