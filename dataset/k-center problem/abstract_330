We analyze the minority game for patients, and the results known from the
minority game are applied to the patient problem consulted at the department of
pediatric cardiology. We find numerically the standard deviation and the global
efficiency, similar to the El Farol bar problem. After the score equation and
the scaled utility are introduced, the dynamical behavior of our model is
discussed for particular strategies. Our result presented will be compared with
the well-known minority games.
