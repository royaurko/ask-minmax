We consider the problem of constructing solutions to the Yamabe equation
(i.e. conformal constant scalar curvature metrics) on the generalized connected
sum M = (M_1) #_K (M_2) of two compact Riemannian manifolds (M_1,g_1) and
(M_2,g_2) along a common (isometrically embedded) submanifold (K,g_K) of
codimension greater or equal than 3.
