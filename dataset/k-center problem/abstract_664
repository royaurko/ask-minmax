We identify a subproblem of the model-checking problem for the epistemic
\mu-calculus which is decidable. Formulas in the instances of this subproblem
allow free variables within the scope of epistemic modalities in a restricted
form that avoids embodying any form of common knowledge. Our subproblem
subsumes known decidable fragments of epistemic CTL/LTL, may express winning
strategies in two-player games with one player having imperfect information and
non-observable objectives, and, with a suitable encoding, decidable instances
of the model-checking problem for ATLiR.
