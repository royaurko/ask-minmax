It is proven that if an interpolation map between two wavelet sets preserves
the union of the sets, then the pair must be an interpolation pair. We also
construct an example of a pair of wavelet sets for which the congruence domains
of the associated interpolation map and its inverse are equal, and yet the pair
is not an interpolation pair. The first result solves affirmatively a problem
that the second contributor had posed several years ago, and the second result
solves an intriguing problem of D. Han. The key to this counterexample is a
special technical lemma on constructing wavelet sets. Several other
applications of this result are also given. In addition, some problems are
posed. We also take the opportunity to give some general exposition on wavelet
sets and operator-theoretic interpolation of wavelets.
