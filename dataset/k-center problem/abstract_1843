We analyze electromagnetic waves propagation in one-dimensional periodic
media with single or periodic defects. The study is made both from the point of
view of the modes and of the diffraction problem. We provide an explicit
dispersion equation for the numerical calculation of the modes, and we
establish a connection between modes and poles and zeros of the scattering
matrix.
