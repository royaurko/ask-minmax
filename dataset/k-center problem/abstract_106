We discuss the discovery potential for New Physics of various measurements of
CP violation. If nature is supersymmetric, then the flavor problem is even more
mysterious than in the standard model. We show how we can learn about the
mechanism that solves the supersymmetric flavor problem from measurements of
mixing and CP violation in $K$, $D$ and $B$ decays. (Invited talk given at the
Workshop on K Physics, Orsay, France, May 30 - June 4, 1996.)
