Bound and scattering states of a non-central extension of the
three-dimensional Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonian are worked out analytically within
the framework of the potential groups of the problem, SO(7) for bound states
and SO(6,1) for scattering states. In the latter case, the S matrix is
calculated by the method of intertwining operators.
