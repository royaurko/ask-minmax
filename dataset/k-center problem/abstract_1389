This special session adresses the problems that designers face when
implementing analog and digital circuits in nanometer technologies. An
introductory embedded tutorial will give an overview of the design problems at
hand : the leakage power and process variability and their implications for
digital circuits and memories, and the reducing supply voltages, the design
productivity and signal integrity problems for embedded analog blocks. Next, a
panel of experts from both industrial semiconductor houses and design
companies, EDA vendors and research institutes will present and discuss with
the audience their opinions on whether the design road ends at marker "65nm" or
not.
