Theoretical computer science has found fertile ground in many areas of
mathematics. The approach has been to consider classical problems through the
prism of computational complexity, where the number of basic computational
steps taken to solve a problem is the crucial qualitative parameter. This new
approach has led to a sequence of advances, in setting and solving new
mathematical challenges as well as in harnessing discrete mathematics to the
task of solving real-world problems.
  In this talk, I will survey the development of modern cryptography -- the
mathematics behind secret communications and protocols -- in this light. I will
describe the complexity theoretic foundations underlying the cryptographic
tasks of encryption, pseudo-randomness number generators and functions, zero
knowledge interactive proofs, and multi-party secure protocols. I will attempt
to highlight the paradigms and proof techniques which unify these foundations,
and which have made their way into the mainstream of complexity theory.
