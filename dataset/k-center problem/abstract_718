We consider the focusing cubic NLS in the exterior $\Omega$ of a smooth,
compact, strictly convex obstacle in three dimensions. We prove that the
threshold for global existence and scattering is the same as for the problem
posed on Euclidean space. Specifically, we prove that if
$E(u_0)M(u_0)<E(Q)M(Q)$ and $\|\nabla u_0\|_2\|u_0\|_2<\|\nabla Q\|_2\|Q\|_2$,
the corresponding solution to the initial-value problem with Dirichlet boundary
conditions exists globally and scatters to linear evolutions asymptotically in
the future and in the past. Here, $Q(x)$ denotes the ground state for the
focusing cubic NLS in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
