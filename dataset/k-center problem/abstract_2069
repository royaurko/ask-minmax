This paper investigates the randomness properties of a function of the
divisor pairs of a natural number. This function, the antecedents of which go
to very ancient times, has randomness properties that can find applications in
cryptography, key distribution, and other problems of computer science. It is
shown that the function is aperiodic and it has excellent autocorrelation
properties.
