Writing complex computer programs to study scientific problems requires
careful planning and an in-depth knowledge of programming languages and tools.
In this chapter the importance of using the right tool for the right problem is
emphasized. Common tools to organize computer programs, as well as to debug and
improve them are discussed, followed by simple data reduction strategies and
visualization tools. Furthermore, some useful scientific libraries such as
boost, GSL, LEDA and numerical recipes are outlined.
