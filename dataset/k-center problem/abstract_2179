In the paper, we have introduced the notion of mild bounded ancient solutions
to the Navier-Stokes equations in a half space. They play a certain role in
understanding whether or not solutions to the initial boundary value problem
for the Navier-Stokes system with non-slip boundary conditions have blowups of
Type I.
