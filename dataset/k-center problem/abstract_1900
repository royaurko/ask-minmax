We discuss the concept of Cooper pair in the context of recent experimental
studies of radio-frequency excitations in ultracold atomic gases. We argue that
the threshold energy determines the size of the Cooper pair emergent from the
exact solution of the reduced BCS problem, and elaborate on the physical
distinction between bosonic and fermionic Cooper pairs.
