In this paper, we first describe a matricial Newton-type algorithm designed
to solve the multivariable spectrum approximation problem. We then prove its
global convergence. Finally, we apply this approximation procedure to
multivariate spectral estimation, and test its effectiveness through
simulation. Simulation shows that, in the case of short observation records,
this method may provide a valid alternative to standard multivariable
identification techniques such as MATLAB's PEM and MATLAB's N4SID.
