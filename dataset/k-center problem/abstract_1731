Semiclassical perturbation theory is investigated within the framework of
axiomatic field theory. Axioms of perturbation semiclassical theory are
formulated. Their correspondence with LSZ approach and Schwinger source theory
is studied. Semiclassical S-matrix, as well as examples of decay processes, are
considered in this framework.
