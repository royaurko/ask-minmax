We investigate the problem of deciding whether a given preference profile is
close to having a certain nice structure, as for instance single-peaked,
single-caved, single-crossing, value-restricted, best-restricted,
worst-restricted, medium-restricted, or group-separable profiles. We measure
this distance by the number of voters or alternatives that have to be deleted
to make the profile a nicely structured one. Our results classify the problem
variants with respect to their computational complexity, and draw a clear line
between computationally tractable (polynomial-time solvable) and
computationally intractable (NP-hard) questions.
