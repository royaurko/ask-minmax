We illustrate how to extend the concept of structural stability through
applying it to the front propagation speed selection problem. This
consideration leads us to a renormalization group study of the problem. The
study illustrates two very general conclusions: (1) singular perturbations in
applied mathematics are best understood as renormalized perturbation methods,
and (2) amplitude equations are renormalization group equations.
