In this paper, we investigate the index coding problem in the presence of an
eavesdropper. Messages are to be sent from one transmitter to a number of
legitimate receivers who have side information about the messages, and share a
set of secret keys with the transmitter. We assume perfect secrecy, meaning
that the eavesdropper should not be able to retrieve any information about the
message set. This problem is a generalization of the Shannon's cipher system.
We study the minimum key lengths for zero-error and perfectly secure index
coding problems.
