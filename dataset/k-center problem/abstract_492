In this article, we investigate the kinetic/fluid coupling on a toy model. We
obtain it rigorously from a hydrodynamical limit. The idea is that at the level
of the full kinetic model, the coupling is obvious. We then investigate the
coupling obtained when passing into the limit. We show that, especially in
presence of a shock stuck on the interface, the coupling involves a kinetic
layer known as the Milne problem. Due to this layer, the limit process is quite
delicate and some blow-up techniques are needed to ensure its strong
convergence.
