We consider self-similar approximations of nonlinear hyperbolic systems in
one space dimension with Riemann initial data and general diffusion matrix. We
assume that the matrix of the system is strictly hyperbolic and the diffusion
matrix is close to the identity. No genuine nonlinearity assumption is
required. We show the existence of a smooth, self-similar solution which has
bounded total variation, uniformly in the diffusion parameter. In the
zero-diffusion limit, the solutions converge to a solution of the Riemann
problem associated with the hyperbolic system. A similar result is established
for the relaxation approximation and the boundary-value problem in a half-space
for the same regularizations.
