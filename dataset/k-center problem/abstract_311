Motivated by Papadakis (2005a, 2005b), we study a Chermnykh-like problem, in
which an additional gravitational potential from the belt is included. In
addition to the usual five equilibrium points (three collinear and two
triangular points), there are some new equilibrium points for this system. We
studied the conditions for the existence of these new equilibrium points both
analytically and numerically.
