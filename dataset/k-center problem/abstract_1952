This work wishes to support various mathematical issues concerning the
iterative methods with the help of new programming languages. We consider a way
to show how problems in math have an answer by using different academic
resources and different thoughts. Here we treat methods like Gauss-Seidel's,
Cramer's and Gauss-Jordan's.
