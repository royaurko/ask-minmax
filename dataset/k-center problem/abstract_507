The N=1 supersymmetric invariant Landau problem is constructed and solved. By
considering Landau level projections remaining non trivial under N=1
supersymmetry transformations, the algebraic structures of the N=1
supersymmetric covariant non(anti)commutative superplane analogue of the
ordinary N=0 noncommutative Moyal-Voros plane are identified.
