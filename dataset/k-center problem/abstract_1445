The electron-electron correlation term in two-atomic collision is the most
important, most difficult term to obtain the effective interatomic potential.
Generally the H and H collision is a four center problem. It is extremely
difficult to compute the electron-electron correlation term to include the
effect of exchange or antisymmetry between two system electrons exactly. All
the two-atomic collision related theoretical data differ from each other due to
its difference in approximating the electron-electron correlation term. I
invent a trick to evaluate the term exactly. Earlier the positronium (Ps) and H
system was easily approximated as a three center problem due to the light mass
of Ps. My new code for H-H collision using the ab-initio and exact
static-exchange model (SEM) can reproduce exactly the same data of Ps and H
system just by using the appropriate atomic parameters. The success of the
present trick makes the foundation of a big monument in cold and low energy
atomic collision physics. The Feshbach resonances are observed in H(1s)-H(1s)
elastic scattering in both the singlet and triplet channels. One can use the
trick to solve any four center problem including excitation and ionization
processes. Again one can use the idea in larger systems too.
