Let $\mathcal{L}_\epsilon$ be a family of elliptic systems of linear
elasticity with rapidly oscillating periodic coefficients. We obtain the
uniform $W^{1,p}$ estimate in a Lipschitz domain for solutions to the Dirichlet
problem, where $(2n/(n+1)) -\delta<p<(2n/(n-1))+\delta$. The ranges of $p$'s
are sharp for $n=2$ or 3.
