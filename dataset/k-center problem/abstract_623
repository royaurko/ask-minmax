Recent results have revealed a critical way in which lower order terms affect
the well-posedness of the characteristic initial value problem for the scalar
wave equation. The proper choice of such terms can make the Cauchy problem for
scalar waves well posed even on a background spacetime with closed lightlike
curves. These results provide new guidance for developing stable characteristic
evolution algorithms. In this regard, we present here the finite difference
version of these recent results and implement them in a stable evolution code.
We describe test results which validate the code and exhibit some of the
interesting features due to the lower order terms.
