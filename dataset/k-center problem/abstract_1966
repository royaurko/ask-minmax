We solve the problem on flat extensions of a generic surface with boundary in
Euclidean 3-space, relating it to the singularity theory of the envelope
generated by the boundary. We give related results on Legendre surfaces with
boundaries via projective duality and observe the duality on boundary
singularities. Moreover we give formulae related to remote singularities of the
boundary-envelope.
