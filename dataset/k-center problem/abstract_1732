I review some aspects of obtaining inflation from string theory, in
particular brane-antibrane inflation within the framework of KKLMMT, and
racetrack inflation. Further, I discuss recent work on the problem of reheating
after brane-antibrane annihilation, and possible distinctive features of
production of cosmic string and brane defects at this time.
