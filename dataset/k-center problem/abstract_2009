We give a survey of a variety of recent results about the distribution and
some geometric properties of points $(x,y)$ on modular hyperbolas $xy \equiv a
\pmod m$. We also outline a very diverse range of applications of such results,
discuss multivariate generalisations and suggest a number of open problems of
different levels of difficulty.
