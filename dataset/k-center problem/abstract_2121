A boundary value problem related to a parabolic higher order operator with a
small parameter is analized. When the small parameter tends to zero, the
reduced operator is hyperbolic. When t tends to infinity a parabolic hyperbolic
boundary layer appears. In this paper a rigorous asymptotic approximation
uniformly valid for all t is established.
