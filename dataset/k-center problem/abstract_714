We put forward an exponential-time algorithm for deciding branching
bisimilarity on normed BPA (Bacis Process Algebra) systems. The decidability of
branching (or weak) bisimilarity on normed BPA was once a long standing open
problem which was closed by Yuxi Fu. The EXPTIME-hardness is an inference of a
slight modification of the reduction presented by Richard Mayr. Our result
claims that this problem is EXPTIME-complete.
