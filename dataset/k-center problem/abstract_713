This work is focused on attacks on confidentiality that require time
synchronization. This manuscript proposes a detection framework for covert
channel perspective in cloud security. This problem is interpreted as a binary
classification problem and the algorithm proposed is based on certain features
that emerged after data analysis of Google cluster trace that forms base for
analyzing attack free data. This approach can be generalized to study the flow
of other systems and fault detection. The detection framework proposed does not
make assumptions pertaining to data distribution as a whole making it suitable
to meet cloud dynamism.
