We establish the equivalence between the problem of a solitary potential
scatterer in a Luttinger liquid of spinless repulsive fermions and an
anisotropic Kondo model where the value of the impurity spin id determined by
the scaling dimension of the scattering potential. The Bethe ansatz is used to
derive non-perturbative expressions for the capacitance and conductance.
