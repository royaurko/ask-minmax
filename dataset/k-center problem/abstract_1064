Gauge mediation models have two drawbacks, that is, the so-called \mu-problem
and a lack of predictability of the gravitino dark matter abundance. We show
that conformal sequestering in the supersymmetry breaking sector offers
attractive solutions to both problems. The correct mass scale of the \mu and
B_\mu terms is generated by taking the gravitino mass of O(100) GeV without
causing the flavor-changing neutral-current problem. Moreover, a large
anomalous dimension of the supersymmetry breaking field naturally realizes the
small stau and neutralino mass difference required for the coannihilation to
work yielding the right dark matter abundance.
