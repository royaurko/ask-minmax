A self-learning algebraic multigrid method for dominant and minimal singular
triplets and eigenpairs is described. The method consists of two multilevel
phases. In the first, multiplicative phase (setup phase), tentative singular
triplets are calculated along with a multigrid hierarchy of interpolation
operators that approximately fit the tentative singular vectors in a collective
and self-learning manner, using multiplicative update formulas. In the second,
additive phase (solve phase), the tentative singular triplets are improved up
to the desired accuracy by using an additive correction scheme with fixed
interpolation operators, combined with a Ritz update. A suitable generalization
of the singular value decomposition is formulated that applies to the coarse
levels of the multilevel cycles. The proposed algorithm combines and extends
two existing multigrid approaches for symmetric positive definite eigenvalue
problems to the case of dominant and minimal singular triplets. Numerical tests
on model problems from different areas show that the algorithm converges to
high accuracy in a modest number of iterations, and is flexible enough to deal
with a variety of problems due to its self-learning properties.
