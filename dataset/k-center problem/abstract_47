We show that the baryon-dark matter coincidence problem is solved in the
CMSSM. The baryons and dark matter are generated simultaneously through the
late-time decay of non-topological solitons, Q-balls, which are formed after
the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. A certain relation between the universal scalar
mass, $m_0$, and the universal gaugino mass, $M_{1/2}$, is required to solve
the coincidence problem, marginally depending on the other CMSSM parameters,
and the result is consistent with the observation of the 126-GeV Higgs boson.
