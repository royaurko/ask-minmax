Particle filters for data assimilation in nonlinear problems use "particles"
(replicas of the underlying system) to generate a sequence of probability
density functions (pdfs) through a Bayesian process. This can be expensive
because a significant number of particles has to be used to maintain accuracy.
We offer here an alternative, in which the relevant pdfs are sampled directly
by an iteration. An example is discussed in detail.
