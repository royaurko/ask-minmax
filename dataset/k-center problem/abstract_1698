We investigate the compositeness condition in four dimensions at the
non-trivial order (next-to-leading order in $1/N$ with the number $N$ of the
colors), taking the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model as an example. In spite of its
non-renormalizability, the compositeness condition can be successfully derived
and solved in compact forms. The resultant problems are discussed.
