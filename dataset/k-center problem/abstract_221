In the present work zero of dispersive function from Stokes' second problem
are investigated. Stokes' second problem is a problem about behavior of the
rarefied gas filling half-space. A plane, limiting half-space, makes harmonious
oscillations in the plane. The linearization kinetic ellipsoidal the
statistical equation with parameter is used. The factorization formula of
dispersion function is proved. By means of the factorization formula zero of
dispersion function in an explicit form and their research is carried out.
Dependence on dimensionless quantity collision frequency of a plane limiting
gas and on parameter equation are investigated.
