In the past decades, different approaches have been developed in order to
link the physical properties of galaxies to the dark matter haloes in which
they reside. In this review, I give a brief overview of methods, aims, and
limits of these techniques, with particular emphasis on semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation. For these models, I also provide a brief summary of recent
successes and open problems.
