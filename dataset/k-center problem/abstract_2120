This paper is concerned with a quaslinear parabolic equation including a
nonlinear nonlocal initial condition. The problem arises as equilibrium
equation in population dynamics with nonlinear diffusion. We make use of global
bifurcation theory to prove existence of an unbounded continuum of positive
solutions.
