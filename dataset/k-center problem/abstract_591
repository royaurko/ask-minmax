In voting contexts, some new candidates may show up in the course of the
process. In this case, we may want to determine which of the initial candidates
are possible winners, given that a fixed number $k$ of new candidates will be
added. We give a computational study of this problem, focusing on scoring
rules, and we provide a formal comparison with related problems such as control
via adding candidates or cloning.
