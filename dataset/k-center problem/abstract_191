In this survey we report on some recent results related to various singular
phenomena arising in the study of some classes of nonlinear elliptic equations.
We establish qualitative results on the existence, nonexistence or the
uniqueness of solutions and we focus on the following types of problems: (i)
blow-up boundary solutions of logistic equations; (ii) Lane-Emden-Fowler
equations with singular nonlinearities and subquadratic convection term. We
study the combined effects of various terms involved in these problems:
sublinear or superlinear nonlinearities, singular nonlinear terms, convection
nonlinearities, as well as sign-changing potentials. We also take into account
bifurcation nonlinear problems and we establish the precise rate decay of the
solution in some concrete situations. Our approach combines standard techniques
based on the maximum principle with non-standard arguments, such as the
Karamata regular variation theory.
