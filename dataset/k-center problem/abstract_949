We study the typical case properties of the 1-in-3 satisfiability problem,
the boolean satisfaction problem where a clause is satisfied by exactly one
literal, in an enlarged random ensemble parametrized by average connectivity
and probability of negation of a variable in a clause. Random 1-in-3
Satisfiability and Exact 3-Cover are special cases of this ensemble. We
interpolate between these cases from a region where satisfiability can be
typically decided for all connectivities in polynomial time to a region where
deciding satisfiability is hard, in some interval of connectivities. We derive
several rigorous results in the first region, and develop the
one-step--replica-symmetry-breaking cavity analysis in the second one. We
discuss the prediction for the transition between the almost surely satisfiable
and the almost surely unsatisfiable phase, and other structural properties of
the phase diagram, in light of cavity method results.
