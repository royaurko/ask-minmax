To study the Lawson-Osserman's counterexample to the Bernstein problem for
minimal submanifolds of higher codimension, a new geometric concept,
submanifolds in Euclidean space with constant Jordan angles(CJA), is
introduced. By exploring the second fundamental form of submanifolds with CJA,
we can characterize the Lawson-Osserman's cone from the viewpoint of Jordan
angles.
