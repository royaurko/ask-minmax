In this note we point out that the definition of the universal enveloping
dialgebra for a Leibniz algebra is consistent with the interpretation of a
Leibniz algebra as a generalization not of a Lie algebra, but of the adjoint
representation of a Lie algebra. From this point of view, the formal
integration problem of Leibniz algebras is, essentially, trivial.
