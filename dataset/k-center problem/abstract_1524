We study the convergence and the stability of fictitious dynamical methods
for electrons. First, we show that a particular damped second-order dynamics
has a much faster rate of convergence to the ground-state than first-order
steepest descent algorithms while retaining their numerical cost per time step.
Our damped dynamics has efficiency comparable to that of conjugate gradient
methods in typical electronic minimization problems. Then, we analyse the
factors that limit the size of the integration time step in approaches based on
plane-wave expansions. The maximum allowed time step is dictated by the highest
frequency components of the fictitious electronic dynamics. These can result
either from the large wavevector components of the kinetic energy or from the
small wavevector components of the Coulomb potential giving rise to the so
called {\it charge sloshing} problem. We show how to eliminate large wavevector
instabilities by adopting a preconditioning scheme that is implemented here for
the first-time in the context of Car-Parrinello ab-initio molecular dynamics
simulations of the ionic motion. We also show how to solve the charge-sloshing
problem when this is present. We substantiate our theoretical analysis with
numerical tests on a number of different silicon and carbon systems having both
insulating and metallic character.
