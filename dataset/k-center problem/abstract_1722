The Kramer--Neugebauer--like transformation is constructed for the stationary
axisymmetric D=4 Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton--axion system. This transformation
directly maps the dualized sigma--model equations of the theory into the
nondualized ones. Also the new chiral $4 \times 4$ matrix representation of the
problem is presented.
