The source coding problem with action-dependent side information at the
decoder has recently been introduced to model data acquisition in
resource-constrained systems. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for
numerical computation of the rate-distortion-cost function for this problem is
proposed, and a convergence proof is provided. Moreover, a two-stage code
design based on multiplexing is put forth, whereby the first stage encodes the
actions and the second stage is composed of an array of classical Wyner-Ziv
codes, one for each action. Specific coding/decoding strategies are designed
based on LDGM codes and message passing. Through numerical examples, the
proposed code design is shown to achieve performance close to the lower bound
dictated by the rate-distortion-cost function.
