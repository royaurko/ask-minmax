We study a model Schr\"odinger operator with constan tmagnetic field on an
infinite wedge with natural boundary conditions. This problem is related to the
semiclassical magnetic Laplacian on 3d domains with edges. We show that the
ground energy is lower than the one coming from the regular part of the wedge
and is continuous with respect to the geometry. We provide an upper bound for
the ground energy on wedges of small opening. Numerical computations enlighten
the theoretical approach.
