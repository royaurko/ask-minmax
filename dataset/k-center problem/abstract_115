We apply the embedding method of Batalin-Tyutin for revealing noncommutative
structures in the generalized Landau problem. Different types of
noncommutativity follow from different gauge choices. This establishes a
duality among the distinct algebras. An alternative approach is discussed which
yields equivalent results as the embedding method. We also discuss the
consequences in the Landau problem for a non constant magnetic field.
