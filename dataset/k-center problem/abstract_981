It is shown that in 2+1 dimensions the Fermi-Walker gauge allows the general
solution of the problem of determining the metric from the sources in terms of
simple quadratures. This technique is used to solve the problem of the
occurrence of closed time like curves (CTC's) in stationary solutions. In fact
the Fermi-Walker gauge, due to its physical nature, allows to exploit the weak
energy condition and in this connection it is proved that, both for open and
closed universes with axial symmetry, the energy condition imply the total
absence of closed time like curves. The extension of this theorem to the
general stationary problem, in absence of axial symmetry is considered and at
present the proof of such generalization is subject to some assumptions on the
behavior of the determinant of the dreibeins in this gauge.
