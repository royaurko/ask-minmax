Exact expressions for three-dimensional potential and force yield due to
uniform singularity distributed on a finite at rectangular surface have been
presented. The expressions, valid throughout the physical domain, have been
found to be consistent with other expressions available as special cases of the
same problem. Very accurate estimates of the capacitance of a unit square plate
and a unit cube have been made using them.
