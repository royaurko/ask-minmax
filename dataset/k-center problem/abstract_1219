We show that in generic supergravity theories the mass of the moduli during
inflation is larger (or at least of the same order of magnitude) than the
Hubble constant. This fact does not depends on the details of the inflation and
on the value of the Hubble parameter during it. The reason is that inflationary
universe is dominated by large F-term (or D-term) density which is higher than
the SUSY breaking scale in the present minimum and stabilizes the flat
directions of the supersymmetric vacua. Therefore, in general even standard
inflationary scenarios (with large H) may solve the cosmological moduli
problem.
