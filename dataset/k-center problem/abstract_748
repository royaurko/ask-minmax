We develop the calculus for hypersurface variations based on variation of the
hypersurface defining function. This is used to show that the functional
gradient of a new Willmore-like, conformal hypersurface energy agrees exactly
with the obstruction to smoothly solving the singular Yamabe problem for
conformally compact four-manifolds. We give explicit hypersurface formulae for
both the energy functional and the obstruction.
