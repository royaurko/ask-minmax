It is argued that the Einstein equation on a braneworld at low curvature
cannot be derived from its classical brane dynamics (i. e. dynamics of the
brane as a classical object in the higher dimensional spacetime) as far as the
action of the system has smooth low-curvature limit. We discuss possible
solutions to the problem.
