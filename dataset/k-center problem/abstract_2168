We give an interpretation of the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) Principle in
game-theoretic terms. Based on this interpretation, we make a formal
distinction between different ways of {em applying/} Maximum Entropy
distributions. MaxEnt has frequently been criticized on the grounds that it
leads to highly representation dependent results. Our distinction allows us to
avoid this problem in many cases.
