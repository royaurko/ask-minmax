We establish that the set of pairs $(\alpha, \beta)$ of real numbers such
that $$ \liminf_{q \to + \infty} q \cdot (\log q)^2 \cdot \Vert q \alpha \Vert
\cdot \Vert q \beta \Vert > 0, $$ where $\Vert \cdot \Vert$ denotes the
distance to the nearest integer, has full Hausdorff dimension in $\R^2$. Our
proof rests on a method introduced by Peres and Schlag, that we further apply
to various Littlewood-type problems
