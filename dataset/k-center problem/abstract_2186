We improve the range of exponents for the restriction problem for the 3-d
paraboloid over finite fields. The key new ingredient is a variant of the
Bourgain-Katz-Tao finite field incidence theorem derived from sum-product
estimates. In prime order fields, we give an explicit relationship between the
exponent in this incidence theorem and restriction estimates for the
paraboloid.
