The purpose of this paper is to give some equivalent conditions to the socle
and Bass numbers' conjectures which raised by C. Huneke in (Problems on local
cohomology, Free resolutions in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry,
Res. Notes Math. 1992, pp. 93-108). In addition, some results about certain
Gorenstein ideals are included.
