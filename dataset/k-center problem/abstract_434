The spectra of a particular class of PT symmetric eigenvalue problems has
previously been studied, and found to have an extremely rich structure. In this
paper we present an explanation for these spectral properties in terms of
quantisation conditions obtained from the complex WKB method. In particular, we
consider the relation of the quantisation conditions to the reality and
positivity properties of the eigenvalues. The methods are also used to examine
further the pattern of eigenvalue degeneracies observed by Dorey et al. in
[1,2].
