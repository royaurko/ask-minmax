In this overview paper, presented at the meeting DANS14, Novi Sad, July3-7,
2014, we give some applications of Laplace transforms to analytic number
theory. These include the classical circle and divisor problem, moments of
$|\zeta(1/2+it)|$, and a discussion of two functional equations connected to a
work of Prof. Bogoljub Stankovi\'c.
