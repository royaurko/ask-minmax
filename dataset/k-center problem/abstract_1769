We give a new presentation of the braid group $B$ of the complex reflection
group $G(e,e,r)$ which is positive and homogeneous, and for which the
generators map to reflections in the corresponding complex reflection group. We
show that this presentation gives rise to a Garside structure for $B$ with
Garside element a kind of generalised Coxeter element, and hence obtain
solutions to the word and conjugacy problems for $B$.
