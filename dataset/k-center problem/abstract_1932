J. Dixmier asked in 1950 whether every non-amenable group admits uniformly
bounded representations that cannot be unitarised. We provide such
representations upon passing to extensions by abelian groups. This gives a new
characterisation of amenability. Furthermore, we deduce that certain Burnside
groups are non-unitarisable, answering a question raised by G. Pisier.
