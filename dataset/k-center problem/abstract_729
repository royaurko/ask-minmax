For highly perforated domains the paper addresses a novel approach to study
mixed boundary value problems for the equations of linear elasticity in the
framework of meso-scale approximations. There are no assumptions of periodicity
involved in the description of the geometry of the domain. The size of the
perforations is small compared to the minimal separation between neighbouring
defects and here we discuss a class of problems in perforated domains, which
are not covered by the homogenisation approximations. The meso-scale
approximations presented here are uniform. Explicit asymptotic formulae are
supplied with the remainder estimates.
