We present a structure associated to the class of linear codes. The
properties of that structure are similar to some structures in the linear
algebra techniques into the framework of the Gr\"obner bases tools. It allows
to get some insight in the problem of determining whether two codes are
permutation equivalent or not. Also an application to the decoding problem is
presented, with particular emphasis on the binary case.
