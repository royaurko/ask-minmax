The computation of the probability of the first-passage time through a given
threshold of a stochastic process is a classic problem that appears in many
branches of physics. When the stochastic dynamics is markovian, the probability
admits elegant analytic solutions derived from the Fokker-Planck equation with
an absorbing boundary condition while, when the underlying dynamics is
non-markovian, the equation for the probability becomes non-local due to the
appearance of memory terms, and the problem becomes much harder to solve. We
show that the computation of the probability distribution and of the
first-passage time for non-Markovian processes can be mapped into the
evaluation of a path-integral with boundaries, and we develop a technique for
evaluating perturbatively this path integral, order by order in the
non-Markovian terms.
