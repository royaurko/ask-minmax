In this paper we construct an explicit quasi-isomorphism to study the cyclic
cohomology of a deformation quantization over a riemannian \'etale groupoid.
Such a quasi-isomorphism allows us to propose a general algebraic index problem
for riemannian \'etale groupoids. We discuss solutions to that index problem
when the groupoid is proper or defined by a constant Dirac structure on a 3-dim
torus.
