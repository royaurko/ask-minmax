We argue that identifying the electroweak Higgs particle with the extra
components of the gauge field in $4+d$ dimensions provides a solution to the
hierarchy problem. The absence of ultraviolate quadratic divergences is due to
the fact that the Higgs mass is protected by an exact gauge symmetry at
energies beyond the cutoff. The idea is implemented within explicit models
which also provide a link between fermion chirality and electroweak symmetry
breaking in four dimensions.
