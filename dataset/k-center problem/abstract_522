When drawing graphs whose edges and nodes contain text or graphics, such
informa tion needs to be displayed without overlaps, either as part of the
initial layout or as a post-processing step. The core problem in removing
overlaps lies in retaining the structural information inherent in a layout,
minimizing the additional area required, and keeping edges as straight as
possible. This paper presents a unified node and edge overlap removal algorithm
that does well at solving this problem.
