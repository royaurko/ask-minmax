We describe message-passing and decimation approaches for lossy source coding
using low-density generator matrix (LDGM) codes. In particular, this paper
addresses the problem of encoding a Bernoulli(0.5) source: for randomly
generated LDGM codes with suitably irregular degree distributions, our methods
yield performance very close to the rate distortion limit over a range of
rates. Our approach is inspired by the survey propagation (SP) algorithm,
originally developed by Mezard et al. for solving random satisfiability
problems. Previous work by Maneva et al. shows how SP can be understood as
belief propagation (BP) for an alternative representation of satisfiability
problems. In analogy to this connection, our approach is to define a family of
Markov random fields over generalized codewords, from which local
message-passing rules can be derived in the standard way. The overall source
encoding method is based on message-passing, setting a subset of bits to their
preferred values (decimation), and reducing the code.
