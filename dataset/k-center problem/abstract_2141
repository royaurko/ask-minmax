In this note we consider the inviscid limit for the 3D Boussinesq equations
without diffusion, under slip boundary conditions of Navier's type. We first
study more closely the Navier-Stokes equations, to better understand the
problem. The role of the initial data is also emphasized in connection with the
vanishing viscosity limit.
