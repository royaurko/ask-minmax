We consider two bosonic atoms interacting with a short-range potential and
trapped in a spherically symmetric harmonic oscillator. The problem is exactly
solvable and is relevant for the study of ultra-cold atoms. We show that the
energy spectrum is universal, irrespective of the shape of the interaction
potential, provided its range is much smaller than the oscillator length.
