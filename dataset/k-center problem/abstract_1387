We consider a scenario where a supersymmetric model has multiple dark matter
particles. Adding a U(1)' gauge symmetry is a well-motivated extension of the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). It can cure the problems of the
MSSM such as the mu-problem or the proton decay problem with high-dimensional
lepton number and baryon number violating operators which R-parity allows. An
extra parity (U-parity) may arise as a residual discrete symmetry after U(1)'
gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. The Lightest U-parity Particle (LUP) is
stable under the new parity becoming a new dark matter candidate. Up to three
massive particles can be stable in the presence of the R-parity and the
U-parity. We numerically illustrate that multiple stable particles in our model
can satisfy both constraints from the relic density and the direct detection,
thus providing a specific scenario where a supersymmetric model has
well-motivated multiple dark matters consistent with experimental constraints.
The scenario provides new possibilities in the present and upcoming dark matter
searches in the direct detection and collider experiments.
