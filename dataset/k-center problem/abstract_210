This is the report-version of a mini-series of two articles on the
foundations of satisfiability of conjunctive normal forms with non-boolean
variables, to appear in Fundamenta Informaticae, 2011. These two parts are here
bundled in one report, each part yielding a chapter.
  Generalised conjunctive normal forms are considered, allowing literals of the
form "variable not-equal value". The first part sets the foundations for the
theory of autarkies, with emphasise on matching autarkies. Main results concern
various polynomial time results in dependency on the deficiency. The second
part considers translations to boolean clause-sets and irredundancy as well as
minimal unsatisfiability. Main results concern classification of minimally
unsatisfiable clause-sets and the relations to the hermitian rank of graphs.
Both parts contain also discussions of many open problems.
