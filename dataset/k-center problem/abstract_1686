We discuss some aspects of recent research as well as more general issues
about motivation, useful methods and open problems in the field of cosmological
singularities. In particular, we review some of the approaches to the general
area and include discussions of the method of asymptotic splittings,
singularity and completeness theorems and the use of the Bel-Robinson energy to
prove completeness theorems and classify cosmological singularities.
