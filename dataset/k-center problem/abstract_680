The energy loss of a highly energetic parton in a weakly coupled quark-gluon
plasma is studied as an initial value problem. An extremely prolate plasma,
where the momentum distribution is infinitely elongated along one direction, is
considered. The energy loss is strongly time and direction dependent and its
magnitude can much exceed the equilibrium value. It is logarithmically
ultraviolet divergent. We argue that a good approximation to the energy loss
can be obtained if this divergence is cut off with the parton energy.
