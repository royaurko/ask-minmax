Combining dynamic renormalization with equation-free computational tools, we
study the apparently self-similar evolution of void distribution dynamics in
the diffusion-deposition problem proposed by Stinchcombe and Depken [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 88, 125701 (2002)]. We illustrate fixed point and dynamic approaches,
forward as well as backward in time.
