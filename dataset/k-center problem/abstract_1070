When particulate suspensions are sheared, perturbations in the shear flows
around the rigid particles increase the local energy dissipation, so that the
viscosity of the suspension is effectively higher than that of the solvent. For
bulk (three-dimensional) fluids, understanding this viscosity enhancement is a
classic problem in hydrodynamics that originated over a century ago with
Einstein's study of a dilute suspension of spherical particles.
\cite{Einstein1} In this paper, we investigate the analogous problem of the
effective viscosity of a suspension of disks embedded in a two-dimensional
membrane or interface. Unlike the hydrodynamics of bulk fluids, low-Reynolds
number membrane hydrodynamics is characterized by an inherent length scale
generated by the coupling of the membrane to the bulk fluids that surround it.
As a result, we find that the size of the particles in the suspension relative
to this hydrodynamic length scale has a dramatic effect on the effective
viscosity of the suspension. Our study also helps to elucidate the mathematical
tools needed to solve the mixed boundary value problems that generically arise
when considering the motion of rigid inclusions in fluid membranes.
