A method for non-abelian Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem is presented. The role of
decision and search is explored, and the platform of solvable/polycyclic group
is suggested. In the process we review recent progress in non-abelian
cryptography and post some open problems that naturally arise from this path of
research.
