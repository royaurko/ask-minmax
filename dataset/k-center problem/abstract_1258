We present a real space renormalization group scheme for the problem of
random walks in a random environment on a strip, which includes one-dimensional
random walk in random environment with bounded non-nearest-neighbor jumps. We
show that the model renormalizes to an effective one-dimensional random walk
problem with nearest-neighbor jumps and conclude that Sinai scaling is valid in
the recurrent case, while in the sub-linear transient phase, the displacement
grows as a power of the time.
