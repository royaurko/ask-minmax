The stochastic multi-armed bandit problem is well understood when the reward
distributions are sub-Gaussian. In this paper we examine the bandit problem
under the weaker assumption that the distributions have moments of order
1+\epsilon, for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. Surprisingly, moments of order 2
(i.e., finite variance) are sufficient to obtain regret bounds of the same
order as under sub-Gaussian reward distributions. In order to achieve such
regret, we define sampling strategies based on refined estimators of the mean
such as the truncated empirical mean, Catoni's M-estimator, and the
median-of-means estimator. We also derive matching lower bounds that also show
that the best achievable regret deteriorates when \epsilon <1.
