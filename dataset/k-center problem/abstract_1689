This is a report on recent progress and developments since the NANP'99
Conference in current and future long baseline (~1 km) and very long baseline
(~100 - 800 km) oscillation experiments at reactors. These experiments, under
certain assumptions, can fully reconstruct the internal mass structure of the
electron neutrino and provide laboratory test of solar and atmospheric neutrino
problems.
