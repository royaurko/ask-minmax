In this work we introduce a new family of ten-step linear multistep methods
for the integration of orbital problems. The new methods are constructed by
adopting a new methodology which improves the phase lag characteristics by
vanishing both the phase lag function and its first derivatives at a specific
frequency. The efficiency of the new family of methods is proved via error
analysis and numerical applications.
