Modelling of singularities given by discontinuous functions or distributions
by means of generalized functions has proved useful in many problems posed by
physical phenomena. We introduce in a systematic way generalized functions of
Colombeau that model such singularities. Moreover, we evaluate some products of
singularity-modelling generalized functions whenever the result admits an
associated distribution
