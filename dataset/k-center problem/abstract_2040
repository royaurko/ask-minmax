We describe a family of exact Gerstner type solutions for the geophysical
equatorial deep water wave problem in the f-plane approximation. These Gerstner
type waves are two-dimensional and travel with constant speed over a uniform
horizontal current. The particle paths in the presence and absence of the
Coriolis force are also analyzed in dependence of the current strength.
