A problem of MAC polar codes which are based on MAC polarization is that they
do not always achieve the entire capacity region. The reason behind this
problem is that MAC polarization sometimes induces a loss in the capacity
region. This paper provides a single letter necessary and sufficient condition
which characterizes all the MACs that do not lose any part of their capacity
region by polarization.
