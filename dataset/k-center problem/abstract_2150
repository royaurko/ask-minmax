We consider the problem of reconstructing a wide sense stationary
band-limited process from its local averages taken either at the Nyquist rate
or above. As a result, we obtain a sufficient condition under which average
sampling expansions hold in mean square and for almost all sample functions.
Truncation and aliasing errors of the expansion are also discussed.
