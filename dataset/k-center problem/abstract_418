We prove rigorously the well-known result of Gardner about the typical
fractional volume of interactions between N spins which solve the problem of
storing a given set of random patterns. The Gardner formula for this volume in
the limit N,p \to \infty, p/N \to \alpha is proven for all values of \alpha.
Besides, we prove a useful criterion of the factorisation of all the
correlation functions for a class of spin glass model.
