In this paper, we study the quantity of computational resources (state
machine states and/or probabilistic transition precision) needed to solve
specific problems in a single hop network where nodes communicate using only
beeps. We begin by focusing on randomized leader election. We prove a lower
bound on the states required to solve this problem with a given error bound,
probability precision, and (when relevant) network size lower bound. We then
show the bound tight with a matching upper bound. Noting that our optimal upper
bound is slow, we describe two faster algorithms that trade some state
optimality to gain efficiency. We then turn our attention to more general
classes of problems by proving that once you have enough states to solve leader
election with a given error bound, you have (within constant factors) enough
states to simulate correctly, with this same error bound, a logspace TM with a
constant number of unary input tapes: allowing you to solve a large and
expressive set of problems. These results identify a key simplicity threshold
beyond which useful distributed computation is possible in the beeping model.
