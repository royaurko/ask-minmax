In this paper, we derive a priori estimates for the gradient and second order
derivatives of solutions to a class of Hessian type fully nonlinear parabolic
equations with the first initial-boundary value problem on Riemannian
manifolds. These a priori estimates are derived under conditions which are
nearly optimal. Especially, there are no geometric restrictions on the boundary
of the Riemannian manifolds. And as an application, the existence of smooth
solutions to the first initial-boundary value problem even for infinity time is
obtained.
