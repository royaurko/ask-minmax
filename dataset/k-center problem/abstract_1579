One of the major problems in modeling natural signals is that signals with
very similar structure may locally have completely different measurements,
e.g., images taken under different illumination conditions, or the speech
signal captured in different environments. While there have been many
successful attempts to address these problems in application-specific settings,
we believe that underlying a large set of problems in signal representation is
a representational deficiency of intensity-derived local measurements that are
the basis of most efficient models. We argue that interesting structure in
signals is better captured when the signal is de- fined as a matrix whose
entries are discrete indices to a separate palette of possible measurements. In
order to model the variability in signal structure, we define a signal class
not by a single index map, but by a probability distribution over the index
maps, which can be estimated from the data, and which we call probabilistic
index maps. The existing algorithm can be adapted to work with this
representation. Furthermore, the probabilistic index map representation leads
to algorithms with computational costs proportional to either the size of the
palette or the log of the size of the palette, making the cost of significantly
increased invariance to non-structural changes quite bearable. We illustrate
the benefits of the probabilistic index map representation in several
applications in computer vision and speech processing.
