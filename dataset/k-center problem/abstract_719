We consider existential problems over the reals. Extended quantifier
elimination generalizes the concept of regular quantifier elimination by
providing in addition answers, which are descriptions of possible assignments
for the quantified variables. Implementations of extended quantifier
elimination via virtual substitution have been successfully applied to various
problems in science and engineering. So far, the answers produced by these
implementations included infinitesimal and infinite numbers, which are hard to
interpret in practice. We introduce here a post-processing procedure to
convert, for fixed parameters, all answers into standard real numbers. The
relevance of our procedure is demonstrated by application of our implementation
to various examples from the literature, where it significantly improves the
quality of the results.
