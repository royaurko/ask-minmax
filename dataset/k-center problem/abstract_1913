In this article we discuss the role of stability functions in geometric
invariant theory and apply stability function techniques to problems in toric
geometry. In particular we show how one can use these techniques to recover
results of Burns-Guillemin-Uribe and Shiffman-Tate-Zelditch on asymptotic
properties of sections of holomorphic line bundles over toric varieties.
