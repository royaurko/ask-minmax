We provide a complete treatment of algebro-geometric solutions of the
classical massive Thirring system. In particular, we study Dubrovin-type
equations for auxiliary divisors, consider the corresponding algebro-geometric
initial value problem, and derive the theta function representations of
algebro-geometric solutions of the Thirring system.
