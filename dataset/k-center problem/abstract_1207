For all $N \geq 9$, we find smooth entire epigraphs in $\R^N$, namely smooth
domains of the form $\Omega : = \{x\in \R^N\ / \ x_N > F (x_1,\ldots,
x_{N-1})\}$, which are not half-spaces and in which a problem of the form
  $\Delta u + f(u) = 0 $ in $\Omega$ has a positive, bounded solution with 0
Dirichlet boundary data and constant Neumann boundary data on $\partial
\Omega$. This answers negatively for large dimensions a question by Berestycki,
Caffarelli and Nirenberg \cite{bcn2}. In 1971, Serrin \cite{serrin} proved that
a bounded domain where such an overdetermined problem is solvable must be a
ball, in analogy to a famous result by Alexandrov that states that an embedded
compact surface with constant mean curvature (CMC) in Euclidean space must be a
sphere. In lower dimensions we succeed in providing examples for domains whose
boundary is close to large dilations of a given CMC surface where Serrin's
overdetermined problem is solvable.
