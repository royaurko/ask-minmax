The three-body continuum Coulomb problem is treated in terms of the
generalized parabolic coordinates. Approximate solutions are expressed in the
form of a Lippmann-Schwinger type equation, where the Green's function includes
the leading term of the kinetic energy and the total potential energy, whereas
the potential contains the non-orthogonal part of the kinetic energy operator.
As a test of this approach, the integral equation for the $(e^-,\, e^-,\,
{{He}^{++}})$ system is solved numerically by using the parabolic Sturmian
basis representation of the (approximate) potential. Convergence of the
expansion coefficients of the solution is obtained as the basis set used to
describe the potential is enlarged.
