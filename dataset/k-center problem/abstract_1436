The B\"uchi non-emptiness problem for timed automata refers to deciding if a
given automaton has an infinite non-Zeno run satisfying the B\"uchi accepting
condition. The standard solution to this problem involves adding an auxiliary
clock to take care of the non-Zenoness. In this paper, it is shown that this
simple transformation may sometimes result in an exponential blowup. A
construction avoiding this blowup is proposed. It is also shown that in many
cases, non-Zenoness can be ascertained without extra construction. An
on-the-fly algorithm for the non-emptiness problem, using non-Zenoness
construction only when required, is proposed. Experiments carried out with a
prototype implementation of the algorithm are reported.
