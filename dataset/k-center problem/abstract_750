In this paper we present a randomized algorithm for solving the maximal
layers problem for a random order. That is, given a point set $P =
\{p_1,...,p_n\}$ with $p_i \in [0,1]^k$ picked uniformly at random, compute the
successive maximal layers of $P$. The algorithm achieves a runtime of $o(n^2)$
in expectation. Additionally, the algorithm has a runtime of $o(kn^2)$ when $k$
is not a constant. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such
algorithm for the problem (for non-constant $k$). The algorithm is implemented
using a new data-structure for storing and answering dominance queries over the
set of incomparable points.
