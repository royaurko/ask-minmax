We consider the problem of jointly estimating the parameters as well as the
structure of binary valued Markov Random Fields, in contrast to earlier work
that focus on one of the two problems. We formulate the problem as a
maximization of $\ell_1$-regularized surrogate likelihood that allows us to
find a sparse solution. Our optimization technique efficiently incorporates the
cutting-plane algorithm in order to obtain a tighter outer bound on the
marginal polytope, which results in improvement of both parameter estimates and
approximation to marginals. On synthetic data, we compare our algorithm on the
two estimation tasks to the other existing methods. We analyze the method in
the high-dimensional setting, where the number of dimensions $p$ is allowed to
grow with the number of observations $n$. The rate of convergence of the
estimate is demonstrated to depend explicitly on the sparsity of the underlying
graph.
