We present an analysis on the geometrical place formed by the set of maxima
of the trajectories of a projectile launched in a media with linear drag. Such
a place, the locus of apexes, is written in term of the Lambert $W$ function in
polar coordinates, confirming the special role played by this function in the
problem. In order to characterize the locus, a study of its curvature is
presented in two parameterizations, in terms of the launch angle and in the
polar one. The angles of maximum curvature are compared with other important
angles in the projectile problem. As an addendum, we find that the synchronous
curve in this problem is a circle as in the drag-free case.
