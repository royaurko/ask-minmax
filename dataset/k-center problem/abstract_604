For any symmetric collection of natural numbers h^{p,q} with p+q=k, we
construct a smooth complex projective variety whose weight k Hodge structure
has these Hodge numbers; if k=2m is even, then we have to impose that h^{m,m}
is bigger than some quadratic bound in m. Combining these results for different
weights, we solve the construction problem for the truncated Hodge diamond
under two additional assumptions. Our results lead to a complete classification
of all nontrivial dominations among Hodge numbers of Kaehler manifolds.
