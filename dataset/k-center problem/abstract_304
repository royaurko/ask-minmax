A cosmological theory that predicts a late-time accelerated attractor with a
constant dark matter to dark energy ratio can be said to solve the Coincidence
Problem. Such cosmologies are naturally generated in the context of
non-standard gravity theories under conformal transformation because of the
resulting couplings between scalar fields and matter. The present work examines
four classes of these transformed theories and finds that only a small
subset--those with a single scalar field--are capable of solving the
Coincidence Problem.
