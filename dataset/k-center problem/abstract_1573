One of the first graph theoretical problems which got serious attention
(already in the fifties of the last century) was to decide whether a given
integer sequence is equal to the degree sequence of a simple graph (or it is
{\em graphical} for short). One method to solve this problem is the greedy
algorithm of Havel and Hakimi, which is based on the {\em swap} operation.
Another, closely related question is to find a sequence of swap operations to
transform one graphical realization into another one of the same degree
sequence. This latter problem got particular emphases in connection of fast
mixing Markov chain approaches to sample uniformly all possible realizations of
a given degree sequence. (This becomes a matter of interest in connection of --
among others -- the study of large social networks.) Earlier there were only
crude upper bounds on the shortest possible length of such swap sequences
between two realizations. In this paper we develop formulae (Gallai-type
identities) for these {\em swap-distance}s of any two realizations of simple
undirected or directed degree sequences. These identities improves considerably
the known upper bounds on the swap-distances.
