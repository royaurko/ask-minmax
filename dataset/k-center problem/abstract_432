The interrelation between analytic functions and real-valued functions is
formulated in the work. It is shown such an interrelation realizes nonlinear
representations for real-valued functions that allows to develop new methods of
estimation for them. These methods of estimation are approved by solving the
Cauchy problem for equations of viscous incompressible liquid.
