The status of the problem of neutrino masses and mixing is shortly reviewed.
Different schemes of mixing of (Dirac or Majorana) massive neutrinos are
considered. The theory of neutrino oscillations in vacuum and in matter is
presented. Existing indications in favor of neutrino mixing are shortly
discussed.
