L-BFGS is a hill climbing method that is guarantied to converge only for
convex problems. In computer graphics, it is often used as a black box solver
for a more general class of non linear problems, including problems having many
local minima. Some works obtain very nice results by solving such difficult
problems with L-BFGS. Surprisingly, the method is able to escape local minima:
our interpretation is that the approximation of the Hessian is smoother than
the real Hessian, making it possible to evade the local minima. We analyse the
behavior of L-BFGS on the design of 2D frame fields. It involves an energy
function that is infinitly continuous, strongly non linear and having many
local minima. Moreover, the local minima have a clear visual interpretation:
they corresponds to differents frame field topologies. We observe that the
performances of LBFGS are almost unpredictables: they are very competitive when
the field is sampled on the primal graph, but really poor when they are sampled
on the dual graph.
