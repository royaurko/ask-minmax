In this paper we study a generalization of the Fibonacci sequence in which
rabbits are mortal and take more that two months to become mature. In
particular we give a general recurrence relation for these sequences (improving
the work in the paper Hoggatt, V. E., Jr.; Lind, D. A. "The dying rabbit
problem". Fibonacci Quart. 7 1969 no. 5, 482--487) and we calculate explicitly
their general term (extending the work in the paper Miles, E. P., Jr.
Generalized Fibonacci numbers and associated matrices. Amer. Math. Monthly 67
1960 745--752). In passing, and as a technical requirement, we also study the
behavior of the positive real roots of the characteristic polynomial of the
considered sequences.
