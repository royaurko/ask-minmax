We review an "exact semiclassical" resolution method for the general
stationary 1D Schr\"odinger equation with a polynomial potential. This method
avoids having to compute any Stokes phenomena directly; instead, it basically
relies on an elementary Wronskian identity, and on a fully exact form of
Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization conditions which can also be viewed as a
Bethe-Ansatz system of equations that will "solve" the general polynomial 1D
Schr\"odinger problem.
