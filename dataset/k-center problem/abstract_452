We investigate modified steepest descent methods coupled with a loping
Kaczmarz strategy for obtaining stable solutions of nonlinear systems of
ill-posed operator equations. We show that the proposed method is a convergent
regularization method. Numerical tests are presented for a linear problem
related to photoacoustic tomography and a non-linear problem related to the
testing of semiconductor devices.
