We consider the classification problem for compact Lie groups $G\subset U(n)$
which are generated by a single conjugacy class with a fixed number $N$ of
distinct eigenvalues. We give an explicit classification when N=3, and apply
this to extract information about Galois representations and braid group
representations.
