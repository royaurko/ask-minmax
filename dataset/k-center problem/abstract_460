A short summary of approximate approach to the study of minimal surfaces in
AdS, based on solving Nambu-Goto equations iteratively. Today, after partial
denunciation of the BDS conjecture, this looks like the only constructive
approach to understanding the ways of its possible modification and thus to
saving the Alday-Maldacena duality. Numerous open technical problems are
explicitly formulated throughout the text.
