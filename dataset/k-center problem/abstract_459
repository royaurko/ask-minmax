This paper introduces a proposal for a Proof Carrying Code (PCC) architecture
called Lissom. Started as a challenge for final year Computing students, Lissom
was thought as a mean to prove to a sceptic community, and in particular to
students, that formal verification tools can be put to practice in a realistic
environment, and be used to solve complex and concrete problems. The
attractiveness of the problems that PCC addresses has already brought students
to show interest in this project.
