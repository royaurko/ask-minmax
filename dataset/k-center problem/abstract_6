Here we study the Dirichlet problem for first order linear and quasi-linear
hyperbolic PDEs on a simply connected bounded domain of $\R^2$, where the
domain has an interior outflow set and a mere inflow boundary. By means of a
Lyapunov function we show the existence of a unique solution in the space of
functions of bounded variation and its continuous dependence on all the data of
the linear problem. Finally, we conclude the existence of a solution to the
quasi-linear case by utilizing the Schauder fixed point theorem. This type of
problems considered here appears in applications such as transport based image
inpainting.
