We consider the Fisher-KPP equation with a non-local interaction term. We
establish a condition on the interaction that allows for existence of
non-constant periodic solutions, and prove uniform upper bounds for the
solutions of the Cauchy problem, as well as upper and lower bounds on the
spreading rate of the solutions with compactly supported initial data.
