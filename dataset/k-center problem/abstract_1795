We study some accurate semiclassical resolvent estimates for operators that
are neither selfadjoint nor elliptic, and applications to the Cauchy problem.
In particular we get a precise description of the spectrum near the imaginary
axis and precise resolvent estimates inside the pseudo-spectrum. We apply our
results to the Kramers-Fokker-Planck operator.
