The sparse grid combination technique provides a framework to solve high
dimensional numerical problems with standard solvers. Hierarchization is
preprocessing step facilitating the communication needed for the combination
technique. The derived hierarchization algorithm outperforms the baseline by up
to 30x and achieves close to 5% of peak performance. It also shows stable
performance for the tested data sets of up to 1 GB.
