When analysing time series an important issue is to decide whether the time
series is stationary or a random walk. Relaxing these notions, we consider the
problem to decide in favor of the I(0)- or I(1)-property. Fixed-sample
statistical tests for that problem are well studied in the literature. In this
paper we provide first results for the problem to monitor sequentially a time
series. Our stopping times are based on a sequential version of a
kernel-weighted variance-ratio statistic. The asymptotic distributions are
established for I(1) processes, a rich class of stationary processes, possibly
affected by local nonpara- metric alternatives, and the local-to-unity model.
Further, we consider the two interesting change-point models where the time
series changes its behaviour after a certain fraction of the observations and
derive the associated limiting laws. Our Monte-Carlo studies show that the
proposed detection procedures have high power when interpreted as a hypothesis
test, and that the decision can often be made very early.
