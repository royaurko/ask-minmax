We review the stamp folding problem, the number of ways to fold a strip of
$n$ stamps, and the related problem of enumerating meander configurations. The
study of equivalence classes of foldings and meanders under symmetries allows
to characterize and enumerate folding and meander shapes. Symmetric foldings
and meanders are described, and relations between folding and meandric
sequences are given. Extended tables for these sequences are provided.
