We study here the small time dynamics of $N$ electrons on the circle with
Coul;omb repulsive interaction and study the series for the velocities
(initially zero). The main result is the estimates of the convergence radius
from below. We explain how this result is related to the problem of very fast
establishing of direct electric current.
