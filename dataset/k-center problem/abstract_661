Clustering graphs based on a comparison of the number of links within
clusters and the expected value of this quantity in a random graph has gained a
lot of attention and popularity in the last decade. Recently, Aldecoa and Marin
proposed a related, but slightly different approach leading to the quality
measure surprise, and reported good behavior in the context of synthetic and
real world benchmarks. We show that the problem of finding a clustering with
optimum surprise is NP-hard. Moreover, a bicriterial view on the problem
permits to compute optimum solutions for small instances by solving a small
number of integer linear programs, and leads to a polynomial time algorithm on
trees.
