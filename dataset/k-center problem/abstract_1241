The Monte Carlo shell model is a powerful technique for computational nuclear
structure. Only a certain class of nuclear interactions, however, such as
pairing and quadrupole, are free of the numerical noise known as the sign
problem.This paper presents sum rules that relate the sign problem to the J=0
pairing matrix elements, thus illuminating the extrapolation procedure
routinely used for realistic shell-model interactions.
