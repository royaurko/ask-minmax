In solving diffusion problems, it is common to consider the finite difference
equation to be an approximation to the differential equation. Nevertheless,
history shows that the finite difference equation is primitive and that the
differential equation is its idealized representation designed to obtain
solutions in algebraic form. The difference equation is logically consistent
within itself, independent of the differential equation. The difference
equation and the differential equation together constitute two powerful
complementary tools, one providing numerical solutions to problems of arbitrary
complexity on a case by case basis, and the other providing insights into
classes of problems under idealized conditions.
