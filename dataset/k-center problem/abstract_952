Description Logics (DLs) are a family of knowledge representation formalisms
mainly characterised by constructors to build complex concepts and roles from
atomic ones. Expressive role constructors are important in many applications,
but can be computationally problematical. We present an algorithm that decides
satisfiability of the DL ALC extended with transitive and inverse roles and
functional restrictions with respect to general concept inclusion axioms and
role hierarchies; early experiments indicate that this algorithm is well-suited
for implementation. Additionally, we show that ALC extended with just
transitive and inverse roles is still in PSPACE. We investigate the limits of
decidability for this family of DLs, showing that relaxing the constraints
placed on the kinds of roles used in number restrictions leads to the
undecidability of all inference problems. Finally, we describe a number of
optimisation techniques that are crucial in obtaining implementations of the
decision procedures, which, despite the worst-case complexity of the problem,
exhibit good performance with real-life problems.
