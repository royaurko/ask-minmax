This paper extends an initial study [arXiv:0903.1762v1] where it was shown
the tempo of the putting strokes of accomplished golfers can be explained by
assuming these golfers drive their biomechanical system (i.e. golfer and
putter) resonantly. In this paper it is proposed that a reason for driving the
system resonantly is to simplify the problem of distance control in putting.
