We give characterizations of the center, of conjugated and of commuting
elements in a fundamental group of a graph of group. We deduce various results
: on the one hand we give a sufficient condition for the center, the
centralizers, and the root structures in such a group to be in some sense
trivial, and on the other hand we prove that for any group G, the conjugacy
problem reduces to the same problem in a double of G along any finite family of
subgroups.
