A certain Diophantine problem and 2D crystallography are linked through the
notion of standard realizations which was introduced originally in the study of
random walks. In the discussion, a complex projective quadric defined over Q is
associated with a finite graph. "Rational points" on this quadric turns out to
be related to standard realizations of 2D crystal structures.
