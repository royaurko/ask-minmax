We consider two-fluid flow problems in an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE)
framework. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, we address the problem
of the moving contact line, namely the line common to the two fluids and the
wall. Second, we perform a stability analysis in the energy norm for various
numerical schemes, taking into account the gravity and surface tension effects.
The problem of the moving contact line is treated with the so-called
Generalized Navier Boundary Conditions. Owing to these boundary conditions, it
is possible to circumvent the incompatibility between the classical no-slip
boundary condition and the fact that the contact line of the interface on the
wall is actually moving. The energy stability analysis is based in particular
on an extension of the Geometry Conservation Law (GCL) concept to the case of
moving surfaces. This extension is useful to study the contribution of the
surface tension. The theoretical and computational results presented in this
paper allow us to propose a strategy which offers a good compromise between
efficiency, stability and artificial diffusion.
