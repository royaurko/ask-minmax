We consider the numerical solution of scalar wave equations in domains which
are the union of a bounded domain and a finite number of infinite cylindrical
waveguides. The aim of this paper is to provide a new convergence analysis of
both the Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) method and the Hardy space infinite
element method in a unified framework. We treat both diffraction and resonance
problems. The theoretical error bounds are compared with errors in numerical
experiments.
