A parallel time integration method for nonlinear partial differential
equations is proposed. It is based on a new implementation of the Paraexp
method for linear partial differential equations (PDEs) employing a block
Krylov subspace method. For nonlinear PDEs the algorithm is based on our
Paraexp implementation within a waveform relaxation. The initial value problem
is solved iteratively on a complete time interval. Nonlinear terms are treated
as a source term, provided by the solution from the previous iteration. At each
iteration, the problem is decoupled into independent subproblems by the
principle of superposition. The decoupled subproblems are solved fast by
exponential integration, based on a block Krylov method. The new time
integration is demonstrated for the one-dimensional advection-diffusion
equation and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical experiments confirm
excellent parallel scaling for the linear advection-diffusion problem, and good
scaling in case the nonlinear Burgers equation is simulated.
