Let $E$ be an arbitrary subset of the unit circle $T$ and let $f$ be a
function defined on $E$. When there exist polynomials $P_n$ which are uniformly
bounded by a number $M > 0$ on $T$ and converge (pointwise) to $f$ at each
point of $E$? We give a necessary and sufficient description of such functions
$f$. The necessity part of our result, in fact, is a classical theorem of S.Ya.
Khavinson, while the proof of sufficiency uses the method that has been
recently applied in particular in the contributor's solution of an approximation
problem proposed by L. Zalcman.
