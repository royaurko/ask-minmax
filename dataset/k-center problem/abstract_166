We point out a close relation between a family of Goedel-type solutions of
3+1 General Relativity and the Landau problem in S^2, R^2 and H_2; in
particular, the classical geodesics correspond to Larmor orbits in the Landau
problem. We discuss the extent of this relation, by analyzing the solutions of
the Klein-Gordon equation in these backgrounds. For the R^2 case, this relation
was independently noticed in hep-th/0306148. Guided by the analogy with the
Landau problem, we speculate on the possible holographic description of a
single chronologically safe region.
