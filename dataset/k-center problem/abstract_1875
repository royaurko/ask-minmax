The iterative algorithm recently proposed by Waxman for solving eigenvalue
problems, which relies on the method of moments, has been modified to improve
its convergence considerably without sacrificing its benefits or elegance. The
suggested modification is based on methods to calculate low-lying eigenpairs of
large bounded hermitian operators or matrices.
