The design of digital filters is a fundamental process in the context of
digital signal processing. The purpose of this paper is to study the use of
$\lp$ norms (for $2 < p < \infty$) as design criteria for digital filters, and
to introduce a set of algorithms for the design of Finite (FIR) and Infinite
(IIR) Impulse Response digital filters based on the Iterative Reweighted Least
Squares (IRLS) algorithm. The proposed algorithms rely on the idea of breaking
the $\lp$ filter design problem into a sequence of approximations rather than
solving the original $\lp$ problem directly. It is shown that one can
efficiently design filters that arbitrarily approximate a desired $\lp$
solution (for $2 < p < \infty$) including the commonly used $l_\infty$ (or
minimax) design problem. A method to design filters with different norms in
different bands is presented (allowing the user for better control of the
signal and noise behavior per band). Among the main contributions of this work
is a method for the design of {\it magnitude} $\lp$ IIR filters. Experimental
results show that the algorithms in this work are robust and efficient,
improving over traditional off-the-shelf optimization tools. The group of
proposed algorithms form a flexible collection that offers robustness and
efficiency for a wide variety of digital filter design applications.
