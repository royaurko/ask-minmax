We study the problem of the computation of the effective diffusion constant
of a Brownian particle diffusing in a random potential which is given by a
function $V(\phi)$ of a Gaussian field $\phi$. A self similar renormalization
group analysis is applied to a mathematically related problem of the effective
permeability of a random porous medium from which the diffusion constant of the
random potential problem can be extracted. This renormalization group approach
reproduces practically all known exact results in one and two dimensions. The
results are confronted with numerical simulations and we find that their
accuracy is good up to points well beyond the expected perturbative regime. The
results obtained are also tentatively applied to interacting particle systems
without disorder and we obtain expressions for the self-diffusion constant in
terms of the excess thermodynamic entropy. This result is of a form that has
commonly been used to fit the self diffusion constant in molecular dynamics
simulations.
