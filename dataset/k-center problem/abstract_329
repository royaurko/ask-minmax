A problem of collisions of atoms with two-channel zero-range interaction in
an atomic waveguide is solved by using of a renormalization procedure. A
matching of the solution to a solution of the related one-dimensional problem
leads to relation between the one-dimensional and three-dimensional scattering
parameters. The scattering amplitude and bound states for the confined system
demonstrate differences from the related free and one-dimensional systems.
