If nature exhibits low energy supersymmetry, discrete (non-$Z_2$) R
symmetries may well play an important role. In this paper, we explore such
symmetries. We generalize gaugino condensation, constructing large classes of
models which are classically scale invariant, and which spontaneously break
discrete R symmetries (but not supersymmetry). The order parameters for the
breaking include chiral singlets. These simplify construction of models with
metastable dynamical supersymmetry breaking. We explain that in gauge
mediation, the problem of the cosmological constant makes "retrofitting"
particularly natural -- almost imperative. We describe new classes of models,
with interesting scales for supersymmetry breaking, and which allow simple
solutions of the $\mu$ problem. We argue that models exhibiting such R
symmetries can readily solve not only the problem of dimension four operators
and proton decay, but also dimension five operators. On the other hand, in
theories of "gravity mediation", the breaking of R symmetry is typically of
order $M_p$, R parity is required to suppress dimension four $B$ and $L$
violating operators, and dimension five operators remain problematic.
