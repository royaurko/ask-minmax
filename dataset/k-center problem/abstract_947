We present a review of our recent work in extending the successful dynamical
mean-field theory from the equilibrium case to nonequilibrium cases. In
particular, we focus on the problem of turning on a spatially uniform, but
possibly time varying, electric field (neglecting all magnetic field effects).
We show how to work with a manifestly gauge-invariant formalism, and compare
numerical calculations from a transient-response formalism to different types
of approximate treatments, including the semiclassical Boltzmann equation and
perturbation theory in the interaction. In this review, we solve the
nonequilibrium problem for the Falicov-Kimball model, which is the simplest
many-body model and the easiest problem to illustrate the nonequilibrium
behavior in both diffusive metals and Mott insulators. Due to space
restrictions, we assume the reader already has some familiarity both with the
Kadanoff-Baym-Keldysh nonequilibrium formalism and with equilibrium dynamical
mean-field theory; we provide a guide to the literature where additional
details can be found.
