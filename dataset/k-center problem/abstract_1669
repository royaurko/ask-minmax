Here I present an overview of recent studies of the phenomenon of negative
refraction and left-handed materials. I will discuss some basic questions
pertinent to the problem. It is pointed out that the current claims of negative
refraction and left handed materials are not conclusive. To support our
consideration, I will start with the fundamental physics.
