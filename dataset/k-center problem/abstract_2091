We propose new Kruzhkov type entropy conditions for one dimensional scalar
conservation law with a discontinuous flux. We prove existence and uniqueness
of the entropy admissible weak solution to the corresponding Cauchy problem
merely under assumptions on the flux which provide the maximum principle. In
particular, we allow multiple flux crossings and we do not need any kind of
genuine nonlinearity conditions.
