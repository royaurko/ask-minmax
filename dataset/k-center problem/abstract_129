The work describes a general problem, which emphasizes proportional reasoning
and probabilistic reasoning skills in the context of planting garlic in a
backyard garden. Along with practicing these reasoning skills in a context
far-removed from the standard high school or college curriculum, our solution
involves the development of a few relatively sophisticated statistical
concepts, specifically histograms and confidence intervals.
