The intention of this article is to give a flavour of some global problems in
General Relativity. We cover a variety of topics, some of them related to the
fundamental concept of 'Cauchy hypersurfaces': (1) structure of globally
hyperbolic spacetimes, (2) the relativistic initial value problem, (3) constant
mean curvature surfaces, (4) singularity theorems, (5) cosmic censorship and
Penrose inequality, (6) spinors and holonomy.
