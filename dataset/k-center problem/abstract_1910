For a cocompact group $\G$ of $\slr$ we fix a real non-zero harmonic 1-form
$\alpha$. We study the asymptotics of the hyperbolic lattice-counting problem
for $\G$ under restrictions imposed by the modular symbols
$\modsym{\gamma}{\a}$. We prove that the normalized values of the modular
symbols, when ordered according to this counting, have a Gaussian distribution.
