This paper considers the problem of detecting nonstationary phenomena, and
chirps in particular, from very noisy data. Chirps are waveforms of the very
general form A(t) exp(i\lambda \phi(t)), where \lambda is a (large) base
frequency, the phase \phi(t) is time-varying and the amplitude A(t) is slowly
varying. Given a set of noisy measurements, we would like to test whether there
is signal or whether the data is just noise. One particular application of note
in conjunction with this problem is the detection of gravitational waves
predicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.
  We introduce detection strategies which are very sensitive and more flexible
than existing feature detectors. The idea is to use structured algorithms which
exploit information in the so-called chirplet graph to chain chirplets together
adaptively as to form chirps with polygonal instantaneous frequency. We then
search for the path in the graph which provides the best trade-off between
complexity and goodness of fit. Underlying our methodology is the idea that
while the signal may be extremely weak so that none of the individual empirical
coefficients is statistically significant, one can still reliably detect by
combining several coefficients into a coherent chain. This strategy is general
and may be applied in many other detection problems. We complement our study
with numerical experiments showing that our algorithms are so sensitive that
they seem to detect signals whenever their strength makes them detectable.
