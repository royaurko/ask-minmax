We provide a characterization for maximal monotone realizations for a certain
class of (nonlinear) operators in terms of their corresponding boundary data
spaces. The operators under consideration naturally arise in the study of
evolutionary problems in mathematical physics. We apply our abstract
characterization result to Port-Hamiltonian systems and a class of frictional
boundary conditions in the theory of contact problems in visco-elasticity.
