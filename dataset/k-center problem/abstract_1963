We prove that the equivalence of pure states of a separable C*-algebra is
either smooth or it continuously reduces $[0,1]^{\bbN}/\ell_2$ and it therefore
cannot be classified by countable structures. The latter was independently
proved by Kerr--Li--Pichot by using different methods.
  We also give some remarks on a 1967 problem of Dixmier.
