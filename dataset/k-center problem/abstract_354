We briefly review the GIFT (Goltstones instead of Fine Tuning) mechanism
which provides a promising solution to the doublet-triplet splitting problem
and some other puzzles of the supersymmetric grand unification as are the
$\mu$-problem, the fermion mass problem, etc. It can be naturally implemented
by extending the minimal SUSY SU(5) model to the gauge SU(6) theory.
