This is a survey which discusses the isomorphism problem for both C* and
smooth crossed products by minimal diffeomorphisms. For C* crossed products,
examples demonstrate the failure of the obvious analog of the
Giordano-Putnam-Skau Theorem on minimal homeomorphisms of the Cantor set. For
smooth crossed products, there are many open problems.
