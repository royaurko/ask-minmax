The parameter imbedding method for the Fredholm equation converts it into an
initial value problem in its parameter $\lambda$. We establish the method for
general operator equations of the form $[I + \hat{f}(\lambda)]\psi = \phi $. It
is particularly useful for studying spontaneous symmetry breaking problems,
such as contained in the nonlinear Schwinger-Dyson equation.
