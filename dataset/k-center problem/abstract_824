Superconformal anomalies provide an elegant and economical way to understand
the soft breaking parameters in SUSY models; however, implementing them leads
to the several undesirable features including: tachyonic sleptons and
electroweak symmetry breaking problems in both the MSSM and the NMSSM. Since
these two theories also have the additonal problem of massless neutrinos, we
have reconsidered the AMSB problems in a class of models that extends the NMSSM
to explain small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. In a recent paper,
we showed that for a class of minimal left-right extensions, a built-in
mechanism exists which naturally solves the tachyonic slepton problem and
provides new alternatives to the MSSM that also have automatic R-parity
conservation. In this paper, we discuss how electroweak symmetry breaking
arises in this model through an NMSSM-like low energy theory with a singlet
VEV, induced by the structure of the left-right extension and of the right
magnitude. We then study the phenomenological issues and find: the LSP is an
Higgsino-wino mix, new phenomenology for chargino decays to the LSP, degenerate
same generation sleptons and a potential for a mild squark-slepton degeneracy.
We also discuss possible collider signatures and the feasibility of dark matter
in this model.
