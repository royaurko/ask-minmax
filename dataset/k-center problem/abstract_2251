We describe a constructive, cubic time solution to the conjugacy problem in
Artin groups of extra-large type, which was proved solvable in those groups by
Appel and Schupp. We use results from two of our previous papers that
characterise geodesic words in those groups, as well as the description of
conjugacy between elements involving three or more generators that is given by
Appel and Schupp.
