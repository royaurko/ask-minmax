We propose dynamical systems defined on algebra of lattices, which we call
`lattice equations'. We give exact general solutions of initial value problems
for a class of lattice equations, and evaluate the complexity of the solutions.
Moreover we discuss the relationship between those equations and binary
cellular automata.
