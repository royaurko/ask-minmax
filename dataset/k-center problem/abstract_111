We study the Goursat or characteristic problem, i.e. a hyperbolic equation
with given data on a surface (the half of the standard Cauchy problem), with
some kind of dimensional regularization procedure to deal with the divergences
that appear. We will also comment some possible relation with a holographic
setup.
