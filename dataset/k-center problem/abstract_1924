In this work we comment some conclusions derived from the analysis of recent
proposals on the field of chaos-based cryptography. These observations remark
the main problems detected in some of those schemes under examination.
Therefore, this paper is a list of what to avoid when considering chaos as
source of new strategies to conceal and protect information.
