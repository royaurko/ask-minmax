A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is said to be \emph{approximation
resistant} if it is hard to approximate better than the trivial algorithm which
picks a uniformly random assignment. Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, we
give a characterization of approximation resistance for $k$-partite CSPs
defined by an even predicate.
