We study the parameterized complexity of Split Contraction and Threshold
Contraction. In these problems we are given a graph G and an integer k and
asked whether G can be modified into a split graph or a threshold graph,
respectively, by contracting at most k edges. We present an FPT algorithm for
Split Contraction, and prove that Threshold Contraction on split graphs, i.e.,
contracting an input split graph to a threshold graph, is FPT when
parameterized by the number of contractions. To give a complete picture, we
show that these two problems admit no polynomial kernels unless NP\subseteq
coNP/poly.
