In this paper, we consider the Target Set Selection problem: given a graph
and a threshold value $thr(v)$ for any vertex $v$ of the graph, find a minimum
size vertex-subset to "activate" s.t. all the vertices of the graph are
activated at the end of the propagation process. A vertex $v$ is activated
during the propagation process if at least $thr(v)$ of its neighbors are
activated. This problem models several practical issues like faults in
distributed networks or word-to-mouth recommendations in social networks. We
show that for any functions $f$ and $\rho$ this problem cannot be approximated
within a factor of $\rho(k)$ in $f(k) \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, unless FPT = W[P],
even for restricted thresholds (namely constant and majority thresholds). We
also study the cardinality constraint maximization and minimization versions of
the problem for which we prove similar hardness results.
