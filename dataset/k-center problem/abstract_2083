The equilibrium conditions of a system consisting of a box with gas divided
by a piston are revised. The apparent indetermination of the problem is solved
by explicitly imposing the constancy of the internal energy when the Entropy
Maximum Principle is applied. The equality of the pressures is naturally
concluded from this principle when the piston is allowed to spontaneously move.
The application of the Energy Minimum Principle is also revised.
