We consider unknown ad-hoc radio networks, when the underlying network is
bidirectional and nodes can have polynomially large labels. For this model, we
present a deterministic protocol for gossiping which takes $O(n \lg^2 n \lg \lg
n)$ rounds. This improves upon the previous best result for deterministic
gossiping for this model by [Gasienec, Potapov, Pagourtizis, Deterministic
Gossiping in Radio Networks with Large labels, ESA (2002)], who present a
protocol of round complexity $O(n \lg^3 n \lg \lg n)$ for this problem. This
resolves open problem posed in [Gasienec, Efficient gossiping in radio
networks, SIROCCO (2009)], who cite bridging gap between lower and upper bounds
for this problem as an important objective. We emphasize that a salient feature
of our protocol is its simplicity, especially with respect to the previous best
known protocol for this problem.
