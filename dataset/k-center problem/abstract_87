In this paper, we demonstrate an elementary method for constructing new
solutions to Bochner's problem for matrix differential operators from known
solutions. We then describe a large family of solutions to Bochner's problem,
obtained from classical solutions, which include several examples known from
the literature. By virtue of the method of construction, we show how one may
explicitly identify a generating function for the associated sequence of monic
w-orthogonal matrix polynomials p(x,n) as well as the associated algebra D(w)
of all matrix differential operators for which the p(x,n) are eigenfunctions.
