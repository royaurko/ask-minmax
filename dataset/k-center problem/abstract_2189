This is an expository account of Balaban's approach to the renormalization
group. The method is illustrated with a treatment of the ultraviolet problem
for the scalar phi^4 model on a toroidal lattice in dimension d=3. In this
third paper we demonstrate convergence of the expansion and complete the proof
of a stability bound.
