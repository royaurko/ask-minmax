The generalized traveling salesman problem (GTSP) is an extension of the
well-known traveling salesman problem. In GTSP, we are given a partition of
cities into groups and we are required to find a minimum length tour that
includes exactly one city from each group. The recent studies on this subject
consider different variations of a memetic algorithm approach to the GTSP. The
aim of this paper is to present a new memetic algorithm for GTSP with a
powerful local search procedure. The experiments show that the proposed
algorithm clearly outperforms all of the known heuristics with respect to both
solution quality and running time. While the other memetic algorithms were
designed only for the symmetric GTSP, our algorithm can solve both symmetric
and asymmetric instances.
