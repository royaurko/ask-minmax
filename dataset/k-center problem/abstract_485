The correctness of Harrods model in the differential form is studied. The
inadequacy of exponential growth of economy is shown; an alternative result is
obtained. By example of Phillips model, an approach to correction of
macroeconomic models (in terms of initial prerequisites) is generalized. A
methodology based on balance relations for modelling of economic dynamics,
including obtaining forecast estimates, is developed. The problems thus
considered are reduced to the solution of Volterra and Fredholm integral
equations of the second kind.
