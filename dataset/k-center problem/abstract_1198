For the special theory of relativity, the normalization problem is formulated
as the question how observers in constant relative motion may reach an
agreement on space and time scales. As the normalization problem does not
receive a thorough treatment in the standard development of the theory, two
possible solutions called normalization at rest and normalization in motion are
suggested. It is shown that normalization in motion makes the validity of the
Lorentz transformation the result of mere conventions. The non-conventional
approach following from normalization at rest requires an assumption concerning
the acceleration of objects. A conceptual distinction between inside and
outside observation, together with the analysis of the normalization problem,
allows us to formulate an alternative interpretation of special relativity
contrasting both the standard interpretation and Lorentz-type interpretations.
