A semi-Lagrangian method for parabolic problems is proposed, that extends
previous work by the contributors to achieve a fully conservative, flux-form
discretization of linear and nonlinear diffusion equations. A basic consistency
and convergence analysis are proposed. Numerical examples validate the proposed
method and display its potential for consistent semi-Lagrangian discretization
of advection--diffusion and nonlinear parabolic problems.
