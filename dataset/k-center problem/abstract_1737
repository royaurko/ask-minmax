A new approach which generalizes the Selective Modal Analyis (SMA) and
algorithms based upon it for solving the generalized eigenvalue problem is
described. This approach allows for the systematic consideration of physical
properties of the system under study. Two small application cases demonstrate
the capabilities of the proposed approach.
