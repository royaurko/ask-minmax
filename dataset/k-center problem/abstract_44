A strongly damped wave equation including the displacement depending
nonlinear damping term and nonlinear interaction function is considered. The
main aim of the note is to show that under the standard dissipativity
restrictions on the nonlinearities involved the initial boundary value problem
for the considered equation is globally well-posed in the class of sufficiently
regular solutions and the semigroup generated by the problem possesses a global
attractor in the corresponding phase space. These results are obtained for the
nonlinearities of an arbitrary polynomial growth and without the assumption
that the considered problem has a global Lyapunov function.
