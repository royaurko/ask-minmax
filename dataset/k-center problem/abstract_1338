Verification of multi-agents systems (MAS) has been recently studied taking
into account the need of expressing resource bounds. Several logics for
specifying properties of MAS have been presented in quite a variety of
scenarios with bounded resources. In this paper, we study a different
formalism, called Priced Resource-Bounded Alternating-time Temporal Logic
(PRBATL), whose main novelty consists in moving the notion of resources from a
syntactic level (part of the formula) to a semantic one (part of the model).
This allows us to track the evolution of the resource availability along the
computations and provides us with a formalisms capable to model a number of
real-world scenarios. Two relevant aspects are the notion of global
availability of the resources on the market, that are shared by the agents, and
the notion of price of resources, depending on their availability. In a
previous work of ours, an initial step towards this new formalism was
introduced, along with an EXPTIME algorithm for the model checking problem. In
this paper we better analyze the features of the proposed formalism, also in
comparison with previous approaches. The main technical contribution is the
proof of the EXPTIME-hardness of the the model checking problem for PRBATL,
based on a reduction from the acceptance problem for Linearly-Bounded
Alternating Turing Machines. In particular, since the problem has multiple
parameters, we show two fixed-parameter reductions.
