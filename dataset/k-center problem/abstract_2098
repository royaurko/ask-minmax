The four-fermion gravitational interaction is induced by torsion, and gets
essential on the Planck scale. On this scale, the axial-axial contribution
dominates strongly in the discussed interaction. The energy-momentum tensor,
generated by this contribution, is analyzed, as well as stability of the
problem with respect to compression. The trace of this energy-momentum tensor
can be negative.
