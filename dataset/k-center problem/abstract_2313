We establish a sharp upper estimate for the order of a canonical system in
terms of the Hamiltonian. This upper estimate becomes an equality in the case
of Krein strings. As an application we prove a conjecture of Valent about the
order of a certain class of Jacobi matrices with polynomial coefficients.
