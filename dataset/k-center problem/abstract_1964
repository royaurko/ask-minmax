The problem of particle fluctuations in arbitrary nonuniform systems with
Bose-Einstein condensate is considered. This includes the case of trapped Bose
atoms. It is shown that the correct description of particle fluctuations for
any nonuniform system of interacting atoms always results in thermodynamically
normal fluctuations.
