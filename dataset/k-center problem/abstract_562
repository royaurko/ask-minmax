In this article, we consider the boundary-value problem of nonlinear
fractional differential equation with p-Laplacian operator. By the properties
of Green function and Schauder fixed point theorem, several existence and
nonexistence results for positive solutions, in terms of two parameters are
obtained. The uniqueness of positive solution on these parameters is also
studied.
