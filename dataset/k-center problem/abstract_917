Let $V$ be a finite dimensional inner product space over $\mathbb{R}$ with
dimension $n$, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$, $\wedge^{r}V$ be the exterior algebra
of $V$, the problem is to find $\max_{\| \xi \| = 1, \| \eta \| = 1}\| \xi
\wedge \eta \|$ where $k,l$ $\in \mathbb{N},$ $\forall \xi \in \wedge^{k}V,
\eta \in \wedge^{l}V.$
  This is a problem suggested by the famous Nobel Prize Winner C.N. Yang. He
solved this problem for $k\leq 2$ in [1], and made the following
\textbf{conjecture} in [2] : If $n=2m$, $k=2r$, $l=2s$, then the maximum is
achieved when $\xi_{max} = \frac{\omega^{k}}{\| \omega^{k}\|}, \eta_{max} =
\frac{\omega^{l}}{\| \omega^{l}\|}$, where $ \omega = \Sigma_{i=1}^m
e_{2i-1}\wedge e_{2i}, $ and $\{e_{k}\}_{k=1}^{2m}$ is an orthonormal basis of
V.
  From a physicist's point of view, this problem is just the dual version of
the easier part of the well-known Beauzamy-Bombieri inequality for product of
polynomials in many variables, which is discussed in [4].
  Here the duality is referred as the well known Bose-Fermi correspondence,
where we consider the skew-symmetric algebra(alternative forms) instead of the
familiar symmetric algebra(polynomials in many variables)
  In this paper, for two cases we give estimations of the maximum of exterior
products, and the Yang's conjecture is answered partially under some special
cases.
