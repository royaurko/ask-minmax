One of the most outstanding problems of the standard model of cosmology today
is the problem of cosmological constant/dark energy. It corresponds to about 73
per cent of the energy content of the universe gone missing. I hereby postulate
a modified FRW metric for our universe, which animates a universe spinning
rigidly but very slowly with an angular frequency that is equal to the Hubble
constant. It is shown by a simple argument that in such a universe there will
be an overlooked rotational energy whose average value is identically equal to
the matter-energy content of this universe as observed by a coordinate
observer.
