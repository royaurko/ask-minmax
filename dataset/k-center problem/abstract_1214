Problem of cosmological singularity is discussed in the framework of gauge
theories of gravitation. Generalizing cosmological Friedmann equations (GCFE)
for homogeneous isotropic models including scalar fields and usual gravitating
matter are introduced. It is shown that by certain restrictions on equation of
state of gravitating matter and indefinite parameter of GCFE generic feature of
inflationary cosmological models of flat, open and closed type is their regular
bouncing character.
