We consider an abstract functional-differential equation derived from the
pressure-less Euler system with variable coefficients that includes several
systems of partial differential equations arising in the fluid mechanics. Using
the method of convex integration we show the existence of infinitely many weak
solutions for prescribed initial data and kinetic energy.
