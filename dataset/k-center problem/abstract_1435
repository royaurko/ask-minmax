In this paper we describe a new method for analyzing the Laplacian on
asymptotically hyperbolic spaces, which was introduced recently by the contributor.
This new method in particular constructs the analytic continuation of the
resolvent for even metrics (in the sense of Guillarmou), and gives high energy
estimates in strips. The key idea is an extension across the boundary for a
problem obtained from the Laplacian shifted by the spectral parameter. The
extended problem is non-elliptic -- indeed, on the other side it is related to
the Klein-Gordon equation on an asymptotically de Sitter space -- but
nonetheless it can be analyzed by methods of Fredholm theory. This method is a
special case of a more general approach to the analysis of PDEs which includes,
for instance, Kerr-de Sitter and Minkowski type spaces. The present paper is
self-contained, and deals with asymptotically hyperbolic spaces without
burdening the reader with material only needed for the analysis of the
Lorentzian problems considered in the contributor's original work.
