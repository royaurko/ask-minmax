We show that knowing the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (DN) associated to the
equations of elastodynamics with residual stress we can determine the lens
relations of presssure and shear waves. We derive several consequences of this
for the inverse problem of determining the residual stress and the Lam\'e
parameters from the DN map.
