In this paper, we use the unitary representation theory of $SL_2(\mathbb R)$
to understand the Rankin-Cohen brackets for modular forms. Then we use this
interpretation to study the corresponding deformation problems that Paula
Cohen, Yuri Manin and Don Zagier initiated. Two uniqueness results are
established.
