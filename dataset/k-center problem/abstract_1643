Some models for developed turbulence are considered; they are shown to obey a
large fluctuations theorem, and one among them also obeys a response
reciprocity relation of Onsager's type. This illustrates and extends ideas and
techniques developed in earlier works mainly for non equilibrium problems in
statistical mechanics.
