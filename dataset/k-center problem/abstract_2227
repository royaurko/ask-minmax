We consider the full Navier-Stokes-Fourier system in the singular regime of
small Mach and large Reynolds and Peclet numbers, with ill prepared initial
data on an unbounded domain in the three dimensional Euclidean space with a
compact boundary. We perform the singular limit in the framework of weak
solutions and identify the Euler-Boussinesq system as the target problem.
