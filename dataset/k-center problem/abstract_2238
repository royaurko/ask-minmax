In this paper a simple, effective adaptation of Alternating Direction
Implicit (ADI) time discretization schemes is proposed for the numerical
pricing of American-style options under the Heston model via a partial
differential complementarity problem. The stability and convergence of the new
methods are extensively investigated in actual, challenging applications. In
addition a relevant theoretical result is proved.
