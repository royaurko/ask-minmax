In this paper we extend existing results concerning generalized eigenvalues
of Pucci's extremal operators. In the radial case, we also give a complete
description of their spectrum, together with an equivalent of Rabinowitz's
Global Bifurcation Theorem. This allows us to solve equations involving Pucci's
operators.
