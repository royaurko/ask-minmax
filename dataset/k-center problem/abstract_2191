We derive a non-linear version of the Feynman-Kac formula for the solutions
of the vorticity equation in dimension 2 with space periodic boundary
conditions. We prove the existence (global in time) and uniqueness for a
stochastic terminal value problem associated with the vorticity equation in
dimension 2.
