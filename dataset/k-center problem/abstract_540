We set up a left ring of fractions over a certain ring of boundary problems
for linear ordinary differential equations. The fraction ring acts naturally on
a new module of generalized functions. The latter includes an isomorphic copy
of the differential algebra underlying the given ring of boundary problems. Our
methodology employs noncommutative localization in the theory of
integro-differential algebras and operators. The resulting structure allows to
build a symbolic calculus in the style of Heaviside and Mikusinski, but with
the added benefit of incorporating boundary conditions where the traditional
calculi allow only initial conditions.
