In this paper we investigate stratosphere temperature impact on remote ozone
satellite and ground-based optical observations. High correlation between
stratospheric temperature and instrumentally determined total ozone content
requires taking into account temperature dependency of ozone absorption and
scattering indexes and of other atmosphere characteristics for inverse ozone
observations problem solution. The assumption that the majority of observed
ozone anomalies and trends are caused by atmosphere temperature change is made.
