We propose a new solution to the strong CP problem based on supersymmetric
non-renormalization theorems. CP is broken spontaneously and it's breaking is
communicated to the MSSM by radiative corrections. The strong CP phase is
protected by a susy non-renormalization theorem and remains exactly zero while
loops can generate a large CKM phase from wave function renormalization. We
present a concrete model as an example but stress that our framework is
general. We also discuss constraints on susy breaking and point out
experimental signatures.
