We consider mixing problems in the form of transient convection--diffusion
equations with a velocity vector field with multiscale character and rough
data. We assume that the velocity field has two scales, a coarse scale with
slow spatial variation, which is responsible for advective transport and a fine
scale with small amplitude that contributes to the mixing. For this problem we
consider the estimation of filtered error quantities for solutions computed
using a finite element method with symmetric stabilization. A posteriori error
estimates and a priori error estimates are derived using the multiscale
decomposition of the advective velocity to improve stability. All estimates are
independent both of the P\'eclet number and of the regularity of the exact
solution.
