For many algebraic codes the main part of decoding can be reduced to a shift
register synthesis problem. In this paper we present an approach for solving
generalised shift register problems over skew polynomial rings which occur in
error and erasure decoding of $\ell$-Interleaved Gabidulin codes. The algorithm
is based on module minimisation and has time complexity $O(\ell \mu^2)$ where
$\mu$ measures the size of the input problem.
