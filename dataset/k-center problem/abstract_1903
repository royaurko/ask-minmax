In this paper we focus on the global-in-time existence and the pointwise
estimates of solutions to the initial value problem for the semilinear
dissipative wave equation in multi-dimensions. By using the method of Green
function combined with the energy estimates, we obtain the pointwise estimates
of the solution.
