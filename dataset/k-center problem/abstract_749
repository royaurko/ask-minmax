We consider the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation
with derivative nonlinearity $(i\partial _t + \Delta ) u= \pm \partial
(\overline{u}^m)$ on $\R ^d$, $d \ge 1$, with random initial data, where
$\partial$ is a first order derivative with respect to the spatial variable,
for example a linear combination of $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} , \, \dots ,
\, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_d}$ or $|\nabla |= \mathcal{F}^{-1}[|\xi |
\mathcal{F}]$. We prove that almost sure local in time well-posedness, small
data global in time well-posedness and scattering hold in $H^s(\R ^d)$ with $s>
\max \left( \frac{d-1}{d} s_c , \frac{s_c}{2}, s_c - \frac{d}{2(d+1)} \right)$
for $d+m \ge 5$, where $s$ is below the scaling critical regularity $s_c :=
\frac{d}{2}-\frac{1}{m-1}$.
