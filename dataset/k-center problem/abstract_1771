We prove that every finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed
field is either derived tame or derived wild. The proof is based on the
technique of matrix problems (boxes and reduction algorithm). It implies, in
particular, that any degeneration of a derived wild algebra is derived wild;
respectively, any deformation of a derived tame algebra is derived tame.
