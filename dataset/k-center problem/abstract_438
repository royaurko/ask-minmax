We treat the classical dynamics of the hydrogen atom in perpendicular
electric and magnetic fields as a celestial mechanics problem. By expressing
the Hamiltonian in appropriate action-angle variables, we separate the
different time scales of the motion. The method of averaging then allows us to
reduce the system to two degrees of freedom, and to classify the most important
periodic orbits.
