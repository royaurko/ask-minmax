The aim of this paper is to investigate weakly developable spaces. For a
comparison with semi-metrizable spaces, we introduce and study a class of
spaces among those of weakly developable spaces, semimetrizable spaces and
first countable spaces having a G_delta-diagonal. Some results are obtained and
applications to the problem of extending continuous functions are discussed.
