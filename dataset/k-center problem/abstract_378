We consider how the languages of $G$-automata compare with other formal
language classes. We prove that if the word problem of a group $G$ is accepted
by a machine in the class $\mathcal M$ then the language of any $G$-automaton
is in the class $\mathcal M$. It follows that the so called {\emph counter
languages} (languages of $\mathbb Z^n$-automata) are context-sensitive, and
further that counter languages are indexed if and only if the word problem for
$\mathbb Z^n$ is indexed.
