In this paper, we address the fusion problem in wireless sensor networks,
where the cross-correlation between the estimates is unknown. To solve the
problem within the Bayesian framework, we assume that the covariance matrix has
a prior distribution. We also assume that we know the covariance of each
estimate, i.e., the diagonal block of the entire covariance matrix (of the
random vector consisting of the two estimates). We then derive the conditional
distribution of the off-diagonal blocks, which is the cross-correlation of our
interest. We show that when there are two nodes, the conditional distribution
happens to be the inverted matrix variate $t$-distribution, from which we can
readily sample. For more than two nodes, the conditional distribution is no
longer the inverted matrix variate $t$-distribution. But we show that we can
decompose it into several sampling problems, each of which is the inverted
matrix variate $t$-distribution and therefore we can still sample from it.
Since we can sample from this distribution, it enables us to use the Monte
Carlo method to compute the minimum mean square error estimate for the fusion
problem. We use two models to generate experiment data and demonstrate the
generality of our method. Simulation results show that the proposed method
works better than the popular covariance intersection method.
