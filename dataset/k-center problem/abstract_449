We consider the problem of estimating the period of an unknown periodic
function observed in additive noise sampled at irregularly spaced time instants
in a semiparametric setting. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
estimator based on the cumulated Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We prove that this
estimator is consistent, asymptotically Gaussian and we provide an explicit
expression of the asymptotic variance. Some Monte-Carlo experiments are then
presented to support our claims.
