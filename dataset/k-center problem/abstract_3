In $N$-body problem, a simple choreography solution is a periodic solution in
which all the masses chase each other on a single loop. In this paper we prove
that for the Newtonian $N$-body problem, $N \ge 3$, there are at least
$2^{N-2}$ different main simple choreography solutions. As a result this
confirms a conjecture given by Chenciner and etc.
