This paper discusses the solutions to the perturbed wave equation containing
a singular potential term in the Lorentzian metric. We present the classical
solution to the problem using the separation of variables method for any
dimension, n. Special solutions are obtained for even n's and properties of
these solutions are discussed. Finally, we also consider the solution to the
Cauchy problem for the case n=2.
