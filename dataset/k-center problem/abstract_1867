Using coherent states of the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra $h_N$, extended Voros
products and Moyal brakets are derived.
  The covariance of Voros product under canonical transformations is discussed.
Star product related to Barut-Girardello coherent states of the Lie algebra
$su(1,1)$ is also considered. The star eigenvalue problem of singular harmonic
osillator is investigated.
