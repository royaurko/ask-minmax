The problem to be studied in this work is within the context of coefficient
identification problems for the wave equation. More precisely, we consider the
problem of reconstruction of the refractive index (or equivalently, the
dielectric constant) of an inhomogeneous medium using one backscattering
boundary measurement. The goal of this paper is to analyze the performance of a
globally convergent algorithm of Beilina and Klibanov on experimental data
acquired in the Microwave Laboratory at University of North Carolina at
Charlotte. The main challenge working with experimental data is the the huge
misfit between these data and computationally simulated data. We present data
pre-processing steps to make the former somehow look similar to the latter.
Results of both non-blind and blind targets are shown indicating good
reconstructions even for high contrasts between the targets and the background
medium.
