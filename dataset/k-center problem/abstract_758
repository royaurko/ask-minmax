In this paper, indirect collocation approach based on compactly supported
radial basis function is applied for solving Volterras population model. The
method reduces the solution of this problem to the solution of a system of
algebraic equations. Volterras model is a non-linear integro-differential
equation where the integral term represents the effect of toxin. To solve the
problem, we use the well-known CSRBF: Wendland3,5. Numerical results and
residual norm 2 show good accuracy and rate of convergence.
