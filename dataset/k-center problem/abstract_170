This paper addresses the problem of improving properties of a linear operator
u in $l_2^n$ by restricting it onto coordinate subspaces. We discuss how to
reduce the norm of u by a random coordinate restriction, how to approximate u
by a random operator with small "coordinate" rank, how to find coordinate
subspaces where u is an isomorphism. The first problem in this list provides a
probabilistic extension of a suppression theorem of Kashin and Tzafriri, the
second one is a new look at a result of Rudelson on the random vectors in the
isotropic position, the last one is the recent generalization of the
Bourgain-Tzafriri's invertibility principle. The main point is that all the
results are independent of n, the situation is instead controlled by the
Hilbert-Schmidt norm of u. As an application, we provide an almost optimal
solution to the problem of harmonic density in harmonic analysis, and a
solution to the reconstruction problem for communication networks which deliver
data with random losses.
