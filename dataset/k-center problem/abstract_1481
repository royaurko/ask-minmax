Given a graph $G$ cellularly embedded on a surface $\Sigma$ of genus $g$, a
cut graph is a subgraph of $G$ such that cutting $\Sigma$ along $G$ yields a
topological disk. We provide a fixed parameter tractable approximation scheme
for the problem of computing the shortest cut graph, that is, for any
$\varepsilon >0$, we show how to compute a $(1+ \varepsilon)$ approximation of
the shortest cut graph in time $f(\varepsilon, g)n^3$.
  Our techniques first rely on the computation of a spanner for the problem
using the technique of brick decompositions, to reduce the problem to the case
of bounded tree-width. Then, to solve the bounded tree-width case, we introduce
a variant of the surface-cut decomposition of Ru\'e, Sau and Thilikos, which
may be of independent interest.
