We consider the energy modeling a two component Bose-Einstein condensate in
the limit of strong coupling and strong segregation. We prove the
$\Gamma$-convergence to a perimeter minimization problem, with a weight given
by the density of the condensate. In the case of equal mass for the two
components, this leads to symmetry breaking for the ground state. The proof
relies on a new formulation of the problem in terms of the total density and
spin functions, which turns the energy into the sum of two weighted
Cahn-Hilliard energies. Then, we use techniques coming from geometric measure
theory to construct upper and lower bounds. In particular, we make use of the
slicing technique introduced in Ambrosio-Tororelli (CPAM, 1990).
