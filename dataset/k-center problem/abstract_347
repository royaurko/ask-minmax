The quark model and the parton model are known to be two different
manifestations of the same covariant entity. However, the interaction
amplitudes of partons are incoherent while they are coherent in the quark
model. According to Feynman, this is due to the dilation of the interaction
time among the quarks. We present a quantitative analysis of this time-dilation
problem using Lorentz boosts as squeeze transformations.
