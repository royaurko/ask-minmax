In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenvalues
associated to the Pucci operator in bounded domain $\Omega$ with Neumann/Robin
boundary condition i.e. $\partial_n u=\alpha u$ when $\alpha$ tends to
infinity. This study requires Lipschitz estimates up to the boundary that are
interesting in their own rights.
