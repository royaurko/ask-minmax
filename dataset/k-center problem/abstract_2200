We prove the Hasse principle and weak approximation for varieties defined
over number fields by the nonsingular intersection of pairs of quadratic forms
in 8 variables. The argument develops work of Colliot-Thelene, Sansuc and
Swinnerton-Dyer, and centres on a purely local problem about forms which split
off 3 hyperbolic planes.
