We study intersections of projective convex sets in the sense of Steinitz. In
a projective space, an intersection of a nonempty family of convex sets splits
into multiple connected components each of which is a convex set. Hence, such
an intersection is called a multi-convex set. We derive a duality for saturated
multi-convex sets: there exists an order anti-isomorphism between nonempty
saturated multi-convex sets in a real projective space and those in the dual
projective space. In discrete geometry and computational geometry, these
results allow to transform a given problem into a dual problem which sometimes
is easier to solve. This will be pursued in a later paper.
