We propose a new convergent time semi-discrete scheme for the stochastic
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The scheme is only linearly implicit and does
not require the resolution of a nonlinear problem at each time step. Using a
martingale approach, we prove the convergence in law of the scheme up to a
subsequence.
