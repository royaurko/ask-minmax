The paper is concerned with the problem of shape preserving interpolatory
subdivision. For arbitrarily spaced, planar input data an efficient non-linear
subdivision algorithm is presented that results in $G^1$ limit curves,
reproduces conic sections and respects the convexity properties of the initial
data. Significant numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.
