In a recent paper, Trent and Wick establish a strong relation between the
corona problem and the Toeplitz corona problem for a family of spaces over the
ball and the polydisk. Their work is based on earlier work of Amar. In this
note, several of their lemmas are reinterpreted in the language of Hilbert
modules, revealing some interesting facts and raising some questions about
quasi-free Hilbert modules. Moreover, a modest generalization of their result
is obtained.
