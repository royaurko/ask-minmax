Given Markov chains and Markov decision processes (MDPs) whose transitions
are labelled with non-negative integer costs, we study the computational
complexity of deciding whether the probability of paths whose accumulated cost
satisfies a Boolean combination of inequalities exceeds a given threshold. For
acyclic Markov chains, we show that this problem is PP-complete, whereas it is
hard for the PosSLP problem and in PSPACE for general Markov chains. Moreover,
for acyclic and general MDPs, we prove PSPACE- and EXP-completeness,
respectively. Our results have direct implications on the complexity of
computing reward quantiles in succinctly represented stochastic systems.
