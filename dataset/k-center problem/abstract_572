The nonrelativistic problem of a particle immersed in a triangular potential
well, set forth by N.A. Rao and B.A. Kagali, is revised. It is shown that these
researchers misunderstood the full meaning of the potential and obtained a
wrong quantization condition. By exploring the space inversion symmetry, this
work presents the correct solution to this problem with potential applications
in electronics in a simple and transparent way.
