We give an update on our derivation of a quantization condition relating the
finite-volume spectrum of three particles in a cubic box to infinite-volume
scattering quantities. We have discovered and fixed technical problems in the
derivation sketched in the proceedings of last year's lattice conference
[arXiv:1311.4848], and have presented a detailed description of the corrected
derivation in Ref. [arXiv:1408.5933]. Here we give an overview of the problems
and their solutions, and describe open questions.
