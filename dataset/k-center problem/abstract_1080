We study interactions between localized scatterers on metallic carbon
nanotubes by a mapping onto a one-dimensional Casimir problem. Backscattering
of electrons between localized scattering potentials mediates long range forces
between them. We model spatially localized scatterers by local and non-local
potentials and treat simultaneously the effects of intravalley and intervalley
backscattering. We find that the long range forces between scatterers exhibit
the universal power law decay of the Casimir force in one dimension, with
prefactors that control the sign and strength of the interaction. These
prefactors are nonuniversal and depend on the symmetry and degree of
localization of the scattering potentials. We find that local potentials
inevitably lead to a coupled valley scattering problem, though by contrast
non-local potentials lead to two decoupled single-valley problems in a
physically realized regime. The Casimir effect due to two-valley scattering
potentials is characterized by the appearance of spatially periodic modulations
of the force.
