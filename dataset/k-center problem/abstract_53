We study the dynamics of the interface between two incompressible fluids in a
two-dimensional porous medium whose flow is modeled by the Muskat equations.
For the two-phase Muskat problem, we establish global well-posedness and decay
to equilibrium for small $H^2$ perturbations of the rest state. For the
one-phase Muskat problem, we prove local well-posedness for $H^2$ initial data
of arbitrary size. Finally, we show that solutions to the Muskat equations
instantaneously become infinitely smooth.
