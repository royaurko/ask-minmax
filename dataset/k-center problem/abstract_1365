We present a novel scheme to the coverage problem, introducing a quantitative
way to estimate the interaction between a block and its enviroment.This is
achieved by setting a discrete version of Green`s theorem, specially adapted
for Model Checking based verification of integrated circuits.This method is
best suited for the coverage problem since it enables one to quantify the
incompleteness or, on the other hand, the redundancy of a set of rules,
describing the model under verification.Moreover this can be done continuously
throughout the verification process, thus enabling the user to pinpoint the
stages at which incompleteness/redundancy occurs. Although the method is
presented locally on a small hardware example, we additionally show its
possibility to provide precise coverage estimation also for large scale
systems. We compare this method to others by checking it on the same
test-cases.
