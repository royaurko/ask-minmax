We obtain the most general matrix criterion for stability and instability of
multi-component solitary waves considering a system of $N$ incoherently coupled
nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Soliton stability is studied as a constrained
variational problem which is reduced to finite-dimensional linear algebra. We
prove that unstable (all real and positive) eigenvalues of the linear stability
problem for multi-component solitary waves are connected with negative
eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, the latter is constructed for the energetic
surface of N-component spatially localized stationary solutions.
