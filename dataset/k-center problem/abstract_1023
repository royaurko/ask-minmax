We prove a general theorem that the
$L_{\rho}^2({\mathbb{R}^{d}};{\mathbb{R}^{1}})\otimes
L_{\rho}^2({\mathbb{R}^{d}};{\mathbb{R}^{d}})$ valued solution of an infinite
horizon backward doubly stochastic differential equation, if exists, gives the
stationary solution of the corresponding stochastic partial differential
equation. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the
$L_{\rho}^2({\mathbb{R}^{d}};{\mathbb{R}^{1}})\otimes
L_{\rho}^2({\mathbb{R}^{d}};{\mathbb{R}^{d}})$ valued solutions for backward
doubly stochastic differential equations on finite and infinite horizon with
linear growth without assuming Lipschitz conditions, but under the monotonicity
condition. Therefore the solution of finite horizon problem gives the solution
of the initial value problem of the corresponding stochastic partial
differential equations, and the solution of the infinite horizon problem gives
the stationary solution of the SPDEs according to our general result.
