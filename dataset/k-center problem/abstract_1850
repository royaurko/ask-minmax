A class of Riemann-Hilbert problems corresponding to quasi-permutation
monodromy matrices is solved in terms of Szeg\"o kernel on auxiliary Riemann
surfaces. The tau-function of Schlesinger system turns out to be closely
related to determinant of Cauchy-Riemann operator. The link between
theta-divisor and Malgrange's divisor in the theory of Schlesinger equations is
established.
