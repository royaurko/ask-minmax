This manuscript presents a problem on special relativity theory (SRT) which
embodies an apparent paradox relying on the concept of simultaneity. The
problem is represented in the framework of Greek epic poetry and structured in
a didactic way. Owing to the characteristic properties of Lorenz
transformations, three events which are simultaneous in a given inertial
reference system, occur at different times in the other two reference frames.
In contrast to the famous twin paradox, in the present case there are three,
not two, different inertial observers. This feature provides a better framework
to expose some of the main characteristics of SRT, in particular, the concept
of velocity and the relativistic rule of addition of velocities.
