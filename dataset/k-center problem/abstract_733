Numerical solution of non-steady problems of supersonic inflow of a binary
mixture of a rarefied gas on a normally posed wall with mirror and diffuse
reflection laws is obtained on the basis of the kinetic Boltzmann equation for
the model of hard sphere molecules. For calculation of collision integrals we
apply the projection method, developed by Tcheremissine for a one-component gas
and generalized by the contributor for a binary gas mixture in the case of
cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate a good qualitative agreement of our
results with other contributors for one-component gases.
