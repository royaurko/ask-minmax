The Survey Propagation (SP) algorithm for solving $k$-SAT problems has been
shown recently as an instance of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm. In this
paper, we show that for general constraint-satisfaction problems, SP may not be
reducible from BP. We also establish the conditions under which such a
reduction is possible. Along our development, we present a unification of the
existing SP algorithms in terms of a probabilistically interpretable iterative
procedure -- weighted Probabilistic Token Passing.
