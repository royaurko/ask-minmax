We consider an elliptic eigenvalue problem with a fast cellular flow of
amplitude $A$, in a two-dimensional domain with $L^2$ cells. For fixed $A$, and
$L \to \infty$, the problem homogenizes, and has been well studied. Also well
studied is the limit when $L$ is fixed, and $A \to \infty$. In this case the
solution equilibrates along stream lines.
  In this paper, we show that if \textit{both} $A \to \infty$ and $L \to
\infty$, then a transition between the homogenization and averaging regimes
occurs at $A \approx L^4$. When $A\gg L^4$, the principal Dirichlet eigenvalue
is approximately constant. On the other hand, when $A\ll L^4$, the principal
eigenvalue behaves like ${\bar \sigma(A)}/L^2$, where $\bar \sigma(A) \approx
\sqrt{A} I$ is the effective diffusion matrix. A similar transition is observed
for the solution of the exit time problem. The proof in the homogenization
regime involves bounds on the second correctors. Miraculously, if the slow
profile is quadratic, these estimates can be obtained using drift independent
$L^p \to L^\infty$ estimates for elliptic equations with an incompressible
drift. This provides effective sub and super-solutions for our problem.
