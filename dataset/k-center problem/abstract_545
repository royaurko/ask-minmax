The problem of integer partitions is addressed using the microcanonical
approach which is based on the analogy between this problem in the number
theory and the calculation of microstates of a many-boson system. For ordinary
(one-dimensional) partitions, the correction to the leading asymptotic is
obtained. The estimate for the number of two-dimensional (plane) partitions
coincides with known asymptotic results.
