We present a model for nonlocal diffusion with Neumann boundary conditions in
a bounded smooth domain prescribing the flux through the boundary. We study the
limit of this family of nonlocal diffusion operators when a rescaling parameter
related to the kernel of the nonlocal operator goes to zero. We prove that the
solutions of this family of problems converge to a solution of the heat
equation with Neumann boundary conditions.
