A new and relatively unexplored research direction in robotics systems is the
coordination of humans and robots working as a team. In this paper, we focus
upon problem domains and tasks in which multiple robots, humans and other
agents are cooperating through coordination to satisfy a set of goals or to
maximize utility. We are primarily interested in applications of human robot
coordination in entertainment and other activities of daily life. We discuss
the teamwork problem and propose an architecture to address this.
