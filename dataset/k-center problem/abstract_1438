In this paper we investigate some new problems in additive combinatorics. Our
problems mainly involve permutations (or circular permutations)
$a_1,\ldots,a_n$ of $n$ distinct numbers or elements of an additive abelian
group with adjacent sums $a_i+a_{i+1}$ (or differences $a_i-a_{i+1}$ or
distances $|a_i-a_{i+1}|$) pairwise distinct. For any subset $A$ of an additive
torsion-free abelian group $G$ with $|A|=n>3$, we show that there is a
numbering $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ of the elements of $A$ such that
  $$a_1+a_2+a_3,\ a_2+a_3+a_4,\ \ldots,\ a_{n-2}+a_{n-1}+a_n,\
a_{n-1}+a_n+a_1,\ a_n+a_1+a_2$$ are pairwise distinct. We pose 18 open
conjectures for further research; for example, we conjecture that the above
assertion holds for any abelian group $G$.
