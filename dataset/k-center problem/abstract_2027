We establish some sharp weighted trace inequalities
$W^{1,2}(\rho^{1-2\sigma}, M)\hookrightarrow L^{\frac{2n}{n-2\sigma}}(\pa M)$
on $n+1$ dimensional compact smooth manifolds with smooth boundaries, where
$\rho$ is a defining function of $M$ and $\sigma\in (0,1)$. This is stimulated
by some recent work on fractional (conformal) Laplacians and related problems
in conformal geometry, and also motivated by a conjecture of Aubin.
