Lie and Q-conditional symmetries of the classical three-component diffusive
Lotka - Volterra system in the case of one space variable are studied. The
group-classification problems for finding Lie symmetries and Q-conditional
symmetries of the first type are completely solved. Notably, non-Lie symmetries
(Q-conditional symmetry operators) for a multi-component non-linear
reaction-diffusion system are constructed for the first time. An example of
non-Lie symmetry reduction for solving a biologically motivated problem is
presented.
