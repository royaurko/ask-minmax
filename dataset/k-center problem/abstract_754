General relativity poses serious problems for counterfactual propositions
peculiar to it as a physical theory. Because these problems arise solely from
the dynamical nature of spacetime geometry, they are shared by all schools of
thought on how counterfactuals should be interpreted and understood. Given the
role of counterfactuals in the characterization of, inter alia, many accounts
of scientific laws, theory confirmation and causation, general relativity once
again presents us with idiosyncratic puzzles any attempt to analyze and
understand the nature of scientific knowledge must face.
