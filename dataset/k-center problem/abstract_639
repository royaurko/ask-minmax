In 1970s, a method was developed for integration of nonlinear equations by
means of algebraic geometry. Starting from a Lax representation with spectral
parameter, the algebro-geometric method allows to solve the system explicitly
in terms of theta functions of Riemann surfaces. However, the explicit formulas
obtained in this way fail to answer qualitative questions such as whether a
given singular solution is stable or not. In the present paper, the problem of
stability for equilibrium points is considered, and it is shown that this
problem can also be approached by means of algebraic geometry.
