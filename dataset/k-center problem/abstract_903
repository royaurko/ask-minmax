Although the standard generally-covariant Dirac equation is unique in a
topologically simple spacetime, it has been shown that it leads to
non-uniqueness problems for the Hamiltonian and energy operators, including the
non-uniqueness of the energy spectrum. These problems should be solved by
restricting the choice of the Dirac gamma field in a consistent way. Recently,
we proposed to impose the value of the rotation rate of the tetrad field. This
is not necessarily easy to implement and works only in a given reference frame.
Here, we propose that the gamma field should change only by constant gauge
transformations. To get that situation, we are naturally led to assume that the
metric can be put in a space-isotropic diagonal form. When this is the case, it
distinguishes a preferred reference frame. We show that by defining the gamma
field from the "diagonal tetrad" in a chart in which the metric has that form,
the uniqueness problems are solved at once for all reference frames. We discuss
the physical relevance of the metric considered and our restriction to
first-quantized theory.
