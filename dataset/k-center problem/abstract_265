It is well known that the verification of resource-constrained multiagent
systems is undecidable in general. In many such settings, resources are private
to agents. In this paper, we investigate the model checking problem for a
resource logic based on Alternating-Time Temporal Logic (ATL) with shared
resources. Resources can be consumed and produced up to any amount. We show
that the model checking problem is undecidable if two or more of such unbounded
resources are available. Our main technical result is that in the case of a
single shared resource, the problem becomes decidable. Although intuitive, the
proof of decidability is non-trivial. We reduce model checking to a problem
over alternating B\"uchi pushdown systems. An intermediate result connects to
general automata-based verification: we show that model checking Computation
Tree Logic (CTL) over (compact) alternating B\"uchi pushdown systems is
decidable.
