We give a randomized $2^{n+o(n)}$-time and space algorithm for solving the
Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) on n-dimensional Euclidean lattices. This
improves on the previous fastest algorithm: the deterministic
$\widetilde{O}(4^n)$-time and $\widetilde{O}(2^n)$-space algorithm of
Micciancio and Voulgaris (STOC 2010, SIAM J. Comp. 2013).
  In fact, we give a conceptually simple algorithm that solves the (in our
opinion, even more interesting) problem of discrete Gaussian sampling (DGS).
More specifically, we show how to sample $2^{n/2}$ vectors from the discrete
Gaussian distribution at any parameter in $2^{n+o(n)}$ time and space. (Prior
work only solved DGS for very large parameters.) Our SVP result then follows
from a natural reduction from SVP to DGS. We also show that our DGS algorithm
implies a $2^{n + o(n)}$-time algorithm that approximates the Closest Vector
Problem to within a factor of $1.97$.
  In addition, we give a more refined algorithm for DGS above the so-called
smoothing parameter of the lattice, which can generate $2^{n/2}$ discrete
Gaussian samples in just $2^{n/2+o(n)}$ time and space. Among other things,
this implies a $2^{n/2+o(n)}$-time and space algorithm for $1.93$-approximate
decision SVP.
