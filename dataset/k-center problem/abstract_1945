We discuss the validity of general relativity at low-energy and relate the
threshold below which the theory breaks down with the observed value of the
cosmological constant. This suggests the existence of a mass scale of ${\cal
O}(10^{-3}) eV$ and a putative violation of the equivalence principle at about
$10^{-14}$ level.
