In this paper we obtain sharp Lieb-Thirring inequalities for a Schr\"odinger
operator on semi-axis with a matrix potential and show how they can be used to
other related problems. Among them are spectral inequalities on star graphs and
spectral inequalities for Schr\"odinger operators on half-spaces with Robin
boundary conditions.
