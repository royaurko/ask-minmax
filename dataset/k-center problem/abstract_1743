We consider stability and approximate reconstruction of Riemannian manifold
when the finite number of eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and the
boundary values of the corresponding eigenfunctions are given. The
reconstruction can be done in stable way when manifold is a priori known to
satisfy natural geometrical conditions related to curvature and other invariant
quantities.
