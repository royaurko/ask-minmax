The nonperturbing experimental methods have been described, by means of which
the solitary vortex structures in gas-discharge nonneutral electron plasma were
detected and investigated. The comparison with the experimental methods used in
devices with pure electron plasma was made. The problems of shielding the
electrostatic perturbations in nonneutral plasmas were considered.
