We demonstrate that there is an intimate relationship between the magnetic
properties of Derrida's random energy model (REM) of spin glasses and the
problem of joint source--channel coding in Information Theory. In particular,
typical patterns of erroneously decoded messages in the coding problem have
``magnetization'' properties that are analogous to those of the REM in certain
phases, where the non--uniformity of the distribution of the source in the
coding problem, plays the role of an external magnetic field applied to the
REM. We also relate the ensemble performance (random coding exponents) of joint
source--channel codes to the free energy of the REM in its different phases.
