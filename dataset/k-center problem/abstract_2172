We study two phase problems posed over a two dimensional cone generated by a
smooth curve $\gamma$ on the unit sphere. We show that when
$length(\gamma)<2\pi$ the free boundary avoids the vertex of the cone. When
$length(\gamma) \geq 2\pi$ we provide examples of minimizers such that the
vertex belongs to the free boundary.
