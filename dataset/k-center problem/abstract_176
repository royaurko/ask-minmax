Solving numerically hydrodynamical problems of incompressible fluids raises
the question of handling first order derivatives (those of pressure) in a
closed container and determining its boundary conditions. We research several
pressure boundary conditions for the primitive variables formulation of
thermoconvective problems. In particular we study the Marangoni instability of
an infinite fluid layer and we show that the numerical results with a Chebyshev
collocation method are highly correspondent to the exact ones. These ideas have
been applied to linear stability analysis of the B\'enard-Marangoni (BM)
problem in cylindrical geometry and the results obtained have been very
accurate.
