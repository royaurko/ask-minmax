In this contribution we show sufficient conditions for simultaneous unique
identification of unknown spacewise coefficients and heat source in a parabolic
partial differential equation given additional final time measurements. Our
approach is based on density, in suitable spaces, of the corresponding adjoint
problem.
  A second issue of this paper is the regularization approach. The sequence of
approximated solution is obtained by coupling the nonlinear Landweber iteration
with iterated Tikhonov regularization. We show that the parameter-to-solution
map satisfies sufficient conditions to prove stability and convergence of
approximated solutions for the identification problem. We use a unified
discrepancy principle as the stopping criteria.
  Finally, we apply the developed theory in the inverse identification problem
of unknown parameters (perfusion coefficient, metabolic heat source) for the
identification of tumor regions by thermography.
