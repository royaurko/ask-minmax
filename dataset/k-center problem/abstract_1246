A critical review is presented of recent data on direct one- and two-nucleon
emission obtained in electron scattering at NIKHEF, Mainz and JLab. In the case
of (e,e$'$p) reactions attention is focussed on extracting spectroscopic
factors, looking at medium effects on the bound nucleon form factors, and
investigating nuclear transparency. The possibility of obtaining information on
nucleon-nucleon correlations in (e,e$'$pp) and (e,e$'$pn) reactions is also
discussed.
