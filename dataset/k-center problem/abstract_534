Multi-class classification is one of the most important tasks in machine
learning. In this paper we consider two online multi-class classification
problems: classification by a linear model and by a kernelized model. The
quality of predictions is measured by the Brier loss function. We suggest two
computationally efficient algorithms to work with these problems and prove
theoretical guarantees on their losses. We kernelize one of the algorithms and
prove theoretical guarantees on its loss. We perform experiments and compare
our algorithms with logistic regression.
