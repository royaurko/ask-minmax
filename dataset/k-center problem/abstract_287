A tropical (or min-plus) semiring is a set $\mathbb{Z}$ (or $\mathbb{Z \cup
\{\infty\}}$) endowed with two operations: $\oplus$, which is just usual
minimum, and $\odot$, which is usual addition. In tropical algebra the vector
$x$ is a solution to a polynomial $g_1(x) \oplus g_2(x) \oplus...\oplus
g_k(x)$, where $g_i(x)$'s are tropical monomials, if the minimum in
$\min_i(g_{i}(x))$ is attained at least twice. In min-plus algebra solutions of
systems of equations of the form $g_1(x)\oplus...\oplus g_k(x) =
h_1(x)\oplus...\oplus h_l(x)$ are studied.
  In this paper we consider computational problems related to tropical linear
system. We show that the solvability problem (both over $\mathbb{Z}$ and
$\mathbb{Z} \cup \{\infty\}$) and the problem of deciding the equivalence of
two linear systems (both over $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z} \cup \{\infty\}$)
are equivalent under polynomial-time reduction to mean payoff games and are
also equivalent to analogous problems in min-plus algebra. In particular, all
these problems belong to $\mathsf{NP} \cap \mathsf{coNP}$. Thus we provide a
tight connection of computational aspects of tropical linear algebra with mean
payoff games and min-plus linear algebra. On the other hand we show that
computing the dimension of the solution space of a tropical linear system and
of a min-plus linear system are $\mathsf{NP}$-complete.
  We also extend some of our results to the systems of min-plus linear
inequalities.
