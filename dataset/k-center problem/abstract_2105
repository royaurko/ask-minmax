We use some basic properties of binomial and Stirling numbers to prove that
the Euler characteristic is, essentially, the unique numerical topological
invariant for compact polyhedra which can be expressed as a linear combination
of the numbers of faces of triangulations. We obtain this result converting it
into an eigenvalue problem.
