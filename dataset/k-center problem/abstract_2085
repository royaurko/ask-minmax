Closed formulas are known for $S(k,0;n)$, the number of standard Young
tableaux of size $n$ and with at most $k$ parts, where $1\le k\le 5$. Here we
study the analogue problem for $S(k,\ell;n)$, the number of standard Young
tableaux of size $n$ which are contained in the $(k,\ell)$ hook. We deduce some
formulas for the cases $k+\ell\le 4$.
