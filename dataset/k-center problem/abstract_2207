We study a BGK-like approximation to hyperbolic conservation laws forced by a
multiplicative noise. First, we make use of the stochastic characteristics
method and establish the existence of a solution for any fi xed parameter
$\varepsilon$. In the next step, we investigate the limit as $\varepsilon$
tends to 0 and show the convergence to the kinetic solution of the limit
problem.
