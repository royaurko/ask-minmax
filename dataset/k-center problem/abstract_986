A unique pattern selection in the absolutely unstable regime of driven,
nonlinear, open-flow systems is reviewed. It has recently been found in
numerical simulations of propagating vortex structures occuring in
Taylor-Couette and Rayleigh-Benard systems subject to an externally imposed
through-flow. Unlike the stationary patterns in systems without through-flow
the spatiotemporal structures of propagating vortices are independent of
parameter history, initial conditions, and system length. They do, however,
depend on the boundary conditions in addition to the driving rate and the
through-flow rate. Our analysis of the Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation
elucidates how the pattern selection can be described by a nonlinear eigenvalue
problem with the frequency being the eigenvalue. Approaching the border between
absolute and convective instability the eigenvalue problem becomes effectively
linear and the selection mechanism approaches that of linear front propagation.
