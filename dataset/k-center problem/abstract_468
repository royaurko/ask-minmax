Distributed synchronization is known to occur at several scales in the brain,
and has been suggested as playing a key functional role in perceptual grouping.
State-of-the-art visual grouping algorithms, however, seem to give
comparatively little attention to neural synchronization analogies. Based on
the framework of concurrent synchronization of dynamic systems, simple networks
of neural oscillators coupled with diffusive connections are proposed to solve
visual grouping problems. Multi-layer algorithms and feedback mechanisms are
also studied. The same algorithm is shown to achieve promising results on
several classical visual grouping problems, including point clustering, contour
integration and image segmentation.
