The Poynting-Robertson(P-R) effect on Lyapunov stability of equilibrium
points is being discussed in the the generalized photogravitational Chermnykh's
problem when bigger primary is a sours of radiation and smaller primary is an
oblate spheriod. We derived the equations of motion, obtained the equilibrium
points and examined the linear stability of the equilibrium points for various
values of parameter which have been used in the present problem. We have
examined the effect of gravitational potential from the belt. The positions of
the equilibrium points are different from the position in classical case. We
have seen that due to the P-R effect all the equilibrium points are unstable in
Lyapunov sense.
