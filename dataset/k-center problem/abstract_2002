One possible escape from the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem is computational
complexity. For example, it is NP-hard to compute if the STV rule can be
manipulated. However, there is increasing concern that such results may not re
ect the difficulty of manipulation in practice. In this tutorial, I survey
recent results in this area.
