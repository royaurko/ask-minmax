We study the Fourier--Mukai numbers of rational elliptic surfaces. As its
application, we give an example of a pair of minimal 3-folds with Kodaira
dimensions 1, $h^1(\mc O)=h^2(\mc O)=0$ such that they are mutually derived
equivalent, deformation equivalent, but not birationally equivalent. It also
supplies a counterexample of the birational Torelli problem.
