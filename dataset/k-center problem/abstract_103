The problem of explaining the acceleration of the expansion of the universe
and the observational and theoretical difficulties associated with dark matter
and dark energy are discussed. The possibility that GR does not correctly
describe the large-scale structure of the universe is considered and an
alternative gravity theory is proposed as a possible resolution to the
problems.
