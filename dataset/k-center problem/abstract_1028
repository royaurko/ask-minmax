The question whether a set of formulae G implies a formula f is fundamental.
The present paper studies the complexity of the above implication problem for
propositional formulae that are built from a systematically restricted set of
Boolean connectives. We give a complete complexity classification for all sets
of Boolean functions in the meaning of Post's lattice and show that the
implication problem is efficentily solvable only if the connectives are
definable using the constants {false,true} and only one of {and,or,xor}. The
problem remains coNP-complete in all other cases. We also consider the
restriction of G to singletons.
