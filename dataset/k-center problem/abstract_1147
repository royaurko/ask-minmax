We consider a regular indefinite Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem \{$-f" +
q f = \lambda r f$} on $[a,b]$ subject to general self-adjoint boundary
conditions and with a weight function $r$ which changes its sign at finitely
many, so-called turning points. We give sufficient and in some cases necessary
and sufficient conditions for the Riesz basis property of this eigenvalue
problem. In the case of separated boundary conditions we extend the class of
weight functions $r$ for which the Riesz basis property can be completely
characterized in terms of the local behavior of $r$ in a neighborhood of the
turning points. We identify a class of non-separated boundary conditions for
which, in addition to the local behavior of $r$ in a neighborhood of the
turning points, local conditions on $r$ near the boundary are needed for the
Riesz basis property. As an application, it is shown that the Riesz basis
property for the periodic boundary conditions is closely related to a regular
HELP-type inequality without boundary conditions.
