In Bayesian theory, calculating a posterior probability distribution is
highly important but usually difficult. Therefore, some methods have been put
forward to deal with such problem, among which, the most popular one is the
asymptotic expansions for posterior distributions. In this paper, we propose an
alternative method, named random weighting method, for scaled posterior
distributions, and give an ideal convergence speed, which serves as the
theoretical guarantee for methods of numerical simulations.
