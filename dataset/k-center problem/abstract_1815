This note is surveying certain aspects (including recent results) of the
following problem stated by F.Raymond and R.Schultz: ''It is generally felt
that a manifold 'chosen at random' will have little symmetry. Can this
intuitive notion be made more precise? Does there exist a closed simply
connected manifold, on which no finite group acts effectively? (A weaker
question, no involution?)''
