We propose a geometrical approach to the investigation of Hamiltonian systems
on (Pseudo) Riemannian manifolds. A new geometrical criterion of instability
and chaos is proposed. This approach is more generic than well known reduction
to the geodesic flow. It is applicable to various astrophysical and
cosmological problems.
