We consider the two body problem with central interaction on two point
homogeneous spaces from point of view of the invariant differential operators
theory. The representation of the two particle Hamiltonian in terms of the
radial differential operator and invariant operators on the symmetry group is
found. The connection of different mass center definitions for these spaces to
the obtained expression for Hamiltonian operator is studied.
