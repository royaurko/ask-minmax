A classification theorem for linear differential equations in two variables
(one real and one Grassmann) having polynomial solutions(the generalized
Bochner problem) is given. The main result is based on the consideration of the
eigenvalue problem for a polynomial element of the universal enveloping algebra
of the algebra $osp(2,2)$ in the "projectivized" representation (in
differential operators of the first order) possessing an invariant subspace. A
classification of 2 x 2 matrix differential equations in one real variable
possessing polynomial solutions is described. Connection to the
recently-discovered quasi-exactly-solvable problems is discussed.
