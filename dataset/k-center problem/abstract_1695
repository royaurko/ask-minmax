The measured masses of the three charge states of the charmed $\Sigma_c$
baryon are found to be in disagreement with a sum rule based on the quark
model, but relying on no detailed assumptions about the form of the
interaction. This poses a significant problem for the charmed baryon sector of
the quark model. Other relations among charmed baryon masses are also
discussed.
