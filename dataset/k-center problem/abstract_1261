Fluctuations of electric and magnetic fields in the collisionless plasma are
found as a solution of the initial value linearized problem. The plasma initial
state is on average stationary and homogeneous. When the state is stable, the
initial fluctuations decay exponentially and in the long time limit a
stationary spectrum of fluctuations is established. For the equilibrium plasma
it reproduces the spectrum obtained from the fluctuation-dissipation relation.
Fluctuations in the unstable two-stream system are also discussed.
