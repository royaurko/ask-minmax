There is the scale problem in the Randall-Sundrum models. Regarding this, I
review the works done with B. S. Kyae and H. M. Lee. In a supersymmetric
generalization in the RSI model, we discuss that the $\mu$ parameter can be
obtained by an intermediate scale brane. In addition, we also discuss the
cosmological constant problem with a self-tuning solution in the RSII model.
