In this paper we consider a model for short term dynamics of dunes in tidal
area. We construct a Two-Scale Numerical Method based on the fact that the
solution of the equation which has oscillations Two-Scale converges to the
solution of a well-posed problem. This numerical method uses on Fourier series.
