We give a new explicit construction of $n\times N$ matrices satisfying the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Namely, for some c>0, large N and any n
satisfying N^{1-c} < n < N, we construct RIP matrices of order k^{1/2+c}. This
overcomes the natural barrier k=O(n^{1/2}) for proofs based on small coherence,
which are used in all previous explicit constructions of RIP matrices. Key
ingredients in our proof are new estimates for sumsets in product sets and for
exponential sums with the products of sets possessing special additive
structure. We also give a construction of sets of n complex numbers whose k-th
moments are uniformly small for 1\le k\le N (Turan's power sum problem), which
improves upon known explicit constructions when (\log N)^{1+o(1)} \le n\le
(\log N)^{4+o(1)}. This latter construction produces elementary explicit
examples of n by N matrices that satisfy RIP and whose columns constitute a new
spherical code; for those problems the parameters closely match those of
existing constructions in the range (\log N)^{1+o(1)} \le n\le (\log
N)^{5/2+o(1)}.
