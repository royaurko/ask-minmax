We will pursue a way of building up an algebraic structure that involves, in
a mathematical abstract way, the well known Grassmann variables. The problem
arises when we tried to understand the grassmannian polynomial expansion on the
scope of ring theory. The formalization of this kind of variables and its
properties will help us to have a better idea of some algebraic structures and
the way they are implemented in models concerning theoretical physics.
