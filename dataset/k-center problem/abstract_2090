We show that if $k$ is a countable field, then there exists a finitely
generated, infinite-dimensional, primitive algebraic $k$-algebra $A$ whose
Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is at most six. In addition to this we construct a
two-generated primitive algebraic $k$-algebra. We also pose many open problems.
