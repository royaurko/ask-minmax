In this paper, we consider the adaptive Eulerian--Lagrangian method (ELM) for
linear convection-diffusion problems. Unlike the classical a posteriori error
estimations, we estimate the temporal error along the characteristics and
derive a new a posteriori error bound for ELM semi-discretization. With the
help of this proposed error bound, we are able to show the optimal convergence
rate of ELM for solutions with minimal regularity. Furthermore, by combining
this error bound with a standard residual-type estimator for the spatial error,
we obtain a posteriori error estimators for a fully discrete scheme. We present
numerical tests to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our adaptive
algorithm.
