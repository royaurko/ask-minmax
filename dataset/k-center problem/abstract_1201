The problem of forced convection along an isothermal, constantly moving plate
is a classical problem of fluid mechanics that has been solved for the first
time in 1961 by Sakiadis (1961). Thereafter, many solutions have been obtained
for different aspects of this class of boundary layer problems. Solutions have
been appeared including mass transfer, varying plate velocity, varying plate
temperature, fluid injection and fluid suction at the plate. The work by
Hassanien (1997) belongs to the above class of problems, including a linearly
varying velocity and the variation of fluid viscosity with temperature. The
contributor obtained similarity solutions considering that viscosity varies as an
inverse function of temperature. However, the Prandtl number, which is a
function of viscosity, has been considered constant across the boundary layer.
It has been already confirmed in the literature that the assumption of constant
Prandtl number leads to unrealistic results (Pantokratoras, 2004, 2005). The
objective of the present paper is to obtain results considering both viscosity
and Prandtl number variable across the boundary layer. The differences of the
two methods are very large in some cases.
