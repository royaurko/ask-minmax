This book has four chapters. Chapter one is introductory in nature, for it
recalls some basic definitions essential to make the book a self-contained one.
Chapter two, introduces for the first time the new notion of neutrosophic rings
and some special neutrosophic rings like neutrosophic ring of matrix and
neutrosophic polynomial rings. Chapter three gives some new classes of
neutrosophic rings like group neutrosophic rings,neutrosophic group
neutrosophic rings, semigroup neutrosophic rings, S-semigroup neutrosophic
rings which can be realized as a type of extension of group rings or
generalization of group rings. Study of these structures will throw light on
the research on the algebraic structure of group rings. Chapter four is
entirely devoted to the problems on this new topic, which is an added
attraction to researchers. A salient feature of this book is that it gives 246
problems in Chapter four. Some of the problems are direct and simple, some
little difficult and some can be taken up as a research problem.
