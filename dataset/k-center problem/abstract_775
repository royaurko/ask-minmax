Generalized solutions of the Cauchy problem for the one-dimensional periodic
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, with certain nonlinearities, are not unique.
For any $s<0$ there exist nonzero generalized solutions varying continuously in
the Sobolev space $H^s$, with identically vanishing initial data.
