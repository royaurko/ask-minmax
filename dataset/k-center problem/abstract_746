In this paper we study the Fokker-Plank equation arising in a model which
describes the charge and discharge process of ion-lithium batteries. In
particular we focus our attention on slow reaction regimes with non-negligible
entropic effects, which triggers the mass-splitting transition. At first we
prove that the problem is globally well-posed. After that we prove a stability
result under some hypothesis of improved regularity and a uniqueness result for
the stability under some additional condition of
