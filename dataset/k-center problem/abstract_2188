A degenerate nonlinear nonlocal evolution equation is considered; it can be
understood as a porous medium equation whose pressure law is nonlinear and
nonlocal. We show the existence of sign changing weak solutions to the
corresponding Cauchy problem. Moreover, we construct explicit compactly
supported self-similar solutions which generalize Barenblatt profiles --- the
well-known solutions of the classical porous medium equation.
