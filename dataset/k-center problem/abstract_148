We study some measure partition problems: Cut the same positive fraction of
$d+1$ measures in $\mathbb R^d$ with a hyperplane or find a convex subset of
$\mathbb R^d$ on which $d+1$ given measures have the same prescribed value. For
both problems positive answers are given under some additional assumptions.
