It has previously been an open problem whether all Boolean submodular
functions can be decomposed into a sum of binary submodular functions over a
possibly larger set of variables. This problem has been considered within
several different contexts in computer science, including computer vision,
artificial intelligence, and pseudo-Boolean optimisation. Using a connection
between the expressive power of valued constraints and certain algebraic
properties of functions, we answer this question negatively.
  Our results have several corollaries. First, we characterise precisely which
submodular functions of arity 4 can be expressed by binary submodular
functions. Next, we identify a novel class of submodular functions of arbitrary
arities which can be expressed by binary submodular functions, and therefore
minimised efficiently using a so-called expressibility reduction to the Min-Cut
problem. More importantly, our results imply limitations on this kind of
reduction and establish for the first time that it cannot be used in general to
minimise arbitrary submodular functions. Finally, we refute a conjecture of
Promislow and Young on the structure of the extreme rays of the cone of Boolean
submodular functions.
