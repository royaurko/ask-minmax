A novel class of self-dual solutions in $\sigma$ models and gauge theories is
considered. The contribution of the corresponding fluctuations to the chiral
condensate is calculated. We discuss the few tightly connected problems, such
as the $U(1)$ problem, the $\theta$ dependence and the chiral symmetry breaking
within a framework of this approach. Arguments in favour of significance of the
configurations with fractional topological charge are given.
