Frequent pattern (itemset) mining in transactional databases is one of the
most well-studied problems in data mining. One obstacle that limits the
practical usage of frequent pattern mining is the extremely large number of
patterns generated. Such a large size of the output collection makes it
difficult for users to understand and use in practice. Even restricting the
output to the border of the frequent itemset collection does not help much in
alleviating the problem. In this paper we address the issue of overwhelmingly
large output size by introducing and studying the following problem: mining
top-k approximate frequent patterns. The union of the power sets of these k
sets should satisfy the following conditions: (1) including itemsets with
larger support as many as possible and (2) including itemsets with smaller
support as less as possible. An integrated objective function is designed to
combine these two objectives. Consequently, we derive the upper bounds on
objective function and present an approximate branch-and-bound method for
finding the feasible solution. We give empirical evidence showing that our
formulation and approximation methods work well in practice.
