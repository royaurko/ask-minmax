We prove the nonexistence of smooth stable solution to the biharmonic problem
$\Delta^2 u= u^p$, $u>0$ in $\R^N$ for $1 < p < \infty$ and $N < 2(1 + x_0)$,
where $x_0$ is the largest root of the following equation: $$x^4 -
\frac{32p(p+1)}{(p-1)^2}x^2 + \frac{32p(p+1)(p+3)}{(p-1)^3}x
-\frac{64p(p+1)^2}{(p-1)^4} = 0.$$ In particular, as $x_0 > 5$ when $p > 1$, we
obtain the nonexistence of smooth stable solution for any $N \leq 12$ and $p >
1$. Moreover, we consider also the corresponding problem in the half space
$\R^N_+$, or the elliptic problem $\Delta^2 u= \l(u+1)^p$ on a bounded smooth
domain $\O$ with the Navier boundary conditions. We will prove the regularity
of the extremal solution in lower dimensions. Our results improve the previous
works.
