One of the puzzles of the dark energy problem is the (first) cosmological
coincidence problem, namely, {\em why does our universe begin the accelerated
expansion recently? why are we living in an epoch in which the dark energy
density and the dust matter energy density are comparable?} On the other hand,
cosmological observations hint that the equation-of-state parameter (EoS) of
dark energy crossed the phantom divide $w_{de}=-1$ in the near past. Many dark
energy models whose EoS can cross the phantom divide have been proposed.
However, to our knowledge, these models with crossing the phantom divide only
provide the possibility that $w_{de}$ can cross -1. They do not answer another
question, namely, {\em why crossing the phantom divide occurs recently?} Since
in many existing models whose EoS can cross the phantom divide, $w_{de}$
undulates around -1 randomly, {\em why are we living in an epoch $w_{de}<-1$?}
This can be regarded as the second cosmological coincidence problem. In this
work, the cosmological evolution of the vector-like dark energy interacting
with background perfect fluid is investigated. We find that the first and
second cosmological coincidence problems can be alleviated at the same time in
this scenario.
