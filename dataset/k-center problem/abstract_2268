We prove rigorously the convergence of the Cahn-Larch\'e system, which is a
Cahn-Hilliard system coupled with the system of linearized elasticity, to a
modified Hele-Shaw problem as long as a classical solution of the latter system
exists. By matched asymptotic expansion we construct approximate solutions and
estimate the difference between the true and the approximate solutions.
