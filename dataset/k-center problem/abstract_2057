The multiresponse surface problem is modelled as one of multiobjective
stochastic optimisation, and diverse solutions are proposed. Several crucial
differences are highlighted between this approach and others that have been
proposed. Finally, in a numerical example, some particular solutions are
applied and described in detail.
