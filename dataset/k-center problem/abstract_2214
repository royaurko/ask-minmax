The existence of natural Zero Magnetic (ZM) oscillations of the distributed
electromagnetic oscillating system (Minkowski space-time) is one of logical
consequences of the self-sufficient potential formalism in electromagnetic
theory. A mental experiment confirming the reality of the ZM waves of
electromagnetic potential is proposed. Main characteristics of those waves are
considered. A problem of possibility of application of the ZM waves to
information transmission between spatially distributed objects (i.e., radio
communication) is formulated.
