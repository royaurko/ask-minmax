Efficient implementations of DPLL with the addition of clause learning are
the fastest complete Boolean satisfiability solvers and can handle many
significant real-world problems, such as verification, planning and design.
Despite its importance, little is known of the ultimate strengths and
limitations of the technique. This paper presents the first precise
characterization of clause learning as a proof system (CL), and begins the task
of understanding its power by relating it to the well-studied resolution proof
system. In particular, we show that with a new learning scheme, CL can provide
exponentially shorter proofs than many proper refinements of general resolution
(RES) satisfying a natural property. These include regular and Davis-Putnam
resolution, which are already known to be much stronger than ordinary DPLL. We
also show that a slight variant of CL with unlimited restarts is as powerful as
RES itself. Translating these analytical results to practice, however, presents
a challenge because of the nondeterministic nature of clause learning
algorithms. We propose a novel way of exploiting the underlying problem
structure, in the form of a high level problem description such as a graph or
PDDL specification, to guide clause learning algorithms toward faster
solutions. We show that this leads to exponential speed-ups on grid and
randomized pebbling problems, as well as substantial improvements on certain
ordering formulas.
