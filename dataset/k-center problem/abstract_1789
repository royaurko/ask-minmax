In this paper we study noncommutative plane curves, i.e. non-commutative
k-algebras for which the 1-dimensional simple modules form a plane curve. We
study extensions of simple modules and we try to enlighten the completion
problem, i.e. understanding the connection between simple modules of different
dimension.
