This paper is concerned with the derivation of conforming and non-conforming
functional a posteriori error estimates for elliptic boundary value problems in
exterior domains. These estimates provide computable and guaranteed upper and
lower bounds for the difference between the exact and the approximate solution
of the respective problem. We extend earlier results for conforming
approximations to the non-conforming case, for which the approximate solutions
might not belong to the energy space and are just considered to be square
integrable. Moreover, we present some numerical tests.
