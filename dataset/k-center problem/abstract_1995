We have extended the 't Hooft-Nobbenhuis complex transformations to include
mass. Under these new transformations, Schrodinger, Dirac, Klein-Gordon and
Einstein general relativity equations are invariant. The non invariance of the
cosmological constant in Einstein field equations dictates it to vanish thus
solving the longstanding cosmological constant problem.
