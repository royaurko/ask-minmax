Given a planar graph G and a sequence C_1,...,C_q, where each C_i is a family
of vertex subsets of G, we wish to find a plane embedding of G, if any exists,
such that for each i in {1,...,q}, there is a face F_i in the embedding whose
boundary contains at least one vertex from each set in C_i. This problem has
applications to the recovery of topological information from geographical data
and the design of constrained layouts in VLSI. Let I be the input size, i.e.,
the total number of vertices and edges in G and the families C_i, counting
multiplicity. We show that this problem is NP-complete in general. We also show
that it is solvable in O(I log I) time for the special case where for each
input family C_i, each set in C_i induces a connected subgraph of the input
graph G. Note that the classical problem of simply finding a planar embedding
is a further special case of this case with q=0. Therefore, the processing of
the additional constraints C_1,...,C_q only incurs a logarithmic factor of
overhead.
