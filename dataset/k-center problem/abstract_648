In this paper, we consider the problem of determining in polynomial time
whether a given planar point set $P$ of $n$ points admits 4-connected
triangulation. We propose a necessary and sufficient condition for recognizing
$P$, and present an $O(n^3)$ algorithm of constructing a 4-connected
triangulation of $P$. Thus, our algorithm solves a longstanding open problem in
computational geometry and geometric graph theory. We also provide a simple
method for constructing a noncomplex triangulation of $P$ which requires
$O(n^2)$ steps. This method provides a new insight to the structure of
4-connected triangulation of point sets.
