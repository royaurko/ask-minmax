We discuss the problems of incompleteness and inexpressibility. We introduce
almost self-referential formulas, use them to extend set theory, and relate
their expressive power to that of infinitary logic. We discuss the nature of
proper classes. Finally, we introduce and axiomatize a powerful extension to
set theory.
