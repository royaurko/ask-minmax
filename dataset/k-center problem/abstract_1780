In this note we introduce the concept of a quasi-finite complex. Next, we
show that for a given countable and locally finite CW complex L the following
conditions are equivalent:
  (i) L is quasi-finite. (ii) There exists a [L]-invertible mapping of a
metrizable compactum X with e-dim X = [L] onto the Hilbert cube.
  Finally, we construct an example of a quasi-finite complex L such that its
extension type [L] does not contain a finitely dominated complex.
