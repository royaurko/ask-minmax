We study computational problems arising from the iterated removal of weakly
dominated actions in anonymous games. Our main result shows that it is
NP-complete to decide whether an anonymous game with three actions can be
solved via iterated weak dominance. The two-action case can be reformulated as
a natural elimination problem on a matrix, the complexity of which turns out to
be surprisingly difficult to characterize and ultimately remains open. We
however establish connections to a matching problem along paths in a directed
graph, which is computationally hard in general but can also be used to
identify tractable cases of matrix elimination. We finally identify different
classes of anonymous games where iterated dominance is in P and NP-complete,
respectively.
