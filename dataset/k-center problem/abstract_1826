We provide an expository account of Guoliang Yu's property A. The piece
starts from the basic definitions, and goes on to discuss closure properties of
the class of property A spaces (and groups) and the relationship of property A
to coarse embeddability problems, operator theory, and amenability. It finishes
with some examples of non-property A spaces. We also include an annotated
bibliography covering much of the related literature.
