In this paper, we consider first order Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations posed
on a ``junction'', that is to say the union of a finite number of half-lines
with a unique common point. For this continuous HJ problem, we propose a finite
difference scheme and prove two main results. As a first result, we show bounds
on the discrete gradient and time derivative of the numerical solution. Our
second result is the convergence (for a subsequence) of the numerical solution
towards a viscosity solution of the continuous HJ problem, as the mesh size
goes to zero. When the solution of the continuous HJ problem is unique, we
recover the full convergence of the numerical solution. We apply this scheme to
compute the densities of cars for a traffic model. We recover the well-known
Godunov scheme outside the junction point and we give a numerical illustration.
