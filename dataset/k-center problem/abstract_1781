Motivated by the remarkable interplay between (chordal) graphs and matrix
algebra, we associate to each graph a so-called completion number that might
encode some aspects of that interplay. We show that this number is not trivial,
and we ask for a graph theoretic characterization of those graphs with a given
completion number.
