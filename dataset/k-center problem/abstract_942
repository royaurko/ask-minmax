Correlating the data measured by tunneling and photoemission spectroscopies
is a long-standing problem in condensed matter physics. The quasiparticle
interference, recently discovered in high-Tc cuprates, reveals a possibility to
solve this problem. Application of modern phase retrieval algorithms to Fourier
transformed tunneling data allows to recover the distribution of the
quasiparticle spectral weight in the reciprocal space of solids measured
directly by photoemission. This opens a direct way to unify these two powerful
techniques and may help to solve a number of problems related with space/time
inhomogeneities predicted in strongly correlated electron systems.
