In this paper, we consider the problem of the estimation of a Weibull
tail-coefficient. In particular, we propose a regression model, from which we
derive a bias-reduced estimator. This estimator is based on a least-squares
approach. The asymptotic normality of this estimator is also established. A
small simulation study is provided in order to prove its efficiency.
