Nontrivial pairs of zero-divisors in group rings are introduced and
discussed. A problem on the existence of nontrivial pairs of zero-divisors in
group rings of free Burnside groups of odd exponent $n \gg 1$ is solved in the
affirmative. Nontrivial pairs of zero-divisors are also found in group rings of
free products of groups with torsion.
