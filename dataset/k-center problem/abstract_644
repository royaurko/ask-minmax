The paper considers the problem of implementation on graphics processors of
numerical integration routines for higher order finite element approximations.
The design of suitable GPU kernels is investigated in the context of general
purpose integration procedures, as well as particular example applications. The
most important characteristic of the problem investigated is the large
variation of required processor and memory resources associated with different
degrees of approximating polynomials. The questions that we try to answer are
whether it is possible to design a single integration kernel for different GPUs
and different orders of approximation and what performance can be expected in
such a case.
