We consider the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear Schroedinger eqiation with
initial data close to a sum of N decoupled solitons. Under some suitable
assumptions on the spectral structure of the one soliton linearizations we
prove that for large time the asymptotics of the solution is given by a sum of
solitons with slightly modified parameters and a small dispersive term.
