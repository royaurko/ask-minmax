The problem of first order phase transitions in nanoscopic systems is
investigated in the framework of Hill's nanothermodynamics. We obtain the
equilibrium conditions and a generalized version of the Clapeyron-Clausius
equation for a nanoscopic system which contains two phases. Our study is
exemplified for the case when one of the phases consists of an ideal gas.
