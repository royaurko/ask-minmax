Discrete Dirac type self-adjoint system is equivalent to the block Szeg\"o
recurrence. Representation of the fundamental solution is obtained, inverse
problems on the interval and semi-axis are solved. A Borg-Marchenko type result
is obtained too. Connections with the block Toeplitz matrices are treated.
