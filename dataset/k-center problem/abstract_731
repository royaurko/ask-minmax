In this paper we provide sufficient conditions that ensure the existence of
the solution of some vector equilibrium problems in Hausdorff topological
vector spaces ordered by a cone. The conditions that we consider are imposed
not on the whole domain of the operators involved, but rather on a self
segment-dense subset of it, a special type of dense subset. We apply the
results obtained to vector optimization and vector variational inequalities.
