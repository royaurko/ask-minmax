Geometric methods proposed by Stallings for treating finitely generated
subgroups of free groups were successfully used by many contributors to solve a wide
collection of decision problems for free groups and their subgroups.
  In the present paper we employ our generalized Stallings' folding method to
introduce a procedure, which given a subgroup H of a free product of finite
groups reads off its Kurosh decomposition from the subgroup graph of H.
