A new exponentially convergent algorithm is proposed for an abstract the
first order differential equation with unbounded operator coefficient
possessing a variable domain. The algorithm is based on a generalization of the
Duhamel integral for vector-valued functions. This technique translates the
initial problem to a system of integral equations. Then the system is
approximated with exponential accuracy. The theoretical results are illustrated
by examples associated with the heat transfer boundary value problems.
