I summarize a part of the work done with Bamert, Burgess, London and Nardi
(hep-ph/9602438) in which we find simplified expressions for the possible
one-loop contributions to the $R_b$ parameter from new virtual particles,
including supersymmetric ones. Our expressions make it easier to identify
which models and choices of parameters are best able to solve the $R_b$
problem.
