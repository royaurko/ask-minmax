A well-known cancellation problem asks when, for two algebraic varieties
$V_1, V_2 \subseteq {\bf C}^n$, the isomorphism of the cylinders $V_1 \times
{\bf C}$ and $V_2 \times {\bf C}$ implies the isomorphism of $V_1$ and $V_2$.
  In this paper, we address a related problem: when the equivalence (under an
automorphism of ${\bf C}^{n+1}$) of two cylinders $V_1 \times {\bf C}$ and $V_2
\times {\bf C}$ implies the equivalence of their bases $V_1$ and $V_2$ under an
automorphism of ${\bf C}^n$? We concentrate here on hypersurfaces and show that
this problem establishes a strong connection between the Cancellation
conjecture of Zariski and the Embedding conjecture of Abhyankar and Sathaye. We
settle the problem for a large class of polynomials. On the other hand, we give
examples of equivalent cylinders with inequivalent bases (those cylinders,
however, are not hypersurfaces).
  Another result of interest is that, for an arbitrary field $K$, the
equivalence of two polynomials in $m$ variables under an automorphism of
$K[x_1,..., x_n], n \ge m,$ implies their equivalence under a tame automorphism
of $K[x_1,..., x_{2n}]$.
