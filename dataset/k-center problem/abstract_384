We give a survey concerning both very classical and recent results on the
electrostatic interpretation of the zeros of some well-known families of
polynomials, and the interplay between these models and the asymptotic
distribution of their zeros when the degree of the polynomials tends to
infinity. The leading role is played by the differential equation satisfied by
these polynomials. Some new developments, applications and open problems are
presented.
