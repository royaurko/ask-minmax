Standard mathematics involves such notions as infinitely small/large,
continuity and standard division. This mathematics is usually treated as
fundamental while finite mathematics is treated as inferior. Standard
mathematics has foundational problems (as follows, for example, from
G\"{o}del's incompleteness theorems) but it is usually believed that this is
less important than the fact that it describes many experimental data with high
accuracy. We argue that the situation is the opposite: standard mathematics is
only a degenerate case of finite one in the formal limit when the
characteristic of the ring or field used in finite mathematics goes to
infinity. Therefore foundational problems in standard mathematics are not
fundamental.
