We reconsidered leptogenesis scenario from right-handed (s)neutrino produced
by the decay of inflaton. Besides the well-investigated case that the neutrino
decays instantaneously after the production, leptogenesis is possible if
neutrino decays after it dominates the universe. In the latter case,
right-handed (s)neutrino can decay either while it is relativistic or after it
becomes non-relativistic. Especially, the first case has not been discussed
seriously in literatures. Resultant lepton asymmetry and constraints from the
gravitino problem are studied in broad parameter region, including all cases of
this scenario. It is also shown how this leptogenesis scenario depends on the
parameters, the inflaton decay rate (the reheating temperature), the
right-handed neutrino mass, the washout parameter, and the constraint from the
gravitino problem. Leptogenesis from relativistic neutrino decay is interesting
because both thermal and non-thermal gravitino problems can be relaxed.
