In this paper we solve one open problem from \cite{pat} and give some
generalizations. Namely, we prove that the first homology group of positive
braid knot is trivial. Also, we show that the same is true for the
Khovanov-Rozansky homology \cite{kovroz} ($sl(n)$ link homology) for any
positive integer $n$.
