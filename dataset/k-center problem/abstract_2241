We prove that for every JBW$^*$-triple $E$ of rank $>1$, the symmetric part
of its predual reduces to zero. Consequently, the predual of every infinite
dimensional von Neumann algebra $A$ satisfies the linear biholomorphic
property, that is, the symmetric part of $A_*$ is zero. This solves a problem
posed by M. Neal and B. Russo in [Mathematica Scandinavica, to appear]
