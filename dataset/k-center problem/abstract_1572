Use of the stochastic Galerkin finite element methods leads to large systems
of linear equations obtained by the discretization of tensor product solution
spaces along their spatial and stochastic dimensions. These systems are
typically solved iteratively by a Krylov subspace method. We propose a
preconditioner which takes an advantage of the recursive hierarchy in the
structure of the global matrices. In particular, the matrices posses a
recursive hierarchical two-by-two structure, with one of the submatrices block
diagonal. Each one of the diagonal blocks in this submatrix is closely related
to the deterministic mean-value problem, and the action of its inverse is in
the implementation approximated by inner loops of Krylov iterations. Thus our
hierarchical Schur complement preconditioner combines, on each level in the
approximation of the hierarchical structure of the global matrix, the idea of
Schur complement with loops for a number of mutually independent inner Krylov
iterations, and several matrix-vector multiplications for the off-diagonal
blocks. Neither the global matrix, nor the matrix of the preconditioner need to
be formed explicitly. The ingredients include only the number of stiffness
matrices from the truncated Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion and a good
preconditioned for the mean-value deterministic problem. We provide a condition
number bound for a model elliptic problem and the performance of the method is
illustrated by numerical experiments.
