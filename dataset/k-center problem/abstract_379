We investigate singular and degenerate behavior of solutions of the unstable
free boundary problem $$\Delta u = -\chi_{\{u>0\}} .$$ First, we construct a
solution that is not of class $C^{1,1}$ and whose free boundary consists of
four arcs meeting in a {\em cross}-shaped singularity. This solution is
completely unstable/repulsive from above and below which would make it hard to
get by the usual methods, and even numerics is non-trivial. We also show
existence of a degenerate solution. This answers two of the open questions in a
recent paper by R. Monneau-G.S. Weiss.
