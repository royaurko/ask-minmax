We characterize the set of planar locally finite Cayley graphs, and give a
finite representation of these graphs by a special kind of finite state
automata called labeling schemes. As a result, we are able to enumerate and
describe all planar locally finite Cayley graphs of a given degree. This
analysis allows us to solve the problem of decision of the locally finite
planarity for a word-problem-decidable presentation.
