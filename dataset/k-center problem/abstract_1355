We examine one overlooked in previous investigations aspect of well - known
Landau - Zener (LZ) problem, namely, the behavior in the intermediate, i.e.
close to a crossing point, energy region, when all four LZ states are coupled
and should be taken into account. We calculate the 4 x 4 connection matrix in
this intermediate energy region, possessing the same block structure as the
known connection matrices for the tunneling and in the over-barrier regions of
the energy, and continously matching those in the corresponding energy regions.
