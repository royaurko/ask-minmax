Algebraic geometry for groups and Lie algebraic has been recently defined and
studied by many contributors on the purpose to study set defined by algebraic
equations on abstract groups and Lie algebras. The purpose of this paper is to
present a free coordinates approach of this problem. This must be related to
the theory of schemes in classical algebraic geometry, and provide a geomotric
framework to study finite groups
