In this paper, we present a new algorithm and an experimental implementation
for factoring elements in the polynomial n'th Weyl algebra, the polynomial n'th
shift algebra, and ZZ^n-graded polynomials in the n'th q-Weyl algebra.
  The most unexpected result is that this noncommutative problem of factoring
partial differential operators can be approached effectively by reducing it to
the problem of solving systems of polynomial equations over a commutative ring.
In the case where a given polynomial is ZZ^n-graded, we can reduce the problem
completely to factoring an element in a commutative multivariate polynomial
ring.
  The implementation in Singular is effective on a broad range of polynomials
and increases the ability of computer algebra systems to address this important
problem. We compare the performance and output of our algorithm with other
implementations in commodity computer algebra systems on nontrivial examples.
