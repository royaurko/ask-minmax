We establish vortex dynamics for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation
for asymptotically large numbers of vortices for the problem without a gauge
field and either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. As our main tool, we
establish quantitative bounds on several fundamental quantities, including the
kinetic energy, that lead to explicit convergence rates. For dilute vortex
liquids we prove that sequences of solutions converge to the hydrodynamic
limit.
