We consider the problem of finding the gravitational radiation output, or
news, within the context of a numerical simulation of a spacetime by means of
the null-cone, or characteristic, approach to numerical relativity. We develop
a method for computing the news that uses an explicit coordinate transformation
to a coordinate system that satisfies the Bondi conditions. The method has been
implemented computationally. We present results of applying the method to
certain test problems, demonstrating second order convergence of the news to
the analytic value.
