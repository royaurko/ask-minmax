We examine robustness of exponential dichotomies of boundary value problems
for general linear first-order one-dimensional hyperbolic systems. The boundary
conditions are supposed to be of types ensuring smoothing solutions in finite
time, which includes reflection boundary conditions. We show that the dichotomy
survives in the space of continuous functions under small perturbations of all
coefficients in the differential equations.
