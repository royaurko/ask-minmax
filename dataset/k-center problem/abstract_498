Anomalously small gaugino masses are a common feature of various models of
direct gauge mediation. This problem is closely related to the vacuum structure
of the theory. In this paper we show that massive SQCD can have SUSY-breaking
vacua which are qualitatively different from the ISS vacuum. These novel vacua
are metastable with respect to decay to the ISS vacuum. We demonstrate the
possibility of addressing the gaugino mass problem in this framework. We study
the properties of these vacua and construct an example of a model of direct
gauge mediation.
