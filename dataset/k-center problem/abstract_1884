We show that the Drinfeld-Sokolov system of equations has a nontrivial
prolongation structure. The closure process for prolongation algebra gives rise
to the sl(4,c) algebra which is used to derive the scattering problem for the
system of equations under consideration. The nontrivial new Backlund
transformations and some explicit solutions are given.
