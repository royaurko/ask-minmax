The Canonical Function Method (CFM) is a powerful accurate and fast method
that solves the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the eigenvalues directly without
having to evaluate the eigenfunctions. Its versatility allows to solve several
types of problems and in this work it is applied to the solution of several 1D
potential problems, the 3D Hydrogen atom and the Morse potential.
