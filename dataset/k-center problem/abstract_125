We give a direct elementary proof of the existence of traces for arbitrary
star products on a symplectic manifold. We follow the approach we used in
\cite{refs:GuttRaw}, solving first the local problem. A normalisation
introduced by Karabegov \cite{refs:Karabegov} makes the local solutions unique
and allows them to be pieced together to solve the global problem.
