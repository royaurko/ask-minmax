We obtain the basic analytic properties, i.e. meromorphic continuation, polar
structure and bounds for the order of growth, of all the nonlinear twists with
exponents $\leq 1/d$ of the L-functions of any degree $d \geq 1$ in the
extended Selberg class. In particular, this solves the resonance problem in all
such cases.
