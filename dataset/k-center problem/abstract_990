Protein structure prediction can be shown to be an NP-hard problem; the
number of conformations grows exponentially with the number of residues. The
native conformations of proteins occupy a very small subset of these, hence an
exploratory, robust search algorithm, such as a genetic algorithm (GA), is
required. The dynamics of GAs tend to be complicated and problem-specific.
However, their empirical success warrants their further study. In this paper,
guidelines for the design of genetic algorithms for protein structure
prediction are determined. To accomplish this, the performance of the simplest
genetic algorithm is investigated for simple lattice-based protein structure
prediction models (which is extendible to real-space), using energy
minimization. The study has led us to two important conclusions for
`protein-structure-prediction-genetic-algorithms'. Firstly, they require high
resolution building blocks attainable by multi-point crossovers and secondly
they require a local dynamics operator to `fine tune' good conformations.
Furthermore, we introduce a statistical mechanical approach to analyse the
genetic algorithm dynamics and suggest a convergence criterion using a quantity
analogous to the free energy of population.
