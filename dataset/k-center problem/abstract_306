Recent x-ray and radio data from radio sources in galaxy clusters are used to
show that the pdV work required to inflate the radio lobes exceeds all other
energy estimates deduced from the radio emission. If the required jet energy
density has an isotropic pressure, then in almost all cases the jet cannot be
confined by an external medium. This problem can be resolved with jets
dominated by cold protons, but even here the accompanying energy density in
relativistic electons can cause decollimation. Electron-positron jets cannot
solve this problem unless they are highly beamed with unusual energy
distributions. Poynting flux jets may be a viable alternative.
