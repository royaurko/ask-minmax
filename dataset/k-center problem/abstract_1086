This paper proposes a method for construction of approximate feasible primal
solutions from dual ones for large-scale optimization problems possessing
certain separability properties. Whereas infeasible primal estimates can
typically be produced from (sub-)gradients of the dual function, it is often
not easy to project them to the primal feasible set, since the projection
itself has a complexity comparable to the complexity of the initial problem. We
propose an alternative efficient method to obtain feasibility and show that its
properties influencing the convergence to the optimum are similar to the
properties of the Euclidean projection. We apply our method to the local
polytope relaxation of inference problems for Markov Random Fields and
demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.
