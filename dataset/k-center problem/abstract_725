In this survey, we report on the state of the art of some of the fundamental
problems in the Lie theory of Lie groups modeled on locally convex spaces, such
as integrability of Lie algebras, integrability of Lie subalgebras to Lie
subgroups, and integrability of Lie algebra extensions to Lie group extensions.
We further describe how regularity or local exponentiality of a Lie group can
be used to obtain quite satisfying answers to some of the fundamental problems.
These results are illustrated by specialization to some specific classes of Lie
groups, such as direct limit groups, linear Lie groups, groups of smooth maps
and groups of diffeomorphisms.
