In this paper, we consider a supersymmetric AKNS spectral problem. Two
elementary and a binary Darboux transformations are constructed. By means of
reductions, Darboux and B\"acklund transformations are given for the
supersymmetric modified Korteweg-de Vries, sinh-Gordon and nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equations. These Darboux and B\"acklund transformations are
adopted for the constructions of integrable discrete super systems, and both
semi-discrete and fully discrete systems are presented. Also, the continuum
limits of the relevant discrete systems are worked out.
