We use asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations to study peak-type
singular solutions of the supercritical biharmonic NLS. These solutions have a
quartic-root blowup rate, and collapse with a quasi self-similar universal
profile, which is a zero-Hamiltonian solution of a fourth-order nonlinear
eigenvalue problem.
