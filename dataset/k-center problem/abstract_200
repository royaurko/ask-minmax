Generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS groups) are groups that act on trees
with infinite cyclic edge and vertex stabilizers. Such an action is described
by a labeled graph (essentially, the quotient graph of groups). This paper
addresses the problem of determining whether two given labeled graphs define
isomorphic groups; this is the isomorphism problem for GBS groups. There are
two main results and some applications. First, we find necessary and sufficient
conditions for a GBS group to be represented by only finitely many reduced
labeled graphs. These conditions can be checked effectively from any labeled
graph. Then we show that the isomorphism problem is solvable for GBS groups
whose labeled graphs have first Betti number at most one.
