We solve and characterize the Lagrange multipliers of a reaction-diffusion
system in the Gibbs simplex of R^{N+1} by considering strong solutions of a
system of parabolic variational inequalities in R^N. Exploring properties of
the two obstacles evolution problem, we obtain and approximate a N-system
involving the characteristic functions of the saturated and/or degenerated
phases in the nonlinear reaction terms. We also show continuous dependence
results and we establish sufficient conditions of non-degeneracy for the
stability of those phase subregions.
