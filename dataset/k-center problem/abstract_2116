In this paper we discuss the isolation problem of the Agaian matrix among the
6-dimensional matrices. In general a matrix isolation could depend on the kind
of equivalence one uses for complex Hadamard matrices. However the present form
of Agaian matrix has such a big symmetry that both equivalence methods lead to
the same result: the matrix is isolated.
