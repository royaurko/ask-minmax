We study the problem of constructing an optical surface separating two
homogeneous, isotropic media, one of which has a negative refractive index. In
doing so, we develop a vector form of Snell's law, which is used to study
surfaces possessing a certain uniform refraction property, both in the near and
far field cases. In the near field problem, unlike the case when both materials
have positive refractive index, we show that the resulting surfaces can be
neither convex nor concave.
