The three active light neutrinos are used to explain the neutrino
oscillations. The inherently bi-large mixing neutrino mass matrix and the
Fritzsch type, bi-small mixing charged lepton mass matrix are assumed. By
requiring the maximal \nu_\mu-\nu_\tau mixing for the atmospheric neutrino
problem and the mass-squared difference approperiate for the almost maximal
mixing solution to the solar neutrino problem, the following quantities are
predicted: the \nu_e-\nu_\mu mixing, V_{e3}, CP violation in neutrino
oscillations, and the effective electron-neutrino mass relevant to neutrinoless
double beta decays.
