In this paper we extend the multiscale analysis to elliptic problems on
complex domains, e.g. domains with cracks or complicated boundary. We construct
corrected coarse test and trail spaces which takes the fine scale features of
the domain into account. The corrections only needs to be computed in regions
effected by the fine scale geometrical information of the domain. We achieve
linear convergence rate in energy norm for the multiscale solution. Moreover,
the conditioning of the multiscale method is not affected by how the domain
boundary cuts the coarse elements in the background mesh. The analytical
findings are verified in a series of numerical experiments.
