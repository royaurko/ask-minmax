We consider the thesis that an arithmetical relation, which holds for any,
given, assignment of natural numbers to its free variables, is Turing-decidable
if, and only if, it is the standard representation of a PA-provable formula. We
show that, classically, such a thesis is, both, unverifiable and irrefutable,
and, that it implies the Turing Thesis is false; that Goedel's arithmetical
predicate R(x), treated as a Boolean function, is in the complexity class NP,
but not in P; and that the Halting problem is effectively solvable, albeit not
algorithmically.
