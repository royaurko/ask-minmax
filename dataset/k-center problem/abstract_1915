Recently Dupont proved that the categories of discrete and codiscrete (or
connected) objects in an abelian 2-category are equivalent abelian categories.
He posses also a question whether any abelian category comes in this way. We
will give a rather trivial solution of this problem in the case when a given
abelian category has enough projective or injective objects.
