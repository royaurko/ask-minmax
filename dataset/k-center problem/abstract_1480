We consider the following non-interactive simulation problem: Alice and Bob
observe sequences $X^n$ and $Y^n$ respectively where $\{(X_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$
are drawn i.i.d. from $P(x,y),$ and they output $U$ and $V$ respectively which
is required to have a joint law that is close in total variation to a specified
$Q(u,v).$ It is known that the maximal correlation of $U$ and $V$ must
necessarily be no bigger than that of $X$ and $Y$ if this is to be possible.
Our main contribution is to bring hypercontractivity to bear as a tool on this
problem. In particular, we show that if $P(x,y)$ is the doubly symmetric binary
source, then hypercontractivity provides stronger impossibility results than
maximal correlation. Finally, we extend these tools to provide impossibility
results for the $k$-agent version of this problem.
