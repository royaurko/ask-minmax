A kinetic over-relaxation minimizer, based on a lattice version of the
Boltzmann equation is presented. The method is validated against standard
Metropolis Monte Carlo, and proves very effective in attaining (global) minima
of classical pair potentials, involving solid body rotations. Linear scaling of
the computational time to minimum with the system size is demonstrated.
