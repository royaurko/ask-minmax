A one-parameter family of variational problems is introduced that
interpolates between torsional rigidity and the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of
the Laplacian. The associated partial differential equation is derived, which
is shown to have positive solutions in many cases. Results are obtained
regarding extremal domains and regarding variations of the domain or the
parameter.
