This paper presents a new type of genetic algorithm for the set covering
problem. It differs from previous evolutionary approaches first because it is
an indirect algorithm, i.e. the actual solutions are found by an external
decoder function. The genetic algorithm itself provides this decoder with
permutations of the solution variables and other parameters. Second, it will be
shown that results can be further improved by adding another indirect
optimisation layer. The decoder will not directly seek out low cost solutions
but instead aims for good exploitable solutions. These are then post optimised
by another hill-climbing algorithm. Although seemingly more complicated, we
will show that this three-stage approach has advantages in terms of solution
quality, speed and adaptability to new types of problems over more direct
approaches. Extensive computational results are presented and compared to the
latest evolutionary and other heuristic approaches to the same data instances.
