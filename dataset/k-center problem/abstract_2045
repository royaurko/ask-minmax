We prove an analogue for a one-phase free boundary problem of the classical
gradient bound for solutions to the minimal surface equation. It follows, in
particular, that every energy-minimizing free boundary that is a graph is also
smooth. The method we use also leads to a new proof of the classical minimal
surface gradient bound.
