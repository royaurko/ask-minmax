A recent technique, proposed to alleviate the ``sign problem disease'', is
discussed in details. As well known the ground state of a given Hamiltonian $H$
can be obtained by applying the imaginary time propagator $e^{-H \tau}$ to a
given trial state $\psi_T$ for large imaginary time $\tau$ and sampling
statistically the propagated state $ \psi_{\tau} = e^{-H \tau} \psi_T$. However
the so called ``sign problem'' may appear in the simulation and such
statistical propagation would be practically impossible without employing some
approximation such as the well known ``fixed node'' approximation (FN). This
method allows to improve the FN dynamic with a systematic correction scheme.
This is possible by the simple requirement that, after a short imaginary time
propagation via the FN dynamic, a number $p$ of correlation functions can be
further constrained to be {\em exact} by small perturbation of the FN
propagated state, which is free of the sign problem. By iterating this scheme
the Monte Carlo average sign, which is almost zero when there is sign problem,
remains stable and finite even for large $\tau$. The proposed algorithm is
tested against the exact diagonalization results available on finite lattice.
It is also shown in few test cases that the dependence of the results upon the
few parameters entering the stochastic technique can be very easily controlled,
unless for exceptional cases.
