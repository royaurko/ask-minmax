In this paper we make a subtle use of tools from operator theory and the
Schauder fixed-point theorem to establish the existence of pseudo-almost
automorphic solutions to some classes of nonautonomous integro-differential
equations with pseudo-almost automorphic forcing terms. To illustrate our main
results, the existence of pseudo-almost automorphic solutions to a parabolic
Neumann boundary value problem that models population genetics and nerve pulse
propagation will be discussed.
