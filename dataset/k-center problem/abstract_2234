We investigate the structure of the outer automorphism group of the Cuntz
algebra and the closely related problem of conjugacy of MASAa in O_n. In
particular, we exhibit an uncountable family of MASAs, conjugate to the
standard MASA D_n via Bogolubov automorphisms, that are not inner conjugate to
D_n.
