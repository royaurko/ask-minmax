We revisit the problem of spin-mediated superconducting pairing at the
antiferromagnetic quantum-critical point with the ordering momentum
({\pi},{\pi}) = 2k_F. The problem has been previously considered by one of the
contributors. However, it was later pointed out that that analysis neglected umklapp
processes for the spin polarization operator. We incorporate umklapp terms and
re-evaluate the normal state self-energy and the critical temperature of the
pairing instability. We show that the self-energy has a Fermi-liquid form and
obtain the renormalization of the quasiparticle residue Z, the Fermi velocity,
and the curvature of the Fermi surface. We argue that the pairing is a BCS-type
problem, but go one step beyond the BCS theory and calculate the critical
temperature T_c with the prefactor. We apply the results to electron-doped
cuprates near optimal doping and obtain T_c \geq 10 K, which matches the
experimental results quite well.
