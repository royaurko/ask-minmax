In this paper we establish a relation between Coulomb and oscillator systems
on $n$-dimensional spheres and hyperboloids for $n\geq 2$. We show that, as in
Euclidean space, the quasiradial equation for the $n+1$ dimensional Coulomb
problem coincides with the $2n$-dimensional quasiradial oscillator equation on
spheres and hyperboloids. Using the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for
the oscillator system, we construct the energy spectrum and wave functions for
the Coulomb problem.
