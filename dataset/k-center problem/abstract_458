In this paper we consider the problem of pricing a perpetual American put
option in an exponential regime-switching L\'{e}vy model. For the case of the
(dense) class of phase-type jumps and finitely many regimes we derive an
explicit expression for the value function. The solution of the corresponding
first passage problem under a state-dependent level rests on a path
transformation and a new matrix Wiener-Hopf factorization result for this class
of processes.
