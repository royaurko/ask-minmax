We review the potential impact of neutrino data on the determination of the
spin structure of the nucleon. We show that a flavour decomposition of the
parton structure of the nucleon as required by present-day precision
phenomenology could only be achieved at a neutrino factory. We discuss how
neutrino scattering data would allow a full resolution of the nucleon spin
problem.
