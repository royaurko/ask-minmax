We studied how to obtain a distribution for the number of ancestors in
species of sexual reproduction. Present models concentrate on the estimation of
distributions repetitions of ancestors in genealogical trees. It has been shown
that is not possible to reconstruct the genealogical history of each species
along all its generations by means of a geometric progression. This analysis
demonstrates that it is possible to rebuild the tree of progenitors by modeling
the problem with a Markov chain. For each generation, the maximum number of
possible ancestors is different. This brings huge problems for the resolution.
We found a solution through a dilation of the sample space, although the
distribution defined there takes smaller values respect to the initial problem.
In order to correct the distribution for each generation, we introduced the
invariance under gauge (local) group of dilations. These ideas can used to
study the interaction of several processes and provide a new approach on the
problem of the common ancestor. In the same direction, this model also provide
some elements that can be used to improve models of animal reproduction.
