The Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequence problem has applications in
telecommunications, is of theoretical interest to physicists, and has inspired
many optimisation researchers. Metaheuristics for the problem have progressed
greatly in recent years but complete search has not progressed since a
branch-and-bound method of 1996. In this paper we find four ways of improving
branch-and-bound, leading to a tighter relaxation, faster convergence to
optimality, and better empirical scalability.
