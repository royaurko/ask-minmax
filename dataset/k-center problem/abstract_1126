We demonstrate the implementation of a hybrid OpenMP and MPI parallelization
of a conservative spectral method for the Boltzmann equation originally
developed by Gamba and Tharkabhushaman. We perform a scaling analysis to
demonstrate that the problem is well suited to parallelization, and find that
the computational time scales linearly with the number of compute nodes on high
performance computing resources. The original method has also been improved to
higher order in space and time and is implemented on non-uniform grids in
physical space. We test this scheme for an example problem in which a kinetic
boundary layer generates a shock wave for large space and long times. This is
the first time that the fully nonlinear Boltzmann collision operator has been
used to compute this problem.
