An overview of results and problems concerning the asymptotic behaviour for
summatory functions of a certain class of additive functions is given. The
class of functions in question involves Karamata's regular variation. Some new
Abelian and Tauberian results for additive functions of the form $F(n) =
\sum_{p^\alpha||n}\alpha h(p)$ are given.
