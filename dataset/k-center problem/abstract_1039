We show that the strength of non-commutativity could play a role in
determining the boundary condition of a physical problem. As a toy model we
consider the inverse square problem in non-commutative space. The scale
invariance of the system is known to be explicitly broken by the scale of
non-commutativity \Theta. The resulting problem in non-commutative space is
analyzed. It is shown that despite the presence of higher singular potential
coming from the leading term of the expansion of the potential to first order
in \Theta, it can have a self-adjoint extensions. The boundary conditions are
obtained, belong to a 1-parameter family and related to the strength of
non-commutativity.
