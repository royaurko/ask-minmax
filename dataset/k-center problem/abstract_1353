I propose a new method to study computationally difficult problems. I
consider a new system, larger than the one I want to simulate. The original
system is recovered by imposing constraints on the large system. I simulate the
large system with the hard constraints replaced by soft constraints. I
illustrate the method in the case of the ferromagnetic Ising model and in the
case the three dimensional spin-glass model. I show that in both models the
phases of the soft problem have the same properties as the phases of the
original model and that the softened model belongs to the same universality
class as the original one. I show that correlation times are much shorter in
the larger soft constrained system and that it is computationally advantageous
to study it instead of the original system. This method is quite general and
can be applied to many other systems.
