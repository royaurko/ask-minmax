We deal with a boundary value problem of the form $-\epsilon(\phi_p(\epsilon
u'))'+a(x)W'(u)=0,\quad u'(0)=0=u'(1),$ where $\phi_p(s) = \vert s \vert^{p-2}
s$ for $s \in \mathbb{R}$ and $p>1$, and $W:[-1,1] \to {\mathbb R}$ is a
double-well potential. We study the limit profile of solutions when $\epsilon
\to 0^+$ and, conversely, we prove the existence of nodal solutions associated
with any admissible limit profile when $\epsilon$ is small enough.
