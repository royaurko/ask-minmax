Extreme Scattering Events and pulsar secondary spectra have highlighted
fundamental problems in our understanding of the dynamics of interstellar
turbulence. We describe some of these problems in detail and present the theory
behind the technique of speckle imaging, which offers a prospect of revealing
fundamental properties of the turbulence. It also offers the prospect of
resolving pulsar magnetospheres on ~10 nanoarcsecond scales.
