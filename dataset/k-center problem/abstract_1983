We study primitive divisors of terms of the sequence P_n=n^2+b, for a fixed
integer b which is not a negative square. It seems likely that the number of
terms with a primitive divisor has a natural density. This seems to be a
difficult problem. We survey some results about divisors of this sequence as
well as provide upper and lower growth estimates for the number of terms which
have a primitive divisor.
