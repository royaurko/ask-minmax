We study the central objects of symbolic dynamics, that is, subshifts and
block maps, from the perspective of basic category theory, and present several
natural categories with subshifts as objects and block maps as morphisms. Our
main goals are to find universal objects in these symbolic categories, to
classify their block maps based on their category theoretic properties, and to
establish as many natural properties (finite completeness, regularity etc.) as
possible. Existing definitions in category theory suggest interesting new
problems for block maps. Our main technical contributions are the solution to
the dual problem of the Extension Lemma and results on certain types of
conserved quantities, suggested by the concept of a coequalizer.
