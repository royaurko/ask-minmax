The existence of an on-line competitive algorithm for coloring bipartite
graphs remains a tantalizing open problem. So far there are only partial
positive results for bipartite graphs with certain small forbidden graphs as
induced subgraphs. We propose a new on-line competitive coloring algorithm for
$P_9$-free bipartite graphs.
