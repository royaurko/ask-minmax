Two choices are possible for the refractive index of a linear, homogeneous,
isotropic, active, dielectric material. Either of the choices is adequate for
obtaining frequency-domain solutions for (i) scattering by slabs, spheres, and
other objects of bounded extent; (ii) guided-wave propagation in homogeneously
filled, cross-sectionally uniform, straight waveguide sections with perfectly
conducting walls; and (iii) image formation due to flat lenses. The correct
choice does matter for the half-space problem, but that problem is not
realistic.
