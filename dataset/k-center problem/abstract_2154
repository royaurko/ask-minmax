This note discusses the problem of multiple testing of a single hypothesis,
with a standard goal of combining a number of p-values without making any
assumptions about their dependence structure. An old result by Rueschendorf
shows that the p-values can be combined by scaling up their average by a factor
of 2 (but no smaller factor is sufficient in general).
