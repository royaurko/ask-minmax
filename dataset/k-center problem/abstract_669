We consider non-autonomous wave equations \[ \left\{ \begin{aligned} \&\ddot
u(t) + \B(t)\dot u(t) + \A(t)u(t) = f(t) \quad t\text{-a.e.}\\ \&u(0)=u_0,\,
\dot u(0) = u_1. \end{aligned} \right. \] where the operators $\A(t)$ and
$\B(t)$ are associated with time-dependent sesquilinear forms $\fra(t,.,.)$ and
$\frb$ defined on a Hilbert space $H$ with the same domain $V$. The initial
values satisfy $ u_0 \in V$ and $u_1 \in H$. We prove well-posedness and
maximal regularity for the solution both in the spaces $V'$ and $H$. We apply
the results to non-autonomous Robin-boundary conditions and also use maximal
regularity to solve a quasilinear problem.
