In this paper we study the complexity of the problems: given a loop,
described by linear constraints over a finite set of variables, is there a
linear or lexicographical-linear ranking function for this loop? While
existence of such functions implies termination, these problems are not
equivalent to termination. When the variables range over the rationals (or
reals), it is known that both problems are PTIME decidable. However, when they
range over the integers, whether for single-path or multipath loops, the
complexity has not yet been determined. We show that both problems are
coNP-complete. However, we point out some special cases of importance of PTIME
complexity. We also present complete algorithms for synthesizing linear and
lexicographical-linear ranking functions, both for the general case and the
special PTIME cases. Moreover, in the rational setting, our algorithm for
synthesizing lexicographical-linear ranking functions extends existing ones,
because our class of ranking functions is more general, yet it has polynomial
time complexity.
