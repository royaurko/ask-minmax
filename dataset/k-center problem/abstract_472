We investigate the impact of TeV-scale matter belonging to complete
vectorlike multiplets of unified groups on the lightest Higgs boson in the
MSSM. We find that consistent with perturbative unification and electroweak
precision data the mass m_h can be as large as 160 GeV. These extended MSSM
models can also render the little hierarchy problem less severe, but only for
lower values of m_h < 125 GeV. We present estimates for the sparticle mass
spectrum in these models.
