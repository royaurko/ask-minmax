For some planar Newtonian $N+3$-body problems, we use variational
minimization methods to prove the existence of new periodic solutions
satisfying that $N$ bodies chase each other on a curve, and the other 3 bodies
chase each other on another curve. From the definition of the group action in
equations $(3.1)-(3.3)$, we can find that they are new solutions which are also
different from all the examples of Ferrario and Terracini (2004)$[22]$.
