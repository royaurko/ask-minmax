This memoir attempts at a systematic study of convergence to stationary state
for certain classes of degenerate diffusive equations, by means of well-chosen
Lyapunov functionals. Typical examples are the kinetic Fokker--Planck and
Boltzmann equation. Many open problems and possible directions for future
research are discussed.
