We consider an admissible Riemannian polyhedron with piece-wise smooth
boundary. The associated Laplace defines the boundary spectral data as the set
of eigenvalues and restrictions to the boundary of the corresponding
eigenfunctions. In this paper we prove that the boundary spectral data
prescribed on an open subset of the polyhedron boundary determine the
admissible Riemannian polyhedron uniquely.
