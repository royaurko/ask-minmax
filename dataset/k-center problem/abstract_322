The electronic bandgaps measured in fluorescence spectroscopy on individual
single wall carbon nanotubes isolated within micelles show signficant
deviations from the predictions of one electron band theory. We resolve this
problem by developing a theory of the electron hole interaction in the
photoexcited states. The one dimensional character and tubular structure
introduce a novel relaxation pathway for carriers photoexcited above the
fundamental band edge. Analytic expression for the energies and lineshapes of
higher subband excitons are derived, and a comparison with experiment is used
to extract the value of the screened electron hole interaction.
