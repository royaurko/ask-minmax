We study the asymptotic behaviour near extinction of positive solutions of
the Cauchy problem for the fast diffusion equation with a critical exponent.
After a suitable rescaling which yields a non--linear Fokker--Planck equation,
we find a continuum of algebraic rates of convergence to a self--similar
profile. These rates depend explicitly on the spatial decay rates of initial
data. This improves a previous result on slow convergence for the critical fast
diffusion equation ({\sc Bonforte et al}. in Arch Rat Mech Anal 196:631--680,
2010) and provides answers to some open problems.
