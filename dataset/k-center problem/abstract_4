The compound decision problem for a vector of independent Poisson random
variables with possibly different means has half a century old solution.
However, it appears that the classical solution needs smoothing adjustment even
when there are many observations and relatively small means such that the
empirical distribution is close to its mean. We discuss three such adjustments.
We also present another approach that first transforms the problem into the
normal compound decision problem.
