We show that the integrated density of states of the almost Mathieu operator
is absolutely continuous if and only if the coupling is non-critical. We deduce
for subcritical coupling that the spectrum is purely absolutely continuous for
almost every phase, settling the measure-theoretical case of Problem 6 of Barry
Simon's list of Schr\"odinger operator problems for the twenty-first century.
