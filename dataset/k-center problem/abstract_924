Are there positive semi-definite (PSD) but not sums of squares (SOS) Hankel
tensors? If the answer to this question is "no", then the problem for
determining an even order Hankel tensor is PSD or not can be solved in
polynomial-time. By Hilbert, one of the cases of low order (degree) and
dimension (number of variables), in which PSD non-SOS (PNS) symmetric tensors
(homogeneous polynomials) exists, is of order six and dimension three. The
famous Motzkin polynomial falls into this case. In this paper, we study the
existence problem of sixth order three dimensional PNS Hankel tensors. We
examine various important classes of sixth order three dimensional Hankel
tensors. No PNS Hankel tensors are found in these cases. We then randomly
generate several thousands of sixth order three dimensional Hankel tensors and
make them PSD by adding adequate multiple of a fixed sixth order three
dimensional positive definite Hankel tensor. Again, still no PNS Hankel tensors
are found. Thus, we make a conjecture that there are no sixth order three
dimensional PNS Hankel tensors. If this conjecture turns out to be true, this
implies that the problem for determining a given sixth order three dimensional
Hankel tensor is PSD or not can be solved by a semi-definite linear programming
problem.
