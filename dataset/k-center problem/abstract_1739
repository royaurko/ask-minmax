In this paper we characterise the indeterminate case by the eigenvalues of
the Hankel matrices being bounded below by a strictly positive constant. An
explicit lower bound is given in terms of the orthonormal polynomials and we
find expresions for this lower bound in a number of indeterminate moment
problems.
