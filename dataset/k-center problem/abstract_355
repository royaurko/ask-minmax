Large mixing MSW solutions to the solar neutrino problem appear to be
currently favored by the data. We discuss the possibility of discriminating
them by means of present and future experiments. In particular, we show that
the study of energy and time dependence of the Earth regeneration effect can be
useful in this respect.
