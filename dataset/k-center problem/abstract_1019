In this note we study a minimization problem for a vector of measures subject
to a prescribed interaction matrix in the presence of external potentials. The
conductors are allowed to have zero distance from each other but the external
potentials satisfy a growth condition near the common points.
  We then specialize the setting to a specific problem on the real line which
arises in the study of certain biorthogonal polynomials (studied elsewhere) and
we prove that the equilibrium measures solve a pseudo-algebraic curve under the
assumption that the potentials are real analytic. In particular the supports of
the equilibrium measures are shown to consist of a finite union of compact
intervals.
