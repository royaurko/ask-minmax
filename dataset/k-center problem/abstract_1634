I review recent progress from $N$-body simulations in our understanding of
the secular evolution of isolated disk galaxies. I describe some of the recent
controversies in the field which have been commonly attributed to numerics. The
numerical methods used are widely used in computational astronomy and the
problems encountered are therefore of wider interest.
