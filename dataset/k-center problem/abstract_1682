In this short review of Doubly Special Relativity I describe first the
relations between DSR and (quantum) gravity. Then I show how, in the case of a
field theory with curved momentum space, the Hopf algebra of symmetries
naturally emerges. I conclude with some remarks concerning DSR phenomenology
and description of open problems.
