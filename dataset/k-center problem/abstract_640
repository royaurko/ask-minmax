We present a new analysis of the stability of the first and second
barycentric formulae for interpolation at the Chebyshev points of the second
kind. Our theory shows that the second formula is more stable than previously
thought and our experiments confirm its stability in practice. % OLD: We also
explain that the first barycentric formula has accuracy problems which are not
properly taken into account in the current literature. We also extend our
current understanding regarding the accuracy problems of the first barycentric
formula.
