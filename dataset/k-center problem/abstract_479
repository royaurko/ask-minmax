We present a class of wild matrix problems (representations of boxes), which
are "brick-tame," i.e. only have one-parameter families of \emph{bricks}
(representations with trivial endomorphism algebra). This class includes
several boxes that arise in study of simple vector bundles on degenerations of
elliptic curves, as well as those arising from the coadjoint action of some
linear groups.
