This paper considers signal detection in coexisting wireless sensor networks
(WSNs). We characterize the aggregate signal and interference from a Poisson
random field of nodes and define a binary hypothesis testing problem to detect
a signal in the presence of interference. For the testing problem, we introduce
the maximum likelihood (ML) detector and simpler alternatives. The proposed
mixed-fractional lower order moment (FLOM) detector is computationally simple
and close to the ML performance, and robust to estimation errors in system
parameters. We also derived asymptotic theoretical performances for the
proposed simple detectors. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to supplement our
analytical results and compare the performance of the receivers.
