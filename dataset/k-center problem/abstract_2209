Recent observations have revealed structure on small angular scales in the
anisotropy data of cosmic rays at multi TeV energies. Even though the absolute
amplitudes are very small, these effects are somewhat surprising and a wide
range of possible causes have been discussed. A possible origin associated with
heliospheric electric fields is proposed.
