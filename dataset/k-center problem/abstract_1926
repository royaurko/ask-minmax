We show that there exist non-unitarizable groups without non-abelian free
subgroups. Both torsion and torsion free examples are constructed. As a
by-product, we show that there exist finitely generated torsion groups with
non-vanishing first $L^2$-Betti numbers. We also relate the well-known problem
of whether every hyperbolic group is residually finite to an open question
about approximation of $L^2$-Betti numbers.
