The solar neutrino problem, atmospheric neutrino problem, and the existence
of hot dark matter can all be economically accounted for using only the three
known neutrinos if these neutrinos all have nearly degenerate masses of a few
eV. We show how to generate this pattern of neutrino masses in a natural way
within a `see-saw' framework.
