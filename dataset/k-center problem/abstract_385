The interpolation step of Guruswami and Sudan's list decoding of Reed-Solomon
codes poses the problem of finding the minimal polynomial of an ideal with
respect to a certain monomial order. An efficient algorithm that solves the
problem is presented based on the theory of Groebner bases of modules. In a
special case, this algorithm reduces to a simple Berlekamp-Massey-like decoding
algorithm.
