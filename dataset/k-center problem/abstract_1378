The maximal matching problem has received considerable attention in the
self-stabilizing community. Previous work has given different self-stabilizing
algorithms that solves the problem for both the adversarial and fair
distributed daemon, the sequential adversarial daemon, as well as the
synchronous daemon. In the following we present a single self-stabilizing
algorithm for this problem that unites all of these algorithms in that it
stabilizes in the same number of moves as the previous best algorithms for the
sequential adversarial, the distributed fair, and the synchronous daemon. In
addition, the algorithm improves the previous best moves complexities for the
distributed adversarial daemon from O(n^2) and O(delta m) to O(m) where n is
the number of processes, m is thenumber of edges, and delta is the maximum
degree in the graph.
