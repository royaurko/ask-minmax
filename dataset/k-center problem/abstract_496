We study the age problem of the universe with the holographic DE model
introduced in [21], and test the model with some known old high redshift
objects (OHRO). The parameters of the model have been constrained using the
SNIa, CMB and BAO data set. We found that the age of the old quasar APM 08
279+5255 at z = 3.91 can be described by the model.
