We give coefficient estimates for a class of close-to-convex harmonic
mappings, and discuss the Fekete-Szeg\H{o} problem of it. We also introduce two
classes of polyharmonic mappings $\mathcal{HS}_{p}$ and $\mathcal{HC}_{p}$,
consider the starlikeness and convexity of them, and obtain coefficient
estimates on them. Finally, we give a necessary condition for a mapping $F$ to
be in the class $\mathcal{HC}_{p}$.
