This paper is a continuation of the work done to understand the security of a
MOR cryptosystem over matrix groups defined over a finite field. In this paper
we show that in the case of unitary group U$(d,q^2)$ the security of the MOR
cryptosystem is similar to the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem in
$\mathbb{F}_{q^{2d}}$. In our way of developing the MOR cryptosystem, we
developed row-column operations for unitary matrices that solves the word
problem in the group of unitary matrices. This is similar to row-column
operations in special linear groups that write a matrix as a product of
elementary transvections.
