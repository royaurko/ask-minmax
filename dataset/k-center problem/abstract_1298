To follow the dynamicity of the user's content, researchers have recently
started to model interactions between users and the Context-Aware Recommender
Systems (CARS) as a bandit problem where the system needs to deal with
exploration and exploitation dilemma. In this sense, we propose to study the
freshness of the user's content in CARS through the bandit problem. We
introduce in this paper an algorithm named Freshness-Aware Thompson Sampling
(FA-TS) that manages the recommendation of fresh document according to the
user's risk of the situation. The intensive evaluation and the detailed
analysis of the experimental results reveals several important discoveries in
the exploration/exploitation (exr/exp) behaviour.
