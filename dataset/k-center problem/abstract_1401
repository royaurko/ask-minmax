Large scale manned space flight within the solar system is still confronted
with the solution of two problems: 1. A propulsion system to transport large
payloads with short transit times between different planetary orbits. 2. A cost
effective lifting of large payloads into earth orbit. For the solution of the
first problem a deuterium fusion bomb propulsion system is proposed where a
thermonuclear detonation wave is ignited in a small cylindrical assembly of
deuterium with a gigavolt-multimegampere proton beam, drawn from the
magnetically insulated spacecraft acting in the ultrahigh vacuum of space as a
gigavolt capacitor. For the solution of the second problem, the ignition is
done by argon ion lasers driven by high explosives, with the lasers destroyed
in the fusion explosion and becoming part of the exhaust.
