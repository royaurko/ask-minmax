Improved estimation of hydrometeorological states from down-sampled
observations and background model forecasts in a noisy environment, has been a
subject of growing research in the past decades. Here, we introduce a unified
framework that ties together the problems of downscaling, data fusion and data
assimilation as ill-posed inverse problems. This framework seeks solutions
beyond the classic least squares estimation paradigms by imposing proper
regularization, which are constraints consistent with the degree of smoothness
and probabilistic structure of the underlying state. We review relevant
regularization methods in derivative space and extend classic formulations of
the aforementioned problems with particular emphasis on hydrologic and
atmospheric applications. Informed by the statistical characteristics of the
state variable of interest, the central results of the paper suggest that
proper regularization can lead to a more accurate and stable recovery of the
true state and hence more skillful forecasts. In particular, using the Tikhonov
and Huber regularization in the derivative space, the promise of the proposed
framework is demonstrated in static downscaling and fusion of synthetic
multi-sensor precipitation data, while a data assimilation numerical experiment
is presented using the heat equation in a variational setting.
