The problem of confinement of spinless particles in 1+1 dimensions is
approached with a linear potential by considering a mixing of Lorentz vector
and scalar couplings. Analytical bound-states solutions are obtained when the
scalar coupling is of sufficient intensity compared to the vector coupling.
