We consider the classical problem of the blowing-up of solutions of the
nonlinear heat equation. We show that there exist infinitely many profiles
around the blow-up point, and for each integer $k$, we construct a set of
codimension $2k$ in the space of initial data giving rise to solutions that
blow-up according to the given profile.
