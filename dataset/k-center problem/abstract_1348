This paper studies the decentralized signaling problem when the encoder and
the decoder, viewed as two decision makers, have misaligned objective
functions. In particular, the study investigates extensions of the quadratic
cheap talk and signaling game problem, which has been introduced in the
economics literature. Two main contributions of this study are the extension of
Crawford and Sobel's cheap talk formulation to multi-dimensional sources, and
the extension to noisy channel setups as a signaling game problem. We show
that, in the presence of misalignment, the quantized nature of all equilibrium
policies holds for any scalar random source. It is shown that for
multi-dimensional setups, unlike the scalar case, equilibrium policies may be
of non-quantized nature, and even linear. In the noisy setup, a Gaussian source
is to be transmitted over an additive Gaussian channel. The goals of the
encoder and the decoder are misaligned by a bias term and encoder's cost also
includes a power term scaled by a multiplier. Conditions for the existence of
affine equilibrium policies as well as general informative equilibria are
presented for both the scalar and multi-dimensional setups. Our findings
provide further conditions on when affine policies may be optimal in
decentralized multi-criteria control problems and lead to conditions for the
presence of active information transmission in strategic environments.
