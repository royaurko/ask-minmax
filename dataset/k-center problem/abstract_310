Many problems in astrophysics involve relativistic outflows. The plasma
dynamics in these scenarios is critical to determine the conditions for the
self-consistent evolution of the fields and particle acceleration. Advances in
computer power now allow for kinetic plasma simulations, based on the
particle-in-cell (PIC) paradigm, capable of providing information about the
role of plasma instabilities in relativistic outflows. A discussion of the key
issues associated with PIC simulations is presented, along with some the most
important results and open questions, with a particular emphasis on the long
time evolution of the filamentation, or Weibel, instability, and on the
possible collisionless mechanisms for particle acceleration arising in the
collision of relativistic plasma shells.
