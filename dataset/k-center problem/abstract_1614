Kernelization investigates exact preprocessing algorithms with performance
guarantees. The most prevalent type of parameters used in kernelization is the
solution size for optimization problems; however, also structural parameters
have been successfully used to obtain polynomial kernels for a wide range of
problems. Many of these parameters can be defined as the size of a smallest
modulator of the given graph into a fixed graph class (i.e., a set of vertices
whose deletion puts the graph into the graph class). Such parameters admit the
construction of polynomial kernels even when the solution size is large or not
applicable. This work follows up on the research on meta-kernelization
frameworks in terms of structural parameters.
  We develop a class of parameters which are based on a more general view on
modulators: instead of size, the parameters employ a combination of rank-width
and split decompositions to measure structure inside the modulator. This allows
us to lift kernelization results from modulator-size to more general
parameters, hence providing smaller kernels. We show (i) how such large but
well-structured modulators can be efficiently approximated, (ii) how they can
be used to obtain polynomial kernels for any graph problem expressible in
Monadic Second Order logic, and (iii) how they allow the extension of previous
results in the area of structural meta-kernelization.
