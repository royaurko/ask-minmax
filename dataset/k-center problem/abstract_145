The problem of finding perfect Euler cuboids or proving their non-existence
is an old unsolved problem in mathematics. The third cuboid conjecture is the
last of the three propositions suggested as intermediate stages in proving the
non-existence of perfect Euler cuboids. It is associated with a certain
Diophantine equation of the order 12. In this paper a structural theorem for
the solutions of this Diophantine equation is proved.
