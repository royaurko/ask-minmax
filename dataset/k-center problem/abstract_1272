In this work we study qualitative properties of real analytic bounded maps.
The main tool is approximation of real valued functions analytic in rectangular
domains of the complex plane by continued g-fractions of Wall. As an
application, the Sundman-Poincar\'e method in the Newtonian three-body problem
is revisited and applications to collision detection problem are considered.
