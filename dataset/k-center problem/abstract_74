Starting from an innocent Ramsey-theoretic question regarding directed paths
in tournaments, we discover a series of rich and surprising connections that
lead into the theory around a fundamental problem in Combinatorics: the
Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi induced matching problem. Using these relationships, we prove
that every coloring of the edges of the transitive $n$-vertex tournament using
three colors contains a directed path of length at least $\sqrt{n} \cdot
e^{\log^* n}$ which entirely avoids some color. We also completely resolve the
analogous question for ordinary monochromatic directed paths in general
tournaments, as well as natural generalizations of the Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi
problem which we encounter through our investigation.
