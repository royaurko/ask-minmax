We introduce an adaptive output-sensitive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for
probabilistic models expressed as programs, Adaptive Lightweight
Metropolis-Hastings (AdLMH). The algorithm extends Lightweight
Metropolis-Hastings (LMH) by adjusting the probabilities of proposing random
variables for modification to improve convergence of the program output. We
show that AdLMH converges to the correct equilibrium distribution and compare
convergence of AdLMH to that of LMH on several test problems to highlight
different aspects of the adaptation scheme. We observe consistent improvement
in convergence on the test problems.
