Different approaches to the fermion mass problem are reviewed. We illustrate
these approaches by summarizing recent developments in models of quark and
lepton mass matrices. Dynamical calculations of the top quark mass are
discussed, based on (a) infrared quasi-fixed points of the renormalisation
group equations, and (b) the multiple point criticality principle in the pure
Standard Model. We also consider Yukawa unification and mass matrix texture.
Models with approximately conserved gauged chiral flavour charges beyond the
Standard Model are shown to naturally give a fermion mass hierarchy.
