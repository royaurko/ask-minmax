Continuing work initiated in an earlier publication [Yamada, Asada, Phys.
Rev. D 82, 104019 (2010)], we investigate collinear solutions to the general
relativistic three-body problem. We prove the uniqueness of the configuration
for given system parameters (the masses and the end-to-end length). First, we
show that the equation determining the distance ratio among the three masses,
which has been obtained as a seventh-order polynomial in the previous paper,
has at most three positive roots, which apparently provide three cases of the
distance ratio. It is found, however, that, even for such cases, there exists
one physically reasonable root and only one, because the remaining two positive
roots do not satisfy the slow motion assumption in the post-Newtonian
approximation and are thus discarded. This means that, especially for the
restricted three-body problem, exactly three positions of a third body are true
even at the post-Newtonian order. They are relativistic counterparts of the
Newtonian Lagrange points L1, L2 and L3. We show also that, for the same masses
and full length, the angular velocity of the post-Newtonian collinear
configuration is smaller than that for the Newtonian case. Provided that the
masses and angular rate are fixed, the relativistic end-to-end length is
shorter than the Newtonian one.
