The paper presents a new study method of mechanic vibrations with the help of
the data acquisition systems. The study of vibrations with the help of data
acquisition systems allows the solving of some engineering problems connected
to the measurement of some parameters which are difficult to measure having in
view the improvement of the technical performances of the industrial equipment
or devices
