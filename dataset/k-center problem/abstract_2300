In this paper, we study the large time behavior of the 3-D isentropic
compressible Navier-Stokes equation in the partial space-periodic domains, and
simultaneously show that the related profile systems can be described by like
Navier-Stokes equations with suitable "pressure" functions in lower dimensions.
Our proofs are based on the energy methods together with some delicate analysis
on the corresponding linearized problems.
