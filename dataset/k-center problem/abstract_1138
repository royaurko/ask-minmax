This paper studies a formulation of 1-bit Compressed Sensing (CS) problem
based on the maximum likelihood estimation framework. In order to solve the
problem we apply the recently proposed Gradient Support Pursuit algorithm, with
a minor modification. Assuming the proposed objective function has a Stable
Restricted Hessian, the algorithm is shown to accurately solve the 1-bit CS
problem. Furthermore, the algorithm is compared to the state-of-the-art 1-bit
CS algorithms through numerical simulations. The results suggest that the
proposed method is robust to noise and at mid to low input SNR regime it
achieves the best reconstruction SNR vs. execution time trade-off.
