Cost-efficient compressive sensing is challenging when facing large-scale
data, {\em i.e.}, data with large sizes. Conventional compressive sensing
methods for large-scale data will suffer from low computational efficiency and
massive memory storage. In this paper, we revisit well-known solvers called
greedy algorithms, including Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), Subspace
Pursuit (SP), Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement (OMPR). Generally,
these approaches are conducted by iteratively executing two main steps: 1)
support detection and 2) solving least square problem.
  To reduce the cost of Step 1, it is not hard to employ the sensing matrix
that can be implemented by operator-based strategy instead of matrix-based one
and can be speeded by fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Step 2, however, requires
maintaining and calculating a pseudo-inverse of a sub-matrix, which is random
and not structural, and, thus, operator-based matrix does not work. To overcome
this difficulty, instead of solving Step 2 by a closed-form solution, we
propose a fast and cost-effective least square solver, which combines a
Conjugate Gradient (CG) method with our proposed weighted least square problem
to iteratively approximate the ground truth yielded by a greedy algorithm.
Extensive simulations and theoretical analysis validate that the proposed
method is cost-efficient and is readily incorporated with the existing greedy
algorithms to remarkably improve the performance for large-scale problems.
