We give universal upper bounds on the relative dimensions of isotypic
components of a tensor product of the linear group GL(n) representations and
universal upper bounds on the relative dimensions of irreducible components of
a tensor product of the special linear group SL(n) representations. This
problem is motivated by harmonic analysis problems, and we give some
applications of this result in the theory of Beurling-Fourier algebras.
