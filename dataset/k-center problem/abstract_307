I review the data relating to the appearance of the missing mass problem at a
particular acceleration scale. Rotation curves are examined in detail, with
emphasis on the empirical connection between baryonic and total mass
distributions. Other lines of evidence are also considered, including disk
stability, dwarf spheroidals, giant ellipticals, clusters of galaxies, the
microwave background, BBN, and the growth of large scale structure.
