In a very celebrated paper A. Connes has formulated a conjecture which is now
one of the most important open problem in Operator Algebras. This importance
comes from the works of many mathematicians who have found some unexpected
equivalent statements showing as this conjecture is transversal to almost all
the sub-specialization of Operator Algebras. In this survey I would like to
give a more or less detailed description of all these approaches.
