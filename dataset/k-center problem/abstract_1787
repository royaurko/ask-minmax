Let kappa be a regular uncountable cardinal and lambda >=kappa^+ . The
principle of stationary reflection for P_kappa lambda has been successful in
settling problems of infinite combinatorics in the case kappa=omega_1. For a
greater kappa the principle is known to fail at some lambda. This note shows
that it fails at every lambda if kappa is the successor of a regular
uncountable cardinal or kappa is countably closed.
