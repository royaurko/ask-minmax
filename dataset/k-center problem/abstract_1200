This paper presents n-coding, a theoretical model of multiple internal mental
representations. The n-coding construct is developed from a review of cognitive
and imaging studies suggesting the independence of information processing along
different modalities: verbal, visual, kinesthetic, social, etc. A study testing
the effectiveness of the n-coding construct in an algebra-based mechanics
course is presented. Four sections differing in the level of n-coding
opportunities were compared. Besides a traditional instruction section used as
a control group, each of the remaining three treatment sections were given
context rich problems following the 'cooperative group problem solving'
approach which differed by the level of n-coding opportunities designed into
their laboratory environment. To measure the effectiveness of the construct,
problem solving skills were assessed as was conceptual learning using the Force
Concept Inventory. However, a number of new measures taking into account
students' confidence in concepts were developed to complete the picture of
student learning. Results suggest that using the developed n-coding construct
to design context rich environments can generate learning gains in problem
solving, conceptual knowledge and concept-confidence.
