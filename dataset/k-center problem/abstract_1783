If P is a hereditary property then we show that, for the existence of a
perfect f-factor, P is a sufficient condition for countable graphs and yields a
sufficient condition for graphs of size aleph_1. Further we give two examples
of a hereditary property which is even necessary for the existence of a perfect
f-factor. We also discuss the aleph_2-case.
