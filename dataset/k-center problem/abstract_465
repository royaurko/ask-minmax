This paper deals with the problem of existence and uniqueness of a solution
for a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE for short) with one
reflecting barrier in the case when the terminal value, the generator and the
obstacle process are Lp-integrable with p in ]1,2[. To construct the solution
we use two methods: penalization and Snell envelope. As an application we
broaden the class of functions for which the related obstacle partial
differential equation problem has a unique viscosity solution.
