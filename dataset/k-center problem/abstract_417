The exact solution of the Cauchy problem for a generalized "linear" vectorial
Fokker-Planck equation is found using the disentangling techniques of R.
Feynman and algebraic (operational) methods. This approach may be considered as
a generalization of the Masuo Suzuki's method for solving the 1-dimensional
linear Fokker-Planck equation.
