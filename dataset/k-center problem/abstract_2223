We answer the question posed by Davis: "When is the underlying space of an
orbifold a topological manifold". It amounts to the classification of finite
groups acting linearly on a Euclidean vector space such that the quotient space
is homeomorphic to the original vector space. We also treat the corresponding
problem for actions on unit spheres.
