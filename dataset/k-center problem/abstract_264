We prove polynomial-time solvability of a large class of clustering problems
where a weighted set of items has to be partitioned into clusters with respect
to some balancing constraints. The data points are weighted with respect to
different categories and the clusters adhere to given lower and upper bounds on
the total weight of their points with respect to each of these categories.
Further the weight-contribution of a vector to a cluster can depend on the
cluster it is assigned to. Our interest in these types of clustering problems
is motivated by an application in land consolidation.
  Our framework maximizes an objective function that is convex in the summed-up
utility of the items in each cluster. Despite hardness of convex maximization
and many related problems, for fixed dimension and number of clusters, we are
able to show that our clustering model is solvable in time polynomial in the
number of items if the weight vectors come from a fixed, finite set. Finally,
we exhibit a new model for land consolidation that can be approximated with
provable and favorable error in polynomial time using our framework.
