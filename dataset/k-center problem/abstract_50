We introduce a generalized isospectral problem for global conservative
multi-peakon solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation. Utilizing the solution of
the indefinite moment problem given by M. G. Krein and H. Langer, we show that
the conservative Camassa-Holm equation is integrable by the inverse spectral
transform in the multi-peakon case.
