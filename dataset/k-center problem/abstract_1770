We will introduce new functional equations (\ref{eq:hana}) and
(\ref{eq:hana2}) which are strongly related to well-known formulae
(\ref{eq:young}) and (\ref{eq:young2}) of number theory, and investigate the
solutions of the equations. Moreover, we will also study some stability
problems of those equations.
