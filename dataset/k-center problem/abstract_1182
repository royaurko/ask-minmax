It is shown that in the noncommutative version of QED {(NCQED)} Gribov copies
induced by the noncommutativity of space-time do appear in the Landau gauge.
This is a genuine effect of noncommutative geometry which disappears when the
noncommutative parameter vanishes. On the basis of existing applications of the
Gribov-Zwanziger propagator in NCQED to deal with the UV/IR mixing problem, we
argue that the two problems may have a common origin and possibly a common
solution.
