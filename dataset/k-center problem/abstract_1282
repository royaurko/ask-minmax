A tower for a (2+1)-dimensional Toda type system is constructed in terms of a
series expansion of operators which can be interpreted as generalized Bessel
coefficients; the result is formulated as an analog of the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We tackle the problem of the construction of
infinitesimal algebraic skeletons for such a tower and discuss some open
problems arising along our approach. In particular, we realize the prolongation
skeleton as a Kac-Moody algebra.
