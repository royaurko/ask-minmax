We study the secrecy capacity of a helper-assisted Gaussian wiretap channel
with a source, a legitimate receiver, an eavesdropper and an external helper,
where each terminal is equipped with multiple antennas. Determining the secrecy
capacity in this scenario generally requires solving a nonconvex secrecy rate
maximization (SRM) problem. To deal with this issue, we first reformulate the
original SRM problem into a sequence of convex subproblems. For the special
case of single-antenna legitimate receiver, we obtain the secrecy capacity via
a combination of convex optimization and one-dimensional search, while for the
general case of multi-antenna legitimate receiver, we propose an iterative
solution. To gain more insight into how the secrecy capacity of a
helper-assisted Gaussian wiretap channel behaves, we examine the achievable
secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) and obtain the maximal achievable s.d.o.f.
in closed-form. We also derive a closed-form solution to the original SRM
problem which achieves the maximal s.d.o.f.. Numerical results are presented to
illustrate the efficacy of the proposed schemes.
