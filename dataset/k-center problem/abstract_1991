By considering probability distributions over the set of assignments the
expected truth values assignment to propositional variables are extended
through linear operators, and the expected truth values of the clauses at any
given conjunctive form are also extended through linear maps. The probabilistic
satisfiability problems are discussed in terms of the introduced linear
extensions. The case of multiple truth values is also discussed.
