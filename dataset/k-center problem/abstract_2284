We study a class of dynamic decision problems of mean field type with time
inconsistent cost functionals, and derive a stochastic maximum principle to
characterize subgame perfect Nash equilibrium points. Subsequently, this
approach is extended to a mean field game to construct decentralized strategies
and obtain an estimate of their performance.
