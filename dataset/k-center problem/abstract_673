An initial-boundary value problem in a strip with homogeneous Diriclet
boundary conditions for two-dimensional generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation
is considered. In particular, dissipative and absorbing degenerate terms can be
supplemented to the original Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. Results on global
existence, uniqueness and long-time decay of weak silutions are established.
