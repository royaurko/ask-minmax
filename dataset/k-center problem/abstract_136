In this paper some new cases of Knaster's problem on continuous maps from
spheres are established. In particular, we consider an almost orbit of a
$p$-torus $X$ on the sphere, a continuous map $f$ from the sphere to the real
line or real plane, and show that $X$ can be rotated so that $f$ becomes
constant on $X$.
