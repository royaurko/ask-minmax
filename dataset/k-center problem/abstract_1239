We consider bounds on codes in spherical caps and related problems in
geometry and coding theory. An extension of the Delsarte method is presented
that relates upper bounds on the size of spherical codes to upper bounds on
codes in caps. Several new upper bounds on codes in caps are derived.
Applications of these bounds to estimates of the kissing numbers and one-sided
kissing numbers are considered.
  It is proved that the maximum size of codes in spherical caps for large
dimensions is determined by the maximum size of spherical codes, so these
problems are asymptotically equivalent.
