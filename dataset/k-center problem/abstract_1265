Hara, Takemura and Yoshida discuss toric ideals arising from two way subtable
sum problems and shows that these toric ideals are generated by quadratic
binomials if and only if the subtables are either diagonal or triangular. In
the present paper, we show that if the subtables are either diagonal or
triangular, then their toric ideals possess quadratic Groebner bases.
