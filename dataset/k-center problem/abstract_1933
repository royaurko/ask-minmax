A classical problem in operator theory has been to determine the spectrum of
Toeplitz-like operators on Hilbert spaces of vector-valued holomorphic
functions on the open unit ball in C^m. In this note we obtain necessary
conditions for k-tuples of such operators to be Fredholm in the sense of Taylor
and show they are sufficient in the case of the unit disk.
