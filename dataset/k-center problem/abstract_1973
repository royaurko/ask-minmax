We prove that NP differs from coNP and coNP is not a subset of MA in the
number-on-forehead model of multiparty communication complexity for up to k =
(1-\epsilon)log(n) players, where \epsilon>0 is any constant. Specifically, we
construct a function F with co-nondeterministic complexity O(log(n)) and
Merlin-Arthur complexity n^{\Omega(1)}. The problem was open for k > 2.
