A new understanding of the notion of the stable solution to ill-posed
problems is proposed. The new notion is more realistic than the old one and
better fits the practical computational needs. A method for constructing stable
solutions in the new sense is proposed and justified. The basic point is: in
the traditional definition of the stable solution to an ill-posed problem
$Au=f$, where $A$ is a linear or nonlinear operator in a Hilbert space $H$, it
is assumed that the noisy data $\{f_\delta, \delta\}$ are given,
$||f-f_\delta||\leq \delta$, and a stable solution $u_\d:=R_\d f_\d$ is defined
by the relation $\lim_{\d\to 0}||R_\d f_\d-y||=0$, where $y$ solves the
equation $Au=f$, i.e., $Ay=f$. In this definition $y$ and $f$ are unknown. Any
$f\in B(f_\d,\d)$ can be the exact data, where $B(f_\d,\d):=\{f:
||f-f_\delta||\leq \delta\}$.The new notion of the stable solution excludes the
unknown $y$ and $f$ from the definition of the solution.
