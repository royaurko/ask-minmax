The description of all solutions to the relaxed commutant lifting problem in
terms of an underlying contraction, obtained earlier in joint work of the
contributor with A.E. Frazho and M.A. Kaashoek, is transformed into a linear
fractional Redheffer state space form. Under certain additional conditions the
coefficient functions in this representation are described explicitly in terms
of the original data. The main theorem is a generalization of the Redheffer
description of all solutions to the classical commutant lifting problem. To
illustrate the result a relaxed version of the Nehari extension problem is
considered, and an explicit Redheffer description of all its solutions is
given, assuming that a certain truncated Hankel operator is a strict
contraction. The latter result is specified further for two special cases.
