We study freeze out process of particles across a three dimensional
space-time hypersurface with space-like normal. The problem of negative
contribution is discussed with respect to conservation laws, and a simple and
practical new one-particle distribution for the post FO side is introduced, the
Cancelling Juttner distribution.
