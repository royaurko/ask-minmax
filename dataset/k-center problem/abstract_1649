This paper shows how to apply memoization (caching of subgoals and associated
answer substitutions) in a constraint logic programming setting. The research
is is motivated by the desire to apply constraint logic programming (CLP) to
problems in natural language processing that involve (constraint) interleaving
or coroutining, such as GB and HPSG parsing.
