The formulation of the variational problems for the solute transport in a
fluid layer in presence of double-diffusive thermal convection is discussed. It
is shown that the variational functional obtained by Strauss can be generalized
and the general functional leads to accurate upper bounds on the solute
transport for the case of small and intermediate values of the Rayleigh number.
The general functional however is a non-homogeneous one but for asymptotically
large Rayleigh numbers it converges to the Strauss approximation. Thus for
small and intermediate values of the Rayleigh numbers one should use the
general functional and for vary large values of the Rayleigh numbers one can
use the functional of Strauss.
