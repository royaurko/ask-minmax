Possible formulations of the problem of cosmic rays acceleration in the
interstellar galactic medium are considered with the use of fractional
differential equations. The applied technique has been physically justified. A
Fermi result has been generalized to the case of the acceleration of particles
in shock waves in the supernovae remnants fractally distributed in the Galaxy.
