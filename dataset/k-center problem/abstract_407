Using the smallest eigenvalues of Hankel forms associated with a
multidimensional moment problem, we establish a condition equivalent to the
existence of a reproducing kernel. This result is a multivariate analogue of
Berg, Chen,and Ismail's 2002 result. We also present a class of measures for
which the existence of a reproducing kernel implies indeterminacy.
