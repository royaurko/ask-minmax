We find that chaos in the stochastic ionization problem develops through the
break-up of a sequence of noble tori. In addition to being very accurate, our
method of choice, the renormalization map, is ideally suited for analyzing
properties at criticality. Our computations of chaos thresholds agree closely
with the widely used empirical Chirikov criterion.
