We study the existence of sign-changing multiple interior spike solutions for
the following Dirichlet problem {equation*}\e^2\Delta
v-v+f(v)=0\hbox{in}\Omega,\quad v=0 \hbox{on}\partial \Omega,{equation*} where
$\Omega $ is a smooth and bounded domain of $\R^N$, $\e$ is a small positive
parameter, $f$ is a superlinear, subcritical and odd nonlinearity. In
particular we prove that if $\Omega$ has a plane of symmetry and its
intersection with the plane is a two-dimensional strictly convex domain, then,
provided that $k$ is even and sufficiently large, a $k$-peak solution exists
with alternate sign peaks aligned along a closed curve near a geodesic of
$\partial \Omega$.
