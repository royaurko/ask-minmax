We discuss generalizations of the well-known theorem of Hilbert that there is
no complete isometric immersion of the hyperbolic plane into Euclidean 3-space.
We show that this problem is expressed very naturally as the question of the
existence of certain homotheties of reflective submanifolds of a symmetric
space. As such, we conclude that the only other (non-compact) cases to which
this theorem could generalize are the problem of isometric immersions with flat
normal bundle of the hyperbolic space $H^n$ into a Euclidean space $E^{n+k}$,
$n \geq 2$, and the problem of Lagrangian isometric immersions of $H^n$ into
$\cc^n$, $n \geq 2$. Moreover, there are natural compact counterparts to these
problems, and for the compact cases we prove that the theorem does in fact
generalize: local embeddings exist, but complete immersions do not.
