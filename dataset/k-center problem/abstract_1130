We study the linear and nonlinear stability of relative equilibria in the
planar N-vortex problem, adapting the approach of Moeckel from the
corresponding problem in celestial mechanics. After establishing some general
theory, a topological approach is taken to show that for the case of positive
circulations, a relative equilibrium is linearly stable if and only if it is a
nondegenerate minimum of the Hamiltonian restricted to a level surface of the
angular impulse (moment of inertia). Using a criterion of Dirichlet's, this
implies that any linearly stable relative equilibrium with positive vorticities
is also nonlinearly stable. Two symmetric families, the rhombus and the
isosceles trapezoid, are analyzed in detail, with stable solutions found in
each case.
