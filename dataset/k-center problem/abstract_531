Several two-boundary problems are solved for a special L\'{e}vy process: the
Poisson process with an exponential component. The jumps of this process are
controlled by a homogeneous Poisson process, the positive jump size
distribution is arbitrary, while the distribution of the negative jumps is
exponential. Closed form expressions are obtained for the integral transforms
of the joint distribution of the first exit time from an interval and the value
of the overshoot through boundaries at the first exit time. Also the joint
distribution of the first entry time into the interval and the value of the
process at this time instant are determined in terms of integral transforms.
