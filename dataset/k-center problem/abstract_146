A Galerkin finite element method for the membrane elasticity problem on a
meshed surface is constructed by using two-dimensional elements extended into
three dimensions. The membrane finite element model is established using the
intrinsic approach suggested by [Delfour and Zol\'esio, A boundary differential
equation for thin shells. J. Differential Equations, 119(2):426--449, 1995].
