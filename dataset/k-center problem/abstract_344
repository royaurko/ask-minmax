We study properties of the Polonyi field in the renormalizable hidden sector
in supergravity models. It is shown that radiative corrections induce a sizable
coupling of the Polonyi field to gravitinos as well as raise its mass to an
intermediate scale. We find it serves a solution of the Polonyi problem and
show that the gravitino abundance produced by the Polonyi decay is not large.
It is also pointed out that soft supersymmetry breaking terms induced by this
hidden sector are very restricted.
