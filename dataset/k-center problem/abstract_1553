Cost-sensitive learning relies on the availability of a known and fixed cost
matrix. However, in some scenarios, the cost matrix is uncertain during
training, and re-train a classifier after the cost matrix is specified would
not be an option. For binary classification, this issue can be successfully
addressed by methods maximizing the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric.
Since the AUC can measure performance of base classifiers independent of cost
during training, and a larger AUC is more likely to lead to a smaller total
cost in testing using the threshold moving method. As an extension of AUC to
multi-class problems, MAUC has attracted lots of attentions and been widely
used. Although MAUC also measures performance of base classifiers independent
of cost, it is unclear whether a larger MAUC of classifiers is more likely to
lead to a smaller total cost. In fact, it is also unclear what kinds of
post-processing methods should be used in multi-class problems to convert base
classifiers into discrete classifiers such that the total cost is as small as
possible. In the paper, we empirically explore the relationship between MAUC
and the total cost of classifiers by applying two categories of post-processing
methods. Our results suggest that a larger MAUC is also beneficial.
Interestingly, simple calibration methods that convert the output matrix into
posterior probabilities perform better than existing sophisticated post
re-optimization methods.
