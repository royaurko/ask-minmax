Our main interest in this paper is to study some approximation problems for
classes of functions with mixed smoothness. We use technique, based on a
combination of results from hyperbolic cross approximation, which were obtained
in 1980s -- 1990s, and recent results on greedy approximation to obtain sharp
estimates for best $m$-term approximation with respect to the trigonometric
system. We give some observations on numerical integration and approximate
recovery of functions with mixed smoothness. We prove lower bounds, which show
that one cannot improve accuracy of sparse grids methods with $\asymp
2^nn^{d-1}$ points in the grid by adding $2^n$ arbitrary points. In case of
numerical integration these lower bounds provide best known lower bounds for
optimal cubature formulas and for sparse grids based cubature formulas.
