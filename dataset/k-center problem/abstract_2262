We prove energy estimates for linear $p$-evolution equations in weighted
Sobolev spaces under suitable assumptions on the behavior at infinity of the
coefficients with respect to the space variables. As a consequence we obtain
well posedness for the related Cauchy problem in the Schwartz spaces
$\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{S}'$.
