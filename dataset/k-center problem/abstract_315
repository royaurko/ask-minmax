We show that the recent experiments \cite{safar} reporting the onset of the
non-local conductivity in the vortex state of $YBaCuO$ single crystals indicate
the presence of a new liquid phase of vortices. This phase is intermediate
between the normal metal and the Abrikosov lattice. We use the mapping of the
vortex problem to the problem of bose liquid to determine theoretically the
properties of the proposed vortex liquid phase and compare them with the data.
