We give an elementary proof of Sarason's solvability criterion for the
Nevanlinna-Pick problem with boundary interpolation nodes and boundary target
values. We also give a concrete parametrization of all solutions of such a
problem. The proofs are based on a reduction method due to Julia and
Nevanlinna. Reduction of functions corresponds to Schur complementation of the
corresponding Pick matrices.
