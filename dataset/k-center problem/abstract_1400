We study the initial value problem for the wave equation and the
ultrahyperbolic equation for data posed on initial surface of mixed signature
(both spacelike and timelike). Under a nonlocal constraint, we show that the
Cauchy problem on codimension-one hypersurfaces has global unique solutions in
the Sobolev spaces $H^{m}$, thus it is well-posed. In contrast, we show that
the initial value problem on higher codimension hypersurfaces is ill-posed, at
least when specifying a finite number of derivatives of the data, due to the
failure of uniqueness. This is in contrast to a uniqueness result which Courant
and Hilbert deduce from Asgeirsson's mean value theorem, for which we give an
independent derivation. The proofs use Fourier synthesis and the Holmgren-John
uniqueness theorem.
