Approximation of entire functions by their pad\'e approximants has been
examined in the past. It is true that generically such an approximation holds.
However, examining this problem from another viewpoint, we obtain stronger
generic results on functions defined on simply connected domains or even open
sets of arbitrary connectivity.
