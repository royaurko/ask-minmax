In this paper, we attempt to resolve the dark matter problem in f(T) gravity.
Specifically, from our model we successfully obtain the flat rotation curves of
galaxies containing dark matter. Further, we obtain the density profile of dark
matter in galaxies. Comparison of our analytical results shows that our
torsion-based toy model for dark matter is in good agreement with empirical
data-based models. It shows that we can address the dark matter as an effect of
torsion of the space.
