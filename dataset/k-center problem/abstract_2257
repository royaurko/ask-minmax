Non-self-adjoint Schrodinger operators A which correspond to non-symmetric
zero-range potentials are investigated. For a given A, the description of
non-real eigenvalues, spectral singularities and exceptional points are
obtained; the possibility of interpretation of A as a self-adjoint operator in
a Krein space is studied, the problem of similarity of A to a self-adjoint
operator in a Hilbert space is solved.
