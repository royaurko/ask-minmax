Research on stabilization of coupled hyperbolic PDEs has been dominated by
the focus on pairs of counter-convecting ("heterodirectional") transport PDEs
with distributed local coupling and with controls at one or both boundaries. A
recent extension allows stabilization using only one control for a system
containing an arbitrary number of coupled transport PDEs that convect at
different speeds against the direction of the PDE whose boundary is actuated.
In this paper we present a solution to the fully general case, in which the
number of PDEs in either direction is arbitrary, and where actuation is applied
on only one boundary (to all the PDEs that convect downstream from that
boundary). To solve this general problem, we solve, as a special case, the
problem of control of coupled "homodirectional" hyperbolic linear PDEs, where
multiple transport PDEs convect in the same direction with arbitrary local
coupling. Our approach is based on PDE backstepping and yields solutions to
stabilization, by both full-state and observer-based output feedback,
trajectory planning, and trajectory tracking problems.
