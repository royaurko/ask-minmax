For a functional $\E$ and a peak selection that picks up a global maximum of
$\E$ on varying cones, we study the convergence up to a subsequence to a
critical point of the sequence generated by a mountain pass type algorithm.
Moreover, by carefully choosing stepsizes, we establish the convergence of the
whole sequence under a "localization" assumption on the critical point. We
illustrate our results with two problems: an indefinite Schr\"odinger equation
and a superlinear Schr\"odinger system.
