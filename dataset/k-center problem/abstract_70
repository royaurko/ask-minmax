One of the problems faced by a firm that sells certain goods is to determine
which is the number of products that must supply to maximize profits. In this
article, we give an answer to this problem of economic interest. To solve it we
use the theorem "unconscious statistician". The proposed problem is a
generalization of the results obtained by Stirzaker and Kupferman where the
contributors do not present a situation where the sale of a quantity from some goods
is constrained by the marketing of another. In addition, the described
procedure is simple and can be successfully applied to any number of goods. The
obtained results can be easily put into practice.
