It is shown that the Benney system is equivalent to a one body classical
dynamical problem in which the interaction potential is a functional of the
action function. The general solution of this equation is responsible for the
general solution of the Benney system. Some particular solutions of the
selfconsistent Hamilton-Jacobi equation arising in this investigation are
presented in explicit form.
