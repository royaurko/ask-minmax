The so-called "phenomenological" kinetic equation for one-pair density
operator for spin-selective reactions is defended. We derive this equation from
the kinetic equation for density operator of all pairs which are treated as
singlet and triplet bosons. There presented some reasons for inconsistency of
measurement-like approach to the problem.
