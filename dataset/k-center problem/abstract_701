Recently, the $k$-normal element over finite fields is defined and
characterized by Huczynska et al.. In this paper, the characterization of
$k$-normal elements, by using to give a generalization of Schwartz's theorem,
which allows us to check if an element is a normal element, is obtained. In
what follows, in respect of the problem of existence of a primitive 1-normal
element in $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, for all $q$ and $n$, had
been stated by Huczynska et al., it is shown that, in general, this problem is
not satisfied. Finally, a recursive method for constructing $1$-normal
polynomials of higher degree from a given $1$-normal polynomial over
$\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ is given.
