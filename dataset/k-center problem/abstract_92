We consider constraint satisfaction problems parameterized above or below
tight bounds. One example is MaxSat parameterized above $m/2$: given a CNF
formula $F$ with $m$ clauses, decide whether there is a truth assignment that
satisfies at least $m/2+k$ clauses, where $k$ is the parameter. Among other
problems we deal with are MaxLin2-AA (given a system of linear equations over
$\mathbb{F}_2$ in which each equation has a positive integral weight, decide
whether there is an assignment to the variables that satisfies equations of
total weight at least $W/2+k$, where $W$ is the total weight of all equations),
Max-$r$-Lin2-AA (the same as MaxLin2-AA, but each equation has at most $r$
variables, where $r$ is a constant) and Max-$r$-Sat-AA (given a CNF formula $F$
with $m$ clauses in which each clause has at most $r$ literals, decide whether
there is a truth assignment satisfying at least $\sum_{i=1}^m(1-2^{r_i})+k$
clauses, where $k$ is the parameter, $r_i$ is the number of literals in Clause
$i$, and $r$ is a constant). We also consider Max-$r$-CSP-AA, a natural
generalization of both Max-$r$-Lin2-AA and Max-$r$-Sat-AA, order (or,
permutation) constraint satisfaction problems of arities 2 and 3 parameterized
above the average value and some other problems related to MaxSat. We discuss
results, both polynomial kernels and parameterized algorithms, obtained for the
problems mainly in the last few years as well as some open questions.
