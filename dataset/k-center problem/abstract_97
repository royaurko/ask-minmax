The least-square regression problems or inverse problems have been widely
studied in many fields such as compressive sensing, signal processing, and
image processing. To solve this kind of ill-posed problems, a regularization
term (i.e., regularizer) should be introduced, under the assumption that the
solutions have some specific properties, such as sparsity and group sparsity.
Widely used regularizers include the $\ell_1$ norm, total variation (TV)
semi-norm, and so on.
  Recently, a new regularization term with overlapping group sparsity has been
considered. Majorization minimization iteration method or variable duplication
methods are often applied to solve them. However, there have been no direct
methods for solve the relevant problems because of the difficulty of
overlapping. In this paper, we proposed new explicit shrinkage formulas for one
class of these relevant problems, whose regularization terms have translation
invariant overlapping groups. Moreover, we apply our results in TV deblurring
and denoising with overlapping group sparsity. We use alternating direction
method of multipliers to iterate solve it. Numerical results also verify the
validity and effectiveness of our new explicit shrinkage formulas.
