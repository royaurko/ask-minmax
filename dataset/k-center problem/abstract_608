We study bifurcation from a branch of trivial solutions of semilinear
elliptic Dirichlet boundary value problems on star-shaped domains, where the
bifurcation parameter is introduced by shrinking the domain. In the proof of
our main theorem we obtain in addition a special case of an index theorem due
to S. Smale.
