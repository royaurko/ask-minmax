The p-values are often implicitly used as a measure of evidence for the
hypotheses of the tests. This practice has been analyzed with different
approaches. It is generally accepted for the one-sided hypothesis problem, but
it is often criticized for the two-sided hypothesis problem. We analyze this
practice with a new approach to statistical inference. First we select good
decision rules without using a loss function, we call them experts. Then we
define a probability distribution on the space of experts. The measure of
evidence for a hypothesis is the inductive probability of experts that decide
this hypothesis.
