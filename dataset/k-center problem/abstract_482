In this work, the benefits of the phase fitting technique are embedded in
high order discrete Lagrangian integrators. The proposed methodology creates
integrators with zero phase lag in a test Lagrangian in a similar way used in
phase fitted numerical methods for ordinary differential equations. Moreover,
an efficient method for frequency evaluation is proposed based on the
eccentricities of the moving objects. The results show that the new method
dramatically improves the accuracy and total energy behaviour in Hamiltonian
systems. Numerical tests for the 2-body problem with ultra high eccentricity up
to 0.99 for 1000000 periods and to the Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian system with
chaotic behaviour, show the efficiency of the proposed approach.
