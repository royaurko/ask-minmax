We shall use a Renormalization Group (RG) scheme in order to prove the
classical KAM result in the case of a non-analytic perturbation (the latter
will be assumed to have continuous derivatives up to a sufficiently large
order). We shall proceed by solving a sequence of problems in which the
perturbations are analytic approximations of the original one. We shall finally
show that the sequence of the approximate solutions will converge to a
differentiable solution of the original problem.
