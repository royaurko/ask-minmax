We give a modification of I. Klep and M. Schweighofer algebraic reformulation
of Connes' embedding problem by considering *-algebra of the countably
generated free group. This allows to consider only quadratic polynomials in
unitary generators instead of arbitrary polynomials in self-adjoint generators.
