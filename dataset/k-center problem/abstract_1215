The closed form solution for the geodesics of classical particles in SdS
space are obtained in terms of hyperelliptic modular functions and multiple
hypergeometric functions. The closed form solution for the five roots of the
fifth degree polynomial are found giving the branch places on the genus two
Riemann surface. The `Inversion Problem', for the genus two hyperelliptic
integral is solved in a closed form. Thus a couple of mathematical problems
that have been around for a couple of centuries are solved. The solution is
important in astrophysical applications of measuring the cosmological constant.
