Different approaches to the quark-lepton mass problem are reviewed. The
infrared quasifixed point predictions for the top quark mass are discussed for
the Standard Model and its minimal supersymmetric extension, with particular
reference to the large $\tan\beta$ scenario and Yukawa unification. Mass matrix
ans\"{a}tze with texture zeros at the unification scale are also considered. It
is argued that the hierarchy of fermion masses and mixing angles requires the
existence of an approximately conserved chiral flavour symmetry beyond the
Standard Model.
