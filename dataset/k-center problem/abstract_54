We prove a general lemma for deriving contraction rates for linear inverse
problems with non parametric nonconjugate priors. We then apply it to Gaussian
priors and obtain minimax rates in mildly ill-posed case. This includes, for
example, Meyer wavelet basis with Gaussian priors in the {\it deconvolution
problem}. The result for severely ill-posed problems is derived only when the
prior is sufficiently smooth. The bases for which our method works is dense in
the space of all bases in a sense which shall be described in this paper.
