We show that for any free Araki-Woods factor $\mathcal{M} = \Gamma(H_\R,
U_t)"$ of type ${\rm III_1}$, the bicentralizer of the free quasi-free state
$\varphi_U$ is trivial. Using Haagerup's Theorem, it follows that there always
exists a faithful normal state $\psi$ on $\mathcal{M}$ such that
$(\mathcal{M}^\psi)' \cap \mathcal{M} = \C$.
