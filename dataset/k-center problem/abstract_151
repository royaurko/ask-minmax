A novel, exact, theoretical method for the study of the excited states of a
system is presented. It is demonstrated how to transform the excited state
problem of one Hamiltonian into the ground state problem of an auxiliary one.
From this, a new exact density functional suitable for excited states is
constructed. These results make the excited states of a system accessible
through all ground state theoretical techniques.
