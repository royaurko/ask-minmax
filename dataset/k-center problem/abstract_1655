I discuss the problem of phase separation in cuprates from the point of view
of the Landau theory of Fermi liquids. I calculate the rate of growth of
unstable regions for the hydrodymanics and collisionless limit and, in presence
of long range Coulomb interactions, the size of these regions. These are
analytic results valid for any strength of the Landau parameters.
