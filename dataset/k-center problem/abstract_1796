We construct normal hypersurfaces whose local cohomology modules have
infinitely many associated primes. These include unique factorization domains
of characteristic zero with rational singularities, as well as F-regular unique
factorization domains of positive characteristic. As a consequence, we answer a
question on the associated primes of Frobenius powers of ideals, which arose
from the localization problem in tight closure theory.
