We derive an explicit method for reconstructing singularities of the initial
data in a thermoacoustic tomography problem, in the case of variable sound
speed and limited boundary data. In order to obtain this explicit formula we
assume the metric induced by the sound speed does not have conjugate points
inside the region to be observed.
