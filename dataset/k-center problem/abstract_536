Testing a graph on 2-vertex- and 2-edge-connectivity are two fundamental
algorithmic graph problems. For both problems, different linear-time algorithms
with simple implementations are known. Here, an even simpler linear-time
algorithm is presented that computes a structure from which both the 2-vertex-
and 2-edge-connectivity of a graph can be easily "read off". The algorithm
computes all bridges and cut vertices of the input graph in the same time.
