A local convergence rate is established for an orthogonal collocation method
based on Radau quadrature applied to an unconstrained optimal control problem.
If the continuous problem has a sufficiently smooth solution and the
Hamiltonian satisfies a strong convexity condition, then the discrete problem
possesses a local minimizer in a neighborhood of the continuous solution, and
as the number of collocation points increases, the discrete solution
convergences exponentially fast in the sup-norm to the continuous solution. An
earlier paper analyzes an orthogonal collocation method based on Gauss
quadrature, where neither end point of the problem domain is a collocation
point. For the Radau quadrature scheme, one end point is a collocation point.
