The problem of separating structured information representing phenomena of
differing natures is considered. A structure is assumed to be independent of
the others if can be represented in a complementary subspace. When the
concomitant subspaces are well separated the problem is readily solvable by a
linear technique. Otherwise, the linear approach fails to correctly
discriminate the required information. Hence, a non extensive approach is
proposed. The resulting nonlinear technique is shown to be suitable for dealing
with cases that cannot be tackled by the linear one.
