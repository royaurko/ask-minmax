In this note, we solve an inverse spectral problem for a class of finite band
symmetric matrices. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a matrix
valued function to be a spectral function of the corresponding operator and
give an algorithm for recovering the matrix from this spectral function. Our
approach to the inverse problem is based on the rational interpolation theory
developed in a previous paper.
