A hierarchical interval subdivision is shown to lead to a $p$-adic encoding
of image data. This allows in the case of the relative pose problem in computer
vision and photogrammetry to derive equations having 2-adic numbers as
coefficients, and to use Hensel's lifting method to their solution. This method
is applied to the linear and non-linear equations coming from eight, seven or
five point correspondences. An inherent property of the method is its
robustness.
