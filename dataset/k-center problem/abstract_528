In this paper, we consider the initial boundary value problem for the
three-dimensional viscous primitive equations of large-scale moist atmosphere
which are used to describe the turbulent behavior of long-term weather
prediction and climate changes. First, we obtain the existence and uniqueness
of global strong solutions of the problem. Second, by studying the long-time
behavior of strong solutions, we construct a (weak) universal attractor which
captures all the trajectories.
