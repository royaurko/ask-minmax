On an example of the open nonlinear electrodynamic system - transverse
non-homogeneous, isotropic, nonmagnetic, linearly polarized, nonlinear (a
Kerr-like dielectric nonlinearity) dielectric layer, the algorithms of solution
of the diffraction problem of a plane wave on the nonlinear object and the
results of the numerical analysis of the nonlinear problem are shown. The
nonlinear diffraction problem reduced the solutions of the systems of the
non-homogeneous nonlinear equations of the second kind on the base of the
iterative schemes. The results of the numerical analysis of the diffraction
problem of a plane wave on the nonlinear object are shown. The effects:
non-uniform shift of resonant frequency of the diffraction characteristics of a
nonlinear dielectric layer; increase of the angle of the transparency of the
nonlinear layer at growth of intensity of the field are found out.
