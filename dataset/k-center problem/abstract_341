The problem of the hierarchy of lifetimes of charmed hadrons is reviewed. The
QCD-based theory of preasymptotic effects in inclusive weak decays dating back
to the beginning of the eighties is now entering its mature phase. Combining
recent and old results we argue that the observed hierarchy reflects most
intimate features of the hadronic structure. The problem of a wide spread of
lifetimes of charmed hadrons is addressed.
  We speculate on what is to be expected from QCD to provide the observed
pattern. A number of predictions is given for the hierarchy of lifetimes in the
family of the beautiful hadrons.
