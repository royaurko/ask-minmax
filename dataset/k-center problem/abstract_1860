The model for Orr--Sommerfeld equation with quadratic profile on the finite
interval is considered. The behavior of the spectrum of this problem is
completely investigated for large Reynolds numbers. The limit curves are found
to which the eigenvalues concentrate and the counting eigenvalue functions
along these curves are obtained.
