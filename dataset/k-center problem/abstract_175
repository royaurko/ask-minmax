We give a solution to the equivalence and the embedding problems for smooth
CR-submanifolds of complex spaces (and, more generally, for abstract
CR-manifolds) in terms of complete differential systems in jet bundles
satisfied by all CR-equivalences or CR-embeddings respectively (local and
global). For the equivalence problem, the manifolds are assumed to be of finite
type and finitely nondegenerate. These are higher order generalizations of the
corresponding nondegeneracy conditions for the Levi form. It is shown by a
simple example that these nondegeneracy conditions cannot be even slightly
relaxed to more general known conditions. In particular, for essentially finite
hypersurfaces in $\C^2$, such a complete system may not exist in general. For
the embedding problem, the source manifold is assumed to be of finite type and
the embeddings to be finitely nondegenerate. Situations are given, where the
last condition is automatically satisfied by all CR-embeddings.
