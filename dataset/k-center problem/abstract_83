The Joint Crossing Number problem asks for a simultaneous embedding of two
disjoint graphs into one surface such that the number of edge crossings
(between the two graphs) is minimized. It was introduced by Negami in 2001 in
connection with diagonal flips in triangulations of surfaces, and subsequently
investigated in a general form for small-genus surfaces. We prove that all of
the commonly considered variants of this problem are NP-hard already in the
orientable surface of genus 6, by a reduction from a special variant of the
anchored crossing number problem of Cabello and Mohar.
