Extraction of hydrofluoric acid (HF) from oils is a drastically important
problem in petroleum industry, since HF causes quick corrosion of pipe lines
and brings severe health problems to humanity. Some ionic liquids (ILs)
constitute promising scavenger agents thanks to strong binding to polar
compounds and tunability. PM7-MD simulations and hybrid density functional
theory are employed here to consider HF capture ability of ILs. Discussing the
effects and impacts of the cation and the anion separately and together, I will
evaluate performance of imidazolium acetate and outline systematic search
guidelines for efficient adsorption and extraction of HF.
