We examine in a generic context how the $\mu$ problem can be resolved by
means of a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry. We then focus on the new scheme
based on a discrete gauge R symmetry which is spontaneously broken by
nonperturbative hidden sector dynamics triggering supersymmetry breaking also.
The possibility to suppress the dangerous baryon and/or lepton number violating
interactions by means of this discrete R symmetry is examined also together
with some phenomenological consequences.
