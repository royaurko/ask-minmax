We study quasilinear evolutionary partial integro-differential equations of
second order which include time fractional $p$-Laplace equations of time order
less than one. By means of suitable energy estimates and De Giorgi's iteration
technique we establish results asserting the global boundedness of
appropriately defined weak solutions of these problems. We also show that a
maximum principle is valid for such equations.
