In this paper, we provide all information to participate to the Second
International Nurse Rostering Competition (INRC-II). First, we describe the
problem formulation, which, differently from INRC-I, is a multi-stage
procedure. Second, we illustrate all the necessary infrastructure do be used
together with the participant's solver, including the testbed, the file
formats, and the validation/simulation tools. Finally, we state the rules of
the competition. All update-to-date information about the competition is
available at http://mobiz.vives.be/inrc2/.
