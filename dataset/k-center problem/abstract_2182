We discuss recent results obtained by the contributors, regarding the analysis of
the magneto-geostrophic equation: a model proposed by Moffat and Loper to study
the geodynamo and turbulence in the Earth's fluid core. We conclude this review
by indicating some open problems around the MG equation, that remain to be
addressed in the future.
