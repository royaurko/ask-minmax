Let $(M,g)$ be a $m$-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold without
boundary. Assume $\kappa\in C^2(M)$ is such that $-\Delta_g+\kappa$ is
coercive. We prove the existence of a solution to the supercritical problems $$
-\Delta_gu+\kappa u= u^p,\ u>0\quad\hbox{in}\
(M,g)\quad\hbox{and}\quad-\Delta_gu+\kappa u=\lambda e^u\quad\hbox{in}\ (M,g)
$$ which concentrate s along a $(m-1)-$dimensional submanifold of $M$ as
$p\to\infty$ and $\lambda\to0$, respectively, under suitable symmetry
assumptions on the manifold $M$.
