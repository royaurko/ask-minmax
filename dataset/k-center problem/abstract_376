The main goal of this paper is to give the first examples of equivariant
aspherical Poincare complexes, that are not realized by group actions on closed
aspherical manifolds $M$. These will also provide new counterexamples to the
Nielsen realization problem about lifting homotopy actions of finite groups to
honest group actions. Our examples show that one cannot guarantee that a given
action of a finitely generated group $\pi$ on Euclidean space extends to an
action of $\Pi$, a group containing $\pi$ as a subgroup of finite index, even
when all the torsion of $\Pi$ lives in $\pi$.
