We investigate the fine-tuning problem in the Standard Model and show that
Higgs boson and top quark masses consistent with current experimental bounds
cannot be obtained unless one extends the particle spectrum. A minimal
extension which achieves this involves addition of a singlet real scalar and
one generation of vectorlike fermions. We show that this leads to a
phenomenologically viable prediction for the mass of the Standard Model Higgs
boson.
