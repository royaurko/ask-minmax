In this article, we consider linear hyperbolic Initial and Boundary Value
Problems (IBVP) in a rectangle (or possibly curvilinear polygonal domains) in
both the constant and variable coefficients cases. We use semigroup method
instead of Fourier analysis to achieve the well-posedness of the linear
hyperbolic system, and we find by diagonalization that there are only two
elementary modes in the system which we call hyperbolic and elliptic modes. The
hyperbolic system in consideration is either symmetric or
Friedrichs-symmetrizable.
