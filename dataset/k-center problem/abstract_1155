We deal with two dynamical systems associated with a Riemannian manifold with
boundary. The first one is a system governed by the scalar wave equation, the
second is governed by the Maxwell equations. Both of the systems are controlled
from the boundary. The inverse problem is to recover the manifold via the
relevant measurements at the boundary (inverse data).
  We show that the inverse data determine a C*-algebras, whose (topologized)
spectra are identical to the manifold. By this, to recover the manifold is to
determine a proper algebra from the inverse data, find its spectrum, and
provide the spectrum with a Riemannian structure.
  The paper develops an algebraic version of the boundary control method, which
is an approach to inverse problems based on their relations to control theory.
