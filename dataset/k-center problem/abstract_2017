The Diophantine Equation Hard Problem (DEHP) is a potential cryptographic
problem on the Diophantine equation $U=\sum \limits_{i=1}^n {V_i x_{i}}$. A
proper implementation of DEHP would render an attacker to search for private
parameters amongst the exponentially many solutions. However, an improper
implementation would provide an attacker exponentially many choices to solve
the DEHP. The AA\,$_{\beta}$-cryptosystem is an asymmetric cryptographic scheme
that utilizes this concept together with the factorization problem of two large
primes and is implemented only by using the multiplication operation for both
encryption and decryption. With this simple mathematical structure, it would
have low computational requirements and would enable communication devices with
low computing power to deploy secure communication procedures efficiently.
