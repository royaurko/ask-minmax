An extremely precise global symmetry is necessary in the Peccei--Quinn
solution to the strong CP problem. Such symmetry arises when colored chiral
fermions are localized in an internal space. We present a supersymmetric model
that incorporates the above mechanism. Extra colored chiral multiplets around
the supersymmetry-breaking scale are a generic prediction of the supersymetric
model.
