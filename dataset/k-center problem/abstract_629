The Hessian Topology is a subject having interesting relations with several
areas, for instance, di?erential geometry, implicit di?erential equations,
analysis and singularity theory. In this article we study the problem of
realization of a real plane curve as the Hessian curve of a smooth function.
The plane curves we consider are constituted either by only outer ovals or
inner ovals. We prove that some of such curves are realizable as Hessian
curves.
