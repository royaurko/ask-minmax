We consider surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature immersed in 3-dimensional
manifolds, and we strengthen the compactness result of Labourie in the case
where the ambient manifold is 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. This allows us to
prove results of existence of solutions to the asymptotic Plateau problem, as
defined by Labourie, and the continuous dependence of these solutions on the
data.
