The problem of finding completely positive matrices with equal cp-rank and
rank is considered. We give some easy-to-check sufficient conditions on the
entries of a doubly nonnegative matrix for it to be completely positive with
equal cp-rank and rank. An algorithm is also presented to show its efficiency.
