We give an overview on the quantization problem for fractal measures,
including some related results and methods which have been developed in the
last decades. Based on the work of Graf and Luschgy, we propose a three-step
procedure to estimate the quantization errors. We survey some recent progress,
which makes use of this procedure, including the quantization for self-affine
measures, Markov-type measures on graph-directed fractals, and product measures
on multiscale Moran sets. Several open problems are mentioned.
