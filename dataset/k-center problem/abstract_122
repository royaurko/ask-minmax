Even though the disk embedding theorem is not available in dimension 4 for
free fundamental groups, some surgery problems may be shown to have topological
solutions. We prove that surgery problems may be solved if one considers closed
4-manifolds and the intersection pairing is extended from the integers, and
prove a related splitting result.
