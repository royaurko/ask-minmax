I review the construction of the Exact Parity or Mirror Matter Model and
explain how it solves the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems. The
oscillation driven relic neutrino asymmetry amplification phenomenon is then
used to demonstrate the consistency of the model with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.
