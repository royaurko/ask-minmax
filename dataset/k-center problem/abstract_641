We define the fibre-restricted Gottlieb group with respect to a fibration
$\xi :X\to E\to Y$ in CW complexes. It is a subgroup of the Gottlieb group of
$X$. When $X$ and $E$ are finite simply connected, its rationalized model is
given by the arguments of derivations of Sullivan models based on F\'{e}lix,
Lupton and Smith \cite{FLS}. We consider the realization problem of groups in a
Gottlieb group as fibre-restricted Gottlieb groups in rational homotoy theory.
Especially we define an invariant named as (Gottlieb) depth of $X$ over $Y$. In
particular, when $Y=BS^1$, it is related to the rational toral rank of $X$.
