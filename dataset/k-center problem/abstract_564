The Dirac-Morse problem are investigated within the framework of an
approximation to the term proportional to $1/r^2$ in the view of the
position-dependent mass formalism. The energy eigenvalues and corresponding
wave functions are obtained by using the parametric generalization of the
Nikiforov-Uvarov method for any $\kappa$-value. It is also studied the
approximate energy eigenvalues, and corresponding wave functions in the case of
the constant-mass for pseudospin, and spin cases, respectively.
