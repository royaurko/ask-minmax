The classical one-phase Stefan problem (without surface tension) allows for a
continuum of steady state solutions, given by an arbitrary (but sufficiently
smooth) domain together with zero temperature. We prove global-in-time
stability of such steady states, assuming a sufficient degree of smoothness on
the initial domain, but without any a priori restriction on the convexity
properties of the initial shape. This is an extension of our previous result
[28] in which we studied nearly spherical shapes.
