In a previous study, we obtained the algebro-geometric solutions and $n$-dark
solitons of Forkas-Lenells (FL) hierarchy using algebro-geometric method.
  In this paper, we construct physically relevant classes of solutions for FL
hierarchy by studying the reality conditions for $q=\pm \bar{r}$ based on the
idea of Vinikov's homological basis.
