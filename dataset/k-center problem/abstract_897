We consider the problems of determining the feasibility of a linear
congruence, producing a solution to a linear congruence, and finding a spanning
set for the nullspace of an integer matrix, where each problem is considered
modulo an arbitrary constant k>1. These problems are known to be complete for
the logspace modular counting classes {Mod_k L} = {coMod_k L} in special case
that k is prime (Buntrock et al, 1992). By considering variants of standard
logspace function classes --- related to #L and functions computable by UL
machines, but which only characterize the number of accepting paths modulo k
--- we show that these problems of linear algebra are also complete for
{coMod_k L} for any constant k>1.
  Our results are obtained by defining a class of functions FUL_k which are low
for {Mod_k L} and {coMod_k L} for k>1, using ideas similar to those used in the
case of k prime in (Buntrock et al, 1992) to show closure of Mod_k L under NC^1
reductions (including {Mod_k L} oracle reductions). In addition to the results
above, we briefly consider the relationship of the class FUL_k for arbitrary
moduli k to the class {F.coMod_k L} of functions whose output symbols are
verifiable by {coMod_k L} algorithms; and consider what consequences such a
comparison may have for oracle closure results of the form {Mod_k L}^{Mod_k L}
= {Mod_k L} for composite k.
