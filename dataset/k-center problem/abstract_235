We consider the constrained graph alignment problem which has applications in
biological network analysis studies. Given two input graphs G1;G2, a pair of
vertex mappings induces an edge conservation if the vertex pairs are adjacent
in their respective graphs. In general terms the goal is to provide a
one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the input graphs such that edge
conservation is maximized. However the allowed mappings are restricted. Let m1
(m2) denote the number of G2-vertices (G1-vertices) that each G1-vertex
(G2-vertex) is allowed to be mapped to. All problem versions considered herein
assume m2 = 1. We provide a polynomial time solution for a special case where
G1 is acyclic. We show that the problem is NP-complete even under the setting
m1 = 2. We provide several structural properties that lead to polynomial-time
approximation algorithms under the same setting. Relaxing the constraint on m1,
with further structural properties we provide several additional approximation
algorithms for the problem.
