The breather is a vibrating multifermion bound state of the massless
Gross-Neveu model, originally found by Dashen, Hasslacher and Neveu in the
large N limit. We exhibit the salient features of this state and confirm that
it solves the relativistic time-dependent Hartree-Fock equations. We then solve
the scattering problem of two breathers with arbitrary internal parameters and
velocities, generalizing an ansatz recently developed for the baryon-baryon
scattering problem in the same model. The exact analytical solution is given
and illustrated with a few examples.
