This paper is a presentation, where we compute the HOMFLYPT Skein module of
singular links in the 3-sphere. This calculation is based on some results
previously proved by Rabenda and the contributor on Markov traces on singular Hecke
algebras, as well as on classical techniques that allow to pass from the
framework of Markov traces on Hecke algebras to the framework of HOMFLYPT Skein
modules. Some open problems on singular Hecke algebras are also presented.
