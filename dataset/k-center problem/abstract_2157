The Cauchy problem for the semi-relativistic Schr\"odinger-Poisson system of
equations is studied in ${\mathbb R}^n$, $n\geq 1$, for a wide class of
nonlocal interactions. Furthermore, the asymptotic behavior of the solution as
the mass tends to infinity is rigorously discussed, which corresponds to a
non-relativistic limit.
