We consider linear inverse problems where the solution is assumed to have a
sparse expansion on an arbitrary pre-assigned orthonormal basis. We prove that
replacing the usual quadratic regularizing penalties by weighted l^p-penalties
on the coefficients of such expansions, with 1 < or = p < or =2, still
regularizes the problem. If p < 2, regularized solutions of such l^p-penalized
problems will have sparser expansions, with respect to the basis under
consideration. To compute the corresponding regularized solutions we propose an
iterative algorithm that amounts to a Landweber iteration with thresholding (or
nonlinear shrinkage) applied at each iteration step. We prove that this
algorithm converges in norm. We also review some potential applications of this
method.
