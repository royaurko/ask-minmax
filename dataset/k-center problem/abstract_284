We consider the problem of evaluating certain exponential sums. These sums
take the form $\sum_{x_1,...,x_n \in Z_N} e^{f(x_1,...,x_n) {2 \pi i / N}} $,
where each x_i is summed over a ring Z_N, and f(x_1,...,x_n) is a multivariate
polynomial with integer coefficients. We show that the sum can be evaluated in
polynomial time in n and log N when f is a quadratic polynomial. This is true
even when the factorization of N is unknown. Previously, this was known for a
prime modulus N. On the other hand, for very specific families of polynomials
of degree \ge 3, we show the problem is #P-hard, even for any fixed prime or
prime power modulus. This leads to a complexity dichotomy theorem - a complete
classification of each problem to be either computable in polynomial time or
#P-hard - for a class of exponential sums. These sums arise in the
classifications of graph homomorphisms and some other counting CSP type
problems, and these results lead to complexity dichotomy theorems. For the
polynomial-time algorithm, Gauss sums form the basic building blocks. For the
hardness results, we prove group-theoretic necessary conditions for
tractability. These tests imply that the problem is #P-hard for even very
restricted families of simple cubic polynomials over fixed modulus N.
