A new method for combining QCD matrix elements and parton showers in Monte
Carlo simulations of hadronic final states is outlined. The aim is to provide
at least a leading-order description of all hard multi-jet configurations
together with jet fragmentation to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, while
avoiding the most serious problems of double counting.
