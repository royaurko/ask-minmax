The energy-impulse flow of electromagnetic field, produced by the arbitrary
moving charged particle, through the sphere of large radius is calculated. The
result formulae are used in problem of radiation produced by hyperbolically
moving particle and the problem of the synchrotron radiation energy loss. The
energy-impulse radiated by a moving charged particle is shown to be not an
invariant 4-tensor, for this reason calculation methods based on change of
reference frame are not correct.
