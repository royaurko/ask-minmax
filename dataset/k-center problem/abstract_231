Problems in exponential asymptotics are typically characterized by divergence
of the associated asymptotic expansion in the form of a factorial divided by a
power. In this paper, we demonstrate that in certain classes of problems that
involve coalescing singularities, a more general type of exponential-over-power
divergence must be used. As a model example, we study the water waves produced
by flow past an obstruction such as a surface-piercing ship. In the low speed
or low Froude limit, the resultant water waves are exponentially small, and
their formation is attributed to the singularities in the geometry of the
obstruction. However, in cases where the singularities are closely spaced, the
usual asymptotic theory fails. We present both a general asymptotic framework
for handling such problems of coalescing singularities, and provide numerical
and asymptotic results for particular examples.
