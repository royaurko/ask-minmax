This paper addresses the problem of forbidden states of non safe Petri Net
(PN) modelling discrete events systems. To prevent the forbidden states, it is
possible to use conditions or predicates associated with transitions.
Generally, there are many forbidden states, thus many complex conditions are
associated with the transitions. A new idea for computing predicates in non
safe Petri nets will be presented. Using this method, we can construct a
maximally permissive controller if it exists.
