We discuss the effect of electromagnetic environment on laboratory
measurements of the nuclear fusion reactions of astrophysical interest. The
radiation field is eliminated using the path integral formalism in order to
obtain the influence functional, which we evaluate in the semi-classical
approximation. We show that enhancement of the tunneling probability due to the
radiation correction is extremely small and does not resolve the longstanding
problem that the observed electron screening effect is significantly larger
than theoretical predictions.
