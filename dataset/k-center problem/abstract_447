We propose a natural solution to the mu problem in gauge mediation. It relies
on the logarithmic dependence of the effective Kahler potential on the
messenger threshold superfield X. Thus, mu and Bmu naturally arise at one and
two loops, respectively. Moreover B has the same phase as the gaugino mass and
the supersymmetric CP problem is solved as well.
