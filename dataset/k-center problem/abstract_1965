A question of Avramov and Foxby concerning injective dimension of complexes
is settled in the affirmative for the class of noetherian rings. A key step in
the proof is to recast the problem on hand into one about the homotopy category
of complexes of injective modules. Analogous results for flat dimension and
projective dimension are also established.
