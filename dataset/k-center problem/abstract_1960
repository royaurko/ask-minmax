The problem of structured noise suppression is addressed by i)modelling the
subspaces hosting the components of the signal conveying the information and
ii)applying a non-extensive nonlinear technique for effecting the right
separation. Although the approach is applicable to all situations satisfying
the hypothesis of the proposed framework, this work is motivated by a
particular scenario, namely, the cancellation of low frequency noise in
broadband seismic signals.
