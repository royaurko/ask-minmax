We study the high frequency limit for the dissipative Helmholtz equation when
the source term concentrates on a submanifold of R^n. We prove that the
solution has a unique semi-classical measure, which is precisely described in
terms of the classical properties of the problem. This result is already known
when the micro-support of the source is bounded, we now consider the general
case.
