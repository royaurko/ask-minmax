We study the semiclassical behavior of the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger
equation in 1+1-dimensions under discontinuous "barrier" data and we describe
the violent oscillations arising in terms of theta functions. The construction
of proofs relies on the analysis of the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.
