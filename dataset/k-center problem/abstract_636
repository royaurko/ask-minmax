We provide an asymptotic analysis of linear transport problems in the
diffusion limit under minimal regularity assumptions on the domain, the
coefficients, and the data. The weak form of the limit equation is derived and
the convergence of the solution in the $L^2$ norm is established without
artificial regularity requirements. This is important to be able to deal with
problems involving realistic geometries and heterogeneous media. In a second
step we prove the usual $O(\varepsilon)$ convergence rates under very mild
additional assumptions. The generalization of the results to convergence in
$L^p$ with $p \ne 2$ and some limitations are discussed.
