Jing Run Chen proved in 1966 that $p+2$ has at most two prime factors for
infinitely many primes $p$. However, due to the parity problem we do not know
whether $p+2$ has an odd (or even) number of prime factors infinitely often. In
the present work it is proved that $p+d$ has an odd number of prime factors for
at least one value of d=2,4,...16.
