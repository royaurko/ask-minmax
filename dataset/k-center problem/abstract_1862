The definition of the conditional probability is very important in the theory
of the probability. This definition is based on the fact, that random events
can be simultaneously measurable. This paper deal with the problem of
conditioning for such random events, which are not simultaneously measurable.
This paper defines conditional states as convex combination of special states.
