Compressed Sensing (CS) is an effective approach to reduce the required
number of samples for reconstructing a sparse signal in an a priori basis, but
may suffer severely from the issue of basis mismatch. In this paper we study
the problem of simultaneously recovering multiple spectrally-sparse signals
that are supported on the same frequencies lying arbitrarily on the unit
circle. We propose an atomic norm minimization problem, which can be regarded
as a continuous counterpart of the discrete CS formulation and be solved
efficiently via semidefinite programming. Through numerical experiments, we
show that the number of samples per signal may be further reduced by harnessing
the joint sparsity pattern of multiple signals.
