In recent years, the italian theoretical Nuclear Physics community has played
a leading role in the development of a unified approach, allowing for a
consistent and fully quantitative description of the nuclear response to
electromagnetic and weak probes. In this paper I review the main achievements
in both fields, point out some of the open problems, and outline the most
promising prospects.
