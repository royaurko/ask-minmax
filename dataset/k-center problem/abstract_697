The Maxwell electromagnetic and the Lorentz type force equations are derived
in the framework of the R. Feynman proper time paradigm and the related vacuum
field theory approach. The electron inertia problem is analyzed within the
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms and the related pressure-energy
compensation principle. The modified Abraham- Lorentz damping radiation force
is derived, the electromagnetic elctron mass origin is argued.
