In this paper we present a set of results on the integration and on the
symmetries of the lattice potential Korteweg-de Vries (lpKdV) equation. Using
its associated spectral problem we construct the soliton solutions and the Lax
technique enables us to provide infinite sequences of generalized symmetries.
Finally, using a discrete symmetry of the lpKdV equation, we construct a large
class of non-autonomous generalized symmetries.
