Given a linear recurrence sequence (LRS) over the integers, the Positivity
Problem} asks whether all terms of the sequence are positive. We show that, for
simple LRS (those whose characteristic polynomial has no repeated roots) of
order 9 or less, Positivity is decidable, with complexity in the Counting
Hierarchy.
