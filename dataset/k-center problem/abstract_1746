We give a simple example of non-uniqueness in the inverse scattering for
Jacobi matrices: roughly speaking $S$-matrix is analytic. Then, multiplying a
reflection coefficient by an inner function, we repair this matrix in such a
way that it does uniquely determine a Jacobi matrix of Szeg\"o class; on the
other hand the transmission coefficient remains the same. This implies the
statement given in the title.
