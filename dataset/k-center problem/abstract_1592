This paper is concerned with an inverse obstacle problem which employs the
dynamical scattering data of acoustic wave over a finite time interval. The
unknown obstacle is assumed to be sound-soft one. The governing equation of the
wave is given by the classical wave equation. The wave is generated by the
initial data localized outside the obstacle and observed over a finite time
interval at a place which is not necessary the same as the support of the
initial data. The observed data are the so-called bistatic data. In this paper,
an enclosure method which employs the bistatic data and is based on two main
analytical formulae, is developed. The first one enables us to extract the
maximum spheroid with focal points at the center of the support of the initial
data and that of the observation points whose exterior encloses the unknown
obstacle of general shape. The second one, under some technical assumption for
the obstacle including convexity as an example, indicates the deviation of the
geometry of the boundary of the obstacle and the maximum spheroid at the
contact points. Several implications of those two formulae are also given. In
particular, a constructive proof of a uniqueness of a spherical obstacle using
the bistatic data is given.
