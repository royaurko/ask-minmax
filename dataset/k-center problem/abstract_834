It is proved that any left F-quasigroup is isomorphic to the direct product
of a left F-quasigroup with a unique idempotent element and isotope of a
special form of a left distributive quasigroup. The similar theorems are proved
for right F-quasigroups, left and right SM- and E-quasigroups. Information on
simple quasigroups from these quasigroup classes is given, for example, finite
simple F-quasigroup is a simple group or a simple medial quasigroup. It is
proved that any left F-quasigroup is isotopic to the direct product of a group
and a left S-loop. Some properties of loop isotopes of F-quasigroups (including
M-loops) are pointed out. A left special loop is an isotope of a left
F-quasigroup if and only if this loop is isomorphic the direct product of a
group and a left S-loop (this is an answer to Belousov "1a", problem). Any left
FESM-quasigroup is isotopic to the direct product of an abelian group and a
left S-loop (this is an answer to Kinyon-Phillips 2.8(2) problem). New proofs
of some known results on the structure of commutative Moufang loops are
presented.
