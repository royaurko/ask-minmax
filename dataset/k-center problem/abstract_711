We construct fractionally integrated continuous time GARCH models, which
capture the observed long range dependence of squared volatilities in
high-frequency data. We discuss the Molchan-Golosov kernel and the
Mandelbrot-van-Ness kernel with respect to their integrability, and the
resulting fractional processes with respect to their increments, as they should
be stationary and positively correlated. Since this poses problems we resort to
moderately long memory problems by choosing a fractional parameter
$d\in(-0.5,0)$ and remove the singularities of the kernel to obtain
non-pathological sample path properties. The new fractional COGARCH process has
certain positive features like stationarity and algebraically decreasing
covariance function.
