In this paper, based on the conformal mapping method and the perturbation
theory, we develop a method to solve the statistical problem within general
2-dimensional regions. We consider some examples and the numerical results and
fitting results are given. We also give the thermodynamic quantities of the
general 2-dimensional regions, and compare the thermodynamic quantities of the
different regions.
