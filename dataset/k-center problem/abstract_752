Motivated in part by models arising from mathematical descriptions of
Bose-Einstein condensation, we consider total variation minimization problems
in which the total variation is weighted by a function that may degenerate near
the domain boundary, and the fidelity term contains a weight that may be both
degenerate and singular. We develop a general theory for a class of such
problems, with special attention to the examples arising from physical models.
