This paper includes a proof of well-posedness of an initial-boundary value
problem involving a system of degenerate non-local parabolic PDE which
naturally arises in the study of derivative pricing in a generalized market
model. In a semi-Markov modulated GBM model the locally risk minimizing price
function satisfies a special case of this problem. We study the well-posedness
of the problem via a Volterra integral equation of second kind. A probabilistic
approach, in particular the method of conditioning on stopping times is used
for showing uniqueness.
