The linear non homogeneous singular integral equation (LNSIE)derived from the
nonlinear non homogeneous integral eauation (NNIE)of Chandrsasekhar's H-
functions is considered here to develop a new form of H - functions.The
Plemelj's formulae are applied to that equation to determine a new linear non
homogeneous integral equation(LNIE)for H- functions in complex plane . The
analytic properties of this new linear integral equation are assessed and
compared with known linear integral equations satisfied by H- functions. The
Cauchy integral formulae in complex plane are used to obtain this form of H-
functions not dependent on H- function in the integral . This new form of
H-function is represented as a simple integral in terms of known functions both
for conservative and non conservative cases. This is identical with the form of
H- functions derived by this contributor by application of Wiener HOpf technique.
The equivalence of application of the theory of linear singular integral
equation in Riemann Hilbert Problem and of the technique of Wiener- Hopf in
linear integral in representing the H- functions is therefore eatablished .This
new form may be used for solving the problems of radiative transfer in
anisotropic and non coherent scattering by the method of Laplace Transform and
Wiener -Hopf technique.
