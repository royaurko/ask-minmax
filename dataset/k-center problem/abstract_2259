In this note, we prove some non-existence results for Dirichlet problems of
complex Hessian equations. The non-existence results are proved using the
Pohozaev method. We also prove existence results for radially symmetric
solutions. The main difference of the complex case with the real case is that
we don't know if a priori radially symmetric property holds in the complex
case.
