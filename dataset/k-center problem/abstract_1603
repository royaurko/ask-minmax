Network applications, such as multimedia streaming and video conferencing,
impose growing requirements over Quality of Service (QoS), including bandwidth,
delay, jitter, etc. Meanwhile, networks are expected to be load-balanced,
energy-efficient, and resilient to some degree of failures. It is observed that
the above requirements could be better met with multiple disjoint QoS paths
than a single one. Let $G=(V,\, E)$ be a digraph with nonnegative integral cost
and delay on every edge, $s,\, t\in V$ be two specified vertices, and
$D\in\mathbb{Z}_{0}^{+}$ be a delay bound (or some other constraint), the
\emph{$k$ Disjoint Restricted Shortest Path} ($k$\emph{RSP})\emph{ Problem} is
computing $k$ disjoint paths between $s$ and $t$ with total cost minimized and
total delay bounded by $D$. Few efficient algorithms have been developed
because of the hardness of the problem.
  In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms with provable performance
guarantees for the $k$RSP problem. We first present a pseudo-polynomial-time
approximation algorithm with a bifactor approximation ratio of $(1,\,2)$, then
improve the algorithm to polynomial time with a bifactor ratio of
$(1+\epsilon,\,2+\epsilon)$ for any fixed $\epsilon>0$, which is better than
the current best approximation ratio $(O(1+\gamma),\, O(1+\frac{1}{\gamma})\})$
for any fixed $\gamma>0$ \cite{orda2004efficient}. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first constant-factor algorithm that almost strictly
obeys the constraint for the $k$RSP problem.
