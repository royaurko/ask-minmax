We consider the sl(2)-module structure on the spaces of symbols of
differential opera- tors acting on the spaces of weighted densities. We compute
the necessary and sufficient integrability conditions of a given infinitesimal
deformation of this structure and we prove that any formal deformation is
equivalent to its infinitesimal part. We study also the super analogue of this
problem getting the same results.
