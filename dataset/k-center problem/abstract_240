Why the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ observed today is so much smaller
than the Planck scale or why the universe is accelerating at present? This is
so-called the cosmological constant fine-tuning problem. In this paper, we find
that this problem is solved with the help of Higgs inflation by simply assuming
a variable cosmological "constant" during the inflation epoch. In the
meanwhile, it could predict a large tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\approx 0.20$ and
a large running of spectral index $n'_s \approx -0.028$ with a red-tilt
spectrum $n_s \approx 0.96$, as well as a big enough number of e-folds
$N\approx 40$ that required to solve the problems in the Big Bang cosmology
with the help of $\Lambda$.
