We investigate the interface dynamic in Laplacian growth model, using the
conformal mapping technique. Starting from the governing equation for the
conformal map, obtained by B.Shraiman and D.Bensimon, we derive different
possible forms of the equation. Some of them have evident physical
representation and are convenient for computer simulation, the results of which
are presented in this paper.
