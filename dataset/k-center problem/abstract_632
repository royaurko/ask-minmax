The effect of correlations between model parameters and nuisance parameters
is discussed, in the context of fitting model parameters to data. Modifications
to the usual $\chi^2$ method are required. Fake data studies, as used at
present, will not be optimum. Problems will occur for applications of the
Maltoni-Schwetz \cite{ms} theorem. Neutrino oscillations are used as examples,
but the problems discussed here are general ones, which are often not
addressed.
