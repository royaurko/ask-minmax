The nature of Dark Energy is still very much a mystery, and the combination
of a variety of experimental tests, sensitive to different potential Dark
Energy properties, will help elucidate its origins. This white paper briefly
surveys the array of theoretical approaches to the Dark Energy problem and
their relation to experimental questions.
