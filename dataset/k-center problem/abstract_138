A formalism is presented that allows an asymptotically exact solution of
non-relativistic and semi-relativistic two-body problems with infinitely rising
confining potentials. We consider both linear and quadratic confinement. The
additional short-range terms are expanded in a Coulomb-Sturmian basis. Such
kinds of Hamiltonians are frequently used in atomic, nuclear, and particle
physics.
