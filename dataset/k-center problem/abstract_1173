The supersymmetry method for study of disordered systems is shortly reviewed.
The discussion starts with a historical introduction followed by an explanation
of the idea of using Grassmann anticommuting variables for investigating
disordered metals. After that the nonlinear supermatrix $\sigma$-model is
derived. Solution of several problems obtained with the help of the
$\sigma$-model is presented. This includes the problem of the level statistics
in small metal grains, localization in wires and films, and Anderson
metal-insulator transition. Calculational schemes developed for studying these
problems form the basis of subsequent applications of the supersymmetry
approach.
