This work develops new numerical methods for the solution of the tomography
problem in domains with reflecting obstacles. We compare the solution's
performance for Lambertian reflection, for classical tomography with ubroken
rays and for specular reflection. Our numerical method using Lambertian
reflection improves the solution's accuracy by an order of magnitude compared
to classical tomography with ubroken rays and for tomography in the presence of
a specularly reflecting obstacle the numerical method improves the solution's
accuracy approximately by a factor of three times. We present efficient new
algorithms for the solution's software implementation and analyze the
solution's performance and effectiveness.
