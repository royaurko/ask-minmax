Gist is a tool that (a) solves the qualitative analysis problem of turn-based
probabilistic games with {\omega}-regular objectives; and (b) synthesizes
reasonable environment assumptions for synthesis of unrealizable
specifications. Our tool provides the first and efficient implementations of
several reduction-based techniques to solve turn-based probabilistic games, and
uses the analysis of turn-based probabilistic games for synthesizing
environment assumptions for unrealizable specifications.
