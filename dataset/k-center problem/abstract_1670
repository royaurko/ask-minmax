In this work we present a model for the photoconductivity of a two
dimensional electron system (2DES) subjected to a magnetic field. The model
includes the microwave and Landau contributions in a non-perturbative exact
way, Impurity scattering effects are treated perturbatively. Based on this
formalism, we provide a Kubo-like formula that takes into account the
oscillatory Floquet structure of the problem. We discuss results related with
the recently discovered zero-resistance states.
