Shortened abstract: A mean field theory of long range frustration is
constructed for spin glass systems with quenched randomness of vertex--vertex
connections and of spin--spin coupling strengths. This theory is applied to a
spin glass model of the random $K$-satisfiability problem (K=2 or K=3).
  The zero--temperature phase diagram of the $\pm J$ Viana--Bray model is also
determined, which is identical to that of the random 2-SAT problem. The
predicted phase transition between a non-frustrated and a long--rangely
frustrated spin glass phase might also be observable in real materials at a
finite temperature.
