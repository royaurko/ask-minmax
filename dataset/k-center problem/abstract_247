A method is developed for solving quasilinear convection diffusion problems
starting on a coarse mesh where the data and solution-dependent coefficients
are unresolved, the problem is unstable and approximation properties do not
hold. The Newton-like iterations of the solver are based on the framework of
regularized pseudo-transient continuation where the proposed time integrator is
a variation on the Newmark strategy, designed to introduce controllable
numerical dissipation and to reduce the fluctuation between the iterates in the
coarse mesh regime where the data is rough and the linearized problems are
badly conditioned and possibly indefinite. An algorithm and updated marking
strategy is presented to produce a stable sequence of iterates as boundary and
internal layers in the data are captured by adaptive mesh partitioning. The
method is suitable for use in an adaptive framework making use of local error
indicators to determine mesh refinement and targeted regularization. Derivation
and q-linear local convergence of the method is established, and numerical
examples demonstrate the theory including the predicted rate of convergence of
the iterations.
