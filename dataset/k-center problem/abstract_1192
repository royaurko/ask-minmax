Several methods for solving efficiently the one-dimensional deconvolution
problem are proposed. The problem is to solve the Volterra equation ${\mathbf
k} u:=\int_0^t k(t-s)u(s)ds=g(t),\quad 0\leq t\leq T$. The data, $g(t)$, are
noisy. Of special practical interest is the case when the data are noisy and
known at a discrete set of times. A general approach to the deconvolution
problem is proposed: represent ${\mathbf k}=A(I+S)$, where a method for a
stable inversion of $A$ is known, $S$ is a compact operator, and $I+S$ is
injective. This method is illustrated by examples: smooth kernels $k(t)$, and
weakly singular kernels, corresponding to Abel-type of integral equations, are
considered. A recursive estimation scheme for solving deconvolution problem
with noisy discrete data is justified mathematically, its convergence is
proved, and error estimates are obtained for the proposed deconvolution method.
