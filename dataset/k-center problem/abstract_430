The Cauchy problem for the Fokker-Plank-Kolmogorov equation with a nonlocal
nonlinear drift term is reduced to a similar problem for the correspondent
linear equation. The relation between symmetry operators of the linear and
nonlinear Fokker-Plank-Kolmogorov equations is considered. Illustrative
examples of the one-dimensional symmetry operators are presented.
