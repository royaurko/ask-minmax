It is proved that if the scattering amplitudes at a fixed wavenumber for two
obstacles from a certain large class of obstacles differ a little, than the
obstacles differ a little. Error estimate is given. It is proved that there is
an inversion formula for finding the obstacle from a fixed-energy scattering
data.
