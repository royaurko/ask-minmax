In this paper we investigate the boundary value problem ${div(\gamma\nabla
u)=0 in \Omega, u=f on \partial\Omega$ where $\gamma$ is a complex valued
$L^\infty$ coefficient, satisfying a strong ellipticity condition. In
Electrical Impedance Tomography, $\gamma$ represents the admittance of a
conducting body. An interesting issue is the one of determining $\gamma$
uniquely and in a stable way from the knowledge of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map
$\Lambda_\gamma$. Under the above general assumptions this problem is an open
issue.
  In this paper we prove that, if we assume a priori that $\gamma$ is piecewise
constant with a bounded known number of unknown values, then Lipschitz
continuity of $\gamma$ from $\Lambda_\gamma$ holds.
