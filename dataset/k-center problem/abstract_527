We show that any convex region which contains a unit segment, an equilateral
triangle of sides 1/2, and a square of side 1/3 always has area at least
0.227498. Using grid-search algorithm, we attempt to find a configuration of
these three objects with minimal convex hull area. Consequently, we improve a
lower bound for Moser's worm problem from 0.2194 to 0.227498.
