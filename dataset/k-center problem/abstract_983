A canonical formalism for spherical symmetry, originally developed by
Kucha\v{r} to describe vacuum Schwarzschild black holes, is extended to include
a spherically symmetric, massless, scalar field source. By introducing the ADM
mass as a canonical coordinate on phase space, one finds that the
super-Hamiltonian and supermomentum constraints for the coupled system simplify
considerably. Yet, despite this simplification, it is difficult to find a
functional time formalism for the theory. First, the configuration variable
that played the role of time for the vacuum theory is no longer a spacetime
scalar once spherically symmetric matter is coupled to gravity. Second,
although it is possible to perform a canonical transformation to a new set of
variables in terms of which the super-Hamiltonian and supermomentum constraints
can be solved, the new time variable also fails to be a spacetime scalar. As
such, our solutions suffer from the so-called {\it spacetime problem of time}.
A candidate for a time variable that {\it is} a spacetime scalar is presented.
Problems with turning this variable into a canonical coordinate on phase space
are discussed.
