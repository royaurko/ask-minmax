We show a surprising link between singularity theory and the invariant
subspace problem of nilpotent operators as recently studied by C. M. Ringel and
M. Schmidmeier, a problem with a longstanding history going back to G.
Birkhoff. The link is established via weighted projective lines and (stable)
categories of vector bundles on those. The setup yields a new approach to
attack the subspace problem. In particular, we deduce the main results of
Ringel and Schmidmeier for nilpotency degree p from properties of the category
of vector bundles on the weighted projective line of weight type (2,3,p),
obtained by Serre construction from the triangle singularity x^2+y^3+z^p. For
p=6 the Ringel-Schmidmeier classification is thus covered by the classification
of vector bundles for tubular type (2,3,6), and then is closely related to
Atiyah's classification of vector bundles on a smooth elliptic curve. Returning
to the general case, we establish that the stable categories associated to
vector bundles or invariant subspaces of nilpotent operators may be naturally
identified as triangulated categories. They satisfy Serre duality and also have
tilting objects whose endomorphism rings play a role in singularity theory. In
fact, we thus obtain a whole sequence of triangulated (fractional) Calabi-Yau
categories, indexed by p, which naturally form an ADE-chain.
