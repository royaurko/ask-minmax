We find an asymptotic formula for the conformal capacity of a plane condenser
both plate of which are concentric circular arcs as the distance between them
vanishes. This result generalizes the formula for the capacity of parallel
linear plate condenser found by Simonenko and Chekulaeva in 1972 and sheds
light on the problem of finding an asymptotic formula for the capacity of
condenser whose plates are arbitrary parallel curves. This problem was posed
and partially solved by R. K\"{u}hnau in 1998.
