The piston problem is investigated in the case where the length of the
cylinder is infinite (on both sides) and the ratio $m/M$ is a very small
parameter, where $m$ is the mass of one particle of the gaz and $M$ is the mass
of the piston. Introducing initial conditions such that the stochastic motion
of the piston remains in the average at the origin (no drift), it is shown that
the time evolution of the fluids, analytically derived from Liouville equation,
agrees with the Second Law of thermodynamics.
  We thus have a non equilibrium microscopical model whose evolution can be
explicitly shown to obey the two laws of thermodynamics.
