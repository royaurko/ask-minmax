We consider a deterministic discrete-time model of fire spread introduced by
Hartnell [1995] and the problem of minimizing the number of burnt vertices when
deploying a limited number of firefighters per timestep. We consider the
process occurring on the d-dimensional square lattice for d>=3, and we prove
several results, including two conjectures of Wang and Moeller [2002].
