The problem of energy and its localization in general relativity is
critically re-examined. The Tolman energy integral for the Eddington spinning
rod is analyzed in detail and evaluated apart from a single term. It is shown
that a higher order iteration is required to find its value. Details of
techniques to solve mathematically challenging problems of motion with powerful
computing resources are provided. The next phase of following a system from
static to dynamic to final quasi-static state is described.
