We study propagation of stationary waves in disordered non-linear media
described by the non-linear Schroedinger equation and show that for given
boundary conditions and a given coherent wave incident on a sample the number
of solutions of the equation increase exponentially with the sample size. We
also discuss the ballistic case, the sensitivity of the solutions to a change
of external parameters, the similarity of this problem to the problem of spin
glasses and time-dependent solutions.
