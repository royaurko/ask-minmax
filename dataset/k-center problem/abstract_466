We present a solution to the real multidimensional rational K-moment problem,
where K is defined by finitely many polynomial inequalities. More precisely,
let S be a finite set of real polynomials in X=(X_1,...,X_n) such that the
corresponding basic closed semialgebraic set K_S is nonempty. Let E=D^{-1}R[X]
be a localization of the real polynomial algebra, and T_S^E the preordering on
E generated by S. We show that every linear functional L on E that is
nonnegative on T_S^E is represented by a positive measure on a certain subset
of K_S, provided D contains an element that grows fast enough on K_S.
