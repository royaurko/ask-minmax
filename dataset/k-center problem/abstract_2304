We study the "one and one-half" dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell-Fokker-Planck
system and obtain the first results concerning well-posedness of solutions.
Specifically, we prove the global-in-time existence and uniqueness in the large
of classical solutions to the Cauchy problem and a gain in regularity of the
distribution function in its momentum argument.
