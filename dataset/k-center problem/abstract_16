We address the count of isolated and embedded eigenvalues in a generalized
eigenvalue problem defined by two self-adjoint operators with a positive
essential spectrum and a finite number of isolated eigenvalues. The generalized
eigenvalue problem determines spectral stability of nonlinear waves in a
Hamiltonian dynamical system. The theory is based on the Pontryagin's Invariant
Subspace theorem in an indefinite inner product space but it extends beyond the
scope of earlier papers of Pontryagin, Krein, Grillakis, and others. Our main
results are (i) the number of unstable and potentially unstable eigenvalues
{\em equals} the number of negative eigenvalues of the self-adjoint operators,
(ii) the total number of isolated eigenvalues of the generalized eigenvalue
problem is {\em bounded from above} by the total number of isolated eigenvalues
of the self-adjoint operators, and (iii) the quadratic form defined by the
indefinite inner product is strictly positive on the subspace related to the
absolutely continuous part of the spectrum of the generalized eigenvalue
problem. Applications to solitons and vortices of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger
equations and solitons of the Korteweg--De Vries equations are developed from
the general theory.
