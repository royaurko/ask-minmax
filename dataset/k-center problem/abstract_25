We study the problem of list ranking in the parallel external memory (PEM)
model. We observe an interesting dual nature for the hardness of the problem
due to limited information exchange among the processors about the structure of
the list, on the one hand, and its close relationship to the problem of
permuting data, which is known to be hard for the external memory models, on
the other hand.
  By carefully defining the power of the computational model, we prove a
permuting lower bound in the PEM model. Furthermore, we present a stronger
\Omega(log^2 N) lower bound for a special variant of the problem and for a
specific range of the model parameters, which takes us a step closer toward
proving a non-trivial lower bound for the list ranking problem in the
bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) and MapReduce models. Finally, we also present
an algorithm that is tight for a larger range of parameters of the model than
in prior work.
