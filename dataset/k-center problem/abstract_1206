In this note we show that weak solutions to the wave map problem in the
energy-supercritical dimension 3 are not unique. On the one hand, we find weak
solutions using the penalization method introduced by Shatah and show that they
satisfy a local energy inequality. On the other hand we build on a special
harmonic map to construct a weak solution to the wave map problem, which
violates this energy inequality.
  Finally we establish a local weak-strong uniqueness argument in the spirit of
Struwe which we employ to show that one may even have a failure of uniqueness
for a Cauchy problem with a stationary solution. We thus obtain a result
analogous to the one of Coron for the case of the heat flow of harmonic maps.
