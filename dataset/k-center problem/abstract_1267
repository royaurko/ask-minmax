In this paper, a new method to determine the complete set of dynamically
balanced planar four-bar mechanims is presented. Using complex variables to
model the kinematics of the mechanism, the dynamic balancing constraints are
written as algebraic equations over complex variables and joint angular
velocities. After elimination of the joint angular velocity variables, the
problem is formulated as a problem of factorization of Laurent polynomials.
Using toric polynomial division, necessary and sufficient conditions for
dynamic balancing of planar four-bar mechanisms are derived.
