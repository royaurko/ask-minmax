The role of the sterile neutrinos to the r-process nucleosynthesis in
supernova explosions is studied. Previously it has been argued that a large
part of neutrino mixing can be excluded if the supernovae are the origin of the
heavy elements. It is shown that a conversion to sterile neutrinos may evade
those limits. The possibility that such conversions can enhance the
nucleosynthesis is investigated. The desired mass spectrum is consistent with
neutrino masses suggested by other observed phenomena, like the solar neutrino
problem, the atmospheric neurino problem, dark matter and the LSND signals.
