We investigate the properties of a class of weighted vector-valued
$L_p$-spaces and the corresponding (an)isotropic Sobolev-Slobodetskii spaces.
These spaces arise naturally in the context of maximal $L_p$-regularity for
parabolic initial-boundary value problems. Our main tools are operators with a
bounded $\calH^\infty$-calculus, interpolation theory, and operator sums.
