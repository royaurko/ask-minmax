We show that the problem of finding the simplex of largest volume in the
convex hull of $n$ points in $\mathbb{Q}^d$ can be approximated with a factor
of $O(\log d)^{d/2}$ in polynomial time. This improves upon the previously best
known approximation guarantee of $d^{(d-1)/2}$ by Khachiyan. On the other hand,
we show that there exists a constant $c>1$ such that this problem cannot be
approximated with a factor of $c^d$, unless $P=NP$. % This improves over the
$1.09$ inapproximability that was previously known. Our hardness result holds
even if $n = O(d)$, in which case there exists a $\bar c\,^{d}$-approximation
algorithm that relies on recent sampling techniques, where $\bar c$ is again a
constant. We show that similar results hold for the problem of finding the
largest absolute value of a subdeterminant of a $d\times n$ matrix.
