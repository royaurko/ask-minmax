We consider different aspects of the problem of cosmological singularity such
as the BKL oscillatory approach to singularity, the new features of the
cosmological dynamics in the neighbourhood of the singularity in
multidimensional and superstring cosmological models and their connections with
such a modern branch of mathematics as infinite-dimensional Lie algebras.
Besides, we consider some new types of cosmological singularities which were
widely discussed during last decade after the discovery of the phenomenon of
cosmic acceleration.
