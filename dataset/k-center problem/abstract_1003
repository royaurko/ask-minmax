The off-site continuums are proposed for the cosmological models of the
galaxies and the Universe. It is shown that many visual properties of galaxies
and the Universe may be described on frames of the off-site continuums
methodology. In cosmological scale, the appearance of off-site objects is quite
similar to the influence of the 'dark matter' and the 'dark energy'. Analogies
to known relic radiation also look through. It is discussed few possible models
of galaxies and the Universe. Such point of view may appear useful for the
investigation of conceptual problems of modern cosmology.
