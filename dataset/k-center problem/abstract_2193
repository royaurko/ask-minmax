The residual finiteness growth of a group quantifies how well approximated
the group is by its finite quotients. In this paper, we construct groups with
arbitrarily large residual finiteness growth. We also demonstrate a new
relationship between residual finiteness growth and some decision problems in
groups, which we apply to our new groups.
