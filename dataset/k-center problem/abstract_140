In this paper, we give a purely cohomological interpretation of the extension
problem for associative algebras; that is the problem of extending an
associative algebra by another associative algebra. We then give a similar
interpretation of infinitesimal deformations of extensions. In particular, we
consider infinitesimal deformations of representations of an associative
algebra.
