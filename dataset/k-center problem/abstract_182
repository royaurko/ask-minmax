The existence problem for vector bundles on a smooth compact complex surface
consists in determining which topological complex vector bundles admit
holomorphic structures. For projective surfaces, Schwarzenberger proved that a
topological complex vector bundle admits a holomorphic (algebraic) structure if
and only if its first Chern class belongs to the Neron-Severi group of the
surface. In contrast, for non-projective surfaces there is only a necessary
condition for the existence problem (the discriminant of the vector bundles
must be positive) and the difficulty of the problem resides in the lack of a
general method for constructing non-filtrable vector bundles. In this paper, we
close the existence problem in the rank-2 case, by giving necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of holomorphic rank-2 vector bundles on
non-K\" ahler elliptic surfaces.
