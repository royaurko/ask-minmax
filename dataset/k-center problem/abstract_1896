We consider the functions in two variables on an arbitrary poset, for which
the convolution operation is defined. We obtain the generalization of incidence
algebra and describe its properties: invertibility, the Jackobson radical,
idempotents, regular elements. As a consequence a positive solution of the
isomorphism problem for such algebras is obtained.
