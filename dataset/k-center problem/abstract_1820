Numerical approximate computation can solve large and complex problems fast.
It has the advantage of high efficiency. However it only gives approximate
results, whereas we need exact results in many fields. There is a gap between
approximate computation and exact results. In this paper, we build a bridge by
which exact results can be obtained by numerical approximate computations.
