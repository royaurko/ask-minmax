We prove that several breather solutions of integrable equations satisfy
suitable elliptic equations, which implies that the stability problem reduces
to the study of the spectrum of explicit linear systems. We exemplify this idea
in the case of the modified KdV and sine-Gordon equations, among several other
cases.
