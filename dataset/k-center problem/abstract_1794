We reduce the problem of the projective normality of polarized abelian
varieties to check the rank of very explicit matrices. This allow us to prove
some results on normal generation of primitive line bundles on abelian
threefolds and fourfolds. We also give two situations where the projective
normality always fails. Finally we make some conjecture.
