The one-dimensional scattering of a two body interacting system by an
infinite wall is studied in a quantum-mechanical framework. This problem
contains some of the dynamical features present in the collision of atomic,
molecular and nuclear systems. The scattering problem is solved exactly, for
the case of a harmonic interaction between the fragments. The exact result is
used to assess the validity of two different approximations to the scattering
process. The adiabatic approximation, which considers that the relative
co-ordinate is frozen during the scattering process, is found to be inadequate
for this problem. The uncorrelated scattering approximation, which neglects the
correlation between the fragments, gives results in accordance with the exact
calculations when the scattering energy is high compared to the oscillator
parameter.
