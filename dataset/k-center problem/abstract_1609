In scientific computing, it is time-consuming to calculate an inverse
operator ${\mathscr A}^{-1}$ of a differential equation ${\mathscr A}\varphi =
f$, especially when ${\mathscr A}$ is a highly nonlinear operator. In this
paper, based on the homotopy analysis method (HAM), a new approach, namely the
method of directly defining inverse mapping (MDDiM), is proposed to gain
analytic approximations of nonlinear differential equations. In other words,
one can solve a nonlinear differential equation by means of directly defining
an inverse mapping $\mathscr J$. Here, the inverse mapping $\mathscr J$ is even
unnecessary to be explicitly expressed in a differential form, since "mapping"
is more general concept than "differential operator". To guide how to directly
define inverse mapping $\mathscr J$, some rules are provided. Besides, a
convergence theorem is proved, which guarantees that a convergent series
solution given by the MDDiM must be a solution of problems under consideration.
In addition, three nonlinear differential equations are used as examples to
illustrate the validity and potential of the MDDiM, and especially the great
freedom and large flexibility of directly defining inverse mappings for various
types of nonlinear problems. The method of directly defining inverse mapping
(MDDiM) might open a completely new, more general way to solve nonlinear
problems in science and engineering, which is fundamentally different from
traditional methods.
