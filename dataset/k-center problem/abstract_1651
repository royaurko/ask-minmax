We show how categorial deduction can be implemented in higher-order (linear)
logic programming, thereby realising parsing as deduction for the associative
and non-associative Lambek calculi. This provides a method of solution to the
parsing problem of Lambek categorial grammar applicable to a variety of its
extensions.
