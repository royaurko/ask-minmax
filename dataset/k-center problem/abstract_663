We consider the problem of counting the number of varieties in a family over
a number field which contain a rational point. In particular, for products of
Brauer-Severi varieties and closely related counting functions associated to
Brauer group elements. Using harmonic analysis on toric varieties, we provide a
positive answer to a question of Serre on such counting functions in some
cases. We also formulate some conjectures on generalisations of Serre's
problem.
