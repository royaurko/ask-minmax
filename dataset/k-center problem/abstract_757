We decide the Borel complexity of the conjugacy problem for automorphism
groups of countable homogeneous digraphs. Many of the homogeneous digraphs, as
well as several other homogeneous structures, have already been addressed in
previous articles. In this article we complete the program, and establish a
dichotomy theorem that this complexity is either the minimum or the maximum
among relations which are classifiable by countable structures. We also discuss
the possibility of extending our results beyond graphs to more general classes
of countable homogeneous structures.
