The article is devoted to the resampling approach application to the
reliability problems. This approach to reliability problems was first proposed
by Ivnitsky (1967). Resampling is intensive statistical computer method, which
is non-parametrical, that uses initial samples data in different combinations
to simulate the process many times and get finally the estimator of the
characteristics of interest. At the present paper simple resampling,
hierarchical resampling, the case of one sample for several variables, the case
of partially known distributions, analysis of degradation flow, analysis of
degradation-renewal process, construction of confidence intervals are
described. All those resampling application cases can be applied successfully
to solve the reliability problems as an alternative to classical methods.
