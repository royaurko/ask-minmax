In this work we investigate the systems that implements algorithms for the
planning problem in Artificial Intelligence, called planners, with especial
attention to the planners based on the plan graph. We analyze the problem of
comparing the performance of the different algorithms and we propose an
environment for the development and analysis of planners.
