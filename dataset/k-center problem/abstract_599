We study the perturbed equation of state (EOS) parameters of the cosmological
tachyonic scalar field components and their mutual time-dependent interaction.
  It is shown that the discrete temperature-dependent pattern of the EOS
emerges from an initial continuum along the evolution of the universe. This
leads to two major components in form of dark energy and dark matter, and also
suggests a solution to the cosmological constant problem and the coincidence
problem.
