We prove bilinear virial identities for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation,
which are extensions of the Morawetz interaction inequalities. We recover and
extend known bilinear improvements to Strichartz inequalities and provide
applications to various nonlinear problems, most notably on domains with
boundaries.
