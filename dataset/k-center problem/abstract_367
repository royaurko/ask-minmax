This paper is a continuation of the investigation of resolvents of elliptic
operators on conic manifolds from math.AP/0410178 and math.AP/0410176 to the
case of manifolds with boundary and realizations of operators under boundary
conditions. We prove the existence of sectors of minimal growth for
realizations of boundary value problems for cone operators under natural
ellipticity conditions on the symbols. Special attention is devoted to the
clarification of the analytic structure of the resolvent.
