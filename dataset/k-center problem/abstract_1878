The frequency of a classical periodic system can be obtained using action
variables without solving the dynamical equations. We demonstrate the
construction of two equivalent forms of the action variable for a one
dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator and obtain its energy dependent
frequency. This analysis of oscillation is compared with the traditional
solution of the problem which requires the use of hypergeometric series.
