We investigate the initial-value problem of the non-linear Liouville
hierarchy. For the general form of the interaction potential we construct an
explicit solution in terms of an expansion over particle clusters whose
evolution is described by the corresponding-order cumulant of evolution
operators of a system of finitely many particles. For the initial data from the
space of integrable functions the existence of a strong solution of the Cauchy
problem is proved.
