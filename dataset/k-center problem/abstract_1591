A classical problem in statistics is estimating the expected coverage of a
sample, which has had applications in gene expression, microbial ecology,
optimization, and even numismatics. Here we consider a related extension of
this problem to random samples of two discrete distributions. Specifically, we
estimate what we call the dissimilarity probability of a sample, i.e., the
probability of a draw from one distribution not being observed in k draws from
another distribution. We show our estimator of dissimilarity to be a
U-statistic and a uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator of
dissimilarity over the largest appropriate range of k. Furthermore, despite the
non-Markovian nature of our estimator when applied sequentially over k, we show
it converges uniformly in probability to the dissimilarity parameter, and we
present criteria when it is approximately normally distributed and admits a
consistent jackknife estimator of its variance. As proof of concept, we analyze
V35 16S rRNA data to discern between various microbial environments. Other
potential applications concern any situation where dissimilarity of two
discrete distributions may be of interest. For instance, in SELEX experiments,
each urn could represent a random RNA pool and each draw a possible solution to
a particular binding site problem over that pool. The dissimilarity of these
pools is then related to the probability of finding binding site solutions in
one pool that are absent in the other.
