We show that all groups in a very large class of Coxeter groups are locally
quasiconvex and have uniform membership problem solvable in quadratic time. If
a group in the class satisfies a further hypothesis it is subgroup separable
and relevant homomorphisms are also calculable in quadratic time.
 The algorithm also decides if a finitely generated subgroup has finite index.
