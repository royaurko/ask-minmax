We study the problem of addition and subtraction using the Zeckendorf
representation of integers. We show that both operations can be performed in
linear time; in fact they can be performed by combinational logic networks with
linear size and logarithmic depth. The implications of these results for
multiplication, division and square-root extraction are also discussed.
