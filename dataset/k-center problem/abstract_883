We investigate the generalized second-order Arnoldi (GSOAR) method, a
generalization of the SOAR method proposed by Bai and Su [{\em SIAM J. Matrix
Anal. Appl.}, 26 (2005): 640--659.], and the Refined GSOAR (RGSOAR) method for
the quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP). The two methods use the GSOAR procedure
to generate an orthonormal basis of a given generalized second-order Krylov
subspace, and with such basis they project the QEP onto the subspace and
compute the Ritz pairs and the refined Ritz pairs, respectively. We develop
implicitly restarted GSOAR and RGSOAR algorithms, in which we propose certain
exact and refined shifts for respective use within the two algorithms.
Numerical experiments on real-world problems illustrate the efficiency of the
restarted algorithms and the superiority of the restarted RGSOAR to the
restarted GSOAR. The experiments also demonstrate that both IGSOAR and IRGSOAR
generally perform much better than the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method
applied to the corresponding linearization problems, in terms of the accuracy
and the computational efficiency.
