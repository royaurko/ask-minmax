We prove the equivalence of the well-posedness of a partial differential
equation with delay and an associated abstract Cauchy problem. This is used to
derive sufficient conditions for well-posedness, exponential stability and norm
continuity of the solutions. Applications to a reaction-diffusion equation with
delay are given.
