A new approach to large-scale nuclear structure calculations, based on the
Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), is described. The method is tested
in the context of a problem involving many identical nucleons constrained to
move in a single large-j shell and interacting via a pairing plus quadrupole
interaction. In cases in which exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian is
possible, the method is able to reproduce the exact results for the ground
state energy and the energies of low-lying excited states with extreme
precision. Results are also presented for a model problem in which exact
solution is not feasible.
