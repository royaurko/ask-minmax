We present a technique for computing explicit, concrete formulas for the
weighted Bergman kernel on a planar domain with weight the modulus squared of a
meromorphic function in the case that the meromorphic function has a finite
number of zeros on the domain and a concrete formula for the unweighted kernel
is known. We apply this theory to the study of the Lu Qi-keng Problem.
