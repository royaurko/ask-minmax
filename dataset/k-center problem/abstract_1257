We study the nonlinear eigenvalue problem $-{\rm div}(a(|\nabla u|)\nabla
u)=\lambda|u|^{q(x)-2}u$ in $\Omega$, $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$, where $\Omega$
is a bounded open set in $\RR^N$ with smooth boundary, $q$ is a continuous
function, and $a$ is a nonhomogeneous potential. We establish sufficient
conditions on $a$ and $q$ such that the above nonhomogeneous quasilinear
problem has continuous families of eigenvalues. The proofs rely on elementary
variational arguments. The abstract results of this paper are illustrated by
the cases $a(t)=t^{p-2}\log (1+t^r)$ and $a(t)= t^{p-2} [\log (1+t)]^{-1}$.
