Physics is a fertile environment for trying to solve some number theory
problems. In particular, several tentative of linking the zeros of the
Riemann-zeta function with physical phenomena were reported. In this work, the
Riemann operator is introduced and used to transform the Riemann's hypothesis
in a Heisenberg-type uncertainty relation, offering a new way for studying the
zeros of Riemann's function
