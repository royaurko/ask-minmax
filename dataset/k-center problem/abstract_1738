The aim of this article is to obtain restrictions on complex orientations of
dividing real J-curves of almost-complex manifolds. This problem comes from
real algebraic geometry and the main result is a congruence generalising
Arnol'd, Rokhlin, Mishachev, Zvonilov and Mikhalkin 's previous results. This
congruence is obtained with a canonical map defined on homology groups of
dimension half the dimension of the manifold with coefficients in $Z/lZ$, with
values in $Z/2lZ$.
