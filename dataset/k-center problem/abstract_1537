Given a particular prescription for the Einstein field equations (EFE's), it
is important to have general protective theorems that lend support to it. The
prescription of data on a timelike hypersurface for the (n + 1)-d EFE's arises
in `noncompact Kaluza--Klein theory', and in certain kinds of braneworlds and
low-energy string theory. The Campbell--Magaard (CM) theorem, which asserts
local existence (and, with extra conditions, uniqueness) of analytic embeddings
of completely general n-d manifolds into vacuum (n + 1)-d manifolds, has often
recently been invoked as a protective theorem for such prescriptions. But in
this paper I argue that there are problems with loosening the CM thoerem of
restrictive meanings in its statement, which is worthwhile thing to do in
pursuit of the proposed applications. While I remedy some problems by
identifying the required topology, delineating what `local' can be taken to
mean, and offering a new, more robust and covariant proof, other problems
remain unsurmountable. The theorem lends only inadequate support, both because
it offers no guarantee of continuous dependence on the data and because it
disregards causality. Furthermore, the theorem is only for the analytic
functions which renders it inappropriate for the study of the relativistic
equations of modern physics. Unfortunately, there are no known general theorems
that offer adequate protection to the proposed applications' prescription. I
conclude by making some suggestions for more modest progress.
