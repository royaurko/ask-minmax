We consider an impulse control problem in infinite horizon applied with
switching technology. We suppose that the firm decides at certain moments
(impulse moments) to switch technology, leading to a jump of the firm value. We
show that the value function for such problems satisfies a dynamic programming
principle version. Our objective is to look for an optimal strategy which
maximizes the value function associated with a switching problem.
