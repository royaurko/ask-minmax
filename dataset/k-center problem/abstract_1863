In this note, we are concerned with the asymptotic approximation of a class
of double integrals which can be represented as an angular spectrum
superposition. These double integrals typically appear in electromagnetic
scattering problems. Based on the synthetic manipulation of the method of
steepest descent path, approximate expressions of the double integrals are
derived in terms of the leading term of the contribution to the asymptotic
expansions.
