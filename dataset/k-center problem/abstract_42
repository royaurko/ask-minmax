We consider a nonlinear eigenvalue problem under Robin boundary conditions in
a domain with (possibly noncompact) smooth boundary. The problem involves a
weighted p-Laplacian operator and subcritical nonlinearities satisfying
Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz type conditions. Using Morse theory and a cohomological
local splitting as in Degiovanni et al. [5], we prove the existence of a
nontrivial weak solution for all (real) values of the eigenvalue parameter. Our
result is new even in the semilinear case p = 2 and complements some recent
results obtained in Autuori et al. [1].
