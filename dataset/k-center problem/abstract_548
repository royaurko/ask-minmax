In this note we present the solution of some isoperimetric problems in open
convex cones of $\R^n$ in which perimeter and volume are measured with respect
to certain nonradial weights. Surprisingly, Euclidean balls centered at the
origin (intersected with the convex cone) minimize the isoperimetric quotient.
Our result applies to all nonnegative homogeneous weights satisfying a
concavity condition in the cone. When the weight is constant, the result was
established by Lions and Pacella in 1990.
