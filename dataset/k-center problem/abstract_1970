For a large class of Schrodinger operators, we introduce the hyperbolic
quadratic pencils by making the coupling constant dependent on the energy in
the very special way. For these pencils, many problems of scattering theory are
easier to study. Then, we give some applications to the original Schrodinger
operators.
