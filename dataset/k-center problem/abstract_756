We derive the optimal investment decision in a project where both demand and
investment costs are stochastic processes, eventually subject to shocks. We
extend the approach used in Dixit and Pindyck (1994), chapter 6.5, to deal with
two sources of uncertainty, but assuming that the underlying processes are no
longer geometric Brownian diffusions but rather jump diffusion processes. For
the class of isoelastic functions that we address in this paper, it is still
possible to derive a closed expression for the value of the firm. We prove
formally that the result we get is indeed the solution of the optimization
problem.
