We describe a technique for mechanically proving certain kinds of theorems in
combinatorics on words, using automata and a package for manipulating them. We
illustrate our technique by solving, purely mechanically, an open problem of
Currie and Saari on the lengths of unbordered factors in the Thue-Morse
sequence.
