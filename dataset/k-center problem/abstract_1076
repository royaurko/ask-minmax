This paper studies a prototype of inverse obstacle scattering problems whose
governing equation is the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions. An explicit
method to extract information about the location and shape of unknown obstacles
from the far field operator with a fixed wave number is given. The method is
based on: an explicit construction of a modification of Mittag-Leffler's
function via the Vekua transform and the study of the asymptotic behaviour; an
explicit density in the Herglotz wave function that approximates the
modification of Mittag-Leffler's function in the bounded domain surrounding
unknown obstacles; a system of inequalities derived from Kirsch's factorization
formula of the far field operator. Then an indicator function which can be
calculated from the far field operator acting on the density is introduced. It
is shown that the asymptotic behaviour of the indicator function yields
information about the visible part of the exterior of the obstacles.
