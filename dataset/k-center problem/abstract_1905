We reveal a connection between the incompressibility method and the Lovasz
local lemma in the context of Ramsey theory. We obtain bounds by repeatedly
encoding objects of interest and thereby compressing strings. The method is
demonstrated on the example of van der Waerden numbers. It applies to lower
bounds of Ramsey numbers, large transitive subtournaments and other Ramsey
phenomena as well.
