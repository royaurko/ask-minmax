This paper contains a revised version of the lecture notes of a short course
on the quantization of gauge theories. Starting from a sketchy review of
scattering theory, the paper describes the lines of BRST-Faddeev-Popov
quantization considering the problem of a non-perturbative extension of this
method. The connection between Slavnov-Taylor identity and S-matrix unitarity
is also discussed.
