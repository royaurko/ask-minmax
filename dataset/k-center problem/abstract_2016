We study the Jacobian Poisson structures in any dimension invariant with
respect to the discrete Heisenberg group. The classification problem is related
to the discrete volume of suitable solids. Particular attention is given to
dimension 3 whose simplest example is the Artin-Schelter-Tate Poisson tensors
respectively.
