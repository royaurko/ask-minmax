In this paper we formulate a weighted version of minimum problem (1.4) on the
sphere and we show that, for $K\le L$, if $\set{\phi_k}^K_{k=1}$ consists of
the spherical functions with degree less than $N$ we can localize the points
$(\xi_1,...,\xi_L)$ on the sphere so that the solution of this problem is the
simplest possible. This localization is connected to the discrete orthogonality
of the spherical functions which was proved in [3]. Using these points we
construct a frame system and a wavelet system on the sphere and we study the
properties of these systems. For $K>L$ a similar construction was made in paper
[4], but in that case the solution of the minimum problem (1.4) is not as
efficient as it is in our case. The analogue of Fej\'er and de la
Val\'ee-Poussin summation methods introduced in [3] can be expressed by the
frame system introduced in this paper.
