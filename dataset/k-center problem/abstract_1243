Lee-Suzuki similarity transformations and Krencigowa-Kuo folded diagrams are
two common methods used to derive energy independent model space effective
interactions for nuclear many-body systems. We demonstrate that these methods
are equivalent to a Renormalization Group (RG) analysis of a separable
potential model. The effective low-momentum potentials V_{eff} are shown to
give the same scaling equation that RG arguments predict. We find the new
result that the different model space techniques considered in this paper yield
a unique low-momentum V_{eff} when applied to the toy model problem.
