The moduli space of polarised K3 surfaces of degree 2d is a quasi-projective
variety of dimension 19. For general d very little has been known about the
Kodaira dimension of these varieties. In this paper we present an almost
complete solution to this problem. Our main result says that this moduli space
is of general type for d>61 and for d=46,50,54,58,60.
