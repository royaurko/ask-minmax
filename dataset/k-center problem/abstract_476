We discuss the Capitulation Problem for Neron-Raynaud class groups of tori
over global fields F and obtain generalizations of the main results of [10]. We
also show that short exact sequences of F-tori induce long exact sequences
involving the corresponding Neron-Raynaud class groups. For example, we show
that the Neron-Raynaud class group of any F-torus which is split by a
metacyclic extension of F can be "resolved" in terms of classical ideal class
groups of global fields.
