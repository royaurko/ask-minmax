We consider $\sigma$-harmonic mappings, that is mappings $U$ whose components
$u_i$ solve a divergence structure elliptic equation ${\rm div} (\sigma \nabla
u_i)=0$, for $i=1,\ldots,n $. We investigate whether, with suitably prescribed
Dirichlet data, the Jacobian determinant can be bounded away from zero. Results
of this sort are required in the treatment of the so-called hybrid inverse
problems, and also in the field of homogenization studying bounds for the
effective properties of composite materials.
