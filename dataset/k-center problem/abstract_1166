In this article, we investigate a density problem coming from the
linearization of Calder\'on's problem with partial data. More precisely, we
prove that the set of products of harmonic functions on a bounded smooth domain
$\Omega$ vanishing on any fixed closed proper subset of the boundary are dense
in $L^{1}(\Omega)$ in all dimensions $n \geq 2$. This is proved using ideas
coming from the proof of Kashiwara's Watermelon theorem.
