This article considers a one-parameter family of circles F_C, which has the
interesting property that the null isocline of the family is the largest member
of the family. This family of circles is bounded and we consider the problem of
deriving an equation for the envelope of F_C. We provide one standard solution,
and three nonstandard ones. The article concludes with a discussion of the
relative merits and aesthetics of the different methods.
