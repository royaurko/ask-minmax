We'll measure the differences of the dual variables and the gain of the
objective function when creating new problems, which each has one inequality
more than the starting LP-instance. These differences of the dual variables are
naturally connected to the branches. Then we'll choose those differences of
dual variables, so that for all combinations of choices at the connected
branches, all dual inequalities will hold for sure. By adding the gain of each
chosen branching, we get a total gain, which gives a better limit of the
original problem. By this technique it is also possible to create cuts.
