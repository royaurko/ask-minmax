We consider the elliptic three body problem as a perturbation of the circular
problem. We show that for sufficiently small eccentricities of the elliptic
problem, and for energies sufficiently close to the energy of the libration
point L2, a Cantor set of Lyapounov orbits survives the perturbation. The
orbits are perturbed to quasi-periodic invariant tori. We show that for a
certain family of masses of the primaries, for such tori we have transversal
intersections of stable and unstable manifolds, which lead to chaotic dynamics
involving diffusion over a short range of energy levels. Some parts of our
argument are nonrigorous, but are strongly backed by numerical computations.
