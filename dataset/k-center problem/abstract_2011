We examine the problem of motion of an oscillating mass object provided no
external force is applied to it. Calculations directly lead to the conclusion
that the body accelerates in each system of reference except for the rest
reference frame. Although its motion is periodic, it bears no resemblance to
harmonic oscillations.
