Despite having a large number of speakers, the Kurdish language is among the
less-resourced languages. In this work we highlight the challenges and problems
in providing the required tools and techniques for processing texts written in
Kurdish. From a high-level perspective, the main challenges are: the inherent
diversity of the language, standardization and segmentation issues, and the
lack of language resources.
