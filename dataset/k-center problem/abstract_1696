Within the framework of generalized free field theory at nonzero temperature
we address the problem of current conservation. The formalism of thermo field
dynamics is used to derive a conserved and thermodynamically consistent
physical current operator. Consequences for the calculation of photon emission
rates from a hot plasma are considered briefly.
