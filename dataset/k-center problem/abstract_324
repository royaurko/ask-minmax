We solve the double exchange model in the presence of arbitrary
substitutional disorder by using a self consistently generated effective
Hamiltonian for the spin degrees of freedom. The magnetic properties are
studied through classical Monte Carlo while the effective exchange, $D_{ij}$,
are calculated by solving the disordered fermion problem, and renormalised
self-consistently with increasing temperature. We present exact results on the
conductivity, magnetoresistance, optical response and `real space' structure of
the inhomogeneous ferromagnetic state, and compare our results with charge
dynamics in disordered La_{1-x}Sr_xMnO_3. The large sizes, ${\cal O} (10^3)$,
accessible within our method allows a complete, controlled calculation on the
disordered strongly interacting problem.
