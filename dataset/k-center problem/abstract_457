We discuss the Sundman-Weierstrass theorem of total collapse in its
historical context. This remarkable and relatively simple result, a type of
stability criterion, is at the crossroads of some interesting developments in
the gravitation Newtonian N-body problem. We use it as motivation to explore
the connections to such important concepts as integrability, singularities and
tyipicality in order to gain some insight on the transition from a
predominantly quantitative to a novel qualitative approach to dynamical
problems that took place at the end of the 19th century.
