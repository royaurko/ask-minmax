We demonstrate an implementation for an approximate rank-k SVD factorization,
combining well-known randomized projection techniques with previously
implemented map/reduce solutions in order to compute steps of the random
projection based SVD procedure, such QR and SVD. We structure the problem in a
way that it reduces to Cholesky and SVD factorizations on $k \times k$ matrices
computed on a single machine, greatly easing the computability of the problem.
