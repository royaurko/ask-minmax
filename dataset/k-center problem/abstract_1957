It is shown that the geodesic rays constructed as limits of Bergman geodesics
from a test configuration are always of class $C^{1,\alpha}, 0<\alpha<1$. An
essential step is to establish that the rays can be extended as solutions of a
Dirichlet problem for a Monge-Ampere equation on a Kaehler manifold which is
compact.
