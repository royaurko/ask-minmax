The doublet-triplet splitting problem is probably the most significant
challenge to supersymmetric GUT theories. In this talk, we review potential
solutions and their problematic aspects. We also present a complete consistent
realization of our preferred solution, higgses as pseudogoldstone bosons, and
discuss some distinctive aspects of its phenomenology.
