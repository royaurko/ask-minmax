The classical Busemann-Petty problem (1956) asks, whether origin-symmetric
convex bodies in $\mathbb {R}^n$ with smaller hyperplane central sections
necessarily have smaller volumes. It is known, that the answer is affirmative
if $n\le 4$ and negative if $n>4$. The same question can be asked when volumes
of hyperplane sections are replaced by other comparison functions having
geometric meaning. We give unified exposition of this circle of problems in
real, complex, and quaternionic $n$-dimensional spaces. All cases are treated
simultaneously. In particular, we show that the Busemann-Petty problem in the
quaternionic $n$-dimensional space has an affirmative answer if and only if $n
=2$. The method relies on the properties of cosine transforms on the unit
sphere. Possible generalizations are discussed.
