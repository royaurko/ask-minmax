In this paper we study the problem of ergodicity for the complex
Ginzburg--Landau equation perturbed by an unbounded random kick-force.
Randomness is introduced both through the kicks and through the times between
the kicks. We show that the Markov process associated with the equation in
question possesses a unique stationary distribution and satisfies a property of
polynomial mixing.
