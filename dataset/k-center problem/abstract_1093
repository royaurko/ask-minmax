Proposed in this paper is a possible interaction which exists in nature -
inertial interaction. It gives matter an inertia and inertial mass. The formula
of inertial mass has been derived. It is possible that inertial interaction
leads to the redshifts of quasars, the rotation curve of spiral galaxy, the
accelerating expansion of the universe, and the stronger gravitational lens
effects of quasars, galaxies, or clusters of galaxies. Einstein's Gravitational
Equation has been modified. Gravitational redshift, perihelion precession, and
bending of light in spherically symmetric vacuum gravitational field are
calculated. The differential equations of static spherically symmetric star's
internal evolution are given. The accelerating expansion stage of the universe
evolution equations are derived. The evolution of the universe is periodic.
Time does not have an origin. There is no Big Bang. Although there is divergent
singularity, there is no universe's singularity of incomplete geodesic. There
are no horizon problem and no flatness problem. The problems that may exist are
discussed.
