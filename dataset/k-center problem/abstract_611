This paper is about reducing influence diagram (ID) evaluation into Bayesian
network (BN) inference problems. Such reduction is interesting because it
enables one to readily use one's favorite BN inference algorithm to efficiently
evaluate IDs. Two such reduction methods have been proposed previously (Cooper
1988, Shachter and Peot 1992). This paper proposes a new method. The BN
inference problems induced by the mew method are much easier to solve than
those induced by the two previous methods.
