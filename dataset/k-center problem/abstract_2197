In this article we will study the nondegeneracy properties of positive finite
energy solutions of a semilinear elliptic equation in the N-dimensional
Hyperbolic space. We will show that the degeneracy occurs only in an N
dimensional subspace. We will prove that the positive solutions are
nondegenerate in the case of geodesic balls.
