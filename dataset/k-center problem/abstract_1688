New structure function measurements from fixed target experiments and
especially HERA are reviewed. The extraction of parton distributions from these
measurements is discussed with special emphasis on systematic problems. Finally
the present uncertainty of our knowledge on parton distributions and on the
strong coupling constant from DIS are dicussed.
