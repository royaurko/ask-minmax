We use the algebraic nested Bethe ansatz to solve the eigenvalue and
eigenvector problem of the supersymmetric $SU_q(n|m)$ model with open boundary
conditions. Under an additional condition that model is related to a
multicomponent supersymmetric t-J model. We also prove that the transfer matrix
with open boundary condition is $SU_q(n|m)$ invariant.
