This article concerns the equations of motion of perfect incompressible
fluids in a 3-D, smooth, bounded, simply connected domain. We suppose that the
curl of the initial velocity field is a vortex patch, and examine the classical
problems of the existence of a solution, either locally or globally in time,
and of the persistence of the initial regularity.
