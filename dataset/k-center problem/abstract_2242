A weighted norm inequality of Muckenhoupt-Wheeden type is obtained for
gradients of solutions to a class of quasilinear equations with measure data on
Reifenberg flat domains. This essentially leads to a resolution of an existence
problem for quasilinear Riccati type equations with a gradient source term of
arbitrary power law growth.
