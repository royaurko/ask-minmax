The diffusion problem over a saddle is studied using a multi-dimensional
Langevin equation. An analytical solution is derived for a quadratic potential
and the probability to pass over the barrier deduced. A very simple solution is
given for the one dimension problem and a general scheme is shown for higher
dimensions.
