In recent years some attempts have been done to relate the RBF with wavelets
in handling high dimensional multiscale problems. To the contributor's knowledge,
however, the orthonormal and bi-orthogonal RBF wavelets are still missing in
the literature. By using the nonsingular general solution and singular
fundamental solution of differential operator, recently the present contributor,
refer. 3, made some substantial headway to derive the orthonormal RBF wavelets
series and transforms. The methodology can be generalized to create the RBF
wavelets by means of the orthogonal convolution kernel function of various
integral operators. In particular, it is stressed that the presented RBF
wavelets does not apply the tensor product to handle multivariate problems at
all.
  This note is to correct some errata in reference 3 and also to supply a few
latest advances in the study of orthornormal RBF wavelet transforms.
