We study a generalization of the standard trapping problem of random walk
theory in which particles move subdiffusively on a one-dimensional lattice. We
consider the cases in which the lattice is filled with a one-sided and a
two-sided random distribution of static absorbing traps with concentration c.
The survival probability Phi(t) that the random walker is not trapped by time t
is obtained exactly in both versions of the problem through a fractional
diffusion approach. Comparison with simulation results is made
