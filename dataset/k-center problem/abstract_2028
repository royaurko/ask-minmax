Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring. Denote by mod R the category of
finitely generated R-modules. In this paper, we consider the classification
problem of resolving subcategories of mod R in terms of specialization-closed
subsets of Spec R. We give a classification of the resolving subcategories
closed under tensor products and transposes. Under restrictive hypotheses, we
also give better classification results.
