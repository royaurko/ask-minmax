We present a notion of weak solution for the Dirichlet problem driven by the
fractional Laplacian, following the Stampacchia theory. Then, we study
semilinear problems on bounded domains $\Omega$ with two different boundary
conditions at the same time: the shape of the solution outside $\Omega$ and a
weighted limit to the boundary. We allow the nonlinearity to be positive or
negative and we look for solutions blowing up at the boundary. Our starting
observation is the existence of s-harmonic functions which explode at the
boundary: these will be used both as supersolutions in the case of negative
nonlinearity and as subsolutions in the positive case.
