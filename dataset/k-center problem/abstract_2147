The problem of representing a class of maps in a form suited for application
of normal form methods is revisited. It is shown that using the methods of Lie
series and of Lie transform a normal form algorithm is constructed in a
straightforward manner. The examples of the Scrh\"oder--Siegel map and of the
Chirikov standard map are included, with extension to arbitrary dimension.
