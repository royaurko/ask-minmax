This paper presents a formulation of Noether's theorem for fractional
classical fields.
  We extend the variational formulations for fractional discrete systems to
fractional field systems. By applying the variational principle to a fractional
action $S$, we obtain the fractional Euler-Lagrange equations of motion.
Considerations of the Noether's variational problem for discrete systems whose
action is invariant under gauge transformations will be extended to fractional
variational problems for classical fields. The conservation laws associated
with fractional classical fields are derived. As an example we present the
conservation laws for the fractional Dirac fields.
