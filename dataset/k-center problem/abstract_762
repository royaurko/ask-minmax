We study invariant measures of a piecewise expanding map in $\mathbb{R}^m$
defined by an expanding similitude modulo lattice. Using the result of Bang on
a problem of Tarski, we show that when the similarity ratio is not less than
$m+1$, it has an absolutely continuous invariant measure equivalent to the
$m$-dimensional Lebesgue measure, under some mild assumption on the fundamental
domain. Applying the method to the case $m=2$, we obtain an alternative proof
of the result in Akiyama-Caalim:2015 together with some improvement.
