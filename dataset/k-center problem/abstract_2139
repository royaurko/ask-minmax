For a Hamilton-Jacobi equation defined on a network, we introduce its
vanishing viscosity approximation. The elliptic equation is given on the edges
and coupled with Kirchhoff-type conditions at the transition vertices. We prove
that there exists exactly one solution of this elliptic approximation and
mainly that, as the viscosity vanishes, it converges to the unique solution of
the original problem.
