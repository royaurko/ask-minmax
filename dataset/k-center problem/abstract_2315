We survey some recent results in Ramsey theory. We indicate their connections
with topological dynamics. On the foundational side, we describe an abstract
approach to finite Ramsey theory. We give one new application of the abstract
approach through which we make a connection with the theme of duality in Ramsey
theory. We finish with some open problems.
