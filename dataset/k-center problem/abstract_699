A rational set in the plane is a point set with all its pairwise distances
rational. Ulam and Erd\'os conjectured in 1945 that there is no dense rational
set in the plane. In this paper we associate special surfaces, we call them
distance surfaces, to finite (rational) sets in the plane. We prove that under
a mild condition on the points in the rational set $S$ the associated distance
surface in $\mathbb{P}^3$ is a surface of general type. Also if we assume
Bombieri-Lang Conjecture in arithmetic algebraic geometry we can answer the
Erd\'os-Ulam problem.
