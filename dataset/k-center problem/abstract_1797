The aim of this paper is investigating of Orlicz spaces with exponential
function and correspondence Orlicz norm: we introduce some new equivalent
norms, obtain the tail characterization, study the product of functions in
Orlicz spaces etc. We consider some applications: estimation of operators in
Orlicz spaces and problem of martingales convergence and divergence
