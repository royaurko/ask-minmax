In this paper we have examined the linear stability of triangular equilibrium
points in the generalised photogravitational restricted three body problem with
Poynting-Robertson drag. We have found the position of triangular equilibrium
points of our problem. The problem is generalised in the sense that smaller
primary is supposed to be an oblate spheroid. The bigger primary is considered
as radiating. The equations of motion are affected by radiation pressure force,
oblateness and P-R drag. All classical results involving photogravitational and
oblateness in restricted three body problem may be verified from this result.
With the help of characteristic equation, we discussed the stability. Finally
we conclude that triangular equilibrium points are unstable.
