The problem of counting the different ways of folding the planar triangular
lattice is shown to be equivalent to that of counting the possible 3-colorings
of its bonds, a dual version of the 3-coloring problem of the hexagonal lattice
solved by Baxter. The folding entropy Log q per triangle is thus given by
Baxter's formula q=sqrt(3)(Gamma[1/3])^(3/2)/2pi =1.2087...
