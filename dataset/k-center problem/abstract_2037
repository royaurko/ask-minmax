A group is metabelian if its commutator subgroup is abelian. For finitely
generated metabelian groups, classical commutative algebra, algebraic geometry
and geometric group theory, especially the latter two subjects, can be brought
to bear on their study. The object of this paper is to describe some of the new
ideas and open problems that arise.
