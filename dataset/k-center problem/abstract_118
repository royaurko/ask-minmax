Alexander Premet has stated the following problem: what is a relation between
subregular nilpotent representations of a classical semisimple restricted Lie
algebra and non-commutative deformations of the corresponding singularities? We
solve this problem for type $A$. Using the McKay correspondence, we relate the
solution to bases in equivariant $K$-theory introduced by Lusztig.
