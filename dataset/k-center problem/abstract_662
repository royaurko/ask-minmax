The contributors consider the interior Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation on
planar domains with corners. In order to approximate the solution of the
corresponding double layer boundary integral equation, they propose a numerical
method of Nystrom type, based on a Lobatto quadrature rule.The convergence and
stability of the method are proved and some numerical tests are included.
