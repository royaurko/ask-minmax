Making use of generalized calibrated geometry and G-structures we put the
problem of finding string-duals with smeared backreacting flavor branes in a
more mathematical setting. This more formal treatment of the problem allows us
to easily smear branes without good coordinate representations, establish
constraints on the smearing form and identify a topological central charge in
the SUSY algebra. After exhibiting our methods for a series of well known
examples, we apply them to the problem of flavoring a supergravity-dual to a
d=2+1 dimensional N=2 super Yang-Mills-like theory. We find new solutions to
both the flavored and unflavored systems. Interpretating these turns out to be
difficult.
