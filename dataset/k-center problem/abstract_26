Using the well-known experimental data the inverse problem of neutrino
diagnostics of reactor core is considered. The solution of this problem makes
it possible to determine distantly the current value of nuclear density of each
nuclear fuel components with known accuracy and also opens up the possibility
for the development of neutrino online technology of temporal evolution of
nuclear fuel isotopic structure and reactor power.
