This work deals with a classic problem: "Given a set of coins among which
there is a counterfeit coin of a different weight, find this counterfeit coin
using ordinary balance scales, with the minimum number of weighings possible,
and indicate whether it weighs less or more than the rest". The method proposed
here not only calculates the minimum number of weighings necessary, but also
indicates how to perform these weighings, it is easily mechanizeable and valid
for any number of coins. Instructions are also given as to how to generalize
the procedure to include cases where there is more than one counterfeit coin.
