Finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) has been developed over the past
decade as a framework for constructing and analyzing stable and accurate
numerical methods for partial differential equations by employing differential
complexes. The recent work of Arnold, Falk and Winther \cite{ArFaWi2010}
includes a well-developed theory of finite element methods for Hodge Laplace
problems, including a priori error estimates. In this work we focus on
developing a posteriori error estimates in which the computational error is
bounded by some computable functional of the discrete solution and problem
data. More precisely, we prove a posteriori error estimates of residual type
for Arnold-Falk-Winther mixed finite element methods for Hodge-de Rham Laplace
problems. While a number of previous works consider a posteriori error
estimation for Maxwell's equations and mixed formulations of the scalar
Laplacian, the approach we take is distinguished by unified treatment of the
various Hodge Laplace problems arising in the de Rham complex, consistent use
of the language and analytical framework of differential forms, and the
development of a posteriori error estimates for harmonic forms and the effects
of their approximation on the resulting numerical method for the Hodge
Laplacian.
