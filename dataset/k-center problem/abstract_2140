We show how to construct a topological Markov map of the interval whose
invariant probability measure is the stationary law of a given stochastic chain
of infinite order. In particular we caracterize the maps corresponding to
stochastic chains with memory of variable length. The problem treated here is
the converse of the classical construction of the Gibbs formalism for Markov
expanding maps of the interval.
