Quantum mechanics of models is considered which are constructed in spaces
with Lie algebra type commutation relations between spatial coordinates. The
case is specialized to that of the group SU(2), for which the formulation of
the problem via the Euler parameterization is also presented. SU(2)-invariant
systems are discussed, and the corresponding eigenvalue problem for the
Hamiltonian is reduced to an ordinary differential equation, as it is the case
with such models on commutative spaces.
