We discuss the problem of classifying all local CR diffeomorphisms of a
strictly pseudoconvex surface. Our method exploits the Tanaka--Webster
pseudohermitian invariants, their transformation formulae, and the Chern--Moser
invariants. Our main application concerns a class of generalized ellipsoids
where we classify all local CR mappings.
