Survey Propagation is an algorithm designed for solving typical instances of
random constraint satisfiability problems. It has been successfully tested on
random 3-SAT and random $G(n,\frac{c}{n})$ graph 3-coloring, in the hard region
of the parameter space. Here we provide a generic formalism which applies to a
wide class of discrete Constraint Satisfaction Problems.
