These lecture notes for the IAS/Park City Graduate Summer School in Geometric
Combinatorics (July 2004) provide an overview of poset topology. These notes
include introductory material, as well as recent developments and open
problems. Some of the topics covered are: subspace arrangements, graph
complexes, group actions on poset homology, shellability, recursive techniques,
and fiber theorems.
