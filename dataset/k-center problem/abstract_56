We discuss the local and global problems for the equivalence of geometric
structures of an arbitrary order and, in later sections, attention is given to
what really matters, namely the equivalence with respect to transformations
belonging to a given pseudo-group of transformations. We first give attention
to general prolongation spaces and thereafter insert the structures in their
most appropriate ambient namely, as specific solutions of partial differential
equations where the equivalence problem is then discussed. In the second part,
we discuss applications of all this abstract nonsense and take considerable
advantage in exploring \'Elie Cartan's magical trump called transformations et
prolongements m\'eri\'edriques that somehow seem absent in present day
geometry.
