A Lipschitz hypersurface is a hypersurface which locally is the graph of a
Lipschitz function. A Lipschitz (or C^1) hypersurface is said to be Levi-flat
if it is locally foliated by complex manifolds of complex dimension (n-1). We
shall prove that there exist no Lipschitz Levi-flat hypersurfaces in CP^n with
n >= 3.
  Our new estimates on the d-bar-Cauchy problems are different from the earlier
Siu's integral kernal method.
