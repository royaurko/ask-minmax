We propose a generalisation of concurrent Kleene algebra \cite{Hoa09} that
can take account of probabilistic effects in the presence of concurrency. The
algebra is proved sound with respect to a model of automata modulo a variant of
rooted $\eta$-simulation equivalence. Applicability is demonstrated by
algebraic treatments of two examples: algebraic may testing and Rabin's
solution to the choice coordination problem.
