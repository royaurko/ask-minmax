We investigate a method to compute a finite set of preliminary orbits for
solar system bodies using the first integrals of the Kepler problem. This
method is thought for the applications to the modern sets of astrometric
observations, where often the information contained in the observations allows
only to compute, by interpolation, two angular positions of the observed body
and their time derivatives at a given epoch; we call this set of data
attributable. Given two attributables of the same body at two different epochs
we can use the energy and angular momentum integrals of the two-body problem to
write a system of polynomial equations for the topocentric distance and the
radial velocity at the two epochs. We define two different algorithms for the
computation of the solutions, based on different ways to perform elimination of
variables and obtain a univariate polynomial. Moreover we use the redundancy of
the data to test the hypothesis that two attributables belong to the same body
(linkage problem). It is also possible to compute a covariance matrix,
describing the uncertainty of the preliminary orbits which results from the
observation error statistics. The performance of this method has been
investigated by using a large set of simulated observations of the Pan-STARRS
project.
