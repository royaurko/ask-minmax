Let $u_n$ be a nondegenerate Lucas sequence. We generalize the results of
Bugeaud, Mignotte, and Siksek, 2006 to give a systematic approach towards the
problem of determining all perfect powers in any particular Lucas sequence. We
then prove a general bound on admissible prime powers in a Lucas sequence
assuming the Frey-Mazur conjecture on isomorphic mod $p$ Galois representations
of elliptic curves.
