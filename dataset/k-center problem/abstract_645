This paper addresses a construction of new $q-$Hermite polynomials with a
full characterization of their main properties and corresponding raising and
lowering operator algebra. The three-term recursive relation as well as the
second-order differential equation obeyed by these new polynomials are
explicitly derived. Relevant operator actions, including the eigenvalue problem
of the deformed oscillator and the self-adjointness of the related position and
momentum operators, are investigated and analyzed. The associated coherent
states are constructed and discussed with an explicit resolution of the induced
moment problem.
