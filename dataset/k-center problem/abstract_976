Social decision support systems are able to aggregate the local perspectives
of a diverse group of individuals into a global social decision. This paper
presents a multi-relational network ontology and grammar-based particle swarm
algorithm capable of aggregating the decisions of millions of individuals. This
framework supports a diverse problem space and a broad range of vote
aggregation algorithms. These algorithms account for individual expertise and
representation across different domains of the group problem space. Individuals
are able to pose and categorize problems, generate potential solutions, choose
trusted representatives, and vote for particular solutions. Ultimately, via a
social decision making algorithm, the system aggregates all the individual
votes into a single collective decision.
