We consider the decidability and complexity of the Ultimate Positivity
Problem, which asks whether all but finitely many terms of a given rational
linear recurrence sequence (LRS) are positive. Using lower bounds in
Diophantine approximation concerning sums of S-units, we show that for simple
LRS (those whose characteristic polynomial has no repeated roots) the Ultimate
Positivity Problem is decidable in polynomial space. If we restrict to simple
LRS of a fixed order then we obtain a polynomial-time decision procedure. As a
complexity lower bound we show that Ultimate Positivity for simple LRS is hard
for co$\exists\mathbb{R}$, i.e., the class of problems solvable in the
universal theory of the reals (which lies between coNP and PSPACE).
