Gradient boundedness up to the boundary for solutions to Dirichlet and
Neumann problems for elliptic systems with Uhlenbeck type structure is
established. Nonlinearities of possibly non-polynomial type are allowed, and
minimal regularity on the data and on the boundary of the domain is assumed.
The case of arbitrary bounded convex domains is also included.
