We study dynamical supersymmetry breaking in vector-like superconformal N=1
gauge theories. We find appropriate deformations of the superpotential to
overcome the problem of the instability of the non supersymmetric vacuum. The
request for long lifetime translates into constraints on the physical couplings
which in this regime can be controlled through efficient RG analysis.
