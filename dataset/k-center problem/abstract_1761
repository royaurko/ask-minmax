We survey finite energy inverse results in N-body scattering, and we also
sketch the proof of the extension of our recent two-cluster to two-cluster
three-body result to the many-body case: this requires only minor
modifications. We also indicate how to extend a free-to-free inverse result in
three-body scattering to the many-body case.
