The smallness of the vacuum energy density and its near coincidence with the
average matter density of the universe are naturally explained by anthropic
selection. An alternative explanation, based on the cyclic model of Steinhardt
and Turok, does not address the coincidence problem and is therefore less
convincing. This article appeared in ``Science'' (4 May 2006) as a
``perspective'' for Steinhardt and Turok's paper in the same issue
(astro-ph/0605173).
