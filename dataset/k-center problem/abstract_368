We study the scattering problem for the nonlinear wave equation with
potential. In the absence of the potential, one has sharp existence results for
the Cauchy problem with small initial data; those require the data to decay at
a rate greater than or equal to a critical decay rate which depends on the
order of the nonlinearity. However, scattering results have appeared only for
the supercritical case. In this paper, we extend the scattering results to the
critical case and we also allow the presence of a short-range potential.
