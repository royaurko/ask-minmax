We present an accurate, stable and efficient solution to the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation for electromagnetic scattering in two dimensions.
The method is well suited for multiple scattering problems and may be applied
to problems with scatterers of arbitrary shape or non-homogenous background
materials. We illustrate the method by calculating light emission from a line
source in a finite sized photonic crystal waveguide.
