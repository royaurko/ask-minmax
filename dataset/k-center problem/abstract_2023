We study the (non-uniform) quantified constraint satisfaction problem QCSP(H)
as H ranges over partially reflexive forests. We obtain a complexity-theoretic
dichotomy: QCSP(H) is either in NL or is NP-hard. The separating condition is
related firstly to connectivity, and thereafter to accessibility from all
vertices of H to connected reflexive subgraphs. In the case of partially
reflexive paths, we give a refinement of our dichotomy: QCSP(H) is either in NL
or is Pspace-complete.
