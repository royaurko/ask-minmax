We prove that under natural assumptions on the data strong solutions in
Sobolev spaces of semilinear parabolic equations in divergence form involving
measure on the right-hand side may be represented by solutions of some
generalized backward stochastic differential equations. As an application we
provide stochastic representation of strong solutions of the obstacle problem
be means of solutions of some reflected backward stochastic differential
equations. To prove the latter result we use a stochastic homographic
approximation for solutions of the reflected backward equation. The
approximation may be viewed as a stochastic analogue of the homographic
approximation for solutions to the obstacle problem.
