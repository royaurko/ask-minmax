A q-analogue of de Finetti's theorem is obtained in terms of a boundary
problem for the q-Pascal graph. For q a power of prime this leads to a
characterisation of random spaces over the Galois field F_q that are invariant
under the natural action of the infinite group of invertible matrices with
coefficients from F_q.
