In this paper we study two types of exponential instability -- parametric
resonance and chaos. We show that a given equation may produce chaos or
parametric resonance, depending how the problem is defined. In so doing we
establish a relationship between the Floquet indices (associated with
parametric resonance) and Lyapunov exponents (associated with chaos).
