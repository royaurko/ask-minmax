The problem of pattern selection in absolutely unstable open flow systems is
investigated by considering the example of Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection. The
spatiotemporal structure of convection rolls propagating downstream in an
externally imposed flow is determined for six different inlet/outlet boundary
conditions. Results are obtained by numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes
equations and by comparison with the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau amplitude
equation. A unique selection process is observed being a function of the
control parameters and the boundary conditions but independent of the history
and the system length. The problem can be formulated in terms of a nonlinear
eigen/boundary value problem where the frequency of the propagating pattern is
the eigenvalue. PACS: 47.54.+r, 47.20.Bp, 47.27.Te, 47.20.Ky
