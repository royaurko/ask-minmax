We prove uniqueness of a martingale problem with boundary conditions on a
simplex associated to a differential operator with an unbounded drift. We show
that the solution of the martingale problem remains absorbed at the boundary
once it attains it, and that, after hitting the boundary, it performs a
diffusion on a lower dimensional simplex, similar to the original one. We also
prove that in the diffusive time scale condensing zero-range processes evolve
as this absorbed diffusion.
