In this article, we consider the inverse problem of determining spatially
heterogeneous absorption and diffusion coefficient from a single measurement of
the absorbed energy (in the diffusion approximation of light transfer). This
problem, which is central in quantitative photoacoustic tomography, is in
general ill-posed since it admits an infinite number of solution pairs. We show
that when the coefficients are known to be piecewise constant functions, a
unique solution can be obtained. For the numerical determination of the
coefficients, we suggest a variational method based based on the
Mumford-Shah-functional, which we implemented numerically and tested on
simulated two-dimensional data.
