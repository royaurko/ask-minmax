I investigate the bound state problems of lowest-lying mesons and heavy
mesons. Chiral symmetry is essential when one consider lowest-lying mesons.
Heavy quark symmetry plays an central role in considering the semi-leptonic
form factors of heavy mesons. Various properties based on the symmetries are
revealed using Bethe-Salpeter equations.
