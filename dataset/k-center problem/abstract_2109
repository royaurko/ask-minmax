We study the Cauchy problem for a semilinear stochastic partial differential
equation driven by a finite-dimensional Wiener process. In particular, under
the hypothesis that all the coefficients are sufficiently smooth and have
bounded derivatives, we consider the equation in the context of power scale
generated by a strongly elliptic differential operator. Application of
semigroup arguments then yields the existence of a continuous strong solution.
