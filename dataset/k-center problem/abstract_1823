We consider a generalized version in continuous time of the parking problem
of Knuth. Files arrive following a Poisson point process and are stored on a
hardware identified with the real line, at the right of their arrival point. We
study here the evolution of the extremities of the data block straddling 0,
which is empty at time 0 and is equal to $\RRR$ at a deterministic time.
