We describe a slightly sub-exponential time algorithm for learning parity
functions in the presence of random classification noise. This results in a
polynomial-time algorithm for the case of parity functions that depend on only
the first O(log n log log n) bits of input. This is the first known instance of
an efficient noise-tolerant algorithm for a concept class that is provably not
learnable in the Statistical Query model of Kearns. Thus, we demonstrate that
the set of problems learnable in the statistical query model is a strict subset
of those problems learnable in the presence of noise in the PAC model.
  In coding-theory terms, what we give is a poly(n)-time algorithm for decoding
linear k by n codes in the presence of random noise for the case of k = c log n
loglog n for some c > 0. (The case of k = O(log n) is trivial since one can
just individually check each of the 2^k possible messages and choose the one
that yields the closest codeword.)
  A natural extension of the statistical query model is to allow queries about
statistical properties that involve t-tuples of examples (as opposed to single
examples). The second result of this paper is to show that any class of
functions learnable (strongly or weakly) with t-wise queries for t = O(log n)
is also weakly learnable with standard unary queries. Hence this natural
extension to the statistical query model does not increase the set of weakly
learnable functions.
