The Jacobi theta-functions admit a definition through the autonomous
differential equations (dynamical system); not only through the famous Fourier
theta-series. We study this system in the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics and
find corresponding Poisson brackets. Availability of these ingredients allows
us to state the problem of a canonical quantization to these equations and
disclose some important problems. In a particular case the problem is
completely solvable in the sense that spectrum of the Hamiltonian can be found.
The spectrum is continuous, has a band structure with infinite number of
lacunae, and is determined by the Mathieu equation: the Schr\"odinger equation
with a periodic cos-type potential.
