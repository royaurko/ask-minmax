This article is concerned with the problem of minimising the Willmore energy
in the class of connected surfaces with prescribed area which are confined to a
container. We propose a phase field approximation based on de Giorgi's diffuse
Willmore functional to this variational problem. Our main contribution is a
penalisation term which ensures connectedness in the sharp interface limit.
  For sequences of phase fields with bounded diffuse Willmore energy and
bounded area term, we prove uniform convergence in two ambient space dimensions
and a certain weak mode of convergence on curves in three dimensions. This
enables us to show $\Gamma$-convergence to a sharp interface problem that only
allows for connected structures. The topological contribution is based on a
geodesic distance chosen to be small between two points that lie on the same
connected component of the transition layer of the phase field.
  We furthermore present numerical evidence of the effectiveness of our model.
The implementation relies on a coupling of Dijkstra's algorithm in order to
compute the topological penalty to a finite element approach for the Willmore
term.
