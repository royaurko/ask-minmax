We present a short review of strange quark matter in supernovae and related
explosions, with particular attention to the issue of the propagation of the
combustion in the dense stellar environment. We discuss the instabilities
affecting the flame and present some new results of application to the
turbulent regime. The transition to the distributed regime and further
deflagration-to-detonation mechanism are addressed. Finally we show that
magnetic fields may be important for this problem, because they modify the
flame through the dispersion relations which characterize the instabilities. A
tentative classification of explosive phenomena according to the value of the
average local magnetic field affecting the burning and the type of stellar
system in which this conversion is taking place is presented. As a general
result, we conclude that "short" conversion timescales are always favored,
since the burning falls in either the turbulent Rayleigh-Taylor (or even the
distributed) regime, or perhaps in the detonation one. In both cases the
velocity is several orders of magnitude larger than $v_{lam}$, and therefore
the latter is irrelevant in practice for this problem. Interesting perspectives
for the study of this problem are still open and important issues need to be
addressed.
