The perceived inability of the Skyrme model to reproduce pseudovector
pion-baryon coupling has come to be known as the ``Yukawa problem.'' In this
talk, we review the complete solution to this problem. The solution involves a
new configuration known as the rotationally improved Skyrmion, or ``RISKY,'' in
which the hedgehog structure is modified by a small quadrupole distortion. We
illustrate our ideas both in the Skyrme model and in a simpler model with a
global U(1) symmetry.
