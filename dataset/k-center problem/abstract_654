In this work, we show high order splitting methods of integration without
negative steps, allowing us to solve numerically irreversible problems, like
reaction-diffusion equations. The methods consist in a suitable affine
combinations of Lie-Trotter schemes with different steps. We prove convergence
of this methods for a large class of semi-linear problems, that includes
Hamiltonian and reaction-diffusion systems.
