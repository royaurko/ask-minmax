The main goal of this paper is to achieve a simultaneous treatment of the
even and odd truncated matricial Hamburger moment problems in the most general
case. In the odd case, these results are completely new for the matrix case,
whereas the scalar version was recently treated by V. A. Derkach, S. Hassi and
H. S. V. de Snoo. The even case was studied earlier by G.-N. Chen and Y.-J. Hu.
Our approach is based on Schur analysis methods. More precisely, we use two
interrelated versions of Schur-type algorithms, namely an algebraic one and a
function-theoretic one. The algebraic version was worked out in a former paper
of the contributors. It is an algorithm which is applied to finite or infinite
sequences of complex matrices. The construction and investigation of the
function-theoretic version of our Schur-type algorithm is a central theme of
this paper. This algorithm will be applied to relevant subclasses of
holomorphic matrix-valued functions of the Herglotz-Nevanlinna class. Using
recent results on the holomorphicity of the Moore-Penrose inverse of
matrix-valued Herglotz-Nevanlinna functions, we obtain a complete description
of the solution set of the moment problem under consideration in the most
general situation.
