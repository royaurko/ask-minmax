We study the problem of generating a test sequence that achieves maximal
coverage for a reactive system under test. We formulate the problem as a
repeated game between the tester and the system, where the system state space
is partitioned according to some coverage criterion and the objective of the
tester is to maximize the set of partitions (or coverage goals) visited during
the game. We show the complexity of the maximal coverage problem for
non-deterministic systems is PSPACE-complete, but is NP-complete for
deterministic systems. For the special case of non-deterministic systems with a
re-initializing ``reset'' action, which represent running a new test input on a
re-initialized system, we show that the complexity is again co-NP-complete. Our
proof technique for reset games uses randomized testing strategies that
circumvent the exponentially large memory requirement in the deterministic
case.
