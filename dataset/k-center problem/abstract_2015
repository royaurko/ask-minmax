Two different aspects of the description of three- and four-nucleon systems
are addressed. The use of bound state like wave functions to describe
scattering states in $N-d$ collisions at low energies and the effects of some
of the widely used three-nucleon force models in selected polarization
observables in the three- and four-nucleon systems are discussed.
