We consider the problem of finding equivalent minimal-size reformulations of
SQL queries in presence of embedded dependencies [1]. Our focus is on
select-project-join (SPJ) queries with equality comparisons, also known as safe
conjunctive (CQ) queries, possibly with grouping and aggregation. For SPJ
queries, the semantics of the SQL standard treat query answers as multisets
(a.k.a. bags), whereas the stored relations may be treated either as sets,
which is called bag-set semantics for query evaluation, or as bags, which is
called bag semantics. (Under set semantics, both query answers and stored
relations are treated as sets.)
  In the context of the above Query-Reformulation Problem, we develop a
comprehensive framework for equivalence of CQ queries under bag and bag-set
semantics in presence of embedded dependencies, and make a number of conceptual
and technical contributions. Specifically, we develop equivalence tests for CQ
queries in presence of arbitrary sets of embedded dependencies under bag and
bag-set semantics, under the condition that chase [9] under set semantics
(set-chase) on the inputs terminates. We also present equivalence tests for
aggregate CQ queries in presence of embedded dependencies. We use our
equivalence tests to develop sound and complete (whenever set-chase on the
inputs terminates) algorithms for solving instances of the Query-Reformulation
Problem with CQ queries under each of bag and bag-set semantics, as well as for
instances of the problem with aggregate queries.
