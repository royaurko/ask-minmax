We prove that the description of cubic functors is a wild problem in the
sense of the representation theory. On the contrary, we describe several
special classes of such functors (2-divisible, weakly alternative, vector
spaces and torsion free ones). We also prove that cubic functors can be defined
locally and obtain corollaries about their projective dimensions and torsion
free parts.
