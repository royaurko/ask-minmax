We consider the problem of efficient estimation for the drift of fractional
Brownian motion $B^H:=(B^H_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ with hurst parameter $H$ less than
1/2. We also construct superefficient James-Stein type estimators which
dominate, under the usual quadratic risk, the natural maximum likelihood
estimator.
