The finite-size spectrum in the Kondo problem is obtained from the
Bethe-ansatz solution of the exactly solved models. We investigate the Anderson
model, the highly correlated SU($\nu$) Anderson model and the {\it s-d}
exchange model. For all these models we find that the spectra exhibit the
properties characteristic of the Fermi liquid fixed point, and hence our
microscopic calculations are in accordance with the results obtained by
boundary conformal field theory with current algebra symmetry.
