Parametric filters, such as the Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented
Kalman Filter, typically scale well with the dimensionality of the problem, but
they are known to fail if the posterior state distribution cannot be closely
approximated by a density of the assumed parametric form. For nonparametric
filters, such as the Particle Filter, the converse holds. Such methods are able
to approximate any posterior, but the computational requirements scale
exponentially with the number of dimensions of the state space. In this paper,
we present the Coordinate Particle Filter which alleviates this problem. We
propose to compute the particle weights recursively, dimension by dimension.
This allows us to explore one dimension at a time, and resample after each
dimension if necessary. Experimental results on simulated as well as real data
confirm that the proposed method has a substantial performance advantage over
the Particle Filter in high-dimensional systems where not all dimensions are
highly correlated. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method for the
problem of multi-object and robotic manipulator tracking.
