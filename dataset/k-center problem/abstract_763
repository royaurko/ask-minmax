Two non-equidistant grid implementations of infinite range exterior complex
scaling are introduced that allow for perfect absorption in the time dependent
Schr\"odinger equation. Finite element discrete variables grid discretizations
provide as efficient absorption as the corresponding finite elements basis set
discretizations. This finding is at variance with results reported in
literature [L. Tao et al., Phys. Rev. A 48, 063419 (2009)]. For finite
differences, a new class of generalized $Q$-point schemes for non-equidistant
grids is derived. Convergence of absorption is exponential $\sim \Delta
x^{Q-1}$ and numerically robust. Local relative errors $\sim10^{-9}$ are
achieved in a standard problem of strong-field ionization.
