A word w is called a synchronizing word of deterministic finite automaton
(DFA) if w sends all states of the automaton to a unique state. In 1964, Jan
\v{C}erny discovered a sequence of n-state complete DFA possessing a minimal
synchronizing word of length (n-1)2. The \v{C}erny conjecture claims that it is
also the upper bound on the length of such a word for a complete DFA. The
problem has motivated great and constantly growing number of investigations and
generalizations and together with the Road Coloring problem is considered as a
most fascinating old problem in the theory of finite automata. An effort to
prove the \v{C}erny conjecture is presented.
