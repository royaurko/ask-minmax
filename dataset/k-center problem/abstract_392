We solve the moment problem for convex distribution functions on $[0,1]$ in
terms of completely alternating sequences. This complements a recent solution
of this problem by Diaconis and Freedman, and relates this work to the
L\'{e}vy-Khintchine formula for the Laplace transform of a subordinator, and to
regenerative composition structures.
