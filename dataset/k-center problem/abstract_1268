In spite of the great progress we have seen in recent years in the derivation
of nuclear forces from chiral effective field theory (EFT), some important
issues are still unresolved. In this contribution, we discuss the open problems
which have particular relevance for microscopic nuclear structure, namely, the
proper renormalization of chiral nuclear potentials and sub-leading many-body
forces.
