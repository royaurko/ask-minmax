The paper addresses the $k$-tangle enumeration problem. We introduce a notion
of cascade diagram for $k$-tangle projections. An effective enumeration
algorithm for projections is proposed based on cascade representation. Tangles
projections with up to 12 crossings are tabulated. We provide also pictures of
alternating $k$-tangles with 5 crossing or less.
