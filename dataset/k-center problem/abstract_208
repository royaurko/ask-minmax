Let a three-dimensional isotropic elastic body be described by the Lam\'e
system with the body force of the form $F(x,t)=\phi(t)f(x)$, where $\phi$ is
known. We consider the problem of determining the unknown spatial term $f(x)$
of the body force where the surface stress history is given as the
overdetermination. This inverse problem is ill-posed. Using the interpolation
method and truncated Fourier series, we construct a regularized solution from
approximate data and provide explicit error estimates.
