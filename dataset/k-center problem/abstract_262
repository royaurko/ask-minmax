In this paper, we propose the problem of online cost-sensitive clas- sifier
adaptation and the first algorithm to solve it. We assume we have a base
classifier for a cost-sensitive classification problem, but it is trained with
respect to a cost setting different to the desired one. Moreover, we also have
some training data samples streaming to the algorithm one by one. The prob- lem
is to adapt the given base classifier to the desired cost setting using the
steaming training samples online. To solve this problem, we propose to learn a
new classifier by adding an adaptation function to the base classifier, and
update the adaptation function parameter according to the streaming data
samples. Given a input data sample and the cost of misclassifying it, we up-
date the adaptation function parameter by minimizing cost weighted hinge loss
and respecting previous learned parameter simultaneously. The proposed
algorithm is compared to both online and off-line cost-sensitive algorithms on
two cost-sensitive classification problems, and the experiments show that it
not only outperforms them one classification performances, but also requires
significantly less running time.
