We are concerned with a priori estimates for the obstacle problem of a wide
class of fully nonlinear equations on Riemannian manifolds. We use new
techniques introduced by Bo Guan and derive new results for a priori second
order estimates of its singular perturbation problem under fairly general
conditions. By approximation, the existence of a C^{1,1} viscosity solution is
proved.
