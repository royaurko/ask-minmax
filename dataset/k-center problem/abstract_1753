This paper presents a construction of fibered links $(K,\Sigma)$ out of chord
diagrams $\sL$. Let $\Gamma$ be the incidence graph of $\sL$. Under certain
conditions on $\sL$ the symmetrized Seifert matrix of $(K,\Sigma)$ equals the
bilinear form of the simply-laced Coxeter system $(W,S)$ associated to
$\Gamma$; and the monodromy of $(K,\Sigma)$ equals minus the Coxeter element of
$(W,S)$. Lehmer's problem is solved for the monodromy of these Coxeter links.
