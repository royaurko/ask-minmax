This paper contains a self-contained brief presentation of the scattering
theory for periodic structures. Its main result is a theorem (the Modified
Rayleigh Conjecture, or MRC), which gives a rigorous foundation for a numerical
method for solving the direct scattering problem for periodic structures. A
numerical example illustrating the procedure is presented.
