Problems in program analysis can be solved by developing novel program
semantics and deriving abstractions conventionally. For over thirty years,
higher-order program analysis has been sold as a hard problem. Its solutions
have required ingenuity and complex models of approximation. We claim that this
difficulty is due to premature focus on abstraction and propose a new approach
that emphasizes semantics. Its simplicity enables new analyses that are beyond
the current state of the art.
