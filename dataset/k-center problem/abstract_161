We study reaction-diffusion equations in cylinders with possibly nonlinear
diffusion and possibly nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions. We provide a
geometric Poincar\'e-type inequality and classification results for stable
solutions, and we apply them to the study of an associated nonlocal problem. We
also establish a counterexample in the corresponding framework for the
fractional Laplacian.
