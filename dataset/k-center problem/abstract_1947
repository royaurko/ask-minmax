The coupled-cluster wave function factorizes to a very good approximation
into a product of an intrinsic wave function and a Gaussian for the
center-of-mass coordinate. The width of the Gaussian is in general not
identical to the oscillator length of the underlying single-particle basis. The
quality of the separation can be verified by a simple procedure.
