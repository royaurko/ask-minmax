The fibre theorem \cite{schm2003} for the moment problem on closed
semi-algebraic subsets of $\R^d$ is generalized to finitely generated real
unital algebras. As an application two new theorems on the rational
multidimensional moment problem are proved. Another application is a
characterization of moment functionals on the polynomial algebra
$\R[x_1,\dots,x_d]$ in terms of extensions. Finally, the fibre theorem and the
extension theorem are used to reprove basic results on the complex moment
problem due to Stochel and Szafraniec \cite{stochelsz} and Bisgaard
\cite{bisgaard}.
