We study an elementary problem of the topological robotics: collective motion
of a set of $n$ distinct particles which one has to move from an initial
configuration to a final configuration, with the requirement that no collisions
occur in the process of motion. The ultimate goal is to construct an algorithm
which will perform this task once the initial and the final configurations are
given. This reduces to a topological problem of finding the topological
complexity TC(C_n(\R^m)) of the configutation space C_n(\R^m) of $n$ distinct
ordered particles in \R^m. We solve this problem for m=2 (the planar case) and
for all odd m, including the case m=3 (particles in the three-dimensional
space). We also study a more general motion planning problem in Euclidean space
with a hyperplane arrangement as obstacle.
