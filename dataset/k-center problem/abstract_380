Let D be a divisor in a complex analytic manifold X. A natural problem is to
determine when the de Rham complex of meromorphic forms on X with poles along D
is quasi-isomorphic to its subcomplex of logarithmic forms. In this mostly
expository note, we recall the main results about this problem. In particular,
we point out the relevance of the theory of D-modules to this topic.
