In earlier work we have studied a method for discretization in time of a
parabolic problem which consists in representing the exact solution as an
integral in the complex plane and then applying a quadrature formula to this
integral. In application to a spatially semidiscrete finite element version of
the parabolic problem, at each quadrature point one then needs to solve a
linear algebraic system having a positive definite matrix with a complex shift,
and in this paper we study iterative methods for such systems. We first
consider the basic and a preconditioned version of the Richardson algorithm,
and then a conjugate gradient method as well as a preconditioned version
thereof.
