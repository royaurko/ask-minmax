The classical honeycomb conjecture asserts that any partition of the plane
into regions of equal area has perimeter at least that of the regular hexagonal
honeycomb tiling. Pappus discusses this problem in his preface to Book V. This
paper gives the first general proof of the conjecture.
  The revision is the published version, which allows disconnected honeycomb
cells and gaps between cells.
