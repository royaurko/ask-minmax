This is a survey of recent work on the structure of Tukey reductions among
analytic $\sigma$-ideals of compact subsets of compact metric spaces and
analytic P-ideals of sets of natural numbers. An attempt is made to organize
the results into a unified whole. This organization makes it possible to
identify natural unresolved problems. Some new joint results with Stevo
Todorcevic are announced.
