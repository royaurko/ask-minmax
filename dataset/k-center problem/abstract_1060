We use twisted sheaves to study the problem of index reduction for Brauer
classes. In general terms, this problem may be phrased as follows: given a
field $k$, a $k$-variety $X$, and a class $\alpha \in \Br(k)$, compute the
index of the class $\alpha_{k(X)} \in \Br(X)$ obtained from $\alpha$ by
extension of scalars to $k(X)$. We give a general method for computing index
reduction which refines classical results of Schofield and van den Bergh. When
$X$ is a curve of genus 1, we use Atiyah's theorem on the structure of stable
vector bundles with integral slope to show that our formula simplifies
dramatically, giving a complete solution to the index reduction problem in this
case. Using the twisted Fourier-Mukai transform, we show that a similarly
simple formula describes homogeneous index reduction on torsors under
higher-dimensional abelian varieties.
