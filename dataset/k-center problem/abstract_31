One of the central questions in theoretical particle physics, since already
several decades, has been that of "masses and mixings of the quarks. With the
entry of neutrino oscillations into the field, the issue of lepton masses has
added a new dimension to the problem. In the literature one finds many models
of quark and lepton mass matrices. However, the mass and mixing problems remain
unsolved.
  In this talk I will present my own contributions to this field, however as
you may expect without offering a solution. I encourage you to go ahead and
think about the problem but be aware of the pitfalls.
