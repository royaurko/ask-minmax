A method to determine the admissibility of symbolic sequences and to find the
unstable periodic orbits corresponding to allowed symbolic sequences for the
diamagnetic Kepler problem is proposed by using the ordering of stable and
unstable manifolds. By investigating the unstable periodic orbits up to length
6, a one to one correspondence between the unstable periodic orbits and their
corresponding symbolic sequences is shown under the system symmetry
decomposition.
