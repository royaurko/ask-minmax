We investigate the cosmological moduli problem by studying a modulus decay in
detail and find that the branching ratio of the gravitino production is
generically of O(0.01-1), which causes another cosmological disaster.
Consequently, the cosmological moduli problem cannot be solved simply by making
the modulus mass heavier than 100 TeV. We also illustrate our results by
explicitly calculating the branching ratio into the gravitinos in the mixed
modulus--anomaly/KKLT- and racetrack-type models.
