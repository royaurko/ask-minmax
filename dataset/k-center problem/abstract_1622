The heavy sfermion scenario is naturally realized when supersymmetry breaking
fields are charged under some symmetry or are composite fields. There, scalar
partners of standard model fermions and the gravitino are as heavy as
O(10-1000) TeV while gauginos are as heavy as O(1) TeV. The scenario is not
only consistent with the observed higgs mass, but also is free from
cosmological problems such as the Polonyi problem and the gravitino problem. In
the scenario, gauginos are primary targets of experimental searches. In this
thesis, we discuss gaugino masses in the heavy sfermion scenario. First, we
derive the so-called anomaly mediated gaugino mass in the superspace formalism
of supergravity with a Wilsonian effective action. Then we calculate gaugino
masses generated through other possible one-loop corrections by extra light
matter fields and the QCD axion. Finally, we consider the case where some
gauginos are degenerated in their masses with each other, because the thermal
relic abundance of the lightest supersymmetric particle as well as the the
strategy to search gauginos drastically change in this case. After calculating
the thermal relic abundance of the lightest supersymmetric particle for the
degenerated case, we discuss the phenomenology of gauginos at the Large Hadron
Collider and cosmic ray experiments.
