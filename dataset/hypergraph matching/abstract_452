Fix a choice and ordering of four pairwise non-adjacent vertices of a
parallelepiped, and call a motif a sequence of four points in R^3 that coincide
with these vertices for some, possibly degenerate, parallelepiped whose edges
are parallel to the axes. We show that a set of r points can contain at most
r^2 motifs. Generalizing the notion of motif to a sequence of L points in R^p,
we show that the maximum number of motifs that can occur in a point set of a
given size is related to a linear programming problem arising from hypergraph
theory, and discuss some related questions.
