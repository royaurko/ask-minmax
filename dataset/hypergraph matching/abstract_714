A perfect matching in a bipartite graph embedded on a torus defines a height
function on the graph's faces and an associated height change vector in $\Z^2$.
These matchings are enumerated by a combination of four evaluations of a
bivariate Laurent polynomial, called Kasteleyn operator, whose coefficient of
bidegree (i,j) is, up to the sign, the number of perfect matchings with height
change (i,j). Therefore the Newton polygon of the Kasteleyn operator is the
convex hull of the height change vectors. In this article, we prove that any
point with integer coordinates in that polygon is realized by a perfect
matching.
