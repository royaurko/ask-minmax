The intensity fluctuation correlation of pseudo-thermal light can be utilized
to realize binocular parallax stereo imaging (BPSI). With the help of
correlation matching algorithm, the matching precision of feature points can
reach one pixel authentically. The implementations of the proposed BPSI system
with real objects were demonstrated in detail. And the experimental results
indicated that the proposed system performs better when the object's
superficial characteristics are not obvious, for example its surface
reflectivity is constant.
