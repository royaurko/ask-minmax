We propose a simple and natural definition for the Laplacian and the signless
Laplacian tensors of a uniform hypergraph. We study their H$^+$-eigenvalues,
i.e., H-eigenvalues with nonnegative H-eigenvectors, and H$^{++}$-eigenvalues,
i.e., H-eigenvalues with positive H-eigenvectors. We show that each of the
Laplacian tensor, the signless Laplacian tensor and the adjacency tensor has at
most one H$^{++}$-eigenvalue, but has several other H$^+$-eigenvalues. We
identify their largest and smallest H$^+$-eigenvalues, and establish some
maximum and minimum properties of these H$^+$-eigenvalues. We then define
analytic connectivity of a uniform hypergraph and discuss its application in
edge connectivity.
