Multiple-choice load balancing has been a topic of intense study since the
seminal paper of Azar, Broder, Karlin, and Upfal. Questions in this area can be
phrased in terms of orientations of a graph, or more generally a k-uniform
random hypergraph. A (d,b)-orientation is an assignment of each edge to d of
its vertices, such that no vertex has more than b edges assigned to it.
Conditions for the existence of such orientations have been completely
documented except for the "extreme" case of (k-1,1)-orientations. We consider
this remaining case, and establish:
  - The density threshold below which an orientation exists with high
probability, and above which it does not exist with high probability.
  - An algorithm for finding an orientation that runs in linear time with high
probability, with explicit polynomial bounds on the failure probability.
  Previously, the only known algorithms for constructing (k-1,1)-orientations
worked for k<=3, and were only shown to have expected linear running time.
