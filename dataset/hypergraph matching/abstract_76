We show that the Ramsey number is linear for every uniform hypergraph with
bounded-degree. This is a hypergraph extension of the famous theorem for
ordinary graphs which Chv\'atal et al. showed in 1983. Our proof is simple,
contains the multicolor case, and provides a strong embedding lemma. It shows
the potential of a new hypergraph regularity lemma by the contributor.
