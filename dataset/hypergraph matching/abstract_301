The phase transition in the size of the giant component in random graphs is
one of the most well-studied phenomena in random graph theory. For hypergraphs,
there are many possible generalisations of the notion of a component, and for
all but the simplest example, the phase transition phenomenon was first proved
by Cooley, Kang and Person. In this paper we build on this and determine the
asymptotic size of the unique giant component.
