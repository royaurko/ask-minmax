The matching of the soundtrack in a movie or a video can have an enormous
influence in the message being conveyed and its impact, in the sense of
involvement and engagement, and ultimately in their aesthetic and entertainment
qualities. Art is often associated with creativity, implying the presence of
inspiration, originality and appropriateness. Evolutionary systems provides us
with the novelty, showing us new and subtly different solutions in every
generation, possibly stimulating the creativity of the human using the system.
In this paper, we present Genetic Soundtracks, an evolutionary approach to the
creative matching of audio to a video. It analyzes both media to extract
features based on their content, and adopts genetic algorithms, with the
purpose of truncating, combining and adjusting audio clips, to align and match
them with the video scenes.
