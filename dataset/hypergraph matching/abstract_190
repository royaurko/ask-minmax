A subspace arrangement defined by intersections of hyperplanes of the braid
arrangement can be encoded by an edge colored hypergraph. It turns out that the
characteristic polynomial of this type of subspace arrangement is given by a
generalized chromatic polynomial of the associated edge colored hypergraph. The
main result of this paper supplies a sufficient condition for the existence of
non-trivial Massey products of the subspace arrangements complex complement.
This is accomplished by studying a spectral sequence associated to the Lie
coalgebras of Sinha and Walter.
