A set of tiles for covering a surface is composed of two types of tiles. The
base shape of each one of them is a diamond or rhombus, both with angles 60 and
120 degrees. They are distinguished by labeling one as an acute diamond with a
base angle of 60 degrees, the other one as an obtuse diamond with a base angle
of 120 degrees. The two types of tiles can be marked with arrows, notches, or
colored lines to keep them distinct. Notches can be used as matching rules such
that the acute diamonds can form a star with 6-fold rotational symmetry among
other matches. Similarly, three obtuse diamonds can be matched with 3-fold
rotational symmetry to form a hexagon among other possibilities. Two variations
of an aperiodic inflation scheme are disclosed to match nine tiles into two
larger tiles. These two larger tiles of the second generation are the new base
shapes following the same matching rules as the original tiles. The inflation
can thus be repeated indefinitely creating an arbitrarily large surface covered
with a 6-fold quasiperiodic tiling consisting of only two diamond shapes. The
notches of the tiles can be creatively deformed to make Escher-esque figures.
