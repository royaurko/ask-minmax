String matching algorithm plays the vital role in the Computational Biology.
The functional and structural relationship of the biological sequence is
determined by similarities on that sequence. For that, the researcher is
supposed to aware of similarities on the biological sequences. Pursuing of
similarity among biological sequences is an important research area of that can
bring insight into the evolutionary and genetic relationships among the genes.
In this paper, we have studied different kinds of string matching algorithms
and observed their time and space complexities. For this study, we have
assessed the performance of algorithms tested with biological sequences.
