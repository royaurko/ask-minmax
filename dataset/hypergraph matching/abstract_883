Extended phase-matching conditions for spontaneous parametric down-conversion
are examined. By augmenting the conventional phase-matching conditions, they
permit the creation of a class of frequency-entangled states that generalizes
the usual twin-beam biphoton state. An experimental characterization of these
states is possible through interferometric coincidence counting.
