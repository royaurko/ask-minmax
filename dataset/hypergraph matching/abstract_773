We present the one-loop matching condition for the unpolarized and polarized
generalized quark distributions in the non-singlet case. The matching condition
links the quasi distributions defined in terms of spacelike correlators at
finite nucleon momentum to the light-cone distributions, and is useful for
extracting the latter from the former in a lattice QCD calculation. Our results
show that at one-loop and leading power accuracy the matching for the
light-cone generalized quark distribution $H$ ($\tilde H$) is non-trivial,
whereas no matching is required for $E$ ($\tilde E$). Therefore, $E$ ($\tilde
E$) can be smoothly approached by its quasi counterpart in the large momentum
limit. We also present the matching for the distribution amplitude of the pion.
