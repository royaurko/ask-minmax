We generalize the Ihara-Selberg zeta function to hypergraphs in a natural
way. Hashimoto's factorization results for biregular bipartite graphs apply,
leading to exact factorizations. For $(d,r)$-regular hypergraphs, we show that
a modified Riemann hypothesis is true if and only if the hypergraph is
Ramanujan in the sense of Winnie Li and Patrick Sol\'e. Finally, we give an
example to show how the generalized zeta function can be applied to graphs to
distinguish non-isomorphic graphs with the same Ihara-Selberg zeta function.
