We obtain new lower bounds for the independence number of $K_r$-free graphs
and linear $k$-uniform hypergraphs in terms of the degree sequence. This
answers some old questions raised by Caro and Tuza \cite{CT91}. Our proof
technique is an extension of a method of Caro and Wei \cite{CA79, WE79}, and we
also give a new short proof of the main result of \cite{CT91} using this
approach. As byproducts, we also obtain some non-trivial identities involving
binomial coefficients.
