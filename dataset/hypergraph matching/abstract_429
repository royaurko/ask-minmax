Let X(G) denote the flag complex of a graph G=(V,E) on n vertices. We study
relations between the first eigenvalues of successive higher Laplacians of
X(G). One consequence is the following result: Let \lambda_2(G) denote the
second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of G. If \lambda_2(G)>
\frac{kn}{k+1} then the real k-th reduced cohomology group H^k(X(G)) is zero.
Applications include a lower bound on the homological connectivity of the
independent sets complex I(G), in terms of a new graph domination parameter
\Gamma(G) defined via certain vector representations of G. This in turns
implies a Hall type theorem for systems of disjoint representatives in
hypergraphs.
