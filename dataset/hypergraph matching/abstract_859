We present a new method of extracting gravitational radiation from
three-dimensional numerical relativity codes and providing outer boundary
conditions. Our approach matches the solution of a Cauchy evolution of
Einstein's equations to a set of one-dimensional linear wave equations on a
curved background. We illustrate the mathematical properties of our approach
and discuss a numerical module we have constructed for this purpose. This
module implements the perturbative matching approach in connection with a
generic three-dimensional numerical relativity simulation. Tests of its
accuracy and second-order convergence are presented with analytic linear wave
data.
