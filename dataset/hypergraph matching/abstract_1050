Cluster matching by permuting cluster labels is important in many clustering
contexts such as cluster validation and cluster ensemble techniques. The
classic approach is to minimize the euclidean distance between two cluster
solutions which induces inappropriate stability in certain settings. Therefore,
we present the truematch algorithm that introduces two improvements best
explained in the crisp case. First, instead of maximizing the trace of the
cluster crosstable, we propose to maximize a chi-square transformation of this
crosstable. Thus, the trace will not be dominated by the cells with the largest
counts but by the cells with the most non-random observations, taking into
account the marginals. Second, we suggest a probabilistic component in order to
break ties and to make the matching algorithm truly random on random data. The
truematch algorithm is designed as a building block of the truecluster
framework and scales in polynomial time. First simulation results confirm that
the truematch algorithm gives more consistent truecluster results for unequal
cluster sizes. Free R software is available.
