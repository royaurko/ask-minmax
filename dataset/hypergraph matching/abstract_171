A sparse version of Mantel's Theorem is that, for sufficiently large $p$,
with high probability (w.h.p.), every maximum triangle-free subgraph of
$G(n,p)$ is bipartite. DeMarco and Kahn proved this for $p>K \sqrt{\log n/n}$
for some constant $K$, and apart from the value of the constant, this bound is
the best possible. Denote by $T_3$ the 3-uniform hypergraph with vertex set
$\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ and edge set $\{abc,ade,bde\}$. Frankl and F\"uredi showed that
the maximum 3-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices containing no copy of $T_3$ is
tripartite for $n> 3000$. For some integer $k$, let $G^k(n,p)$ be the random
$k$-uniform hypergraph. Balogh et al. proved that for $p>K \log n/n$ for some
constant $K$, every maximum $T_3$-free subhypergraph of $G^3(n,p)$ w.h.p. is
tripartite and it does not hold when $p=0.1 \sqrt{\log n}/n$. Denote by $T_4$
the 4-uniform hypergraph with vertex set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$ and edge set
$\{1234,1235,4567\}$. Pikhurko proved that there is an $n_0$ such that for all
$n\ge n_0$, the maximum 4-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices containing no copy
of $T_4$ is 4-partite. In this paper, we extend this type of extremal problem
in random 4-uniform hypergraphs. We show that for some constant $K$ and $p>K
\log n/n$, w.h.p. every maximum $T_4$-free subhypergraph of $G^4(n,p)$ is
4-partite.
