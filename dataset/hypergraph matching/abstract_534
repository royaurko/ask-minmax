We study the perfect phylogeny problem and establish a generalization of the
four gamete condition (also called the Splits Equivalence Theorem) for
sequences over three state characters. Our main result is that a set of input
sequences over three state characters allows a perfect phylogeny if and only if
every subset of three characters allows a perfect phylogeny. In establishing
these results, we prove fundamental structural features of the perfect
phylogeny problem on three state characters and completely characterize the
minimal obstruction sets that must occur in three state input sequences that do
not have a perfect phylogeny. We further give a proof for a stated lower bound
involved in the conjectured generalization of our main result to any number of
states. The techniques are based on the chordal graph view of perfect
phylogeny.
  Until this work, the notion of a conflict, or incompatibility, graph has been
defined for two state characters only. Our generalization of the four gamete
condition allows us to generalize the notion of incompatibility to three state
characters. The resulting incompatibility structure is a hypergraph, which can
be used to solve algorithmic and theoretical problems.
