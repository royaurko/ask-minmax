The independence density of a finite hypergraph is the probability that a
subset of vertices, chosen uniformly at random contains no hyperedges.
Independence densities can be generalized to countable hypergraphs using
limits. We show that, in fact, every positive independence density of a
countably infinite hypergraph with hyperedges of bounded size is equal to the
independence density of some finite hypergraph whose hyperedges are no larger
than those in the infinite hypergraph. This answers a question of Bonato,
Brown, Kemkes, and Pra{\l}at about independence densities of graphs.
Furthermore, we show that for any $k$, the set of independence densities of
hypergraphs with hyperedges of size at most $k$ is closed and contains no
infinite increasing sequences.
