We define the ``shift-match number'' for a binary string and we compute the
probability of occurrence of a given string as a subsequence in longer strings
in terms of its shift-match number. We thus prove that the string matching
probabilities depend not only on the length of shorter strings, but also on the
equivalence class of the shorter string determined by its shift-match number.
