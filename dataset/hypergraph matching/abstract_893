For a setting in which a large number of asymmetrically informed agents are
randomly matched into groups over time, exchanging their information with each
other when matched, we provide an explicit solution for the dynamics of the
cross-sectional distribution of posterior beliefs. We also show that
convergence of the cross-sectional distribution of beliefs to a common
posterior is exponential and that the rate of convergence does not depend on
the size of the groups of agents that meet. The rate of convergence is merely
the mean rate at which an individual agent is matched.
