Let l>k>2. Let the k-graph H^k_l be obtained from the complete 2-graph K_l^2
by enlarging each edge with a new set of k-2 vertices. Mubayi ["A hypergraph
extension of Turan's theorem", to appear in J. Combin. Th. (B)] computed
asymptotically the Turan function ex(n,H_l^k). Here we determine the exact
value of ex(n,H_l^k) for all sufficiently large n, settling a conjecture of
Mubayi.
