Kruszynska and Kraus [Phys. Rev. A 79, 052304 (2009)] have recently
introduced the so-called locally maximally entanglable (LME) states of n qubits
which can be maximally entangled to local auxiliary qubits using controlled
operations. We characterize the local entanglability of hypergraph states and W
states using an approach in [Phys. Rev. A 79, 052304 (2009)]. We show that (i)
all hypergraph states are LME; (ii) hypergraph states and LME states are not
equivalent under local unitaries; (iii) a W state of n qubits is not LME; and
(iv) no hypergraph state of n qubits can be converted into to the W state under
local unitary transformations. Moreover, we also present an approach for
encoding weighted hypergraphs into LME states.
