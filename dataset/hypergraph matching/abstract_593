We propose a fast approximate algorithm for large graph matching. A new
projected fixed-point method is defined and a new doubly stochastic projection
is adopted to derive the algorithm. Previous graph matching algorithms suffer
from high computational complexity and therefore do not have good scalability
with respect to graph size. For matching two weighted graphs of $n$ nodes, our
algorithm has time complexity only $O(n^3)$ per iteration and space complexity
$O(n^2)$. In addition to its scalability, our algorithm is easy to implement,
robust, and able to match undirected weighted attributed graphs of different
sizes. While the convergence rate of previous iterative graph matching
algorithms is unknown, our algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to converge at
a linear rate. Extensive experiments on large synthetic and real graphs (more
than 1,000 nodes) were conducted to evaluate the performance of various
algorithms. Results show that in most cases our proposed algorithm achieves
better performance than previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both
speed and accuracy in large graph matching. In particular, with high accuracy,
our algorithm takes only a few seconds (in a PC) to match two graphs of 1,000
nodes.
