We uncover a novel solution of the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions for
QCD. Interestingly in the perturbative regime the new gauge theory, if
interpreted as a possible QCD dual, predicts the critical number of flavors
above which QCD in the nonperturbative regime, develops an infrared stable
fixed point. Remarkably this value is identical to the maximum bound predicted
in the nonpertubative regime via the all-orders conjectured beta function for
nonsupersymmetric gauge theories.
