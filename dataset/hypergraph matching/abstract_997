We show how to construct homology bases for certain CW complexes in terms of
discrete Morse theory and cellular homology. We apply this technique to study
certain subcomplexes of the half cube polytope studied in previous works. This
involves constructing explicit complete acyclic Morse matchings on the face
lattice of the half cube; this procedure may be of independent interest for
other highly symmetric polytopes.
