6d QFTs are constrained by the analog of 't Hooft anomaly matching: all
anomalies for global symmetries and metric backgrounds are constants of RG
flows, and for all vacua in moduli spaces. We discuss an anomaly matching
mechanism for 6d N=(1,0) theories on their Coulomb branch. It is a global
symmetry analog of Green-Schwarz-West-Sagnotti anomaly cancellation, and
requires the apparent anomaly mismatch to be a perfect square, $\Delta
I_8={1\over 2}X_4^2$. Then $\Delta I_8$ is cancelled by making $X_4$ an
electric / magnetic source for the tensor multiplet, so background gauge field
instantons yield charged strings. This requires the coefficients in $X_4$ to be
integrally quantized. We illustrate this for N=(2,0) theories. We also consider
the N=(1,0) SCFTs from N small $E_8$ instantons, verifying that the recent
result for its anomaly polynomial fits with the anomaly matching mechanism.
