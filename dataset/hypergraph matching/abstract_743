I present a set of theories which display non-trivial `t Hooft anomaly
matching for QCD with $F$ flavors. The matching theories are non-Abelian gauge
theories with "dual" quarks and baryons, rather than the purely confining
theories of baryons that `t Hooft originally searched for. The matching gauge
groups are required to have an $F\pm 6$ dimensional representation. Such a
correspondence is reminiscent of Seiberg's duality for supersymmetric (SUSY)
QCD, and these theories are candidates for non-SUSY duality. However anomaly
matching by itself is not sufficiently restrictive, and duality for QCD cannot
be established at present. At the very least, the existence of multiple anomaly
matching solutions should provide a note of caution regarding conjectured
non-SUSY dualities.
