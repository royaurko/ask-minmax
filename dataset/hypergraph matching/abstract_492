This Matching input keywords with historical or information domain is an
important point in modern computations in order to find the best match
information domain for specific input queries. Matching algorithms represents
hot area of researches in computer science and artificial intelligence. In the
area of text matching, it is more reliable to study semantics of the pattern
and query in terms of semantic matching. This paper improves the semantic
matching results between input queries and information ontology domain. The
contributed algorithm is a hybrid technique that is based on matching extracted
instances from booth, the queries and in information domain. The instances
extraction algorithm that is presented in this paper are contributed which is
based on mathematical and statistical analysis of objects with respect to each
other and also with respect to marked objects. The instances that are instances
from the queries and information domain are subjected to semantic matching to
find the best match, match percentage, and to improve the decision making
process. An application case was studied in this paper which is related to
renewable energy, where the input queries represents the customer requirements
input and the knowledge domain is renewable energy vendors profiles. The
comparison was made with most known recent matching researches.
