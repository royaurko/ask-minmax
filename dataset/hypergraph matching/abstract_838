In this paper we study a variant of the matching model between functional
shapes introduced in [3]. Such a model allows to compare surfaces equipped with
a signal and the matching energy is defined by the $L^2$-norm of the signal on
the surface and a varifold-type attachment term. In this work we study the
problem with fixed geometry which means that we optimize the initial signal
(supported on the initial surface) with respect to a target signal supported on
a different surface. In particular, we consider a $BV$ or $H^1$-penalty term
for the signal instead of its $L^2$-norm. Several numerical examples are shown
in order to prove that the $BV$-penalty improves the quality of the matching.
Moreover, we prove a $\Gamma$-convergence result for the discrete matching
energy towards the continuous-one.
