We show that for sufficiently large $n$, every 3-uniform hypergraph on $n$
vertices with minimum vertex degree at least $\binom{n-1}2 -
\binom{\lfloor\frac34 n\rfloor}2 + c$, where $c=2$ if $n\in 4\mathbb{N}$ and
$c=1$ if $n\in 2\mathbb{N}\setminus 4\mathbb{N}$, contains a loose Hamilton
cycle. This degree condition is best possible and improves on the work of
Bu\ss, H\`an and Schacht who proved the corresponding asymptotical result.
