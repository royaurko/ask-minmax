This letter presents results for the two-loop matching coefficients for the
dimension eight operators that contribute to Higgs production via gluon fusion.
The coefficients can be used to calculate the first correction to the infinite
top mass limit to Higgs production with large transverse momentum at two loops.
To date such processes have been studied at two loop order only in the leading
term in the top mass expansion. These corrections become enhanced in processes
with large final state invariant mass, typical of multijet processes.
