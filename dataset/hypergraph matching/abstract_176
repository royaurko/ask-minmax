We derive an asymptotic formula for the number of connected 3-uniform
hypergraphs with vertex set $[N]$ and $M$ edges for $M=N/2+R$ as long as $R$
satisfies $R = o(N)$ and $R=\omega(N^{1/3}\ln^{2} N)$. This almost completely
fills the gap in the range of $M$ for which the formula is known. We approach
the problem using an `inside-out' approach of an earlier paper of Pittel and
the second contributor, for connected graphs. A key part of the method uses
structural components of connected hypergraphs called cores and kernels. These
are structural components of connected hypergraphs. Our results also give
information on the numbers of them with a given number of vertices and edges,
and hence their typical size in random connected $3$-uniform hypergraphs with
$N$ vertices and $M$ edges, for the range of $M$ we consider.
