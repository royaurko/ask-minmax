The matching polynomial of a graph is the generating function of the numbers
of its matchings with respect to their cardinality. A graph polynomial is
polynomial reconstructible, if its value for a graph can be determined from its
values for the vertex-deleted subgraphs of the same graph. This note discusses
the polynomial reconstructibility of the matching polynomial. We collect
previous results, prove it for graphs with pendant edges and disprove it for
some graphs.
