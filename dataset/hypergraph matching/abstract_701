We present results for matching factors for bilinear operators composed of
HYP-smeared staggered fermions and constructed using HYP-smeared fat links. The
matching factors are calculated perturbatively at one-loop order. The new
feature of our calculation compared to previous work on HYP-smeared staggered
fermions is the use of the Symanzik-improved gluon propagator, which allows our
results to be applied to our ongoing simulations based on configurations
generated by the MILC collaboration. We address the issue of the relative
efficiency of various improvement schemes in reducing one-loop corrections to
the matching factors.
