We present a unified framework on the limits of \emph{constraint satisfaction
problems} (CSPs) and efficient parameter testing which depends only on array
exchangeability and the method of cut decomposition without recourse to the
weakly regular partitions. In particular, we formulate and prove a
representation theorem for compact colored $r$-uniform directed hypergraph
($r$-graph) limits, and apply this to $r$CSP limits. We investigate the sample
complexity of testable $r$-graph parameters, we discuss the generalized ground
state energies and demonstrate that they are efficiently testable.
