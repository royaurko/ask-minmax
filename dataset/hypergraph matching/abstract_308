Let H = (H,V) be a hypergraph with edge set H and vertex set V. Then
hypergraph H is invertible iff there exists a permutation pi of V such that
for all E belongs to H(edges) intersection of(pi(E) and E)=0. H is
invertibility critical if H is not invertible but every hypergraph obtained by
removing an edge from H is invertible. The degree of H is d if |{E belongs to
H(edges)|x belongs to E}| =< d for each x belongs to V Let i(d) be the maximum
number of edges of an invertibility critical hypergraph of degree d. Theorem:
i(d) =< (d-1) {2d-1 choose d} + 1. The proof of this result leads to the
following covering problem on graphs: Let G be a graph. A family H is subset
of (2^{V(G)} is an edge cover of G iff for every edge e of G, there is an E
belongs to H(edge set) which includes e. H(edge set) is a minimal edge cover
of G iff for H' subset of H, H' is not an edge cover of G. Let b(d) (c(d)) be
the maximum cardinality of a minimal edge cover H(edge set) of a complete
bipartite graph (complete graph) where H(edge set) has degree d. Theorem:
c(d)=< i(d)=<b(d)=< c(d+1) and 3. 2^{d-1} - 2 =< b(d)=< (d-1) {2d-1choose d}
+1. The proof of this result uses Sperner theory. The bounds b(d) also arise
as bounds on the maximum number of elements in the union of minimal covers of
families of sets.
