We compute the spectrum of the "all ones" hypermatrix using the Poisson
product formula. This computation includes a complete description of the
eigenvalues' multiplicities, a seemingly elusive aspect of the spectral theory
of tensors. We also give a general distributional picture of the spectrum as a
point-set in the complex plane, and use our techniques to analyze the spectrum
of "sunflower hypergraphs", a class that has played a prominent role in
extremal hypergraph theory.
