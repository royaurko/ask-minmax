We derive actions for projective N=2 superspace ("hyperspace") from those for
harmonic hyperspace, including that for nonabelian Yang-Mills (a new result).
The method uses Wick rotation of the sphere from complex conjugate coordinates
to real, null ones, which can be treated as independent. The result can be
considered "holographic" in that the dimension of the internal (R-symmetry)
space is reduced from 2 to 1, by solving equations of motion or gauge
conditions for dependence on the other coordinate. The auxiliary nature of the
redundant dimension makes the hypergraph rules and evaluation almost identical.
