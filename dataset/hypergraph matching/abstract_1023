We analyse the BATSE 3B catalog using the pair-matching statistic. This
statistic counts only the burst pairs which may have originated from the same
source, so it is less likely to yield false detections of ``repeating bursts"
than the nearest neighbor and correlation function statistics. Even in the
ideal case when repeating is the only possible source of burst correlations,
the pair matching statistic is more sensitive to repeating bursts than these
other statistics particularly for models which predict faint or multiple burst
repetitions. We find that the BATSE 3B data set contains no excess of matched
burst pairs over the expectation from a sample with random positions. We also
apply the pair-matching statistic to the bursts that previously appeared in the
BATSE 1B catalog which now have improved positions and position errors in the
BATSE 3B data set. Previously, these bursts had exhibited some peculiar
position correlations that were interpreted by some as evidence for burst
repetition, but we find that these correlations have disappeared with the
improved BATSE 3B positions.
