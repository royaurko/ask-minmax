We show that the ratio of matched individuals to blocking pairs grows
linearly with the number of propose--accept rounds executed by the
Gale--Shapley algorithm for the stable marriage problem. Consequently, the
participants can arrive at an almost stable matching even without full
information about the problem instance; for each participant, knowing only its
local neighbourhood is enough. In distributed-systems parlance, this means that
if each person has only a constant number of acceptable partners, an almost
stable matching emerges after a constant number of synchronous communication
rounds. This holds even if ties are present in the preference lists.
  We apply our results to give a distributed $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for maximum-weight matching in bicoloured graphs and a centralised
randomised constant-time approximation scheme for estimating the size of a
stable matching.
