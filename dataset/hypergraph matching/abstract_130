The independence polynomial of a hypergraph is the generating function for
its independent (vertex) sets with respect to their cardinality. This article
aims to discuss several recurrence relations for the independence polynomial
using some vertex and edge operations. Further, an extension of the well-known
recurrence relation for simple graphs to hypergraphs is proven and other novel
recurrence relations are also discussed.
