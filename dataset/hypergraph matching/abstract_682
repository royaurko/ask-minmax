An identifying code of a graph is a subset of its vertices such that every
vertex of the graph is uniquely identified by the set of its neighbours within
the code. We show a dichotomy for the size of the smallest identifying code in
classes of graphs closed under induced subgraphs. Our dichotomy is derived from
the VC-dimension of the considered class C, that is the maximum VC-dimension
over the hypergraphs formed by the closed neighbourhoods of elements of C. We
show that hereditary classes with infinite VC-dimension have infinitely many
graphs with an identifying code of size logarithmic in the number of vertices
while classes with finite VC-dimension have a polynomial lower bound.
  We then turn to approximation algorithms. We show that the problem of finding
a smallest identifying code in a given graph from some class is log-APX-hard
for any hereditary class of infinite VC-dimension. For hereditary classes of
finite VC-dimension, the only known previous results show that we can
approximate the identifying code problem within a constant factor in some
particular classes, e.g. line graphs, planar graphs and unit interval graphs.
We prove that it can be approximate within a factor 6 for interval graphs. In
contrast, we show that on C_4-free bipartite graphs (a class of finite
VC-dimension) it cannot be approximated to within a factor of c.log(|V|) for
some c>0.
