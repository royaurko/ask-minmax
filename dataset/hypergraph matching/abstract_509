We define the cyclic matching sequencibility of a graph to be the largest
integer $d$ such that there exists a cyclic ordering of its edges so that every
$d$ consecutive edges in the cyclic ordering form a matching. We show that the
cyclic matching sequencibility of $K_{2m}$ and $K_{2m+1}$ equal $m-1$.
