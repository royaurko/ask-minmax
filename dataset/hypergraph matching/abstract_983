Consider the family of all finite graphs with maximum degree $\Delta(G)<d$
and matching number $\nu(G)<m$. In this paper we give a new proof to obtain the
exact upper bound for the number of edges in such graphs and also characterize
all the cases when the maximal graph is unique. We also provide a new proof of
Gallai's lemma concerning factor critical graphs.
