Motivated by the definition of the Gowers uniformity norms, we introduce and
study a wide class of norms. Our aim is to establish them as a natural
generalization of the $L_p$ norms. We shall prove that these normed spaces
share many of the nice properties of the $L_p$ spaces. Some examples of these
norms are $L_p$ norms, trace norms $S_p$ when $p$ is an even integer, and
Gowers uniformity norms.
  Every such norm is defined through a pair of weighted hypergraphs. In regard
to a question of Laszlo Lovasz, we prove several results in the direction of
characterizing all hypergraph pairs that correspond to norms.
