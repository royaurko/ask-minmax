The matching coefficients for the four-quark operators in NRQCD (NRQED) are
calculated at one loop using dimensional regularization for ultraviolet and
infrared divergences. The matching for the electromagnetic current follows
easily from our results. Both the unequal and equal mass cases are considered.
The role played by the Coulomb infrared singularities is explained in detail.
