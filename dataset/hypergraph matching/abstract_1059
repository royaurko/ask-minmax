We study the performance of a multidimensional matched filter as a follow-up
module of the coherent method recently developed by two of us for the detection
of gravitational wave bursts by spherical resonant detectors. We have tested
this strategy on the same set of injections used for the coherent method and
found that the matched filter sensibly improves the determination of relevant
parameters as the arrival time, amplitude, central frequency and arrival
direction of the signal. The matched filter also improves the false alarm rate,
reducing it roughly by a factor of 3. The hierarchical structure of the whole
analysis pipeline allows to obtain these results without a significant increase
of the computation time.
