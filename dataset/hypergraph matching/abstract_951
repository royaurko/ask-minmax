In this work, arithmetic distribution matching (ADM) is presented. ADM
invertibly transforms a discrete memoryless source (DMS) into a target DMS. ADM
can be used for probabilistic shaping and for rate adaption. Opposed to
existing algorithms for distribution matching, ADM works online and can
transform arbitrarily long input sequences. It is shown analytically that as
the input length tends to infinity, the ADM output perfectly emulates the
target DMS with respect to the normalized informational divergence and the
entropy rate. Numerical results are presented that confirm the analytical
bounds.
