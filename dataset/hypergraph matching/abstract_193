We describe the Betti numbers of the edge ideals $I(G)$ of uniform
hypergraphs $G$ such that $I(G)$ has linear graded free resolution.
  We give an algebraic equation system and some inequalities for the components
of the $f$--vector of the clique complex of an arbitrary chordal graph.
  Finally we present an explicit formula for the multiplicity of the
Stanley-Reisner ring of the edge ideals of any chordal graph.
