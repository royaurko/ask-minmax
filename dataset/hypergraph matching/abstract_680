We present a general method for constructing a new class of topological
Ramsey spaces. Members of such spaces are infinite sequences of products of
Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} classes of finite relational structures satisfying the Ramsey
property. We extend the Product Ramsey Theorem of Soki\v{c} to equivalence
relations for finite products of structures from Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} classes of
finite relational structures satisfying the Ramsey property and the
Order-Prescribed Free Amalgamation Property. This is then applied to prove
Ramsey-classification theorems for equivalence relations on fronts,
generalizing the Pudl\'{a}k-R\"{o}dl Theorem to our class of topological Ramsey
spaces. To each topological Ramsey space in this framework correspond
associated ultrafilters satisfying weak partition properties. The
Ramsey-classification theorems are applied to classify the structure of the
Tukey types of all ultrafilters Tukey reducible to the associated ultrafilter.
We obtain initial Tukey types which are finite Boolean algebras. Furthermore,
the structure of the Rudin-Keisler classes inside each Tukey type are also
completely classified in terms of the embedding relation on the \Fraisse\
classes.
