The spherically symmetric solution for perfect fluid with homogeneous density
and inhomogeneous pressure has been considered. This solution is known as
Stephani solution. The matching of this solution and de Sitter solution has
been done on a hypersurface of constant time. The matching has been done for
general case and for particular cases (flat, closed, open universe). An
equality of the densities and a bound of the pressures have been shown on the
matching hypersurface. Also, restrictions on some arbitrary functions have been
found.
