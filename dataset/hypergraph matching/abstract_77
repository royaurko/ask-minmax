We give an extension of a graph result by Alon and Shapira. And it
affirmatively settles a question on property testing raised by them. All
monotone hypergraph properties and all hereditary partite hypergraph properties
are testable. Our proof is constructive and based on a new hypergraph
regularity lemma.
