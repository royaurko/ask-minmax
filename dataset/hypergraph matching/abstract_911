We present a new algorithm for solving the real roots of a bivariate
polynomial system $\Sigma=\{f(x,y),g(x,y)\}$ with a finite number of solutions
by using a zero-matching method. The method is based on a lower bound for
bivariate polynomial system when the system is non-zero. Moreover, the
multiplicities of the roots of $\Sigma=0$ can be obtained by a given
neighborhood. From this approach, the parallelization of the method arises
naturally. By using a multidimensional matching method this principle can be
generalized to the multivariate equation systems.
