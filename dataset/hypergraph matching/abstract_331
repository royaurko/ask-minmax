Given a hypergraph H = (V, E), a coloring of its vertices is said to be
conflict-free if for every hyperedge S \in E there is at least one vertex in S
whose color is distinct from the colors of all other vertices in S. The
discrete interval hypergraph Hn is the hypergraph with vertex set {1,...,n} and
hyperedge set the family of all subsets of consecutive integers in {1,...,n}.
We provide a polynomial time algorithm for conflict-free coloring any
subhypergraph of Hn, we show that the algorithm has approximation ratio 2, and
we prove that our analysis is tight, i.e., there is a subhypergraph for which
the algorithm computes a solution which uses twice the number of colors of the
optimal solution. We also show that the problem of deciding whether a given
subhypergraph of Hn can be colored with at most k colors has a quasipolynomial
time algorithm.
