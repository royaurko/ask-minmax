A rainbow matching for (not necessarily distinct) sets F_1,...,F_k of
hypergraph edges is a matching consisting of k edges, one from each F_i. The
aim of the paper is twofold - to put order in the multitude of conjectures that
relate to this concept (some of them first presented here), and to present some
partial results on one of these conjectures, that seems central among them.
