This paper is aimed at developing and combining different algorithms for face
detection and face recognition to generate an efficient mechanism that can
detect and recognize the facial regions of input image. For the detection of
face from complex region, skin segmentation isolates the face-like regions in a
complex image and following operations of morphology and template matching
rejects false matches to extract facial region. For the recognition of the
face, the image database is now converted into a database of facial segments.
Hence, implementing the technique of Elastic Bunch Graph matching (EBGM) after
skin segmentation generates Face Bunch Graphs that acutely represents the
features of an individual face enhances the quality of the training set. This
increases the matching probability significantly.
