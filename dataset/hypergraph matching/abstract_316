Hypertree decompositions of hypergraphs are a generalization of tree
decompositions of graphs. The corresponding hypertree-width is a measure for
the cyclicity and therefore tractability of the encoded computation problem.
Many NP-hard decision and computation problems are known to be tractable on
instances whose structure corresponds to hypergraphs of bounded
hypertree-width. Intuitively, the smaller the hypertree-width, the faster the
computation problem can be solved. In this paper, we present the new
backtracking-based algorithm det-k-decomp for computing hypertree
decompositions of small width. Our benchmark evaluations have shown that
det-k-decomp significantly outperforms opt-k-decomp, the only exact hypertree
decomposition algorithm so far. Even compared to the best heuristic algorithm,
we obtained competitive results as long as the hypergraphs are not too large.
