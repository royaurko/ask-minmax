Concerns are expressed for the Monotonic Imbalance Bounding (MIB) property
(Iacus et al. 2011) and for MIB matching because i) the definition of the MIB
property leads to inconsistencies and the nature of the imbalance measure is
not clearly defined, ii) MIB property does not generalize Equal Percent Bias
Reducing (EPBR) property, iii) MIB matching does not provide statistical
information available with EPBR matching.
