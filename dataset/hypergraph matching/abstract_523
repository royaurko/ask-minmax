Gowers introduced, for d\geq 1, the notion of dimension-d uniformity U^d(f)
of a function f: G -> \C, where G is a finite abelian group and \C are the
complex numbers. Roughly speaking, if U^d(f) is small, then f has certain
"pseudorandomness" properties.
  We prove the following property of functions with large U^d(f). Write G=G_1 x
>... x G_n as a product of groups. If a bounded balanced function f:G_1 x ... x
G_n -> \C is such that U^{d} (f) > epsilon, then one of the coordinates of f
has influence at least epsilon/2^{O(d)}.
  The Gowers inner product of a collection of functions is a related notion of
pseudorandomness. We prove that if a collection of bounded functions has large
Gowers inner product, and at least one function in the collection is balanced,
then there is a variable that has high influence for at least four of the
functions in the collection.
  Finally, we relate the acceptance probability of the "hypergraph long-code
test" proposed by Samorodnitsky and Trevisan to the Gowers inner product of the
functions being tested and we deduce applications to the construction of
Probabilistically Checkable Proofs and to hardness of approximation.
