An Extended Visual Cryptography Scheme (EVCS) was proposed by Ateniese et al.
[3] to protect a binary secret image with meaningful (innocent-looking) shares.
This is implemented by concatenating an extended matrix to each basis matrix.
The minimum size of the extended matrix was obtained from a hypergraph coloring
model and the scheme was designed for binary images only [3]. In this paper, we
give a more concise derivation for this matrix extension for color images.
Furthermore, we present a (k, n) scheme to protect multiple color images with
meaningful shares. This scheme is an extension of the (n, n) VCS for multiple
binary images proposed in Droste scheme [2].
