El-Zanati et al proved that for any 1-factorization $\mathcal{F}$ of the
complete uniform hypergraph $\mathcal {G}=K_{rn}^{(r)}$ with $r\geq 2$ and
$n\geq 3$, there is a rainbow 1-factor. We generalize their result and show
that in any proper coloring of the complete uniform hypergraph $\mathcal
{G}=K_{rn}^{(r)}$ with $r\geq 2$ and $n\geq 3$, there is a rainbow 1-factor.
