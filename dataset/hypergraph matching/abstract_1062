Modern extra-dimensional Higgsless scenarios rely on a mass-matching between
fermionic and bosonic KK resonances to evade constraints from precision
electroweak measurements. After analyzing all of the Tevatron and LEP bounds on
these so-called Cured Higgsless scenarios, we study their LHC signatures and
explore how to identify the mass-matching mechanism, the key to their
viability. We find singly and pair produced fermionic resonances show up as
clean signals with 2 or 4 leptons and 2 hard jets, while neutral and charged
bosonic resonances are visible in the dilepton and leptonic WZ channels,
respectively. A measurement of the resonance masses from these channels shows
the matching necessary to achieve $S\simeq 0$. Moreover, a large single
production of KK-fermion resonances is a clear indication of compositeness of
SM quarks. Discovery reach is below 10 fb$^{-1}$ of luminosity for resonances
in the 700 GeV range.
