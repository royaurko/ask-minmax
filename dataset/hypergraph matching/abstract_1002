A formalism in terms of Hertz potentials is presented describing
sum-frequency generation in a uniaxial non-linear crystal. A scheme is proposed
consisting in aligning the side-walk propagation of extraordinary waves in
combination with phase-matching. Simplified paraxial equations describing this
situation are obtained. Particular attention is paid to the generation of
second harmonics.
