There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between squarefree monomial
ideals and finite simple hypergraphs via the cover ideal construction. Let H be
a finite simple hypergraph, and let J = J(H) be its cover ideal in a polynomial
ring R. We give an explicit description of all associated primes of R/J^s, for
any power J^s of J, in terms of the coloring properties of hypergraphs arising
from H. We also give an algebraic method for determining the chromatic number
of H, proving that it is equivalent to a monomial ideal membership problem
involving powers of J. Our work yields two new purely algebraic
characterizations of perfect graphs, independent of the Strong Perfect Graph
Theorem; the first characterization is in terms of the sets Ass(R/J^s), while
the second characterization is in terms of the saturated chain condition for
associated primes.
