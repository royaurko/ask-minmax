Let $H_{n,(p_m)_{m=2,\ldots,M}}$ be a random non-uniform hypergraph of
dimension $M$ on $2n$ vertices, where the vertices are split into two disjoint
sets of size $n$, and colored by two distinct colors. Each non-monochromatic
edge of size $m=2,\ldots,M$ is independently added with probability $p_m$. We
show that if $p_2,\ldots,p_M$ are such that the expected number of edges in the
hypergraph is at least $dn\ln n$, for some $d>0$ sufficiently large, then with
probability $(1-o(1))$, one can find a proper 2-coloring of
$H_{n,(p_m)_{m=2,\ldots,M}}$ in polynomial time. The coloring algorithm
presented in this paper makes use of the spectral properties of the star
expansion of the hypergraph.
