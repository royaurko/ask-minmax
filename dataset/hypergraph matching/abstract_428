We say that a first order formula A distinguishes a graph G from another
graph G' if A is true on G and false on G'. Provided G and G' are
non-isomorphic, let D(G,G') denote the minimal quantifier rank of a such
formula.
 We prove that, if G and G' have the same order n, then D(G,G')\le(n+3)/2,
which is tight up to an additive constant of 1. The analogous questions are
considered for directed graphs (more generally, for arbitrary structures with
maximum relation arity 2) and for k-uniform hypergraphs.
 Also, we study defining formulas, where we require that A distinguishes G from
any other non-isomorphic G'.
