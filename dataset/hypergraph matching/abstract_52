A Kneser representation ${\rm KG}(H)$ for a graph $G$ is a bijective
assignment of hyperedges of a hypergraph $H$ to the vertices of $G$ such that
two vertices of $G$ are adjacent if and only if the corresponding hyperedges
are disjoint. In this paper, we introduce a colored version of the Tur\'an
number and use that to determine the chromatic number of some families of
graphs, in particular, a family of matching graphs whose vertex set is the set
of all matchings of a specified size of a graph and two vertices of a matching
graph are adjacent if the corresponding matchings are edge-disjoint. This
extends the well-known theorems of Lov\'asz (1978) and Schrijver (1978). Also,
we determine the chromatic number of every Kneser multigraph ${\rm KG}(H)$,
where the vertex set of $H$ is the edge set of a multigraph $G$ such that the
multiplicity of each edge is greater than $1$ and a hyperedge in $H$
corresponds to a subgraph of $G$ isomorphic to some graph in a fixed prescribed
family of simple graphs.
