A maximal matching can be maintained in fully dynamic (supporting both
addition and deletion of edges) $n$-vertex graphs using a trivial deterministic
algorithm with a worst-case update time of O(n). No deterministic algorithm
that outperforms the na\"{\i}ve O(n) one was reported up to this date. The only
progress in this direction is due to Ivkovi\'{c} and Lloyd \cite{IL93}, who in
1993 devised a deterministic algorithm with an \emph{amortized} update time of
$O((n+m)^{\sqrt{2}/2})$, where $m$ is the number of edges.
  In this paper we show the first deterministic fully dynamic algorithm that
outperforms the trivial one. Specifically, we provide a deterministic
\emph{worst-case} update time of $O(\sqrt{m})$. Moreover, our algorithm
maintains a matching which is in fact a 3/2-approximate maximum cardinality
matching (MCM). We remark that no fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining
$(2-\eps)$-approximate MCM improving upon the na\"{\i}ve O(n) was known prior
to this work, even allowing amortized time bounds and \emph{randomization}.
  For low arboricity graphs (e.g., planar graphs and graphs excluding fixed
minors), we devise another simple deterministic algorithm with
\emph{sub-logarithmic update time}. Specifically, it maintains a fully dynamic
maximal matching with amortized update time of $O(\log n/\log \log n)$. This
result addresses an open question of Onak and Rubinfeld \cite{OR10}.
  We also show a deterministic algorithm with optimal space usage, that for
arbitrary graphs maintains a maximal matching in amortized $O(\sqrt{m})$ time,
and uses only $O(n+m)$ space.
