Lattice-matched heterovalent alloys and superlattices have some unique
physical properties. For example, their band gap can change by a large amount
without significant change in their lattice constants, thus they have great
potential for optelectronic applications. Using first-principles total energy
calculation and Monte Carlo simulation as well as lattice harmonic expansion,
we systematically study the stability of the heterovalent superlattices. We
show that the chemical trend of stability of lattice-matched heterovalent
superlattices is significantly different from lattice-mismatched isovalent
superlattices, because for lattice-mismatched isovalent superlattices the
stability is mostly determined by strain, whereas for lattice-matched
nonisovalent superlattices the interfacial energy depend not only on the bond
energy but also on the Coulomb energy derived from donor- and acceptor-like
wrong bonds. In the short-period heterovalent superlattices, the abrupt [111]
interface has the lowest energy even though it is polar, whereas for the
long-period heterovalent superlattices, the [110] interface has the lowest
energy. On the contrary, [201] superlattices are usually the most stable for
lattice-mismatched isovalent superlattices.
