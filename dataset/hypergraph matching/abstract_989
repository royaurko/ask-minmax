We report work on the matching of the next-to-leading logarithmic
approximation (NLLA) onto the fixed next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
calculation for event shape variables in electron-positron annihilation. The
correction of the combined NLLA+NNLO computation in the three-jet region,
relevant for precision phenomenology, is small compared with pure NNLO or
NLLA+NLO.
