We obtain perturbative expressions for jet distributions using soft-collinear
effective theory (SCET). By matching SCET onto QCD at high energy, tree level
matrix elements and higher order virtual corrections can be reproduced in SCET.
The resulting operators are then evolved to lower scales, with additional
operators being populated by required threshold matchings in the effective
theory. We show that the renormalization group evolution and threshold
matchings reproduce the Sudakov factors and splitting functions of QCD, and
that the effective theory naturally combines QCD matrix elements and parton
showers. The effective theory calculation is systematically improvable and any
higher order perturbative effects can be included by a well defined procedure.
