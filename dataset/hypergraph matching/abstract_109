In this paper, we investigate the best pixel expansion of the various models
of visual cryptography schemes. In this regard, we consider visual cryptography
schemes introduced by Tzeng and Hu [13]. In such a model, only minimal
qualified sets can recover the secret image and that the recovered secret image
can be darker or lighter than the background. Blundo et al. [4] introduced a
lower bound for the best pixel expansion of this scheme in terms of minimal
qualified sets. We present another lower bound for the best pixel expansion of
the scheme. As a corollary, we introduce a lower bound, based on an induced
matching of hypergraph of qualified sets, for the best pixel expansion of the
aforementioned model and the traditional model of visual cryptography realized
by basis matrices. Finally, we study access structures based on graphs and we
present an upper bound for the smallest pixel expansion in terms of strong
chromatic index.
