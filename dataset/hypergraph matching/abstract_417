A hypermap is an embedding of a connected hypergraph into an orientable
closed surface. A covering between hypermaps is a homomorphism between the
embedded hypergraphs which extends to an orientation-preserving covering of the
supporting surfaces. A covering of a hypermap onto itself is an automorphism,
and a hypermap is regular if its automorphism group acts transitively on the
brins. Depending on the algebraic theory of regular hypermaps and hypermap
operations, the abelian regular coverings over the quaternion hypermap are
investigated. We define normalized multicyclic coverings between regular
hypermaps, generalizing almost totally branched coverings studied in [K. Hu, R.
Nedela, N.-E Wang, Branched cyclic regular coverings over platonic maps,
European J. Combin. 36 (2014) 531--549]. It is shown that the covering
transformation group of a normalized multicyclic covering is a nilpotent group
with bounded class. As an application the abelian normalized bicyclic coverings
over the quaternion hypemap are classified. In particular, those coverings
which possess various level of external symmetry or fulfil certain smoothness
conditions are explicitly determined.
