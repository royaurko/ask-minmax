In interconnection networks, matching preclusion is a measure of robustness
when there is a link failure. Let $G$ be a graph of even order. The matching
preclusion number $mp(G)$ is defined as the minimum number of edges whose
deletion results in a subgraph without perfect matchings. Many interconnection
networks are super matched, that is, their optimal matching preclusion sets are
precisely those induced by a single vertex. In this paper, we obtain general
results of vertex-transitive graphs including many known networks. A
$k$-regular connected vertex-transitive graph has matching preclusion number
$k$ and is super matched except for six classes of graphs. From this many
previous results can be directly obtained and matching preclusion for some
other networks, such as folded $k$-cubes, Hamming graphs and halved $k$-cubes,
are derived.
