The detection of gravitational wave usually requires to match the measurement
data with a large number of templates, which is computationally very expensive.
Compressed sensing methods allow one to match the data with a small number of
templates and interpolate the rest. However, the interpolation process is still
computationally expensive. In this article, we designed a novel method that
only requires to match the data with a few templates, yet without needing any
interpolation process. The algorithm worked well for signals with relatively
high SNRs. It also showed promise for low SNRs signals.
