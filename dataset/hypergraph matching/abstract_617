The matching energy of a graph was introduced by Gutman and Wagner, which is
defined as the sum of the absolute values of the roots of the matching
polynomial of the graph. For the random graph $G_{n,p}$ of order $n$ with fixed
probability $p\in (0,1)$, Gutman and Wagner [I. Gutman, S. Wagner, The matching
energy of a graph, Discrete Appl. Math. 160(2012), 2177--2187] proposed a
conjecture that the matching energy of $G_{n,p}$ converges to
$\frac{8\sqrt{p}}{3\pi}n^{\frac{3}{2}}$ almost surely. In this paper, using
analysis method, we prove that the conjecture is true.
