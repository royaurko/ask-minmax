Biometrics has become a "hot" area. Governments are funding research programs
focused on biometrics. In this paper the problem of person recognition and
verification based on a different biometric application has been addressed. The
system is based on the 3DSkull recognition using 3D matching technique, in fact
this paper present several bio-metric approaches in order of assign the weak
point in term of used the biometric from the contributorize person and insure the
person who access the data is the real person. The feature of the simulate
system shows the capability of using 3D matching system as an efficient way to
identify the person through his or her skull by match it with database, this
technique grantee fast processing with optimizing the false positive and
negative as well .
