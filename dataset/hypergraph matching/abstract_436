We define graded Hopf algebras with bases labeled by various types of graphs
and hypergraphs, provided with natural embeddings into an algebra of
polynomials in infinitely many variables. These algebras are graded by the
number of edges and can be considered as generalizations of symmetric or
quasi-symmetric functions.
