A basic statement in graph theory is that every inclusion-maximal forest is
connected, i.e. a tree. Using a definiton for higher dimensional forests by
Graham and Lovasz and the connectivity-related notion of tightness for
hypergraphs introduced by Arocha, Bracho and Neumann-Lara in, we provide an
example of a saturated, i.e. inclusion-maximal 3-forest that is not tight. This
resolves an open problem posed by Strausz.
