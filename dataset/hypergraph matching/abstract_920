Consider two parties who want to compare their strings, e.g., genomes, but do
not want to reveal them to each other. We present a system for
privacy-preserving matching of strings, which differs from existing systems by
providing a deterministic approximation instead of an exact distance. It is
efficient (linear complexity), non-interactive and does not involve a third
party which makes it particularly suitable for cloud computing. We extend our
protocol, such that it mitigates iterated differential attacks proposed by
Goodrich. Further an implementation of the system is evaluated and compared
against current privacy-preserving string matching algorithms.
