We analyze different ways of pairing agents in a bipartite matching problem,
with regard to its scaling properties and to the distribution of individual
``satisfactions''. Then we explore the role of partial information and bounded
rationality in a generalized {\it Marriage Problem}, comparing the benefits
obtained by self-searching and by a matchmaker. Finally we propose a modified
matching game intended to mimic the way consumers' information makes firms to
enhance the quality of their products in a competitive market.
