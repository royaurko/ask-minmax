A central problem in comparative genomics consists in computing a
(dis-)similarity measure between two genomes, e.g. in order to construct a
phylogeny. All the existing measures are defined on genomes without duplicates.
However, we know that genes can be duplicated within the same genome. One
possible approach to overcome this difficulty is to establish a one-to-one
correspondence (i.e. a matching) between genes of both genomes, where the
correspondence is chosen in order to optimize the studied measure. In this
paper, we are interested in three measures (number of breakpoints, number of
common intervals and number of conserved intervals) and three models of
matching (exemplar, intermediate and maximum matching models). We prove that,
for each model and each measure M, computing a matching between two genomes
that optimizes M is APX-hard. We also study the complexity of the following
problem: is there an exemplarization (resp. an intermediate/maximum matching)
that induces no breakpoint? We prove the problem to be NP-Complete in the
exemplar model for a new class of instances, and we show that the problem is in
P in the maximum matching model. We also focus on a fourth measure: the number
of adjacencies, for which we give several approximation algorithms in the
maximum matching model, in the case where genomes contain the same number of
duplications of each gene.
