We develop a multilevel algorithm for hypergraph partitioning that contracts
the vertices one at a time and thus allows very high quality. This includes a
rating function that avoids nonuniform vertex weights, an efficient
"semi-dynamic" hypergraph data structure, a very fast coarsening algorithm, and
two new local search algorithms. One is a $k$-way hypergraph adaptation of
Fiduccia-Mattheyses local search and gives high quality at reasonable cost. The
other is an adaptation of size-constrained label propagation to hypergraphs.
Comparisons with hMetis and PaToH indicate that the new algorithm yields better
quality over several benchmark sets and has a running time that is comparable
to hMetis. Using label propagation local search is several times faster than
hMetis and gives better quality than PaToH for a VLSI benchmark set.
