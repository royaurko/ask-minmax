We prove that any k-uniform hypergraph on n vertices with minimum degree at
least n/(2(k-1))+o(n) contains a loose Hamilton cycle. The proof strategy is
similar to that used by K\"uhn and Osthus for the 3-uniform case. Though some
additional difficulties arise in the k-uniform case, our argument here is
considerably simplified by applying the recent hypergraph blow-up lemma of
Keevash.
