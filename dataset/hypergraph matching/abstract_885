We study the matching of the next-to-leading logarithmic approximation (NLLA)
onto the fixed next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculation for event shape
distributions in electron-positron annihilation. The resulting theoretical
predictions combine all precision QCD knowledge on the distributions, and are
theoretically reliable over an extended kinematical range. Compared to
previously available matched NLLA+NLO and fixed order NNLO results, we observe
that the effects of the combined NLLA+NNLO are small in the three-jet region,
relevant for precision physics.
