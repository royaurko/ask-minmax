In this talk I summarize our recent works on the chiral symmetry restoration
in the large flavor QCD using the hidden local symmetry (HLS) as an effective
field theory of QCD. Bare parameters in the HLS are determined by matching the
HLS with QCD at the matching scale through the Wilsoninan matching conditions.
This Wilsonian matching leads to the vector manifestation of the Wigner
realization of the chiral symmetry in which the symmetry is restored by the
massless degenerate pion (and its flavor partners) and rho meson (and its
flavor partners) as the chiral partner.
