This paper presents new and efficient algorithms for matching stellar
catalogues where the transformation between the coordinate systems of the two
catalagoues is unknown and may include shearing. Finding a given object whether
a star or asterism from the first catalogue in the second is logarithmic in
time rather than polynomial, yielding a dramatic speed up relative to a naive
implementation. Both acceleration of the matching algorithm and the ability to
solve for arbitrary affine transformations not only will allow the registration
of stellar catalogues and images that are now impossible to use but also will
find applications in machine vision and other imaging applications.
