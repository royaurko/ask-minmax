We construct an involution on set partitions which keeps track of the numbers
of crossings, nestings and alignments of two edges.
 We derive then the symmetric distribution of the numbers of crossings and
nestings in partitions, which generalizes Klazar's recent result in perfect
matchings. By factorizing our involution through bijections between set
partitions and some path diagrams we obtain the continued fraction expansions
of the corresponding ordinary generating functions.
