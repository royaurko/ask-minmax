We use a point-matching approach to numerically compute the Casimir
interaction energy for a two perfect-conductor waveguide of arbitrary section.
We present the method and describe the procedure used to obtain the numerical
results. At first, our technique is tested for geometries with known solutions,
such as concentric and eccentric cylinders. Then, we apply the point-matching
technique to compute the Casimir interaction energy for new geometries such as
concentric corrugated cylinders and cylinders inside conductors with focal
lines.
