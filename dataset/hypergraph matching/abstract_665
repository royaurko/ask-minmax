Given n red and n blue points in general position in the plane, it is
well-known that there is a perfect matching formed by non-crossing line
segments. We characterize the bichromatic point sets which admit exactly one
non-crossing matching. We give several geometric descriptions of such sets, and
find an O(nlogn) algorithm that checks whether a given bichromatic set has this
property.
