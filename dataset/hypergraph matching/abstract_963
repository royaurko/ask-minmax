Faces are highly deformable objects which may easily change their appearance
over time. Not all face areas are subject to the same variability. Therefore
decoupling the information from independent areas of the face is of paramount
importance to improve the robustness of any face recognition technique. This
paper presents a robust face recognition technique based on the extraction and
matching of SIFT features related to independent face areas. Both a global and
local (as recognition from parts) matching strategy is proposed. The local
strategy is based on matching individual salient facial SIFT features as
connected to facial landmarks such as the eyes and the mouth. As for the global
matching strategy, all SIFT features are combined together to form a single
feature. In order to reduce the identification errors, the Dempster-Shafer
decision theory is applied to fuse the two matching techniques. The proposed
algorithms are evaluated with the ORL and the IITK face databases. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the
proposed face recognition techniques also in the case of partially occluded
faces or with missing information.
