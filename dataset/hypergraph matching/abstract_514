Let G be a simple graph of order $n$ and $\mu_1,\mu_2,\ldots,\mu_n$ the roots
of its matching polynomial. The matching energy of $G$ is defined as the sum
$\sum_{i=1}^n|\mu_i|$. Let $K_{n-1,1}^k$ be the graph obtained from $K_1\cup
K_{n-1}$ by adding $k$ edges between $V(K_1)$ and $V(K_{n-1})$. In this paper,
we show that $K_{n-1,1}^k$ has maximum matching energy among all connected
graph with order $n$ and edge connectivity $k$.
