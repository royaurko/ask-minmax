Probability estimation by maximum entropy reconstruction of an initial
relative frequency estimate from its projection onto a hypergraph model of the
approximate conditional independence relations exhibited by it is investigated.
The results of this study suggest that use of this estimation technique may
improve the quality of decisions that must be made on the basis of limited
observations over a decomposable finite product space.
