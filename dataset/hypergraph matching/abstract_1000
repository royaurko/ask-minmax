We argue that when conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken the trace
anomalies in the broken and unbroken phases are matched. This puts strong
constraints on the various couplings of the dilaton. Using the uniqueness of
the effective action for the Goldstone supermultiplet for broken ${\cal N}=1$
superconformal symmetry the dilaton effective action is calculated.
