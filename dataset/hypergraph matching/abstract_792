The resummed differential thrust rate in e+e- annihilation is calculated
using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). The resulting distribution in the
two-jet region T~1 is found to agree with the corresponding expression derived
by the standard approach. A matching procedure to account for finite
corrections at T < 1 is then described. There are two important advantages of
the SCET approach. First, SCET manifests a dynamical seesaw scale q = p^2/Q in
addition to the center-of-mass energy Q and the jet mass scale p ~ Q ~ sqrt(1 -
T). Thus, the resummation of logs of p/q can be cleanly distinguished from the
resummation of logs of Q/p. Second, finite parts of loop amplitudes appear in
specific places in the perturbative distribution: in the matching to the hard
function, at the scale Q, in matching to the jet function, at the scale p, and
in matching to the soft function, at the scale q. This allows for a consistent
merger of fixed order corrections and resummation. In particular, the total NLO
e+e- cross section is reproduced from these finite parts without having to
perform additional infrared regulation.
