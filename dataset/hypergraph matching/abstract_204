The first three contributors [European J. Combin. 33 (2012), 62--71] established a
relationship between the transversal number and the domination number of
uniform hypergraphs. In this paper, we establish a relationship between the
total transversal number and the total domination number of uniform
hypergraphs. We prove tight asymptotic upper bounds on the total transversal
number in terms of the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the edge
size.
