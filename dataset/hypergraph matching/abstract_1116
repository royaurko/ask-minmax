A graph $H$ is single-crossing if it can be drawn in the plane with at most
one crossing. For any single-crossing graph $H$, we give an $O(n^4)$ time
algorithm for counting perfect matchings in graphs excluding $H$ as a minor.
The runtime can be lowered to $O(n^{1.5})$ when $G$ excludes $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$
as a minor. This is the first generalization of an algorithm for counting
perfect matchings in $K_{3,3}$-free graphs (Little 1974, Vazirani 1989). Our
algorithm uses black-boxes for counting perfect matchings in planar graphs and
for computing certain graph decompositions. Together with an independent recent
result (Straub et al. 2014) for graphs excluding $K_5$, it is one of the first
nontrivial algorithms to not inherently rely on Pfaffian orientations.
