In this paper, we propose a method for activity recognition from videos based
on sparse local features and hypergraph matching. We benefit from special
properties of the temporal domain in the data to derive a sequential and fast
graph matching algorithm for GPUs.
  Traditionally, graphs and hypergraphs are frequently used to recognize
complex and often non-rigid patterns in computer vision, either through graph
matching or point-set matching with graphs. Most formulations resort to the
minimization of a difficult discrete energy function mixing geometric or
structural terms with data attached terms involving appearance features.
Traditional methods solve this minimization problem approximately, for instance
with spectral techniques.
  In this work, instead of solving the problem approximatively, the exact
solution for the optimal assignment is calculated in parallel on GPUs. The
graphical structure is simplified and regularized, which allows to derive an
efficient recursive minimization algorithm. The algorithm distributes
subproblems over the calculation units of a GPU, which solves them in parallel,
allowing the system to run faster than real-time on medium-end GPUs.
