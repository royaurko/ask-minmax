We establish a characterization of the vertices of a tropical polyhedron
defined as the intersection of finitely many half-spaces. We show that a point
is a vertex if, and only if, a directed hypergraph, constructed from the
subdifferentials of the active constraints at this point, admits a unique
strongly connected component that is maximal with respect to the reachability
relation (all the other strongly connected components have access to it). This
property can be checked in almost linear-time. This allows us to develop a
tropical analogue of the classical double description method, which computes a
minimal internal representation (in terms of vertices) of a polyhedron defined
externally (by half-spaces or hyperplanes). We provide theoretical worst case
complexity bounds and report extensive experimental tests performed using the
library TPLib, showing that this method outperforms the other existing
approaches.
