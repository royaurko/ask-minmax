This paper introduces "rebar," a method combining a causal matching design
with high dimensional modeling to account for a large set of covariates. After
constructing a match, a researcher models control potential outcomes as a
function of the full covariate matrix using high dimensional regression,
trained on the unmatched control subjects. The resulting predictions in the
matched set then adjust the causal estimate to reduce confounding bias. We
present theoretical results to justify the method's bias-reducing properties,
as well as a simulation study that demonstrates them. Additionally, we
illustrate the method in an evaluation of a school-level comprehensive
educational reform program in Arizona.
