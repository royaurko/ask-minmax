We study set-theoretic solutions $(X,r)$ of the Yang-Baxter equations on a
set $X$ in terms of the induced left and right actions of $X$ on itself. We
give a characterization of involutive square-free solutions in terms of
cyclicity conditions. We characterise general solutions in terms of abstract
matched pair properties of the associated monoid $S(X,r)$ and we show that $r$
extends as a solution $(S(X,r),r_S)$. Finally, we study extensions of solutions
both directly and in terms of matched pairs of their associated monoids. We
also prove several general results about matched pairs of monoids $S$ of the
required type, including iterated products $S\bowtie S\bowtie S$ equivalent to
$r_S$ a solution, and extensions $(S\bowtie T,r_{S\bowtie T})$. Examples
include a general `double' construction $(S\bowtie S,r_{S\bowtie S})$ and some
concrete extensions, their actions and graphs based on small sets.
