In this paper we analyze the probabilistic matching of sources with memory to
channels with memory so that symbol-by-symbol code with memory without
anticipation are optimal, with respect to an average distortion and excess
distortion probability. We show achievability of such a symbolby- symbol code
with memory without anticipation, and we show matching for the Binary Symmetric
Markov source (BSMS(p)) over a first-order symmetric channel with a cost
constraint.
