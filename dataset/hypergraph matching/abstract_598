Context-dependent identification of orthologs customarily relies on conserved
gene order or whole-genome sequence alignment. It is shown here that
short-range context--as short as single maximal matches--also provides an
effective means to identify orthologs within whole genomes. On pristine
(un-repeatmasked) mammalian whole-genome assemblies we perform a genome
"intersection" that in general consumes less than a tenth of the computation
time required by commonly used methods for genome alignment, and we extract
"non-embedded maximal matches," maximal matches that are not embedded into
other maximal matches, as potential orthologs. An ortholog identified via
non-embedded maximal matches is analogous to a "positional ortholog" or a
"primary ortholog" as defined in previous literature; such orthologs constitute
homologs derived from the same direct ancestor whose ancestral positions in the
genome are conserved. At the nucleotide level, non-embedded maximal matches
recapitulate most exact matches identified by a Lastz net alignment. At the
gene level, reciprocal best hits of genes containing non-embedded maximal
matches recover one-to-one orthologs annotated by Ensembl Compara with high
selectivity and high sensitivity; these reciprocal best hits additionally
include putatively novel orthologs not found in Ensembl (e.g. over two thousand
for human/chimpanzee). The method is especially suitable for genome-wide
identification of orthologs.
