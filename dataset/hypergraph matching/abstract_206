We introduce and study tropical eigenpairs of tensors, a generalization of
the tropical spectral theory of matrices. We show the existence and uniqueness
of an eigenvalue. We associate to a tensor a directed hypergraph and define a
new type of cycle on a hypergraph, which we call an H-cycle. The eigenvalue of
a tensor turns out to be equal to the minimal normalized weighted length of
H-cycles of the associated hypergraph. We show that the eigenvalue can be
computed efficiently via a linear program. Finally, we suggest possible
directions of research.
