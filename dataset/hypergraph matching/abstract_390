The neighborhood of a pair of vertices $u,v$ in a triple system is the set of
vertices $w$ such that $uvw$ is an edge.
  A triple system
  $\HH$ is semi-bipartite if its vertex set contains a vertex subset $X$ such
that every edge of $\HH$ intersects $X$ in exactly two points. It is easy to
see that if $\HH$ is semi-bipartite, then the neighborhood of every pair of
vertices in $\HH$ is an independent set. We show a partial converse of this
statement by proving that almost all triple systems with vertex sets $[n]$ and
independent neighborhoods are semi-bipartite. Our result can be viewed as an
extension of the Erd\H os-Kleitman-Rothschild theorem to triple systems. The
proof uses the Frankl-R\"odl hypergraph regularity lemma, and stability
theorems. Similar results have recently been proved for hypergraphs with
various other local constraints.
