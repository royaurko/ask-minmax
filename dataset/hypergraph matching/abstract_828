The twentieth century has seen the rise of a new type of video games targeted
at a mass audience of "casual" gamers. Many of these games require the player
to swap items in order to form matches of three and are collectively known as
\emph{tile-matching match-three games}. Among these, the most influential one
is arguably \emph{Bejeweled} in which the matched items (gems) pop and the
above gems fall in their place. Bejeweled has been ported to many different
platforms and influenced an incredible number of similar games. Very recently
one of them, named \emph{Candy Crush Saga} enjoyed a huge popularity and
quickly went viral on social networks. We generalize this kind of games by only
parameterizing the size of the board, while all the other elements (such as the
rules or the number of gems) remain unchanged. Then, we prove that answering
many natural questions regarding such games is actually \NP-Hard. These
questions include determining if the player can reach a certain score, play for
a certain number of turns, and others. We also

implementation of our reduction.
