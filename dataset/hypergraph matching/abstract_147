The paper proves the equivalence of the notions of nondeterministic and
deterministic parameter testing for uniform dense hypergraphs of arbitrary
order. It generalizes the result previously known only for the case of simple
graphs. By a similar method we establish also the equivalence between
nondeterministic and deterministic hypergraph property testing, answering the
open problem in the area. We introduce a new notion of a cut norm for
hypergraphs of higher order, and employ regularity techniques combined with the
ultralimit method.
