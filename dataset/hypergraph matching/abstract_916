We study the existence of perfect matchings in suitably chosen induced
subgraphs of random biregular bipartite graphs. We prove a result similar to a
classical theorem of Erdos and Renyi about perfect matchings in random
bipartite graphs. We also present an application to commutative graphs, a class
of graphs that are featured in additive number theory.
