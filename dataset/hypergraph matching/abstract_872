In this talk I summarize our recent works on the chiral phase transition in
the large flavor QCD studied by the hidden local symmetry (HLS). Bare
parameters in the HLS are determined by matching the HLS with the underlying
QCD at the matching scale through the Wilsonian matching. This leads to the
vector manifestation of the Wigner realization of the chiral symmetry in which
the symmetry is restored by the massless degenerate pion (and its flavor
partners) and rho meson (and its flavor partners) as the chiral partner.
