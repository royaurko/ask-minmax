Ryser conjectured that $\tau\le(r-1)\nu$ for $r$-partite hypergraphs, where
$\tau$ is the covering number and $\nu$ is the matching number. We prove this
conjecture for $r\le9$ in the special case of linear intersecting hypergraphs,
in other words where every pair of lines meets in exactly one vertex. Aharoni
formulated a stronger version of Ryser's conjecture which specified that each
$r$-partite hypergraph should have a cover of size $(r-1)\nu$ of a particular
form. We provide a counterexample to Aharoni's conjecture with $r=13$ and
$\nu=1$. We also report a number of computational results. For $r=7$, we find
that there is no linear intersecting hypergraph that achieves the equality
$\tau=r-1$ in Ryser's conjecture, although non-linear examples are known. We
exhibit intersecting non-linear examples achieving equality for
$r\in\{9,13,17\}$. Also, we find that $r=8$ is the smallest value of $r$ for
which there exists a linear intersecting $r$-partite hypergraph that achieves
$\tau=r-1$ and is not isomorphic to a subhypergraph of a projective plane.
