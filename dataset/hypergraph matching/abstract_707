A {\it rainbow matching} in an edge-colored graph is a matching in which all
the edges have distinct colors. Wang asked if there is a function f(\delta)
such that a properly edge-colored graph G with minimum degree \delta and order
at least f(\delta) must have a rainbow matching of size \delta. We answer this
question in the affirmative; f(\delta) = 6.5\delta suffices. Furthermore, the
proof provides a O(\delta(G)|V(G)|^2)-time algorithm that generates such a
matching.
