We present a new method for treating the inner Cauchy boundary of a black
hole spacetime by matching to a characteristic evolution. We discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of such a scheme relative to Cauchy-only
approaches. A prototype code, for the spherically symmetric collapse of a
self-gravitating scalar field, shows that matching performs at least as well as
other approaches to handling the inner boundary.
