We present progress on the problem of asymptotically describing the complex
homogeneous adjacency eigenvalues of random and complete uniform hypergraphs.
There is a natural conjecture arising from analogy to random matrix theory that
connects these spectra to that of the all-ones hypermatrix. Several of the
ingredients along a possible path to this conjecture are established, and may
be of independent interest in spectral hypergraph/hypermatrix theory. In
particular, we provide a bound on the spectral radius of the symmetric
Bernoulli hyperensemble.
