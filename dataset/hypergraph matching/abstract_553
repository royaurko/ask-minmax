Biochemical reaction systems may be viewed as discrete event processes
characterized by a number of states and state transitions. These systems may be
modeled as state transition systems with transitions representing individual
reaction events. Since they often involve a large number of interactions, it
can be difficult to construct such a model for a system, and since the
resulting state-level model can involve a huge number of states, model analysis
can be difficult or impossible. Here, we describe methods for the high-level
specification of a system using hypergraphs, for the automated generation of a
state-level model from a high-level model, and for the exact reduction of a
state-level model using information from the high-level model. Exact reduction
is achieved through the automated application of symmetry reduction and
invariant manifold reduction techniques to the high-level model, allowing
potentially significant reductions without the need to generate a full model.
The application of the method to biochemical reaction systems is illustrated by
models describing a hypothetical ion-channel at several levels of complexity.
The method allows for the reduction of the otherwise intractable example models
to a manageable size.
