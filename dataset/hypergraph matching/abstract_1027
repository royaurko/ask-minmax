This paper is concerned with the problem of establishing an index based on
word matching. It is assumed that the book was digitised as better as possible
and some pre-processing techniques were already applied as line orientation
correction and some noise removal. However two main factor are responsible for
being not possible to apply ordinary optical character recognition techniques
(OCR): the presence of antique fonts and the degraded state of many characters
due to unrecoverable original time degradation. In this paper we make a short
introduction to word segmentation that involves finding the lines that
characterise a word. After we discuss different approaches for word matching
and how they can be combined to obtain an ordered list for candidate words for
the matching. This discussion will be illustrated by examples.
