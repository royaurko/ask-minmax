The lambda calculus with constructors is an extension of the lambda calculus
with variadic constructors. It decomposes the pattern-matching a la ML into a
case analysis on constants and a commutation rule between case and application
constructs. Although this commutation rule does not match with the usual
computing intuitions, it makes the calculus expressive and confluent, with a
rather simple syntax. In this paper we define a sound notion of categorical
model for the lambda calculus with constructors. We then prove that this
definition is complete for the fragment of the calculus with no match-failure,
using the model of partial equivalence relations.
