Let $A$ be a subset of positive relative upper density of $\PP^d$, the
$d$-tuples of primes. We prove that $A$ contains an affine copy of any finite
set $F\subs\Z^d$, which provides a natural multi-dimensional extension of the
theorem of Green and Tao on the existence of long arithmetic progressions in
the primes. The proof uses the hypergraph approach by assigning a pseudo-random
weight system to the pattern $F$ on a $d+1$-partite hypergraph; a novel feature
being that the hypergraph is no longer uniform with weights attached to lower
dimensional edges. Then, instead of using a transference principle, we proceed
by extending the proof of the so-called hypergraph removal lemma to our
settings, relying only on the linear forms condition of Green and Tao.
