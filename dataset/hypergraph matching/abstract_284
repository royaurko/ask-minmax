We analyze Avoider-Enforcer games played on edge disjoint hypergraphs,
providing an analog of the classic and well known game $Box$, due to
Chv\'{a}tal and Erd\H{o}s. We consider both strict and monotone versions of
Avoider-Enforcer games, and for each version we give a sufficient condition to
win for each player. We also present applications of our results to several
general Avoider-Enforcer games.
