We introduce a correspondence principle (analogous to the Furstenberg
correspondence principle) that allows one to extract an infinite random graph
or hypergraph from a sequence of increasingly large deterministic graphs or
hypergraphs. As an application we present a new (infinitary) proof of the
hypergraph removal lemma of Nagle-Schacht-R\"odl-Skokan and Gowers, which does
not require the hypergraph regularity lemma and requires significantly less
computation. This in turn gives new proofs of several corollaries of the
hypergraph removal lemma, such as Szemer\'edi's theorem on arithmetic
progressions.
