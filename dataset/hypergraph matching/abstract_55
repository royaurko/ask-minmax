Using a $Z_q$-generalization of a theorem of Ky Fan, we extend to Kneser
hypergraphs a theorem of Simonyi and Tardos that ensures the existence of
multicolored complete bipartite graphs in any proper coloring of a Kneser
graph. It allows to derive a lower bound for the local chromatic number of
Kneser hypergraphs (using a natural definition of what can be the local
chromatic number of a hypergraph).
