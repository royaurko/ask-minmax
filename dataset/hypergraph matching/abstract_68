We prove a complexity dichotomy for complex-weighted Holant problems with an
arbitrary set of symmetric constraint functions on Boolean variables. This
dichotomy is specifically to answer the question: Is the FKT algorithm under a
holographic transformation a \emph{universal} strategy to obtain
polynomial-time algorithms for problems over planar graphs that are intractable
in general? This dichotomy is a culmination of previous ones, including those
for Spin Systems, Holant, and #CSP. A recurring theme has been that a
holographic reduction to FKT is a universal strategy. Surprisingly, for planar
Holant, we discover new planar tractable problems that are not expressible by a
holographic reduction to FKT.
  In previous work, an important tool was a dichotomy for #CSP^d, which denotes
#CSP where every variable appears a multiple of d times. However its proof
violates planarity. We prove a dichotomy for planar #CSP^2. We apply this
planar #CSP^2 dichotomy in the proof of the planar Holant dichotomy.
  As a special case of our new planar tractable problems, counting perfect
matchings (#PM) over k-uniform hypergraphs is polynomial-time computable when
the incidence graph is planar and k >= 5. The same problem is #P-hard when k=3
or k=4, which is also a consequence of our dichotomy. When k=2, it becomes #PM
over planar graphs and is tractable again. More generally, over hypergraphs
with specified hyperedge sizes and the same planarity assumption, #PM is
polynomial-time computable if the greatest common divisor of all hyperedge
sizes is at least 5.
