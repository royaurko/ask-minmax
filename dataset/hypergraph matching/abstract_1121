This work aims to resolve issues related to Web Service retrieval, also known
as Service Selection, Discovery or essentially Matching, in two directions.
Firstly, a novel matching algorithm for SAWSDL is introduced. The algorithm is
hybrid in nature, combining novel and known concepts, such as a logic-based
strategy and syntactic text-similarity measures on semantic annotations and
textual descriptions. A plugin for the S3 contest environment was developed, in
order to position Tomaco amongst state-of-the-art in an objective, reproducible
manner. Evaluation showed that Tomaco ranks high amongst state of the art,
especially for early recall levels. Secondly, this work introduces the Tomaco
web application, which aims to accelerate the wide-spread adoption of Semantic
Web Service technologies and algorithms while targeting the lack of
user-friendly applications in this field. Tomaco integrates a variety of
configurable matching algorithms proposed in this paper. It, finally, allows
discovery of both existing and user-contributed service collections and
ontologies, serving also as a service registry.
