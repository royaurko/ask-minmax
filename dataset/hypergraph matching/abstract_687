In 1972, Erd\"{o}s - Faber - Lov\'{a}sz (EFL) conjectured that, if
$\textbf{H}$ is a linear hypergraph consisting of $n$ edges of cardinality $n$,
then it is possible to color the vertices with $n$ colors so that no two
vertices with the same color are in the same edge. In 1978, Deza, Erd\"{o}s and
Frankl had given an equivalent version of the same for graphs: Let $G=
\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i$ denote a graph with $n$ complete graphs $A_1, A_2,$ $
\dots , A_n$, each having exactly $n$ vertices and have the property that every
pair of complete graphs has at most one common vertex, then the chromatic
number of $G$ is $n$.
  The clique degree $d^K(v)$ of a vertex $v$ in $G$ is given by $d^K(v) =
|\{A_i: v \in V(A_i), 1 \leq i \leq n\}|$. The maximum clique degree $\Delta
^K(G)$ of the graph $G$ is given by $\Delta ^K(G)=max_{v\in V(G)}d^K(v)$. In
this paper, using Symmetric Latin Squares and clique degrees of $G$, we give a
constructive proof of the above conjecture for all graphs $G$ satisfying the
hypothesis of the conjecture and with out the vertices of clique degree $2$.
