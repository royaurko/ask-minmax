We consider the problem of $k$-colouring a random $r$-uniform hypergraph with
$n$ vertices and $cn$ edges, where $k$, $r$, $c$ remain constant as $n$ tends
to infinity. Achlioptas and Naor showed that the chromatic number of a random
graph in this setting, the case $r=2$, must have one of two easily computable
values as $n$ tends to infinity. We give a complete generalisation of this
result to random uniform hypergraphs.
