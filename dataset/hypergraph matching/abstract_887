Beck et. al. characterized the grid graphs whose perfect matching polytopes
are Gorenstein and they also showed that for some parameters, perfect matching
polytopes of torus graphs are Gorenstein. In this paper, we complement their
result, that is, we characterize the torus graphs whose perfect matching
polytopes are Gorenstein. Beck et. al. also gave a method to construct an
infinite family of Gorenstein polytopes. In this paper, we introduce a new
class of polytopes obtained from graphs and we extend their method to construct
many more Gorenstein polytopes.
