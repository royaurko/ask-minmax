We look at colourings of $r$-uniform hypergraphs, focusing our attention on
unique colourability and gaps in the chromatic spectrum. The pattern of an edge
$E$ in an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ whose vertices are coloured is the
partition of $r$ induced by the colour classes of the vertices in $E$. Let $Q$
be a set of partitions of $r$. A $Q$-colouring of $H$ is a colouring of its
vertices such that only patterns appearing in $Q$ are allowed. We first show
that many known hypergraph colouring problems, including Ramsey theory, can be
stated in the language of $Q$-colourings. Then, using as our main tools the
notions of $Q$-colourings and $\Sigma$-hypergraphs, we define and prove a
result on tight colourings, which is a strengthening of the notion of unique
colourability. $\Sigma$-hypergraphs are a natural generalisation of
$\sigma$-hypergraphs introduced by the first two contributors in an earlier paper.
We also show that there exist $\Sigma$-hypergraphs with arbitrarily large
$Q$-chromatic number and chromatic number but with bounded clique number.
Dvorak et al. have characterised those $Q$ which can lead to a hypergraph with
a gap in its $Q$-spectrum. We give a short direct proof of the necessity of
their condition on $Q$. We also prove a partial converse for the special case
of $\Sigma$-hypergraphs. Finally, we show that, for at least one family $Q$
which is known to yield hypergraphs with gaps, there exist no
$\Sigma$-hypergraphs with gaps in their $Q$-spectrum.
