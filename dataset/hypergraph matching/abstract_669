We put forth a new string matching algorithm which matches the pattern from
neither the left nor the right end, instead a special position. Comparing with
the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm and the Boyer-Moore algorithm, the new
algorithm is more flexible to pick the position for starting comparisons. The
option really brings it a saving in cost.
