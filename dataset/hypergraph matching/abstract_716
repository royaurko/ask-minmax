Let $g(n)$ be the least number such that every collection of $n$ matchings,
each of size at least $g(n)$, in a bipartite graph, has a full rainbow
matching. Aharoni and Berger \cite{AhBer} conjectured that $g(n)=n+1$ for every
$n>1$. This generalizes famous conjectures of Ryser, Brualdi and Stein.
Recently, Aharoni, Charbit and Howard \cite{ACH} proved that
$g(n)\le\lfloor\frac{7}{4}n\rfloor$. We prove that $g(n)\le\lfloor\frac{5}{3}
n\rfloor$.
