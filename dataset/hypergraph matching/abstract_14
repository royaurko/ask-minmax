A hypergraph $H$ is called universal for a family $\mathcal{F}$ of
hypergraphs, if it contains every hypergraph $F \in \mathcal{F}$ as a copy. For
the family of $r$-uniform hypergraphs with maximum vertex degree bounded by
$\Delta$ and at most $n$ vertices every universal hypergraph has to contain
$\Omega(n^{r-r/\Delta})$ many edges. We exploit constructions of Alon and
Capalbo [Sparse universal graphs for bounded-degree graphs, Random Structures
Algorithms 31 (2007), no. 2, 123-133; Optimal universal graphs with
deterministic embedding, Proceedings of the nineteenth annual ACM-SIAM
symposium on Discrete algorithms, Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics, 2008, pp. 373-378] to obtain universal $r$-uniform hypergraphs
with $O (n^{r-2/ \lceil 2\Delta/r \rceil})$ edges, in particularly matching the
lower bound in the case $r \mid 2\Delta$.
