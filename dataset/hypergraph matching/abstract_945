Matching texts in highly inflected languages such as Arabic by simple
stemming strategy is unlikely to perform well. In this paper, we present a
strategy for automatic text matching technique for for inflectional languages,
using Arabic as the test case. The system is an extension of ROUGE test in
which texts are matched on token's lemma level. The experimental results show
an enhancement of detecting similarities between different sentences having
same semantics but written in different lexical forms..
