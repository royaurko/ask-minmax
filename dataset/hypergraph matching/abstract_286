Let F be a hypergraph and let forb(m,F) denote the maximum number of edges a
hypergraph with m vertices can have if it doesn't contain F as a subhypergraph.
A conjecture of Anstee and Sali predicts the asymptotic behaviour of forb(m,F)
for fixed F. In this paper we prove that even finding this predicted asymptotic
behaviour is an NP-hard problem, meaning that if the Anstee-Sali conjecture
were true, finding the asymptotics of forb(m,F) would be NP-hard.
