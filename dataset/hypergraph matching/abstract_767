Friedland's Lower Matching Conjecture asserts that if $G$ is a $d$--regular
bipartite graph on $v(G)=2n$ vertices, and $m_k(G)$ denotes the number of
matchings of size $k$, then $$m_k(G)\geq {n \choose
k}^2\left(\frac{d-p}{d}\right)^{n(d-p)}(dp)^{np},$$ where $p=\frac{k}{n}$. When
$p=1$, this conjecture reduces to a theorem of Schrijver which says that a
$d$--regular bipartite graph on $v(G)=2n$ vertices has at least
$$\left(\frac{(d-1)^{d-1}}{d^{d-2}}\right)^n$$ perfect matchings. L. Gurvits
proved an asymptotic version of the Lower Matching Conjecture, namely he proved
that $$\frac{\ln m_k(G)}{v(G)}\geq \frac{1}{2}\left(p\ln
\left(\frac{d}{p}\right)+(d-p)\ln \left(1-\frac{p}{d}\right)-2(1-p)\ln
(1-p)\right)+o_{v(G)}(1).$$
  In this paper, we prove the Lower Matching Conjecture. In fact, we will prove
a slightly stronger statement which gives an extra $c_p\sqrt{n}$ factor
compared to the conjecture if $p$ is separated away from $0$ and $1$, and is
tight up to a constant factor if $p$ is separated away from $1$. We will also
give a new proof of Gurvits's and Schrijver's theorems, and we extend these
theorems to $(a,b)$--biregular bipartite graphs.
