A colouring of a hypergraph's vertices is polychromatic if every hyperedge
contains at least one vertex of each colour; the polychromatic number is the
maximum number of colours in such a colouring. Its dual, the
cover-decomposition number, is the maximum number of disjoint hyperedge-covers.
In geometric hypergraphs, there is extensive work on lower-bounding these
numbers in terms of their trivial upper bounds (minimum hyperedge size and
degree); our goal here is to broaden the study beyond geometric settings. We
obtain algorithms yielding near-tight bounds for three families of hypergraphs:
bounded hyperedge size, paths in trees, and bounded VC-dimension. This reveals
that discrepancy theory and iterated linear program relaxation are useful for
cover-decomposition. Finally, we discuss the generalization of
cover-decomposition to sensor cover.
