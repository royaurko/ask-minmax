We present one-loop matching coefficients between continuum and lattice QCD
for the heavy-light four-fermion operators relevant for neutral B meson mixing
both within and beyond the Standard Model. For the lattice theory we use
nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) to describe b quarks and improved staggered
fermions (AsqTad) for light quarks. The gauge action is the tree-level Symanzik
improved gauge action. Matching to full QCD is carried out through order
alpha_s, Lambda_{QCD}/M_b, and alpha_s/(aM_b).
