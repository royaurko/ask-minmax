We introduce the notion of Hypergraph Weighted Model (HWM) that generically
associates a tensor network to a hypergraph and then computes a value by tensor
contractions directed by its hyperedges. A series r defined on a hypergraph
family is said to be recognizable if there exists a HWM that computes it. This
model generalizes the notion of rational series on strings and trees. We prove
some properties of the model and study at which conditions finite support
series are recognizable.
