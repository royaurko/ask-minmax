A C-coloring of a hypergraph ${\cal H}=(X,{\cal E})$ is a vertex coloring
$\varphi: X\to {\mathbb{N}}$ such that each edge $E\in{\cal E}$ has at least
two vertices with a common color. The related parameter $\overline{\chi}({\cal
H})$, called the upper chromatic number of ${\cal H}$, is the maximum number of
colors can be used in a C-coloring of ${\cal H}$. A hypertree is a hypergraph
which has a host tree $T$ such that each edge $E\in {\cal E}$ induces a
connected subgraph in $T$. Notations $n$ and $m$ stand for the number of
vertices and edges, respectively, in a generic input hypergraph.
  We establish guaranteed polynomial-time approximation ratios for the
difference $n-\overline{\chi}({\cal H})$, which is $2+2 \ln (2m)$ on
hypergraphs in general, and $1+ \ln m$ on hypertrees. The latter ratio is
essentially tight as we show that $n-\overline{\chi}({\cal H})$ cannot be
approximated within $(1-\epsilon) \ln m$ on hypertrees (unless ${\sf NP}
\subseteq {\sf DTIME} (n^{{\cal O}(log\;log\; n)})$). Furthermore,
$\overline{\chi}({\cal H})$ does not have ${\cal
O}(n^{1-\epsilon})$-approximation and cannot be approximated within additive
error $o(n)$ on the class of hypertrees (unless ${\sf P}={\sf NP}$).
