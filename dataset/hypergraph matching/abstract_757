For a set $R$ of $n$ red points and a set $B$ of $n$ blue points, a
$BR$-matching is a non-crossing geometric perfect matching where each segment
has one endpoint in $B$ and one in $R$. Two $BR$-matchings are compatible if
their union is also non-crossing. We prove that, for any two distinct
$BR$-matchings $M$ and $M'$, there exists a sequence of $BR$-matchings $M =
M_1, ..., M_k = M'$ such that $M_{i-1} $ is compatible with $M_i$. This implies
the connectivity of the compatible bichromatic matching graph containing one
node for each bichromatic matching and an edge joining each pair of compatible
matchings, thereby answering the open problem posed by Aichholzer et al. in
"Compatible matchings for bichromatic plane straight-line graphs"
