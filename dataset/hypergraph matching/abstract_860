Within the framework of an exact general relativistic formulation of gluing
manifolds, we consider the problem of matching an inhomogeneous overdense
region to a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background universe in the general
spherical symmetric case of pressure-free models. It is shown that, in general,
the matching is only possible through a thin shell, a fact ignored in the
literature. In addition to this, in subhorizon cases where the matching is
possible, an intermediate underdense region will necessarily arise.
