Along with the development of interferometric gravitational wave detector, we
enter into an epoch of gravitational wave astronomy, which will open a brand
new window for astrophysics to observe our universe. Almost all of the data
analysis methods in gravitational wave detection are based on matched
filtering. Gravitational wave detection is a typical example of weak signal
detection, and this weak signal is buried in strong instrument noise. So it
seems attractable if we can take advantage of stochastic resonance. But
unfortunately, almost all of the stochastic resonance theory is based on
Fourier transformation and has no relation to matched filtering. In this paper
we try to relate stochastic resonance to matched filtering. Our results show
that stochastic resonance can indeed be combined with matched filtering for
both periodic and non-periodic input signal. This encouraging result will be
the first step to apply stochastic resonance to matched filtering in
gravitational wave detection. In addition, based on matched filtering, we
firstly proposed a novel measurement method for stochastic resonance which is
valid for both periodic and non-periodic driven signal.
