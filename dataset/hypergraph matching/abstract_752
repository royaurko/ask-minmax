We present an exact electrovacuum solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations with
infinite sets of multipole moments which can be used to describe the exterior
gravitational field of a rotating charged mass distribution. We show that in
the special case of a slowly rotating and slightly deformed body, the exterior
solution can be matched to an interior solution belonging to the Hartle-Thorne
family of approximate solutions. To search for exact interior solutions, we
propose to use the derivatives of the curvature eigenvalues to formulate a
$C^3-$matching condition from which the minimum radius can be derived at which
the matching of interior and exterior spacetimes can be carried out. We prove
the validity of the $C^3-$matching in the particular case of a static mass with
a quadrupole moment. The corresponding interior solution is obtained
numerically and the matching with the exterior solution gives as a result the
minimum radius of the mass configuration.
