This paper studies geodesics in the graph $\mathscr{P}_{m}$, which has all
perfect matchings in $K_{2m}$ as vertices with two perfect matchings connected
by an edge if their symmetric difference is a cycle of length four.
  The diameter of $\mathscr{P}_{m}$, as well as the eccentricity of each
vertex, are shown to be $m-1$. The number of geodesics between any two
antipodes is shown to be $m^{m-2}$ and an explicit formula for the number of
geodesics between any two matchings in $\mathscr{P}_{m}$ is given.
  The paper concludes by showing that the subgraph of non-crossing perfect
matchings has exactly one pair of antipodes having the maximal number
($m^{m-2}$) of geodesics.
