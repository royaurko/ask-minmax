In 1974, Trotter provided a formula to compute the order dimension of the
generalized crown $\mathbb{S}^k_n$. In 2014, Garcia and Silva defined a
layering of generalized crowns and provided a formula for the order dimension
of the $\ell$-layered generalized crown. In this paper, we characterize the
adjacency matrix of the skeleton of the strict hypergraph of the $\ell$-layered
generalized crown.
