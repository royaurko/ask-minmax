One of the most famous results in the theory of random graphs establishes
that the threshold for Hamiltonicity in the Erdos-Renyi random graph G_{n,p} is
around p ~ (log n + log log n) / n. Much research has been done to extend this
to increasingly challenging random structures. In particular, a recent result
by Frieze determined the asymptotic threshold for a loose Hamilton cycle in the
random 3-uniform hypergraph by connecting 3-uniform hypergraphs to edge-colored
graphs.
  In this work, we consider that setting of edge-colored graphs, and prove a
result which achieves the best possible first order constant. Specifically,
when the edges of G_{n,p} are randomly colored from a set of (1 + o(1)) n
colors, with p = (1 + o(1)) (log n) / n, we show that one can almost always
find a Hamilton cycle which has the further property that all edges are
distinctly colored (rainbow).
