Since Cho and Kim (2005) showed that the competition graph of a doubly
partial order is an interval graph, it has been actively studied whether or not
the same phenomenon occurs for other variants of competition graph and
interesting results have been obtained. Continuing in the same spirit, we study
the competition hypergraph, an interesting variant of the competition graph, of
a doubly partial order. Though it turns out that the competition hypergraph of
a doubly partial order is not always interval, we completely characterize the
competition hypergraphs of doubly partial orders which are interval.
