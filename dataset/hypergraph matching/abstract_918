Matched decoding is a technique that enables the efficient maximum-likelihood
sequence estimation of convolutionally encoded PAM-transmission over
ISI-channels. Recently, we have shown that the super-trellis of encoder and
channel can be described with significantly fewer states without loss in
Euclidean distance, by introducing a non-linear representation of the trellis.
This paper extends the matched decoding concept to punctured convolutional
codes and introduces a time-variant, non-linear trellis description.
