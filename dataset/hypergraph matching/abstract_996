In this paper, we investigate how the Wiener index of unicyclic graphs varies
with graph operations. These results are used to present a sharp lower bound
for the Wiener index of unicyclic graphs of order $n$ with girth and the
matching number $\beta\ge \frac{3g}{2}$. Moreover, we characterize all extremal
graphs which attain the lower bound.
