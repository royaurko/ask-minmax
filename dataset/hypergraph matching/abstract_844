The set of 60 real rays in four dimensions derived from the vertices of a
600-cell is shown to possess numerous subsets of rays and bases that provide
basis-critical parity proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker (BKS) theorem (a
basis-critical proof is one that fails if even a single basis is deleted from
it). The proofs vary considerably in size, with the smallest having 26 rays and
13 bases and the largest 60 rays and 41 bases. There are at least 90 basic
types of proofs, with each coming in a number of geometrically distinct
varieties. The replicas of all the proofs under the symmetries of the 600-cell
yield a total of almost a hundred million parity proofs of the BKS theorem. The
proofs are all very transparent and take no more than simple counting to
verify. A few of the proofs are exhibited, both in tabular form as well as in
the form of MMP hypergraphs that assist in their visualization. A survey of the
proofs is given, simple procedures for generating some of them are described
and their applications are discussed. It is shown that all four-dimensional
parity proofs of the BKS theorem can be turned into experimental disproofs of
noncontextuality.
