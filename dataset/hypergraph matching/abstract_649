Consider a random graph model where each possible edge $e$ is present
independently with some probability $p_e$. Given these probabilities, we want
to build a large/heavy matching in the randomly generated graph. However, the
only way we can find out whether an edge is present or not is to query it, and
if the edge is indeed present in the graph, we are forced to add it to our
matching. Further, each vertex $i$ is allowed to be queried at most $t_i$
times. How should we adaptively query the edges to maximize the expected weight
of the matching? We consider several matching problems in this general
framework (some of which arise in kidney exchanges and online dating, and
others arise in modeling online advertisements); we give LP-rounding based
constant-factor approximation algorithms for these problems. Our main results
are the following:
  We give a 4 approximation for weighted stochastic matching on general graphs,
and a 3 approximation on bipartite graphs. This answers an open question from
[Chen etal ICALP 09]. Combining our LP-rounding algorithm with the natural
greedy algorithm, we give an improved 3.46 approximation for unweighted
stochastic matching on general graphs.
  We introduce a generalization of the stochastic online matching problem
[Feldman etal FOCS 09] that also models preference-uncertainty and timeouts of
buyers, and give a constant factor approximation algorithm.
