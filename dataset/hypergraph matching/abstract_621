Posterior matching is a method proposed by Ofer Shayevitz and Meir Feder to
design capacity achieving coding schemes for general point-to-point memoryless
channels with feedback. In this paper, we present a way to extend posterior
matching based encoding and variable rate decoding ideas for the Gaussian MAC
with feedback, referred to as time-varying posterior matching scheme, analyze
the achievable rate region and error probabilities of the extended
encoding-decoding scheme. The time-varying posterior matching scheme is a
generalization of the Shayevitz and Feder's posterior matching scheme when the
posterior distributions of the input messages given output are not fixed over
transmission time slots. It turns out that the well-known Ozarow's encoding
scheme, which obtains the capacity of two-user Gaussian channel, is a special
case of our extended posterior matching framework as the Schalkwijk-Kailath's
scheme is a special case of the point-to-point posterior matching mentioned
above. Furthermore, our designed posterior matching also obtains the
linear-feedback sum-capacity for the symmetric multiuser Gaussian MAC. Besides,
the encoding scheme in this paper is designed for the real Gaussian MAC to
obtain that performance, which is different from previous approaches where
encoding schemes are designed for the complex Gaussian MAC. More importantly,
this paper shows potential of posterior matching in designing optimal coding
schemes for multiuser channels with feedback.
