We give a constructive bijective proof for an identity that generalizes an
observation of Kasteleyn: Let $m$ and $n$ be positive even numbers and let
$T_{m,n}$ be the toroidal square grid which consists of $m$ horizontal and $n$
vertical cycles. Let $A$ be one layer of the horizontal edges of $T_{m,n}$ and
let $B$ be one layer of the vertical edges of $T_{m,n}$. We say that a perfect
matching is even if it has an even number of elements of each of $A,B$.
Otherwise we say that the perfect matching is odd. We exhibit an (efficiently
computable) involution between the set of even and odd perfect matchings of
$T_{m,n}$. In fact, we show that our involution preserves the number of
horizontal and vertical edges of perfect matchings. In particular, it follows
that $T_{m,n}$ has as many even perfect matchings as odd ones.
