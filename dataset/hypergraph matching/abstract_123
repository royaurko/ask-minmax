Cartesian products of graphs and hypergraphs have been studied since the
1960s. For (un)directed hypergraphs, unique \emph{prime factor decomposition
(PFD)} results with respect to the Cartesian product are known. However, there
is still a lack of algorithms, that compute the PFD of directed hypergraphs
with respect to the Cartesian product.
  In this contribution, we focus on the algorithmic aspects for determining the
Cartesian prime factors of a finite, connected, directed hypergraph and present
a first polynomial time algorithm to compute its PFD. In particular, the
algorithm has time complexity $O(|E||V|r^2)$ for hypergraphs $H=(V,E)$, where
the rank $r$ is the maximum number of vertices contained in an hyperedge of
$H$. If $r$ is bounded, then this algorithm performs even in
$O(|E|\log^2(|V|))$ time. Thus, our method additionally improves also the time
complexity of PFD-algorithms designed for undirected hypergraphs that have time
complexity $O(|E||V|r^6\Delta^6)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum number of
hyperedges a vertex is contained in.
