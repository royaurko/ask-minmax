Consider independent fair coin-flips at each site of the lattice Z^d. A
translation-equivariant matching rule is a perfect matching of heads to tails
that commutes with translations of Z^d and is given by a deterministic function
of the coin-flips. Let X_R be the distance from the origin to its partner,
under the translation-equivariant matching rule R. Holroyd and Peres asked what
is optimal tail behaviour of X_R, for translation-equivariant perfect matching
rules. We prove that for every d>1, there exists a translation-equivariant
perfect matching rule R such that X_R has a finite p-th moment for every 0 < p
< 2/3.
