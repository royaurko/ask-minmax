A delta-function method was proposed to quantitatively evaluate the
electromagnetic impedance matching degree. Measured electromagnetic parameters
of {\alpha}-Fe/Fe3B/Y2O3 nanocomposites are applied to calculate the matching
degree by the method. Compared with reflection loss and quarter-wave principle
theory, the method accurately reveals the intrinsic mechanism of microwave
transmission and reflection properties. A possible honeycomb structure with
promising high-performance microwave absorption according to the method is also
proposed.
