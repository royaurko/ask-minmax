We present a novel routine, namely medlineR, based on R-language, that
enables the user to match data from MEDLINE/PubMed with records indexed in the
ISI Web of Science (WoS) database. The matching allows exploiting the rich and
controlled vocabulary of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of MEDLINE/PubMed with
additional fields of WoS. The integration provides data (e.g. citation data,
list of cited reference, full list of the addresses of contributors' host
organisations, WoS subject categories) to perform a variety of scientometric
analyses. This brief communication describes medlineR, the methodology on which
it relies, and the steps the user should follow to perform the matching across
the two databases. In order to specify the differences from Leydesdorff and
Opthof (2013), we conclude the brief communication by testing the routine on
the case of the "Burgada Syndrome".
