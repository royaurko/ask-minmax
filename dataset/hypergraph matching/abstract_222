We determine the probability thresholds for the existence of monotone paths,
of ?finite and infi?nite length, in random oriented graphs with vertex set
$\mathbb N^{[k]}$, the set of all increasing $k$-tuples in $\mathbb N$. These
graphs appear as line graph of uniform hypergraphs with vertex set $\mathbb N$.
