The matching condition which determines the effect of a heavy quark threshold
on the running of the QCD coupling $\alpha_{\overline{MS}}$ is reviewed. The
matching scale is arbitrary to some extent. However, this affects the value of
$\alpha_{\overline{MS}}$ away from the threshold region only marginally.
