We present a new cluster catalog extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Data Release 6 (SDSS DR6) using an adaptive matched filter (AMF) cluster
finder. We identify 69,173 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.045 $\le z
<$ 0.78 in 8420 sq. deg. of the sky. We provide angular position, redshift,
richness, core and virial radii estimates for these clusters, as well as an
error analysis for each of these quantities. We also provide a catalog of more
than 205,000 galaxies representing the three brightest galaxies in the $r$ band
which are possible BCG candidates. We show basic properties of the BCG
candidates and study how their luminosity scales in redshift and cluster
richness. We compare our catalog with the maxBCG and GMBCG catalogs, as well as
with that of Wen, Han, and Liu. We match between 30% and 50% of clusters
between catalogs over all overlapping redshift ranges. We find that the
percentage of matches increases with the richness for all catalogs. We cross
match the AMF catalog with available X-ray data in the same area of the sky and
find 539 matches, 119 of which with temperature measurements. We present
scaling relations between optical and X-ray properties and cluster center
comparison. We find that both $\Lambda_{200}$ and $R_{200}$ correlate well with
both $L_X$ and $T_X$, with no significant difference in trend if we restrict
the matches to flux-limited X-ray samples.
