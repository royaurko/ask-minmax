In this paper we investigate the hypergraphs whose spectral radii attain the
maximum among all uniform hypergraphs with given number of edges. In particular
we characterize the hypergraph(s) with maximum spectral radius over all
unicyclic hypergraphs, linear or power unicyclic hypergraphs with given girth,
linear or power bicyclic hypergraphs, respectively.
