We study the Maker-Breaker game on the hypergraph of chains of fixed size in
a poset. In a product of chains, the maximum size of a chain that Maker can
guarantee building is $k-\lfloor r/2\rfloor$, where $k$ is the maximum size of
a chain in the product, and $r$ is the maximum size of a factor chain. We also
study a variant in which Maker must follow the chain in order, called the {\it
Walker-Blocker game}. In the poset consisting of the bottom $k$ levels of the
product of $d$ arbitrarily long chains, Walker can guarantee a chain that hits
all levels if $d\ge14$; this result uses a solution to Conway's Angel-Devil
game. When d=2, the maximum that Walker can guarantee is only 2/3 of the
levels, and 2/3 is asymptotically achievable in the product of two equal
chains.
