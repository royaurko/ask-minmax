We show that the Satisfiability (SAT) problem for CNF formulas with
{\beta}-acyclic hypergraphs can be solved in polynomial time by using a special
type of Davis-Putnam resolution in which each resolvent is a subset of a parent
clause. We extend this class to CNF formulas for which this type of
Davis-Putnam resolution still applies and show that testing membership in this
class is NP-complete. We compare the class of {\beta}-acyclic formulas and this
superclass with a number of known polynomial formula classes. We then study the
parameterized complexity of SAT for "almost" {\beta}-acyclic instances, using
as parameter the formula's distance from being {\beta}-acyclic. As distance we
use the size of a smallest strong backdoor set and the {\beta}-hypertree width.
As a by-product we obtain the W[1]-hardness of SAT parameterized by the
(undirected) clique-width of the incidence graph, which disproves a conjecture
by Fischer, Makowsky, and Ravve.
