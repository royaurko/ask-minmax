We present the whole set of equations with regularity and matching conditions
required for the description of physically meaningful stationary cylindrically
symmmetric distributions of matter, smoothly matched to Lewis vacuum spacetime.
A specific example is given. The electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor
are calculated, and it is shown that purely electric solutions are necessarily
static. Then, it is shown that no conformally flat stationary cylindrical fluid
exits, satisfying regularity and matching conditions.
