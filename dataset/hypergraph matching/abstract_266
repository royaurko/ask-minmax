The object recognition is a complex problem in the image processing.
Mathematical morphology is Shape oriented operations, that simplify image data,
preserving their essential shape characteristics and eliminating irrelevancies.
This paper briefly describes morphological operators using hypergraph and its
applications for thinning algorithms. The morphological operators using
hypergraph method is used to preventing errors and irregularities in skeleton,
and is an important step recognizing line objects. The morphological operators
using hypergraph such as dilation, erosion, opening, closing is a novel
approach in image processing and it act as a filter remove the noise and errors
in the images.
