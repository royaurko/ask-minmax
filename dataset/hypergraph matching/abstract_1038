We study the effects of Lorentz non-invariance on the physical pion velocity
at the critical temperature $T_c$ in an effective theory of hidden local
symmetry (HLS) with the "vector manifestation" fixed point. We match at a
"matching scale" $\Lambda_M$ the axial-vector current correlator in the HLS
with the one in the operator product expansion for QCD, and present the
matching condition to determine the bare pion velocity. We find that the
physical pion velocity, which is found to be one at $T=T_c$ when starting from
the Lorentz invariant bare HLS, remains close to one with the Lorentz
non-invariance, $v_\pi (T_c) = 0.83 - 0.99$. This result is quite similar to
the pion velocity in dense matter.
