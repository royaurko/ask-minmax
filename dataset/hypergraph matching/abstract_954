We discussed the phase-matching condition of the input states for a specific
Mach-Zehnder interferometer to enhance the phase sensitivity. The input states
are a coherent state and a superposition of coherent states. For both cases
with and without photon losses, the phase-matching condition to enhance phase
sensitivity is found to be unchanged no matter the input state has parity or
not.
