We introduce a framework to describe probabilistic models in Bell
experiments, and more generally in contextuality scenarios. Such a scenario is
a hypergraph whose vertices represent elementary events and hyperedges
correspond to measurements. A probabilistic model on such a scenario associates
to each event a probability, in such a way that events in a given measurement
have a total probability equal to one. We discuss the advantages of this
framework, like the unification of the notions of contexuality and nonlocality,
and give a short overview of results obtained elsewhere.
