In this paper we study some algebraic properties of hypergraphs, in particula
their Betti numbers. We define some different types of complete hypergraphs,
which to the best of our knowledge, are not previously considered in the
literature. Also, in a natural way, we define a product on hypergraphs, which
in a sense is dual to the join operation on simplicial complexes. For such
product, we give a general formula for the Betti numbers, which specializes
neatly in case of linear resolutions.
