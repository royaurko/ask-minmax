A \textit{rainbow subgraph} of an edge-colored graph is a subgraph whose
edges have distinct colors. The \textit{color degree} of a vertex $v$ is the
number of different colors on edges incident to $v$. We show that if $n$ is
large enough (namely, $n\geq 4.25k^2$), then each $n$-vertex graph $G$ with
minimum color degree at least $k$ contains a rainbow matching of size at least
$k$.
