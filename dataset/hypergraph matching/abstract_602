We show that matchings avoiding certain partial patterns are counted by the
3-Catalan numbers. We give a characterization of 12312-avoiding matchings in
terms of restrictions on the corresponding oscillating tableaux. We also find a
bijection between Schr\"oder paths without peaks at level one and matchings
avoiding both patterns 12312 and 121323. Such objects are counted by the
super-Catalan numbers or the little Schr\"{o}der numbers. A refinement of the
super-Catalan numbers is obtained by fixing the number of crossings in the
matchings. In the sense of Wilf-equivalence, we find that the patterns 12132,
12123, 12321, 12231, 12213 are equivalent to 12312.
