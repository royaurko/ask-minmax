Word matches are often used in sequence comparison methods, either as a
measure of sequence similarity or in the first search steps of algorithms such
as BLAST or BLAT. The D2 statistic is the number of matches of words of k
letters between two sequences. Recent advances have been made in the
characterisation of this statistic and in the approximation of its
distribution. Here, these results are extended to the case of approximate word
matches.
  We compute the exact value of the variance of the D2 statistic for the case
of a uniform letter distribution, and introduce a method to provide accurate
approximations of the variance in the remaining cases. This enables the
distribution of D2 to be approximated for typical situations arising in
biological research. We apply these results to the identification of
cis-regulatory modules, and show that this method detects such sequences with a
high accuracy.
  The ability to approximate the distribution of D2 for both exact and
approximate word matches will enable the use of this statistic in a more
precise manner for sequence comparison, database searches, and identification
of transcription factor binding sites.
