It is conjectured by Frankl and F\"uredi that the $r$-uniform hypergraph with
$m$ edges formed by taking the first $m$ sets in the colex ordering of
${\mathbb N}^{(r)}$ has the largest Lagrangian of all $r$-uniform hypergraphs
with $m$ edges in \cite{FF}. Motzkin and Straus' theorem confirms this
conjecture when $r=2$. For $r=3$, it is shown by Talbot in \cite{T} that this
conjecture is true when $m$ is in certain ranges. In this paper, we explore the
connection between the clique number and Lagrangians for $r$-uniform
hypergraphs. As an implication of this connection, we prove that the
$r$-uniform hypergraph with $m$ edges formed by taking the first $m$ sets in
the colex ordering of ${\mathbb N}^{(r)}$ has the largest Lagrangian of all
$r$-uniform graphs with $t$ vertices and $m$ edges satisfying ${t-1\choose
r}\leq m \leq {t-1\choose r}+ {t-2\choose
r-1}-[(2r-6)\times2^{r-1}+2^{r-3}+(r-4)(2r-7)-1]({t-2\choose r-2}-1)$ for
$r\geq 4.$
