For most physical processes the tracks observed in the muon stations must be
matched with the corresponding tracks in the inner tracker, the external muon
system providing muon identification and triggering but the tracker points
giving the precise momentum measurement at lower momenta. For high momenta the
momentum resolution is much improved by the interconnection of inner and outer
measurements. The matching of outer and inner measurements is more delicate in
case of muons embedded in jets. A study of the matching procedure was carried
out using samples of (b, anti b) jets at high Pt, requiring (b, anti b) -> mu
decays.
