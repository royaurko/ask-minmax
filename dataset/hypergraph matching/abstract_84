We examine the correspondence between the various notions of quasirandomness
for k-uniform hypergraphs and sigma-algebras related to measurable hypergraphs.
This gives a uniform formulation of most of the notions of quasirandomness for
dense hypergraphs which have been studied, with each notion of quasirandomness
corresponding to a sigma-algebra defined by a collection of subsets of [1,k].
  We associate each notion of quasirandomness I with a collection of
hypergraphs, the I-adapted hypergraphs, so that G is quasirandom exactly when
it contains roughly the correct number of copies of each I-adapted hypergraph.
We then identify, for each I, a particular I-adapted hypergraph M_k[I] with the
property that if G contains roughly the correct number of copies of M_k[I] then
G is quasirandom in the sense of I. This generalizes recent results of
Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"odl, and Schacht; Conlon, H\`an, Person, and Schacht; and
Lenz and Mubayi giving this result for some notions of quasirandomness.
