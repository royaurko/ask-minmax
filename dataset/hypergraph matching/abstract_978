We propose an efficient method for generating high accuracy (~1%) nonlinear
power spectra for grids of dark energy cosmologies. Our prescription for
matching matter growth automatically matches the main features of the cosmic
microwave background anisotropy power spectrum, thus naturally including ``CMB
priors''.
