Graph matching is an important problem in machine learning and pattern
recognition. Herein, we present theoretical and practical results on the
consistency of graph matching for estimating a latent alignment function
between the vertex sets of two graphs, as well as subsequent algorithmic
implications when the latent alignment is partially observed. In the correlated
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph setting, we prove that graph matching provides a
strongly consistent estimate of the latent alignment in the presence of even
modest correlation. We then investigate a tractable, restricted-focus version
of graph matching, which is only concerned with adjacency involving vertices in
a partial observation of the latent alignment; we prove that a logarithmic
number of vertices whose alignment is known is sufficient for this
restricted-focus version of graph matching to yield a strongly consistent
estimate of the latent alignment of the remaining vertices. We show how
Frank-Wolfe methodology for approximate graph matching, when there is a
partially observed latent alignment, inherently incorporates this restricted
focus graph matching. Lastly, we illustrate the relationship between seeded
graph matching and restricted-focus graph matching by means of an illuminating
example from human connectomics.
