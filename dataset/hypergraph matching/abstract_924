We compute three-point functions of single trace operators in planar N=4 SYM.
We consider the limit where one of the operators is much smaller than the other
two. We find a precise match between weak and strong coupling in the
Frolov-Tseytlin classical limit for a very general class of classical
solutions. To achieve this match we clarify the issue of back-reaction and
identify precisely which three-point functions are captured by a classical
computation.
