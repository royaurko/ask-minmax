Recently, we adapted exploration and martingale arguments of Nachmias and
Peres, in turn based on ideas of Martin-L\"of, Karp and Aldous, to prove
asymptotic normality of the number $L_1$ of vertices in the largest component
$C$ of the random $r$-uniform hypergraph throughout the supercritical regime.
In this paper we take these arguments further to prove two new results: strong
tail bounds on the distribution of $L_1$, and joint asymptotic normality of
$L_1$ and the number $M_1$ of edges of $C$.
