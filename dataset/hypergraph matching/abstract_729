The problem of merging databases arises in many government and commercial
applications. Schema matching, a common first step, identifies equivalent
fields between databases. We introduce a schema matching framework that builds
nonparametric Bayesian models for each field and compares them by computing the
probability that a single model could have generated both fields. Our
experiments show that our method is more accurate and faster than the existing
instance-based matching algorithms in part because of the use of nonparametric
Bayesian models.
