In this paper, we present an integrated structural and behavioral model of
Reo connectors and Petri nets, allowing a direct comparison of the two
concurrency models. For this purpose, we introduce a notion of connectors which
consist of a number of interconnected, user-defined primitives with fixed
behavior. While the structure of connectors resembles hypergraphs, their
semantics is given in terms of so-called port automata. We define both models
in a categorical setting where composition operations can be elegantly defined
and integrated. Specifically, we formalize structural gluings of connectors as
pushouts, and joins of port automata as pullbacks. We then define a semantical
functor from the connector to the port automata category which preserves this
composition. We further show how to encode Reo connectors and Petri nets into
this model and indicate applications to dynamic reconfigurations modeled using
double pushout graph transformation.
