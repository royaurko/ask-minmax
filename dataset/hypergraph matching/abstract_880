In this paper we prove a series of matching theorems for two sets of Coxeter
generators of a finitely generated Coxeter group that identify common features
of the two sets of generators. As an application, we describe an algorithm for
finding a set of Coxeter generators of maximum rank for a finitely generated
Coxeter group.
