Let $\sigma$ be a partition of the positive integer $r$. A
$\sigma$-hypergraph $H=H(n,r,q|\sigma)$ is an $r$-uniform hypergraph on $nq$
vertices which are partitioned into $n$ classes $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_n$ each
containing $q$ vertices. An $r$-subset $K$ of vertices is an edge of the
hypergraph if the partition of $r$ formed by the non-zero cardinalities $|K\cap
V_i|, 1\leq i \leq n,$ is $\sigma$.
  In earlier works we have considered colourings of the vertices of $H$ which
are constrained such that any edge has at least $\alpha$ and at most $\beta$
vertices of the same colour, and we have shown that interesting results can be
obtained by varying $\alpha, \beta$ and the parameters of $H$ appropriately. In
this paper we continue to investigate the versatility of $\sigma$-hypergraphs
by considering two classical problems: independence and matchings.
  We first demonstrate an interesting link between the constrained colourings
described above and the $k$-independence number of a hypergraph, that is, the
largest cardinality of a subset of vertices of a hypergraph not containing
$k+1$ vertices in the same edge. We also give an exact computation of the
$k$-independence number of the $\sigma$-hypergraph $H$. We then present results
on maximum, and sometimes perfect, matchings in $H$. These results often depend
on divisibility relations between the parameters of $H$ and on the highest
common factor of the parts of $\sigma$.
