We present the whole set of equations with regularity and matching conditions
required for the description of physically meaningful static cylindrically
symmmetric distributions of matter, smoothly matched to Levi-Civita vacuum
spacetime. It is shown that the conformally flat solution with equal principal
stresses represents an incompressible fluid. It is also proved that any
conformally flat cylindrically symmetric static source cannot be matched
through Darmois conditions to the Levi-Civita spacetime. Further evidence is
given that when the Newtonian mass per unit length reaches 1/2 the spacetime
has plane symmetry.
