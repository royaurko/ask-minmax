An oriented hypergraph is a hypergraph where each vertex-edge incidence is
given a label of $+1$ or $-1$. The adjacency and Laplacian eigenvalues of an
oriented hypergraph are studied. Eigenvalue bounds for both the adjacency and
Laplacian matrices of an oriented hypergraph which depend on structural
parameters of the oriented hypergraph are found. An oriented hypergraph and its
incidence dual are shown to have the same nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues. A
family of oriented hypergraphs with uniformally labeled incidences is also
studied. This family provides a hypergraphic generalization of the signless
Laplacian of a graph and also suggests a natural way to define the adjacency
and Laplacian matrices of a hypergraph. Some results presented generalize both
graph and signed graph results to a hypergraphic setting.
