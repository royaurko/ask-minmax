A total dominating set in a graph is a set of vertices such that every vertex
of the graph has a neighbor in the set. We introduce and study graphs that
admit non-negative real weights associated to their vertices such that a set of
vertices is a total dominating set if and only if the sum of the corresponding
weights exceeds a certain threshold. We show that these graphs, which we call
total domishold graphs, form a non-hereditary class of graphs properly
containing the classes of threshold graphs and the complements of domishold
graphs, and are closely related to threshold Boolean functions and threshold
hypergraphs. We present a polynomial time recognition algorithm of total
domishold graphs, and characterize graphs in which the above property holds in
a hereditary sense. Our characterization is obtained by studying a new family
of hypergraphs, defined similarly as the Sperner hypergraphs, which may be of
independent interest.
