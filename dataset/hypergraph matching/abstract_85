A $k$-uniform hypergraph $G=(V,E)$ is called odd-bipartite ([5]), if $k$ is
even and there exists some proper subset $V_1$ of $V$ such that each edge of
$G$ contains odd number of vertices in $V_1$. Odd-bipartite hypergraphs are
generalizations of the ordinary bipartite graphs. We study the spectral
properties of the connected odd-bipartite hypergraphs. We prove that the
Laplacian H-spectrum and signless Laplacian H-spectrum of a connected
$k$-uniform hypergraph $G$ are equal if and only if $k$ is even and $G$ is
odd-bipartite. We further give several spectral characterizations of the
connected odd-bipartite hypergraphs. We also give a characterization for a
connected $k$-uniform hypergraph whose Laplacian spectral radius and signless
Laplacian spectral radius are equal, thus provide an answer to a question
raised in [9]. By showing that the Cartesian product $G\Box H$ of two
odd-bipartite $k$-uniform hypergraphs is still odd-bipartite, we determine that
the Laplacian spectral radius of $G\Box H$ is the sum of the Laplacian spectral
radii of $G$ and $H$, when $G$ and $H$ are both connected odd-bipartite.
