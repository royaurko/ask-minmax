Consider the complete convex geometric graph on $2m$ vertices, $CGG(2m)$,
i.e., the set of all boundary edges and diagonals of a planar convex $2m$-gon
$P$. In [C. Keller and M. Perles, On the Smallest Sets Blocking Simple Perfect
Matchings in a Convex Geometric Graph], the smallest sets of edges that meet
all the simple perfect matchings (SPMs) in $CGG(2m)$ (called "blockers") are
characterized, and it is shown that all these sets are caterpillar graphs with
a special structure, and that their total number is $m \cdot 2^{m-1}$. In this
paper we characterize the co-blockers for SPMs in $CGG(2m)$, that is, the
smallest sets of edges that meet all the blockers. We show that the co-blockers
are exactly those perfect matchings $M$ in $CGG(2m)$ where all edges are of odd
order, and two edges of $M$ that emanate from two adjacent vertices of $P$
never cross. In particular, while the number of SPMs and the number of blockers
grow exponentially with $m$, the number of co-blockers grows
super-exponentially.
