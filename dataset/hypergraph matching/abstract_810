We consider the impact of varying alpha_s choices (and scales) on each side
of the so-called "matching scale" in MLM-matched matrix-element + parton-shower
predictions of collider observables. We explain how inconsistent prescriptions
can lead to counter-intuitive results and present a few explicit examples,
focusing mostly on W/Z + jets processes. We give a specific prescription for
how to improve the consistency of the matching and also address how to perform
consistent tune variations (e.g., of the renormalization scale) around a
central choice. Comparisons to several collider processes are included to
illustrate the properties of the resulting improved matching, relying on
Alpgen+Pythia6, with the latter using the so-called Perugia 2011 tunes,
developed as part of this effort.
