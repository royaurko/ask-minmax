Hypergraph states are multi-qubit states that form a subset of the locally
maximally entangleable states and a generalization of the well--established
notion of graph states. Mathematically, they can conveniently be described by a
hypergraph that indicates a possible generation procedure of these states;
alternatively, they can also be phrased in terms of a non-local stabilizer
formalism. In this paper, we explore the entanglement properties and
nonclassical features of hypergraph states. First, we identify the equivalence
classes under local unitary transformations for up to four qubits, as well as
important classes of five- and six-qubit states, and determine various
entanglement properties of these classes. Second, we present general conditions
under which the local unitary equivalence of hypergraph states can simply be
decided by considering a finite set of transformations with a clear
graph-theoretical interpretation. Finally, we consider the question whether
hypergraph states and their correlations can be used to reveal contradictions
with classical hidden variable theories. We demonstrate that various
noncontextuality inequalities and Bell inequalities can be derived for
hypergraph states.
