String matching is an important part in today's computer applications and
Aho-Corasick algorithm is one of the main string matching algorithms used to
accomplish this. This paper discusses that when can the GPUs be used for string
matching applications using the Aho-Corasick algorithm as a benchmark. We have
to identify the best unit to run our string matching algorithm according to the
performance of our devices and the applications. Sometimes CPU gives better
performance than GPU and sometimes GPU gives better performance than CPU.
Therefore, identifying this critical point is significant task for researchers
who are using GPUs to improve the performance of their string matching
applications based on string matching algorithms.
