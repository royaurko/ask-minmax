Because all microstrip antennas have to be matched to the standard generator
impedance or load, the input impedance matching method for antenna is
particularly important. In this paper a new methodology in achieving matching
impedance of a planar microstrip antenna for wireless application is described.
The method is based on embedding an Interdigital capacitor. The fine results
obtained by using a microstrip Interdigital capacitor for matching antenna
impedance led to an efficient method to improve array antenna performance. In
fact, a substantial saving on the whole surfaces as well as enhancement of the
gain, the directivity and the power radiated was achieved.
