We define a lazy pattern-matching mechanism modulo associativity and
commutativity. The solutions of a pattern-matching problem are stored in a lazy
list composed of a first substitution at the head and a non-evaluated object
that encodes the remaining computations. We integrate the lazy AC-matching in a
strategy language: rewriting rule and strategy application produce a lazy list
of terms.
