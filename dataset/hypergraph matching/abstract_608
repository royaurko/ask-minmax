Suppose that each member of a set of agents has a preference list of a subset
of houses, possibly involving ties and each agent and house has their capacity
denoting the maximum number of correspondingly agents/houses that can be
matched to him/her/it. We want to find a matching $M$, for which there is no
other matching $M'$ such that more agents prefer $M'$ to $M$ than $M$ to $M'$.
(What it means that an agent prefers one matching to the other is explained in
the paper.) Popular matchings have been studied quite extensively, especially
in the one-to-one setting. We provide a characterization of popular b-matchings
for two defintions of popularity, show some $NP$-hardness results and for
certain versions describe polynomial algorithms.
