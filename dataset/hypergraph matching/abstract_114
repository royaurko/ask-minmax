In this paper, we study the homology of the cyclic coloring complex of three
different types of $k$-uniform hypergraphs. For the case of a complete
$k$-uniform hypergraph, we show that the dimension of the $(n-k-1)^{st}$
homology group is given by a binomial coefficient. Further, we discuss a
complex whose $r$-faces consist of all ordered set partitions $[B_1, ...,
B_{r+2}]$ where none of the $B_i$ contain a hyperedge of the complete
$k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ and where $1 \in B_1$. It is shown that the
dimensions of the homology groups of this complex are given by binomial
coefficients. As a consequence, this result gives the dimensions of the
multilinear parts of the cyclic homology groups of $\C[x_1,...,x_n]/
\{x_{i_1}...x_{i_k} \mid i_{1}...i_{k}$ is a hyperedge of $H \}$. For the other
two types of hypergraphs, star hypergraphs and diagonal hypergraphs, we show
that the dimensions of the homology groups of their cyclic coloring complexes
are given by binomial coefficients as well.
