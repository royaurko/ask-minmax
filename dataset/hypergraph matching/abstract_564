We consider proper online colorings of hypergraphs defined by geometric
regions. We prove that there is an online coloring algorithm that colors $N$
intervals of the real line using $\Theta(\log N/k)$ colors such that for every
point $p$, contained in at least $k$ intervals, not all the intervals
containing $p$ have the same color. We also prove the corresponding result
about online coloring a family of wedges (quadrants) in the plane that are the
translates of a given fixed wedge. These results contrast the results of the
first and third contributor showing that in the quasi-online setting 12 colors are
enough to color wedges (independent of $N$ and $k$). We also consider
quasi-online coloring of intervals. In all cases we present efficient coloring
algorithms.
