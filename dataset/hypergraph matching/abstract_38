Let $C^{2k}_r$ be the $2k$-uniform hypergraph obtained by letting
$P_1,...,P_r$ be pairwise disjoint sets of size $k$ and taking as edges all
sets $P_i \cup P_j$ with $i \neq j$. This can be thought of as the
`$k$-expansion' of the complete graph $K_r$: each vertex has been replaced with
a set of size $k$. We determine the exact Turan number of $C^{2k}_3$ and the
corresponding extremal hypergraph, thus confirming a conjecture of Frankl.
Sidorenko has given an upper bound of $(r-2) / (r-1)$ for the Tur\'an density
of $C^{2k}_r$ for any $r$, and a construction establishing a matching lower
bound when $r$ is of the form $2^p + 1$. We show that when $r = 2^p + 1$, any
$C^4_r$-free hypergraph of density $(r-2)/(r-1) - o(1)$ looks approximately
like Sidorenko's construction. On the other hand, when $r$ is not of this form,
we show that corresponding constructions do not exist and improve the upper
bound on the Tur\'an density of $C^4_r$ to $(r-2)/(r-1) - c(r)$, where $c(r)$
is a constant depending only on $r$.
  The backbone of our arguments is a strategy of first proving approximate
structure theorems, and then showing that any imperfections in the structure
must lead to a suboptimal configuration. The tools for its realisation draw on
extremal graph theory, linear algebra, the Kruskal-Katona theorem and
properties of Krawtchouck polynomials.
