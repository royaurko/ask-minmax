We study ensembles of codes on graphs (generalized low-density parity-check,
or LDPC codes) constructed from random graphs and fixed local constrained
codes, and their extension to codes on hypergraphs. It is known that the
average minimum distance of codes in these ensembles grows linearly with the
code length. We show that these codes can correct a linearly growing number of
errors under simple iterative decoding algorithms. In particular, we show that
this property extends to codes constructed by parallel concatenation of Hamming
codes and other codes with small minimum distance. Previously known results
that proved this property for graph codes relied on graph expansion and
required the choice of local codes with large distance relative to their
length.
