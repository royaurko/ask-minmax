This paper shows the existence of independent random matching of a large
(continuum) population in both static and dynamic systems, which has been
popular in the economics and genetics literatures. We construct a joint
agent-probability space, and randomized mutation, partial matching and
match-induced type-changing functions that satisfy appropriate independence
conditions. The proofs are achieved via nonstandard analysis. The proof for the
dynamic setting relies on a new Fubini-type theorem for an infinite product of
Loeb transition probabilities, based on which a continuum of independent Markov
chains is derived from random mutation, random partial matching and random type
changing.
