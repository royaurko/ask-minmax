Aharoni and Berger conjectured that every bipartite graph which is the union
of n matchings of size n + 1 contains a rainbow matching of size n. This
conjecture is a generalization of several old conjectures of Ryser, Brualdi,
and Stein about transversals in Latin squares. There have been many recent
partial results about the Aharoni-Berger Conjecture. In the case when the
matchings are much larger than n + 1, the best bound is currently due to
Clemens and Ehrenm\"uller who proved the conjecture when the matchings are of
size at least 3n/2 + o(n). When the matchings are all edge-disjoint and
perfect, then the best result follows from a theorem of H\"aggkvist and
Johansson which implies the conjecture when the matchings have size at least n
+ o(n).
  In this paper we show that the conjecture is true when the matchings have
size n + o(n) and are all edge-disjoint (but not necessarily perfect). We also
give an alternative argument to prove the conjecture when the matchings have
size at least $\phi n + o(n)$ where $\phi\approx 1.618$ is the Golden Ratio.
  Our proofs involve studying connectedness in coloured, directed graphs. The
notion of connectedness that we introduce is new, and perhaps of independent
interest.
