Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a uniform hypergraph. Let $\mathcal{A(H)}$ and
$\mathcal{Q(H)}$ be the adjacency tensor and the signless Laplacian tensor of
$\mathcal{H}$, respectively. In this note we prove several bounds for the
spectral radius of $\mathcal{A(H)}$ and $\mathcal{Q(H)}$ in terms of the
degrees of vertices of $\mathcal{H}.$
