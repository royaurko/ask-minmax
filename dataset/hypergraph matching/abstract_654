Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in general position in the plane. Given a
convex geometric shape $S$, a geometric graph $G_S(P)$ on $P$ is defined to
have an edge between two points if and only if there exists an empty homothet
of $S$ having the two points on its boundary. A matching in $G_S(P)$ is said to
be $strong$, if the homothests of $S$ representing the edges of the matching,
are pairwise disjoint, i.e., do not share any point in the plane. We consider
the problem of computing a strong matching in $G_S(P)$, where $S$ is a
diametral-disk, an equilateral-triangle, or a square. We present an algorithm
which computes a strong matching in $G_S(P)$; if $S$ is a diametral-disk, then
it computes a strong matching of size at least $\lceil \frac{n-1}{17} \rceil$,
and if $S$ is an equilateral-triangle, then it computes a strong matching of
size at least $\lceil \frac{n-1}{9} \rceil$. If $S$ can be a downward or an
upward equilateral-triangle, we compute a strong matching of size at least
$\lceil \frac{n-1}{4} \rceil$ in $G_S(P)$. When $S$ is an axis-aligned square
we compute a strong matching of size $\lceil \frac{n-1}{4} \rceil$ in $G_S(P)$,
which improves the previous lower bound of $\lceil \frac{n}{5} \rceil$.
