Recent research on percolation has led to the construction of an infinite
class of lattices for which the percolation thresholds can be determined
exactly. We discuss the mathematical basis for the solutions of bond
percolation models, and, in particular, attempt to address some misconceptions
that might arise from the seminal articles by Ziff and Scullard. As one
consequence, we show that there exist infinitely many real numbers $a \in
[0,1]$ for which there are infinitely many lattices that have bond percolation
threshold equal to $a$.
