We construct a theoretical framework to match the formulas for forward
inclusive hadron productions in pA collisions in the small-x saturation
formalism and collinear factorization. The small-x calculation can be viewed as
a power series in $Q_s^2/k_\perp^2$, in which the collinear factorization
result corresponds to the leading term. At high transverse momentum, the
subleading correction terms are insignficant, whereas at low $p_\perp$, the
power corrections become important and the small-x resummation is essential to
describe the differential cross section. We show that the familiar collinear
factorization calculation can smoothly match the results from small-x
factorization at next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$ when we use exact
kinematics, as opposed to the approximate kinematics in previous work. With
this matching, we can describe the experimental data from RHIC very well at
high $p_\perp$.
