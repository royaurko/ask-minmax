We propose a new algorithm called DK-vec for aligning pairs of
Asian/Indo-European noisy parallel texts without sentence boundaries. DK-vec
improves on previous alignment algorithms in that it handles better the
non-linear nature of noisy corpora. The algorithm uses frequency, position and
recency information as features for pattern matching. Dynamic Time Warping is
used as the matching technique between word pairs. This algorithm produces a
small bilingual lexicon which provides anchor points for alignment.
