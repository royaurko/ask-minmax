The aim of this paper is to characterize simplicial complexes which have
standard graded vertex cover algebras. This property has several nice
consequences for the squarefree monomial ideals defining these algebras. It
turns out that such simplicial complexes are closely related to a range of
hypergraphs which generalize bipartite graphs and trees. These relationships
allow us to obtain very general results on standard graded vertex cover
algebras which cover previous major results on Rees algebras of squarefree
monomial ideals.
