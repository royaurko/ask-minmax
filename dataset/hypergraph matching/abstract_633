We overview current problems of audio retrieval and time-series subsequence
matching. We discuss the usage of subsequence matching approaches in audio data
processing, especially in automatic speech recognition (ASR) area and we aim at
improving performance of the retrieval process. To overcome the problems known
from the time-series area like the occurrence of implementation bias and data
bias we present a Subsequence Matching Framework as a tool for fast
prototyping, building, and testing similarity search subsequence matching
applications. The framework is build on top of MESSIF (Metric Similarity Search
Implementation Framework) and thus the subsequence matching algorithms can
exploit advanced similarity indexes in order to significantly increase their
query processing performance. To prove our concept we provide a design of
query-by-example spoken term detection type of application with the usage of
phonetic posteriograms and subsequence matching approach.
