We discuss the tropical analogues of several basic questions of convex
duality. In particular, the polar of a tropical polyhedral cone represents the
set of linear inequalities that its elements satisfy. We characterize the
extreme rays of the polar in terms of certain minimal set covers which may be
thought of as weighted generalizations of minimal transversals in hypergraphs.
We also give a tropical analogue of Farkas lemma, which allows one to check
whether a linear inequality is implied by a finite family of linear
inequalities. Here, the certificate is a strategy of a mean payoff game. We
discuss examples, showing that the number of extreme rays of the polar of the
tropical cyclic polyhedral cone is polynomially bounded, and that there is no
unique minimal system of inequalities defining a given tropical polyhedral
cone.
