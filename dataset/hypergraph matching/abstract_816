Say that an edge of a graph $G$ dominates itself and every other edge
adjacent to it. An edge dominating set of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset of
edges $E' \subseteq E$ which dominates all edges of $G$. In particular, if
every edge of $G$ is dominated by exactly one edge of $E'$ then $E'$ is a
dominating induced matching. It is known that not every graph admits a
dominating induced matching, while the problem to decide if it does admit it is
NP-complete. In this paper we consider the problems of finding a minimum
weighted dominating induced matching, if any, and counting the number of
dominating induced matchings of a graph with weighted edges. We describe an
exact algorithm for general graphs that runs in $O^*(1.1939^n)$ time and
polynomial (linear) space. This improves over any existing exact algorithm for
the problems in consideration.
