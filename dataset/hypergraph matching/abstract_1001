Automatic assessment needs short answer based evaluation and automated
assessment. Various techniques used are Ontology, Semantic similarity matching
and Statistical methods. An automatic short answer assessment system is
attempted in this paper. Through experiments performed on a data set, we show
that the semantic ASAGS outperforms methods based on simple lexical matching;
resulting is up to 59 percent with respect to the traditional vector-based
similarity metric.
