A recent preprint by Yan & Windhorst (astro-ph/0407493) independently repeats
our selection of candidate z~6 galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field
(astro-ph/0403223). The agreement of this independent study with our original
work is excellent, and most of the i-band drop-out galaxies are reproduced. To
avoid confusion with various ID numbers for sources, we present the community
with a matched list of i-band drop-outs in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.
