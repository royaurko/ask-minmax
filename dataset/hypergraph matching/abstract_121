We study properties of random subcomplexes of partitions returned by (a
suitable form of) the Strong Hypergraph Regularity Lemma, which we call regular
slices. We argue that these subcomplexes capture many important structural
properties of the original hypergraph. Accordingly we advocate their use in
extremal hypergraph theory, and explain how they can lead to considerable
simplifications in existing proofs in this field. We also use them for
establishing the following two new results.
  Firstly, we prove a hypergraph extension of the Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorem: for
every $\delta>0$ every sufficiently large $k$-uniform hypergraph with at least
$(\alpha+\delta)\binom{n}{k}$ edges contains a tight cycle of length $\alpha n$
for each $\alpha\in[0,1]$.
  Secondly, we find (asymptotically) the minimum codegree requirement for a
$k$-uniform $k$-partite hypergraph, each of whose parts has $n$ vertices, to
contain a tight cycle of length $\alpha kn$, for each $0<\alpha<1$.
