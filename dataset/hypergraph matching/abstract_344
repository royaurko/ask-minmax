Discovery of (strong) association rules, or implications, is an important
task in data management, and it finds application in artificial intelligence,
data mining and the semantic web. We introduce a novel approach for the
discovery of a specific set of implications, called the D-basis, that provides
a representation for a reduced binary table, based on the structure of its
Galois lattice. At the core of the method is the D-relation defined in the
lattice theory framework, and the hypergraph dualization algorithm that allows
us to effectively produce the set of transversals for a given Sperner
hypergraph. The latter algorithm, first developed by specialits from Rutgers
Center for Operations Research, has already found numerous applications in
solving the optimization problems in data base theory, artificial intelligence
and game theory. One application of the method is in analysis of gene
expression data related to a particular phenotypic variable, and some initial
testing is done for the data provided by the University of Hawaii Cancer
Center.
