Bollob\'{a}s and Thomason (1985) proved that for each $k=k(n) \in [1, n-1]$,
with high probability, the random graph process, where edges are added to
vertex set $V=[n]$ uniformly at random one after another, is such that the
stopping time of having minimal degree $k$ is equal to the stopping time of
becoming $k$-(vertex-)connected. We extend this result to the $d$-uniform
random hypergraph process, where $k$ and $d$ are fixed. Consequently, for
$m=\frac{n}{d}(\ln n +(k-1)\ln \ln n +c)$ and $p=(d-1)! \frac{\ln n + (k-1) \ln
\ln n +c}{n^{d-1}}$, the probability that the random hypergraph models $H_d(n,
m)$ and $H_d(n, p)$ are $k$-connected tends to $e^{-e^{-c}/(k-1)!}.$
