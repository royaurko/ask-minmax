Let $c:E(G)\to [k]$ be an edge-coloring of a graph $G$, not necessarily
proper. For each vertex $v$, let $\bar{c}(v)=(a_1,\ldots,a_k)$, where $a_i$ is
the number of edges incident to $v$ with color $i$. Reorder $\bar{c}(v)$ for
every $v$ in $G$ in nonincreasing order to obtain $c^*(v)$, the color-blind
partition of $v$. When $c^*$ induces a proper vertex coloring, that is,
$c^*(u)\neq c^*(v)$ for every edge $uv$ in $G$, we say that $c$ is color-blind
distinguishing. The minimum $k$ for which there exists a color-blind
distinguishing edge coloring $c:E(G)\to [k]$ is the color-blind index of $G$,
denoted $\operatorname{dal}(G)$. We demonstrate that determining the
color-blind index is more subtle than previously thought. In particular,
determining if $\operatorname{dal}(G) \leq 2$ is NP-complete. We also connect
the color-blind index of a regular bipartite graph to 2-colorable regular
hypergraphs and characterize when $\operatorname{dal}(G)$ is finite for a class
of 3-regular graphs.
