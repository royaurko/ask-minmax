We present the first data structures that maintain near optimal maximum
cardinality and maximum weighted matchings on sparse graphs in sublinear time
per update. Our main result is a data structure that maintains a $(1+\epsilon)$
approximation of maximum matching under edge insertions/deletions in worst case
$O(\sqrt{m}\epsilon^{-2})$ time per update. This improves the 3/2 approximation
given in [Neiman,Solomon,STOC 2013] which runs in similar time. The result is
based on two ideas. The first is to re-run a static algorithm after a chosen
number of updates to ensure approximation guarantees. The second is to
judiciously trim the graph to a smaller equivalent one whenever possible.
  We also study extensions of our approach to the weighted setting, and combine
it with known frameworks to obtain arbitrary approximation ratios. For a
constant $\epsilon$ and for graphs with edge weights between 1 and N, we design
an algorithm that maintains an $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate maximum weighted
matching in $O(\sqrt{m} \log N)$ time per update. The only previous result for
maintaining weighted matchings on dynamic graphs has an approximation ratio of
4.9108, and was shown in [Anand,Baswana,Gupta,Sen, FSTTCS 2012, arXiv 2012].
