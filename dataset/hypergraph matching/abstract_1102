We present the hard matching coefficients for squark and gluino
hadroproduction. The hard matching coefficients follow from the next-to-leading
order cross section near threshold and are an important ingredient for
performing threshold resummation at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic
accuracy. We discuss the calculation, list the analytical results and study the
numerical impact of these corrections. We find that the impact of the hard
matching coefficients can be considerable, with the largest effect observed for
final states involving gluinos.
