Given an edge colouring of a graph with a set of m colours, we say that the
graph is exactly m-coloured if each of the colours is used. In 1996, Stacey and
Weidl, partially resolving a conjecture of Erickson from 1994, showed that for
a fixed natural number m>2 and for all sufficiently large k, there is a
k-colouring of complete graph on N such that no complete infinite subgraph is
exactly m-coloured. In the light of this result, we consider the question of
how close we can come to finding an exactly m-coloured complete infinite
subgraph. We show that for a natural number m and any finite colouring of the
edges of the complete graph on N with m or more colours, there is an exactly
m'-coloured complete infinite subgraph for some m' satisfying |m-m'| <=
(m/2)^(1/2) + 1/2; this is best possible up to an additive constant. We also
obtain analogous results for this problem in the setting of r-uniform
hypergraphs. Along the way, we also prove a recent conjecture of the second
contributor and investigate generalisations of this conjecture to r-uniform
hypergraphs.
