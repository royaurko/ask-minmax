We give a constructive method that can decrease the number of prototiles
needed to tile a space. We achieve this by exchanging edge to edge matching
rules for a small atlas of permitted patches. This method is illustrated with
Wang tiles, and we apply our method to present via these rules a single
prototile that can only tile $R^3$ aperiodically, and a pair of square tiles
that can only tile $R^2$ aperiodically.
