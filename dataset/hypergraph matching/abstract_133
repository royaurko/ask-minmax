Chv\'atal, R\"odl, Szemer\'edi and Trotter proved that the Ramsey numbers of
graphs of bounded maximum degree are linear in their order. We prove that the
same holds for 3-uniform hypergraphs. The main new tool which we prove and use
is an embedding lemma for 3-uniform hypergraphs of bounded maximum degree into
suitable 3-uniform `pseudo-random' hypergraphs.
