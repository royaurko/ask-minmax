A $k$-uniform hypergraph is $s$-almost intersecting if every edge is disjoint
from exactly $s$ other edges. Gerbner, Lemons, Palmer, Patk\'os and Sz\'ecsi
conjectured that for every $k$, and $s>s_0(k)$, every $k$-uniform $s$-almost
intersecting hypergraph has at most $(s+1)\binom{2k-2}{k-1}$ edges. We prove a
strengthened version of this conjecture and determine the extremal graphs. We
also give some related results and conjectures.
