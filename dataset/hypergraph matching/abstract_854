We report the experimental observation of the recently predicted peaks on the
I-V curve of the superconducting single-electron transistor at relatively high
temperatures. The peaks are due to the matching of singularities in the
quasiparticle density of states in two electrodes of a tunnel junction. The
energy shift due to Coulomb blockade provides the matching at finite voltage.
