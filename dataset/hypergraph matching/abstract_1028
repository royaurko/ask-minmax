This paper presents an original methodology to consider question answering.
We noticed that query expansion is often incorrect because of a bad
understanding of the question. But the automatic good understanding of an
utterance is linked to the context length, and the question are often short.
This methodology proposes to analyse the documents and to construct an
informative structure from the results of the analysis and from a semantic text
expansion. The linguistic analysis identifies words (tokenization and
morphological analysis), links between words (syntactic analysis) and word
sense (semantic disambiguation). The text expansion adds to each word the
synonyms matching its sense and replaces the words in the utterances by
derivatives, modifying the syntactic schema if necessary. In this way, whatever
enrichment may be, the text keeps the same meaning, but each piece of
information matches many realisations. The questioning method consists in
constructing a local informative structure without enrichment, and matches it
with the documentary structure. If a sentence in the informative structure
matches the question structure, this sentence is the answer to the question.
