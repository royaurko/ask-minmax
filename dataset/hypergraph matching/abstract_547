We define the notion of affine rigidity of a hypergraph and prove a variety
of fundamental results for this notion. First, we show that affine rigidity can
be determined by the rank of a specific matrix which implies that affine
rigidity is a generic property of the hypergraph.Then we prove that if a graph
is is $(d+1)$-vertex-connected, then it must be "generically neighborhood
affinely rigid" in $d$-dimensional space. This implies that if a graph is
$(d+1)$-vertex-connected then any generic framework of its squared graph must
be universally rigid.
  Our results, and affine rigidity more generally, have natural applications in
point registration and localization, as well as connections to manifold
learning.
