This paper proposes an algorithm for alignment-free sequence comparison using
Logical Match. Here, we compute the score using fuzzy membership values which
generate automatically from the number of matches and mismatches. We
demonstrate the method with both the artificial and real datum. The results
show the uniqueness of the proposed method by analyzing DNA sequences taken
from NCBI databank with a novel computational time.
