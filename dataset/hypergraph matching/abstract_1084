We demonstrate the results of an attempt to match the two-soliton analytical
solution with the numerically produced solutions of the Einstein field
equations, that describe the spacetime exterior of rotating neutron stars, for
arbitrary rotation. The matching procedure is performed by equating the first
four multipole moments of the analytical solution to the multipole moments of
the numerical one. We then argue that in order to check the effectiveness of
the matching of the analytical with the numerical solution we should compare
the metric components, the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit
($R_{ISCO}$), the rotation frequency $\Omega\equiv\frac{d\phi}{dt}$ and the
epicyclic frequencies $\Omega_{\rho},\;\Omega_z$. Finally we present some
results of the comparison.
