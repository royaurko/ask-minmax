In this paper we present a complete characterization of the smallest sets
which block all the simple perfect matchings in a complete convex geometric
graph on $2m$ vertices. In particular, we show that all these sets are
caterpillar graphs with a special structure, and that their total number is $m
\cdot 2^{m-1}$.
