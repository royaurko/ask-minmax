We study the problem of bicoloring random hypergraphs, both numerically and
analytically. We apply the zero-temperature cavity method to find analytical
results for the phase transitions (dynamic and static) in the 1RSB
approximation. These points appear to be in agreement with the results of the
numerical algorithm. In the second part, we implement and test the Survey
Propagation algorithm for specific bicoloring instances in the so called
HARD-SAT phase.
