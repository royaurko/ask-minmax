We study distributed algorithms that find a maximal matching in an anonymous,
edge-coloured graph. If the edges are properly coloured with $k$ colours, there
is a trivial greedy algorithm that finds a maximal matching in $k-1$
synchronous communication rounds. The present work shows that the greedy
algorithm is optimal in the general case: any algorithm that finds a maximal
matching in anonymous, $k$-edge-coloured graphs requires $k-1$ rounds.
  If we focus on graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, it is known that a maximal
matching can be found in $O(\Delta + \log^* k)$ rounds, and prior work implies
a lower bound of $\Omega(\polylog(\Delta) + \log^* k)$ rounds. Our work closes
the gap between upper and lower bounds: the complexity is $\Theta(\Delta +
\log^* k)$ rounds. To our knowledge, this is the first linear-in-$\Delta$ lower
bound for the distributed complexity of a classical graph problem.
