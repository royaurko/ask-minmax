For a $k$-uniform hypergraph $G$ with vertex set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, the
ordered Ramsey number $\operatorname{OR}_t(G)$ is the least integer $N$ such
that every $t$-coloring of the edges of the complete $k$-uniform graph on
vertex set $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ contains a monochromatic copy of $G$ whose vertices
follow the prescribed order. Due to this added order restriction, the ordered
Ramsey numbers can be much larger than the usual graph Ramsey numbers. We
determine that the ordered Ramsey numbers of loose paths under a monotone order
grows as a tower of height one less than the maximum degree. We also extend
theorems of Conlon, Fox, Lee, and Sudakov [Ordered Ramsey numbers,
arXiv:1410.5292] on the ordered Ramsey numbers of 2-uniform matchings to
provide upper bounds on the ordered Ramsey number of $k$-uniform matchings
under certain orderings.
