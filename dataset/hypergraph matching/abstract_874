We give a prescription for attaching parton showers to next-to-leading order
(NLO) partonic jet cross sections in electron-positron annihilation. Our method
effectively extends to NLO the scheme of Catani, Krauss, Kuhn, and Webber for
matching between m hard jets and (m+1) hard jets. The matching between parton
splitting as part of a shower and parton splitting as part of NLO matrix
elements is based on the Catani-Seymour dipole subtraction method that is
commonly used for removing the singularities from the NLO matrix elements.}
