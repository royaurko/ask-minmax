The Ramsey number r_k(s,n) is the minimum N such that every red-blue coloring
of the k-tuples of an N-element set contains either a red set of size s or a
blue set of size n, where a set is called red (blue) if all k-tuples from this
set are red (blue). In this paper we obtain new estimates for several basic
hypergraph Ramsey problems. We give a new upper bound for r_k(s,n) for k \geq 3
and s fixed. In particular, we show that r_3(s,n) \leq 2^{n^{s-2}\log n}, which
improves by a factor of n^{s-2}/ polylog n the exponent of the previous upper
bound of Erdos and Rado from 1952. We also obtain a new lower bound for these
numbers, showing that there are constants c_1,c_2>0 such that r_3(s,n) \geq
2^{c_1 sn \log (n/s)} for all 4 \leq s \leq c_2n. When s is a constant, it
gives the first superexponential lower bound for r_3(s,n), answering an open
question posed by Erdos and Hajnal in 1972. Next, we consider the 3-color
Ramsey number r_3(n,n,n), which is the minimum N such that every 3-coloring of
the triples of an N-element set contains a monochromatic set of size n.
Improving another old result of Erdos and Hajnal, we show that r_3(n,n,n) \geq
2^{n^{c \log n}}. Finally, we make some progress on related hypergraph
Ramsey-type problems.
