As the Internet help us cross cultural border by providing different
information, plagiarism issue is bound to arise. As a result, plagiarism
detection becomes more demanding in overcoming this issue. Different plagiarism
detection tools have been developed based on various detection techniques.
Nowadays, fingerprint matching technique plays an important role in those
detection tools. However, in handling some large content articles, there are
some weaknesses in fingerprint matching technique especially in space and time
consumption issue. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect
plagiarism which integrates the use of fingerprint matching technique with four
key features to assist in the detection process. These proposed features are
capable to choose the main point or key sentence in the articles to be
compared. Those selected sentence will be undergo the fingerprint matching
process in order to detect the similarity between the sentences. Hence, time
and space usage for the comparison process is reduced without affecting the
effectiveness of the plagiarism detection.
