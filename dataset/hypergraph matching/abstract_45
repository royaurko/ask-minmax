An oriented hypergraph is an oriented incidence structure that extends the
concept of a signed graph. We introduce hypergraphic structures and techniques
central to the extension of the circuit classification of signed graphs to
oriented hypergraphs. Oriented hypergraphs are further decomposed into three
families -- balanced, balanceable, and unbalanceable -- and we obtain a
complete classification of the balanced circuits of oriented hypergraphs.
