In this paper,we introduce the monomial ideals I(H) associated to a special
class of non uniform hypergraphs H(X; E; d) namely uniformly increasing
hypergraphs. These ideals are named as inclusion ideals. In this paper, we
discuss some algebraic properties of these inclusion ideals. In particular, we
give an upper bound of the Castlenouvo-Mumford regularity of the special dual
ideal I^[*](H) of the inclusion ideal.
