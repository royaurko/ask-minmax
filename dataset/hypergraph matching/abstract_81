$S \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ is said to be sum-free if $S$ has no solution
to the equation $a+b=c$. The sum-free process on $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ starts with
$S:=\emptyset$, and iteratively inserts elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$, where
each inserted element is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all
elements that could be inserted while maintaining that $S$ is sum-free. We
prove a lower bound (which holds with high probability) on the final size of
$S$, which matches a more general result of Bennett and Bohman, and also
matches the order of a sharp threshold result proved by Balogh, Morris and
Samotij. We also show that the set $S$ produced by the process has a particular
non-pseudorandom property, which is in contrast with several known results
about the random greedy independent set process on hypergraphs.
