A parametrization of hypergraphs based on the geometry of points in
$\mathbf{R}^d$ is developed. Informative prior distributions on hypergraphs are
induced through this parametrization by priors on point configurations via
spatial processes. This prior specification is used to infer conditional
independence models or Markov structure of multivariate distributions.
Specifically, we can recover both the junction tree factorization as well as
the hyper Markov law. This approach offers greater control on the distribution
of graph features than Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, supports inference of
factorizations that cannot be retrieved by a graph alone, and leads to new
Metropolis\slash Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms with both local
and global moves in graph space. We illustrate the utility of this
parametrization and prior specification using simulations.
