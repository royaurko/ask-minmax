The technological transformation and automation of digital content delivery
has revolutionized the media industry. Advertising landscape is gradually
shifting its traditional media forms to the emergent of Internet advertising.
In this paper, the types of internet advertising to be discussed on are
contextual and sponsored search ads. These types of advertising have the
central challenge of finding the best match between a given context and a
suitable advertisement, through a principled method. Furthermore, there are
four main players that exist in the Internet advertising ecosystem: users,
advertisers, ad exchange and publishers. Hence, to find ways to counter the
central challenge, the paper addresses two objectives: how to successfully make
the best contextual ads selections to match to a web page content to ensure
that there is a valuable connection between the web page and the contextual
ads. All methods, discussions, conclusion and future recommendations are
presented as per sections. Hence, in order to prove the working mechanism of
matching contextual ads and web pages, web pages together with the ads matching
system are developed as a prototype.
