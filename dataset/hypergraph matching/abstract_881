Linear stability of multi-vector-soliton bound states in the coupled
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations is analyzed using a new tail-matching method.
Under the condition that individual vector solitons in the bound states are
wave-and-daughter-waves and widely separated, small eigenvalues of these bound
states that bifurcate from the zero eigenvalue of single vector solitons are
calculated explicitly. It is found that unstable eigenvalues from phase-mode
bifurcations always exist, thus the bound states are always linearly unstable.
This tail-matching method is simple, but it gives identical results as the
Karpman-Solev'ev-Gorshkov-Ostrovsky method.
