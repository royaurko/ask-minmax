Let $H$ be an edge colored hypergraph. We say that $H$ contains a
\emph{rainbow} copy of a hypergraph $S$ if it contains an isomorphic copy of
$S$ with all edges of distinct colors.
  We consider the following setting. A randomly edge colored random hypergraph
$H\sim \mathcal H_c^k(n,p)$ is obtained by adding each $k$-subset of $[n]$ with
probability $p$, and assigning it a color from $[c]$ uniformly, independently
at random.
  As a first result we show that a typical $H\sim \mathcal H^2_c(n,p)$ (that
is, a random edge colored graph) contains a rainbow Hamilton cycle, provided
that $c=(1+o(1))n$ and $p=\frac{\log n+\log\log n+\omega(1)}{n}$. This is
asymptotically best possible with respect to both parameters, and improves a
result of Frieze and Loh.
  Secondly, based on an ingenious coupling idea of McDiarmid, we provide a
general tool for tackling problems related to finding "nicely edge colored"
structures in random graphs/hypergraphs. We illustrate the generality of this
statement by presenting two interesting applications. In one application we
show that a typical $H\sim \mathcal H^k_c(n,p)$ contains a rainbow copy of a
hypergraph $S$, provided that $c=(1+o(1))|E(S)|$ and $p$ is (up to a
multiplicative constant) a threshold function for the property of containment
of a copy of $S$. In the second application we show that a typical $G\sim
\mathcal H_{c}^2(n,p)$ contains $(1-o(1))np/2$ edge disjoint Hamilton cycles,
each of which is rainbow, provided that $c=\omega(n)$ and $p=\omega(\log n/n)$.
