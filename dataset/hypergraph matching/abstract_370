It has been conjectured that for any fixed $r\geq 2$ and sufficiently large
$n$, there is a monochromatic Hamiltonian Berge-cycle in every $(r-1)$-coloring
of the edges of $K_{n}^{r}$, the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$
vertices. In this paper, we give a proof for the case when $r\geq 5$. Together
with the previously known results, this gives a positive answer to this
conjecture.
