We study minimum vertex cover problems on random \alpha-uniform hypergraphs
using two different approaches, a replica method in statistical mechanics of
random systems and a leaf removal algorithm. It is found that there exists a
phase transition at the critical average degree e/(\alpha-1). Below the
critical degree, a replica symmetric ansatz in the statistical-mechanical
method holdsand the algorithm estimates a solution of the problem which
coincide with that by the replica method. In contrast, above the critical
degree, the replica symmetric solution becomes unstable and these methods fail
to estimate the exact solution.These results strongly suggest a close relation
between the replica symmetry and the performance of approximation algorithm.
