Motivated by his work on the classification of countable homogeneous oriented
graphs, Cherlin asked about the typical structure of oriented graphs (i)
without a transitive triangle, or (ii) without an oriented triangle. We give an
answer to these questions (which is not quite the predicted one). Our approach
is based on the recent `hypergraph containers' method, developed independently
by Saxton and Thomason as well as by Balogh, Morris and Samotij. Moreover, our
results generalise to forbidden transitive tournaments and forbidden oriented
cycles of any order, and also apply to digraphs. Along the way we prove several
stability results for extremal digraph problems, which we believe are of
independent interest.
