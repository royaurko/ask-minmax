This study poses the feature correspondence problem as a hypergraph node
labeling problem. Candidate feature matches and their subsets (usually of size
larger than two) are considered to be the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph.
A hypergraph labeling algorithm, which models the subset-wise interaction by an
undirected graphical model, is applied to label the nodes (feature
correspondences) as correct or incorrect. We describe a method to learn the
cost function of this labeling algorithm from labeled examples using a
graphical model training algorithm. The proposed feature matching algorithm is
different from the most of the existing learning point matching methods in
terms of the form of the objective function, the cost function to be learned
and the optimization method applied to minimize it. The results on standard
datasets demonstrate how learning over a hypergraph improves the matching
performance over existing algorithms, notably one that also uses higher order
information without learning.
