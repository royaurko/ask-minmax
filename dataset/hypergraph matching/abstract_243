The family $D(k,m)$ of graphs having an orientation such that for every
vertex $v \in V(G)$ either (outdegree) $\deg^+(v) \le k$ or (indegree)
$\deg^-(v) \le m$ have been investigated recently in several papers because of
the role $D(k,m)$ plays in the efforts to estimate the maximum directed cut in
digraphs and the minimum cover of digraphs by directed cuts. Results concerning
the chromatic number of graphs in the family $D(k,m)$ have been obtained via
the notion of $d$-degeneracy of graphs. In this paper we consider a far
reaching generalization of the family $D(k,m)$, in a complementary form, into
the context of $r$-uniform hypergraphs, using a generalization of Hakimi's
theorem to $r$-uniform hypergraphs and by showing some tight connections with
the well known Ramsey numbers for hypergraphs.
