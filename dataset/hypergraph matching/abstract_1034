We present a scheme for calculating in NRQCD with consistent power counting
in the heavy quark velocity v. As an example, we perform the systematic
matching of an external current onto NRQCD at subleading order in v, a
calculation relevant for the process e^+e^- -> hadrons near threshold.
Consistent velocity power counting in dimensional regularization is achieved by
including two distinct gluon fields, one corresponding to gluon radiation and
one corresponding to an instantaneous potential. In this scheme power counting
is manifest in any gauge, and also holds for non-gauge interactions. The
matching conditions for an external vector current in NRQCD are calculated to
O(g^2 v^2) and the cancellation of infrared divergences in the matching
conditions is shown to require both gluon fields. Some subtleties arising in
the matching conditions at subleading order are addressed.
