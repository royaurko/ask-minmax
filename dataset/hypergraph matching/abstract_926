We consider a natural generalization of the classical pattern matching
problem: given compressed representations of a pattern p[1..M] and a text
t[1..N] of sizes m and n, respectively, does p occur in t? We develop an
optimal linear time solution for the case when both p and t are compressed
using the LZW method. This improves the previously known O((n+m)log(n+m)) time
solution of Gasieniec and Rytter, and essentially closes the line of research
devoted to studying LZW-compressed exact pattern matching.
