Using numerical simulations we study the configurations, dynamics, and
melting properties of vortex lattices interacting with elliptical pinning sites
at integer matching fields with as many as 27 vortices per pin. Our pinning
model is based on a recently produced experimental system [G. Karapetrov et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 167002 (2005)], and the vortex configurations we
obtain match well with experimental vortex images from the same system. We find
that the strong pinning sites capture more than one vortex each, and that the
saturation number of vortices residing in a pin increases with applied field
due to the pressure from the surrounding vortices. At high matching fields, the
vortices in the intestitial regions form a disordered triangular lattice. We
measure the depinning thresholds for both the x and y directions, and find
distinctive dynamical responses along with highly anisotropic thresholds. For
melting of the vortex configurations under zero applied current, we find
multi-step melting transitions in which the interstitial vortices melt at a
much lower temperature than the pinned vortices. We associate this with
signatures in the specific heat.
