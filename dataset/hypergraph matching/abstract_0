We give a new proof of K\"onig's theorem and generalize the Gallai-Edmonds
decomposition to balanced hypergraphs in two different ways. Based on our
decompositions we give two new characterizations of balanced hypergraphs and
show some properties of matchings and vertex cover in balanced hypergraphs.
