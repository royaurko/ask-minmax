We report on the implementation of a coherent dipole shower algorithm along
with an automated implementation for dipole subtraction and for performing
POWHEG- and MC@NLO-type matching to next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations.
Both programs are implemented as add-on modules to the event generator
Herwig++. A preliminary tune of parameters to data acquired at LEP, HERA and
Drell-Yan pair production at the Tevatron has been performed, and we find an
overall very good description which is slightly improved by the NLO matching.
