We study the problem of assigning jobs to applicants. Each applicant has a
weight and provides a preference list ranking a subset of the jobs. A matching
M is popular if there is no other matching M' such that the weight of the
applicants who prefer M' over M exceeds the weight of those who prefer M over
M'. This paper gives efficient algorithms to find a popular matching if one
exists.
