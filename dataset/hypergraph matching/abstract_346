We study percolation on self-dual hypergraphs that contain square hyperedges,
using two different four-vertex generators, each containing bonds with three
distinct probabilities $p$, $r$, and $t$. We find explicit values of these
probabilities that satisfy the self-duality conditions discussed by Bollob\'as
and Riordan. We consider these generators on two different hypergraphs,
providing new examples of lattices where exact percolation critical points are
known. We carry out Monte-Carlo simulations to confirm these values. For the
case of the hypergraph and uniform generator studied by Wierman et al., we also
determine the threshold $p = 0.441374\pm 0.000001$, which falls within the
tight bounds that they derived. We also study a four-vertex generator which
exhibits three distinct criticality solutions ($p$, $r$, $t$). Furthermore, we
consider a generator in which all or none of the vertices can connect, and find
a soluble inhomogeneous percolation system that interpolates between site
percolation on the union-jack lattice and bond percolation on the square
lattice.
