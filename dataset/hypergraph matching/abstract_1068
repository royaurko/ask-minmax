Analog (uncoded) transmission provides a simple and robust scheme for
communicating a Gaussian source over a Gaussian channel under the mean squared
error (MSE) distortion measure. Unfortunately, its performance is usually
inferior to the all-digital, separation-based source-channel coding solution,
which requires exact knowledge of the channel at the encoder. The loss comes
from the fact that except for very special cases, e.g. white source and channel
of matching bandwidth (BW), it is impossible to achieve perfect matching of
source to channel and channel to source by linear means. We show that by
combining prediction and modulo-lattice operations, it is possible to match any
colored Gaussian source to any colored Gaussian noise channel (of possibly
different BW), hence achieve Shannon's optimum attainable performance $R(D)=C$.
Furthermore, when the source and channel BWs are equal (but otherwise their
spectra are arbitrary), this scheme is asymptotically robust in the sense that
for high signal-to-noise ratio a single encoder (independent of the noise
variance) achieves the optimum performance. The derivation is based upon a
recent modulo-lattice modulation scheme for transmitting a Wyner-Ziv source
over a dirty-paper channel.
