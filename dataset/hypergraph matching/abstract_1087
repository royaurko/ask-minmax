Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to 3D model retrieval in
recent decades. Recently, view-based methods have attracted much research
attention due to the high discriminative property of multi-views for 3D object
representation. In this report, we summarize the view-based 3D model methods
and provide the further research trends. This paper focuses on the scheme for
matching between multiple views of 3D models and the application of
bag-of-visual-words method in 3D model retrieval. For matching between multiple
views, the many-to-many matching, probabilistic matching and semisupervised
learning methods are introduced. For bag-of-visual-words application in 3D
model retrieval, we first briefly review the bag-of-visual-words works on
multimedia and computer vision tasks, where the visual dictionary has been
detailed introduced. Then a series of 3D model retrieval methods by using
bag-of-visual-words description are surveyed in this paper. At last, we
summarize the further research content in view-based 3D model retrieval.
