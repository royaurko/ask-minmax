We present a recursive way to partition hypergraphs which creates and
exploits hypergraph geometry and is suitable for many-core parallel
architectures. Such partitionings are then used to bring sparse matrices in a
recursive Bordered Block Diagonal form (for processor-oblivious parallel LU
decomposition) or recursive Separated Block Diagonal form (for cache-oblivious
sparse matrix-vector multiplication). We show that the quality of the obtained
partitionings and orderings is competitive by comparing obtained fill-in for LU
decomposition with SuperLU (with better results for 8 of the 28 test matrices)
and comparing cut sizes for sparse matrix-vector multiplication with Mondriaan
(with better results for 4 of the 12 test matrices). The main advantage of the
new method is its speed: it is on average 21.6 times faster than Mondriaan.
