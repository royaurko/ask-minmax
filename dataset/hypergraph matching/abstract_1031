We study the matching of a general spherically symmetric spacetime with a
Vaidya-Reissner-Nordstrom solution. To that end, we study the properties of
spherically symmetric electromagnetic fields and develop the proper
gravitational and electromagnetic junction conditions. We prove that generic
spacetimes can be matched to a Vaidya-Reissner-Nordstrom solution or one of its
specializations, and that these matchings have clear physical interpretations.
Furthermore, the non-spacelike nature of the matching hypersurface is proved
under very general hypotheses. We obtain the fundamental result that any
spherically symmetric body, be it in evolution or not, has un upper limit for
the total net electric charge that carries.
