A connected and acyclic hypergraph is called a supertree. In this paper we
mainly focus on the spectral radii of uniform supertrees. Li, Shao and Qi
determined the first two $k$-uniform supertrees with large spectral radii among
all the $k$-uniform supertrees on $n$ vertices [H. Li, J. Shao, L. Qi, The
extremal spectral radii of $k$-uniform supertrees, arXiv:1405.7257v1, May
2014]. By applying the operation of moving edges on hypergraphs and using the
weighted incidence matrix method we extend the above order to the fourth
$k$-uniform supertree.
