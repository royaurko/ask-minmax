In the present paper we discuss the clustering procedure in the case where
instead of a single metric we have a family of metrics. In this case we can
obtain a partially ordered graph of clusters which is not necessarily a tree.
We discuss a structure of a hypergraph above this graph. We propose two
definitions of dimension for hyperedges of this hypergraph and show that for
the multidimensional p-adic case both dimensions are reduced to the number of
p-adic parameters.
  We discuss the application of the hypergraph clustering procedure to the
construction of phylogenetic graphs in biology. In this case the dimension of a
hyperedge will describe the number of sources of genetic diversity.
