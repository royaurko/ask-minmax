We propose a new greedy algorithm for the maximum cardinality matching
problem. We give experimental evidence that this algorithm is likely to find a
maximum matching in random graphs with constant expected degree c>0,
independent of the value of c. This is contrary to the behavior of commonly
used greedy matching heuristics which are known to have some range of c where
they probably fail to compute a maximum matching.
