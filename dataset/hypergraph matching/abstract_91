As an application of Szemeredi's regularity lemma, Erdos-Frankl-Rodl (1986)
showed that the number of graphs on vertex set {1,2,...n} with a monotone class
P is $2^{(1+o(1))ex(n,P)n^2/2}$ where $ex(n,P)$ is the maximum number of edges
of an n-vertex graph which has no subgraph in P. Kohayakawa et al. (2003)
extended it from monotone to hereditary and from graphs to 3-uniform
hypergraphs. We extend it to general hypergraphs. This may be a simple example
illustrating how to apply a recent hypergraph regularity lemma by the contributor.
