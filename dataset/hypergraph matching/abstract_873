We evaluate the three-loop matching conditions for the dimension-five
operators that are relevant for the b -> s gamma decay. Our calculation
completes the first out of three steps (matching, mixing and matrix elements)
that are necessary for finding the next-to-next-to-leading QCD corrections to
this process. All such corrections must be calculated in view of the ongoing
accurate measurements of the B -> Xs gamma branching ratio.
