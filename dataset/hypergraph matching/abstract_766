Let alpha(G) denote the maximum size of an independent set of vertices and
mu(G) be the cardinality of a maximum matching in a graph G. A matching
saturating all the vertices is perfect. If alpha(G) + mu(G) equals the number
of vertices of G, then it is called a Konig-Egervary graph. A graph is
unicyclic if it has a unique cycle.
  In 2010, Bartha conjectured that a unique perfect matching, if it exists, can
be found in O(m) time, where m is the number of edges.
  In this paper we validate this conjecture for Konig-Egervary graphs and
unicylic graphs. We propose a variation of Karp-Sipser leaf-removal algorithm
(Karp and Spiser, 1981), which ends with an empty graph if and only if the
original graph is a Konig-Egervary graph with a unique perfect matching
obtained as an output as well.
  We also show that a unicyclic non-bipartite graph G may have at most one
perfect matching, and this is the case where G is a Konig-Egervary graph.
