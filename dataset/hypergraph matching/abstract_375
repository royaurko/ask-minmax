In a previous work a procedure was decribed for dividing the $3 \times
N$-dimensional conformational space of a molecular system into a number of
discrete cells, this partition allowed the building of a combinatorial
structure from data sampled in molecular dynamics trajectories: the graph of
cells or G, encoding the set of cells in conformational space that are visited
by the system in its thermal wandering. The information in G however, is
encoded in a great number of fragments that must be aggregated. We describe
here the algorithmic procedures 1) for aggregating the information from G into
an hypergraph allowing to enumerate the relevant cells from conformational
space, and 2) for puttting the data in a very compact format.
