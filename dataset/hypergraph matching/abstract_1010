We prove an infinite analogue of the main theorem of discrete Morse theory
formulated in terms of discrete Morse matchings. Our theorem holds under the
assumption that the given Morse matching induces finitely many equivalence
classes of infinite directed simple paths. A homological version of the theorem
is also given.
