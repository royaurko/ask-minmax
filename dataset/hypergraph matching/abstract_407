In this paper, we study the high-order phase transition in random $r$-uniform
hypergraphs. For a positive integer $n$ and a real $p\in [0,1]$, let
$H:=H^r(n,p)$ be the random $r$-uniform hypergraph on the vertex set $[n]$,
where each $r$-set is an edge with probability $p$ independently. For $1\leq s
\leq r-1$ and two $s$-sets $S$ and $S'$, we say $S$ is connected to $S'$ if
there is a sequence of alternating $s$-sets and edges $S_0,F_1,S_1,F_2, \ldots,
F_k, S_k$ which satisfies $S_0,S_1,\ldots, S_k$ are $s$-sets, $S_0=S$,
$S_k=S'$, $F_1,F_2,\ldots, F_k$ are edges of $H$, and $S_{i-1}\cup S_i\subset
F_i$ for each $1\leq i\leq k$. This is an equivalence relation over the family
of all $s$-sets ${[n]\choose s}$ and results a partition: ${V\choose s}=\cup_i
C_i$. Each $C_i$ is called an {$s$-th-order} connected component and a
component $C_i$ is a giant $s$-th-order connected component if
$|C_i|=\Theta(n^s)$. We prove that the sharp threshold of the existence of the
$s$-th-order giant connected components in $H^r(n,p)$ is
$\frac{1+o(1)}{\big({r\choose s}-1\big){n\choose r-s}}$.
