We say that a (di)graph $G$ has a perfect $H$-packing if there exists a set
of vertex-disjoint copies of $H$ which cover all the vertices in $G$. The
seminal Hajnal--Szemer\'edi theorem characterises the minimum degree that
ensures a graph $G$ contains a perfect $K_r$-packing. In this paper we prove
the following analogue for directed graphs: Suppose that $T$ is a tournament on
$r$ vertices and $G$ is a digraph of sufficiently large order $n$ where $r$
divides $n$. If $G$ has minimum in- and outdegree at least $ (1-1/r)n$ then $G$
contains a perfect $T$-packing. In the case when $T$ is a cyclic triangle, this
result verifies a recent conjecture of Czygrinow, Kierstead and Molla (for
large digraphs). Furthermore, in the case when $T$ is transitive we conjecture
that it suffices for every vertex in $G$ to have sufficiently large indegree or
outdegree. We prove this conjecture for transitive triangles and asymptotically
for all $r \geq 3$. Our approach makes use of a result of Keevash and Mycroft
concerning almost perfect matchings in hypergraphs as well as the Directed
Graph Removal lemma.
