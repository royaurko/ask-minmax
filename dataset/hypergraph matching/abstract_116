We investigate some properties of multipartite entanglement of hypergraph
states in purely hypergraph theoretical terms. We first introduce an approach
for computing the concurrence between two specific qubits of a hypergraph state
by using the so-called Hamming weights of several special subhypergraphs of the
corresponding hypergraph. Then we quantify and characterize bipartite
entanglement between each qubit pair of several special hypergraph states in
terms of the concurrence obtained by using the above approach. Our main results
include that (i) a graph g has a component with the vertex set {i,j} if and
only if the qubit pair labeled by {i,j} of the graph state |g> is entangled;
and (ii) each qubit pair of a special hypergraph state is entangled like the
generalized W state.
