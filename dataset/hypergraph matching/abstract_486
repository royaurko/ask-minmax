The study of intersecting structures is central to extremal combinatorics. A
family of permutations $\mathcal{F} \subset S_n$ is \emph{$t$-intersecting} if
any two permutations in $\mathcal{F}$ agree on some $t$ indices, and is
\emph{trivial} if all permutations in $\mathcal{F}$ agree on the same $t$
indices. A $k$-uniform hypergraph is \emph{$t$-intersecting} if any two of its
edges have $t$ vertices in common, and \emph{trivial} if all its edges share
the same $t$ vertices.
  The fundamental problem is to determine how large an intersecting family can
be. Ellis, Friedgut and Pilpel proved that for $n$ sufficiently large with
respect to $t$, the largest $t$-intersecting families in $S_n$ are the trivial
ones. The classic Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem shows that the largest
$t$-intersecting $k$-uniform hypergraphs are also trivial when $n$ is large. We
determine the \emph{typical} structure of $t$-intersecting families, extending
these results to show that almost all intersecting families are trivial. We
also obtain sparse analogues of these extremal results, showing that they hold
in random settings.
  Our proofs use the Bollob\'as set-pairs inequality to bound the number of
maximal intersecting families, which can then be combined with known stability
theorems. We also obtain similar results for vector spaces.
