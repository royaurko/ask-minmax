A weighting of the edges of a hypergraph is called vertex-coloring if the
weighted degrees of the vertices yield a proper coloring of the graph, i.e.,
every edge contains at least two vertices with different weighted degrees. In
this paper we show that such a weighting is possible from the weight set
{1,2,...,r+1} for all linear hypergraphs with maximum edge size r>3 and not
containing isolated edges. The number r+1 is best possible for this statement.
  Further, the weight set {1,2,3,4,5} is sufficient for all hypergraphs with
maximum edge size 3, as well as {1,2,...,5r-5} for all hypergraphs with maximum
edge size r>3, up to some trivial exceptions.
