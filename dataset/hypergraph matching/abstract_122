Hypergraph partitioning lies at the heart of a number of problems in machine
learning and network sciences. A number of algorithms exist in the literature
that extend standard approaches for graph partitioning to the case of
hypergraphs. However, theoretical aspects of such methods have seldom received
attention in the literature as compared to the extensive studies on the
guarantees of graph partitioning. For instance, consistency results of spectral
clustering under the planted partition or stochastic blockmodel are well-known
(Rohe et al., 2011;Lei and Rinaldo, 2015). In this paper, we present a planted
partition model for sparse random non-uniform hypergraphs that generalizes the
stochastic blockmodels for graphs and uniform hypergraphs. We derive an
asymptotic error bound of a spectral hypergraph partitioning algorithm under
this model using matrix Bernstein inequality. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first consistency result related to partitioning non-uniform
hypergraphs.
