The match between the Linac beam energy and the energy determined by the
bending field of the Booster magnets is crucial for rf capture, beam quality,
and the transmission efficiency in a Booster cycle. The observation of the
injection energy match is important for injection tuning. Several signals, such
as phase shift drive (PSD), radial position error (RPOS), synchrotron phase
(SPD), and fast phase error (FPERR), provide consistent information on the
energy match and can be used for a injection match tuning.
