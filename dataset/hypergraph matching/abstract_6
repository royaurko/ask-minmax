Ryser's Conjecture states that any $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph has a
vertex cover of size at most $r - 1$ times the size of the largest matching.
For $r = 2$, the conjecture is simply K\"onig's Theorem and every bipartite
graph is a witness for its tightness. The conjecture has also been proven for
$r = 3$ by Aharoni using topological methods, but the proof does not give
information on the extremal $3$-uniform hypergraphs. Our goal in this paper is
to characterize those hypergraphs which are tight for Aharoni's Theorem.
  Our proof of this characterization is also based on topological machinery,
particularly utilizing results on the (topological) connectedness of the
independence complex of the line graph of the link graphs of $3$-uniform
Ryser-extremal hypergraphs, developed in a separate paper \cite{HNS}. The
current paper contains the second, structural hypergraph-theoretic part of the
argument, where we use the information on the line graph of the link graphs to
nail down the elements of a structure we call \emph{home-base hypergraph}.
While there is a single minimal home-base hypergraph with matching number $k$
for every positive integer $k \in \N$, home-base hypergraphs with matching
number $k$ are far from being unique. There are infinitely many of them and
each of them is composed of $k$ copies of two different kinds of basic
structures, whose hyperedges can intersect in various restricted, but intricate
ways.
