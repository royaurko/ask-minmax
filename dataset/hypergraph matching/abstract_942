This paper describes the transition of a male-pessimal matching set to
optimal when it is a man-oriented approach by deleting a pair from matching set
considering the score based approach. A descriptive explanation of the proposed
algorithm both in a sequential and parallel manner is given. The comparison
based theoretical analysis shows that the best case of the algorithm is lower
bound of n3.
