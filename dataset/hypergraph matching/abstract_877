We suggest that the correspondence between gauge theories strongly coupled in
the infrared and their low energy effective theories may be probed by
introducing topologically non-trivial background scalar fields. We argue that
one loop expressions for the global charges induced in vacuum by these
background fields are in some cases exact in the fundamental theory, and hence
should be matched in the effective theory. These matching conditions are
sometimes inequivalent to 't Hooft ones. A few examples of induced charge
matching are presented.
