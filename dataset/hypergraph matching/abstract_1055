We define and consider k-distant crossings and nestings for matchings and set
partitions, which are a variation of crossings and nestings in which the
distance between vertices is important. By modifying an involution of Kasraoui
and Zeng (Electronic J. Combinatorics 2006, research paper 33), we show that
the joint distribution of k-distant crossings and nestings is symmetric. We
also study the numbers of k-distant noncrossing matchings and partitions for
small k, which are counted by well-known sequences, as well as the orthogonal
polynomials related to k-distant noncrossing matchings and partitions. We
extend Chen et al.'s r-crossings and enhanced r-crossings.
