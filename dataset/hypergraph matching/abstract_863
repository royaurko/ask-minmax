The matching between two 4-dimensional PP-waves is discussed by using
Israel's matching conditions. Physical consequences on the dynamics of (cosmic)
strings are analyzed. The extension to space-time of arbitrary dimension is
discussed and some interesting features related to the brane world scenario,
BPS states in gravity and Dirac-like quantization conditions are briefly
described.
