We prove that the vertex degree threshold for tiling $\C_4^3$ (the 3-uniform
hypergraph with four vertices and two triples) in a 3-uniform hypergraph on
$n\in 4\mathbb N$ vertices is $\binom{n-1}2 - \binom{\frac34 n}2+\frac38n+c$,
where $c=1$ if $n\in 8\mathbb N$ and $c=-\frac12$ otherwise. This result is
best possible, and is one of the first results on vertex degree conditions for
hypergraph tiling.
