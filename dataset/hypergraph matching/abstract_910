In this paper we derive polynomial time algorithms that generate random
$k$-noncrossing matchings and $k$-noncrossing RNA structures with uniform
probability. Our approach employs the bijection between $k$-noncrossing
matchings and oscillating tableaux and the $P$-recursiveness of the
cardinalities of $k$-noncrossing matchings. The main idea is to consider the
tableaux sequences as paths of stochastic processes over shapes and to derive
their transition probabilities.
