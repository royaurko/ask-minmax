Graph Laplacians on finite compact metric graphs are considered under the
assumption that the matching conditions at the graph vertices are of either
$\delta$ or $\delta'$ type. In either case, an infinite series of trace
formulae which link together two different graph Laplacians provided that their
spectra coincide is derived. Applications are given to the problem of
reconstructing matching conditions for a graph Laplacian based on its spectrum.
