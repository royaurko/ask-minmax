A hypergraph is simple if it has no loops and no repeated edges, and a
hypergraph is linear if it is simple and each pair of edges intersects in at
most one vertex. For $n\geq 3$, let $r= r(n)\geq 3$ be an integer and let
$\boldsymbol{k} = (k_1,\ldots, k_n)$ be a vector of nonnegative integers, where
each $k_j = k_j(n)$ may depend on $n$. Let $M = M(n) = \sum_{j=1}^n k_j$ for
all $n\geq 3$, and define the set $\mathcal{I} = \{ n\geq 3 \mid r(n) \text{
divides } M(n)\}$. We assume that $\mathcal{I}$ is infinite, and perform
asymptotics as $n$ tends to infinity along $\mathcal{I}$. Our main result is an
asymptotic enumeration formula for linear $r$-uniform hypergraphs with degree
sequence $\boldsymbol{k}$. This formula holds whenever the maximum degree
$k_{\max}$ satisfies $r^4 k_{\max}^4(k_{\max} + r) = o(M)$. Our approach is to
work with the incidence matrix of a hypergraph, interpreted as the biadjacency
matrix of a bipartite graph, enabling us to apply known enumeration results for
bipartite graphs. This approach also leads to a new asymptotic enumeration
formula for simple uniform hypergraphs with specified degrees, and a result
regarding the girth of random bipartite graphs with specified degrees.
