We present a new approach, called a lazy matching, to the problem of on-line
matching on bipartite graphs. Originally, each arriving element is irrevocably
matched with some already existing one. In this paper we allow matching a new
element to a group of elements (possibly decreasing other groups) with
additional restrictions that every two groups have to be disjoint and
decreasing a group is allowed as long as it stays not empty. We present a
deterministic optimal algorithm and prove that its competitive ratio equals
$1-\pi/\cosh(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\pi)\approx 0.588$. The lazy approach allows to
break the barrier of $1/2$, which is the best competitive ratio that can be
guaranteed by any deterministic algorithm in the classical on-line matching.
