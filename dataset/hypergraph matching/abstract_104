In this note we give a new effective proof method for the equivalence of the
notions of testability and nondeterministic testability for uniform hypergraph
parameters. We provide the first effective upper bound on the sample complexity
of any nondeterministically testable $r$-uniform hypergraph parameter as a
function of the sample complexity of its witness parameter for arbitrary $r$.
The dependence is of the form of an exponential tower function with the height
linear in $r$. Our argument depends crucially on the new upper bounds for the
$r$-cut norm of sampled $r$-uniform hypergraphs. We employ also our approach
for some other restricted classes of hypergraph parameters, and present some
applications.
