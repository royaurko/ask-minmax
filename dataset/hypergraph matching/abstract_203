In this paper, we consider the embedding of a complete $d$-uniform geometric
hypergraph with $n$ vertices in general position in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where each
hyperedge is represented as a $(d-1)$-simplex, and a pair of hyperedges is
defined to cross if they are vertex-disjoint and contains a common point in the
relative interior of the simplices corresponding to them. As a corollary of the
Van Kampen-Flores Theorem, it can be seen that such a hypergraph contains
$\Omega(\frac{2^d}{\sqrt{d}})$ $n\choose 2d$ crossing pairs of hyperedges.
Using Gale Transform and Ham Sandwich Theorem, we improve this lower bound to
$\Omega(\frac{2^d \log d}{\sqrt{d}})$ $n\choose 2d$.
