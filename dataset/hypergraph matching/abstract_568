In this paper, we study $(1 : b)$ Avoider-Enforcer games played on the edge
set of the complete graph on $n$ vertices. For every constant $k\geq 3$ we
analyse the $k$-star game, where Avoider tries to avoid claiming $k$ edges
incident to the same vertex. We analyse both versions of Avoider-Enforcer games
-- the strict and the monotone -- and for each provide explicit winning
strategies for both players. We determine the order of magnitude of the
threshold biases $f^{mon}_\mathcal{F}$, $f^-_\mathcal{F}$ and
$f^+_\mathcal{F}$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the hypergraph of the game.
