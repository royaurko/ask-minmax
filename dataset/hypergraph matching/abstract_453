A \textit{distinguishing partition} of a group $X$ with automorphism group
${aut}(X)$ is a partition of $X$ that is fixed by no nontrivial element of
${aut}(X)$. In the event that $X$ is a complete multipartite graph with its
automorphism group, the existence of a distinguishing partition is equivalent
to the existence of an asymmetric hypergraph with prescribed edge sizes. An
asymptotic result is proven on the existence of a distinguishing partition when
$X$ is a complete multipartite graph with $m_1$ parts of size $n_1$ and $m_2$
parts of size $n_2$ for small $n_1$, $m_2$ and large $m_1$, $n_2$. A key tool
in making the estimate is counting the number of trees of particular classes.
