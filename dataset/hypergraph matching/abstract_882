We analyze phase matching with reference to frequency doubling in nanosized
quadratic waveguides encompassing form birefringence and supporting
cross-polarized fundamental and second-harmonic modes. In an AlGaAs rod with an
air void, we show that phase-matched second-harmonic generation could be
achieved in a wide spectral range employing state-of-the-art nanotechnology.
