General upper tail estimates are given for counting edges in a random induced
subhypergraph of a fixed hypergraph H, with an easy proof by estimating the
moments. As an application we consider the numbers of arithmetic progressions
and Schur triples in random subsets of integers. In the second part of the
paper we return to the subgraph counts in random graphs and provide upper tail
estimates in the rooted case.
