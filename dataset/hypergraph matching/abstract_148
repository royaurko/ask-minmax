In this paper we study fundamental connectivity properties of hypergraphs
from a graph-theoretic perspective, with the emphasis on cut edges, cut
vertices, and blocks. To prepare the ground, we define various types of
subhypergraphs, as well as various types of walks in a hypergraph. We then
prove a number of new results involving cut edges, cut vertices, and blocks. In
particular, we describe the exact relationship between the block decomposition
of a hypergraph and the block decomposition of its incidence graph.
