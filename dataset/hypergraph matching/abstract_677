One of the most basic questions one can ask about a graph H is: how many
H-free graphs on n vertices are there? For non-bipartite H, the answer to this
question has been well-understood since 1986, when Erd\H{o}s, Frankl and R\"odl
proved, using Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma, that there are 2^{(1 + o(1))
ex(n,H)} such graphs. (A proof which avoids the regularity lemma was given only
recently.) For bipartite graphs, however, much less is known: even the weaker
bound 2^{O(ex(n,H))} has been proven in only a few special cases: for cycles of
length four and six, and for some complete bipartite graphs.
  For even cycles, Bondy and Simonovits proved in the 1970s that ex(n,
C_{2\ell}) = O(n^{1 + 1/\ell}), and this bound is conjectured to be sharp up to
the implicit constant. In this paper we prove that the number of C_{2\ell}-free
graphs on n vertices is at most 2^{O(n^{1 + 1/\ell})}, confirming a conjecture
of Erd\H{o}s. Our proof uses the hypergraph container method, which was
developed recently (and independently) by Balogh, Morris and Samotij, and by
Saxton and Thomason, together with a new 'refined supersaturation theorem' for
even cycles. We moreover show that there are at least 2^{(1 + c)ex(n,C_6)}
C_6-free graphs with n vertices for some c > 0 and infinitely many values of n.
As a further application of our method, we essentially resolve the so-called
Tur\'an problem on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph G(n,p) for both even
cycles and complete bipartite graphs.
