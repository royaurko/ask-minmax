In the manuscript, we present a practical way to find the matching priors
proposed by Welch & Peers (1963) and Peers (1965). We investigate the use of
saddlepoint approximations combined with matching priors and obtain p-values of
the test of an interest parameter in the presence of nuisance parameter. The
advantage of our procedure is the flexibility of choosing different initial
conditions so that one can adjust the performance of the test. Two examples
have been studied, with coverage verified via Monte Carlo simulation. One
relates to the ratio of two exponential means, and the other relates the
logistic regression model. Particularly, we are interested in small sample
settings.
