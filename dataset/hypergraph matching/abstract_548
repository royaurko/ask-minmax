For any set $S$ of positive integers, a mixed hypergraph ${\cal H}$ is a
realization of $S$ if its feasible set is $S$, furthermore, ${\cal H}$ is a
one-realization of $S$ if it is a realization of $S$ and each entry of its
chromatic spectrum is either 0 or 1. Jiang et al. \cite{Jiang} showed that the
minimum number of vertices of realization of $\{s,t\}$ with $2\leq s\leq t-2$
is $2t-s$. Kr$\acute{\rm a}$l \cite{Kral} proved that there exists a
one-realization of $S$ with at most $|S|+2\max{S}-\min{S}$ vertices. In this
paper, we improve Kr$\acute{\rm a}$l's result, and determine the size of the
smallest one-realization of a given set. As a result, we partially solve an
open problem proposed by Jiang et al. in 2002 and by Kr$\acute{\rm a}$l in
2004.
