A hypergraph dictatorship test is first introduced by Samorodnitsky and
Trevisan and serves as a key component in their unique games based $\PCP$
construction. Such a test has oracle access to a collection of functions and
determines whether all the functions are the same dictatorship, or all their
low degree influences are $o(1).$ Their test makes $q\geq3$ queries and has
amortized query complexity $1+O(\frac{\log q}{q})$ but has an inherent loss of
perfect completeness. In this paper we give an adaptive hypergraph dictatorship
test that achieves both perfect completeness and amortized query complexity
$1+O(\frac{\log q}{q})$.
