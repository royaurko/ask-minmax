Extracting minutiae from fingerprint images is one of the most important
steps in automatic fingerprint identification system. Because minutiae matching
are certainly the most well-known and widely used method for fingerprint
matching, minutiae are local discontinuities in the fingerprint pattern. In
this paper a fingerprint matching algorithm is proposed using some specific
feature of the minutiae points, also the acquired fingerprint image is
considered by minimizing its size by generating a corresponding fingerprint
template for a large fingerprint database. The results achieved are compared
with those obtained through some other methods also shows some improvement in
the minutiae detection process in terms of memory and time required.
