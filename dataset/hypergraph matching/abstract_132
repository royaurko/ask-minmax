For a given hypergraph, an orientation can be assigned to the vertex-edge
incidences. This orientation is used to define the adjacency and Laplacian
matrices. In addition to studying these matrices, several related structures
are investigated including the incidence dual, the intersection graph (line
graph), and the 2-section. A connection is then made between oriented
hypergraphs and balanced incomplete block designs.
