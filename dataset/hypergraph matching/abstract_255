We prove an arithmetic removal result for all compact abelian groups,
generalizing a finitary removal result of Kr\'al', Serra and the third contributor.
To this end, we consider infinite measurable hypergraphs that are invariant
under certain group actions, and for these hypergraphs we prove a
symmetry-preserving removal lemma, which extends a finitary result of the same
name by the second contributor. We deduce our arithmetic removal result by applying
this lemma to a specific type of invariant measurable hypergraph. As a direct
application, we obtain the following generalization of Szemer\'edi's theorem:
for any compact abelian group $G$, any measurable set $A\subset G$ with Haar
probability $\mu(A)\geq\alpha>0$ satisfies $$\int_G\int_G\; 1_A\big(x\big)\;
1_A\big(x+r\big) \cdots 1_A\big(x+(k-1)r\big) \; d\mu(x) d\mu(r) \geq c,$$
where the constant $c=c(\alpha,k)>0$ is valid uniformly for all $G$. This
result is shown to hold more generally for any translation-invariant system of
$r$ linear equations given by an integer matrix with coprime $r\times r$
minors.
