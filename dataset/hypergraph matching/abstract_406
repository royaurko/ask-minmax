A clique-coloring of a graph $G$ is a coloring of the vertices of $G$ so that
no maximal clique of size at least two is monochromatic. The clique-hypergraph,
$\mathcal{H}(G)$, of a graph $G$ has $V(G)$ as its set of vertices and the
maximal cliques of $G$ as its hyperedges. A (vertex) coloring of
$\mathcal{H}(G)$ is a clique-coloring of $G$. The clique-chromatic number of
$G$ is the least number of colors for which $G$ admits a clique-coloring. Every
planar graph has been proved to be 3-clique-colorable (Electr. J. Combin. 6
(1999), \#R26). Recently, we showed that every claw-free planar graph,
different from an odd cycle, is $2$-clique-colorable (European J. Combin. 36
(2014) 367-376). In this paper we generalize these results to \{claw,
$K_5$-minor\}-free graphs.
