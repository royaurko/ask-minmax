Two $k$-uniform hypergraphs are said to be cospectral (E-cospectral), if
their adjacency tensors have the same characteristic polynomial
(E-characteristic polynomial). A $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ is said to be
determined by its spectrum, if there is no other non-isomorphic $k$-uniform
hypergraph cospectral with $H$. In this note, we give a method for constructing
E-cospectral hypergraphs, which is similar with Godsil-McKay switching. Some
hypergraphs are shown to be determined by their spectra.
