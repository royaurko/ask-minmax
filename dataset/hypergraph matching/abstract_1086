This paper is concerned with structures of general graphs with perfect
matchings. We first reveal a partially ordered structure among
factor-components of general graphs with perfect matchings. Our second result
is a generalization of Kotzig's canonical partition to a decomposition of
general graphs with perfect matchings. It contains a short proof for the
theorem of the canonical partition. These results give decompositions which are
canonical, that is, unique to given graphs. We also show that there are
correlations between these two and that these can be computed in polynomial
time.
