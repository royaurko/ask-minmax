In this article, we apply the concept of bipolar fuzzy sets to hypergraphs
and investigate some properties of bipolar fuzzy hypergraphs. We introduce the
notion of $A-$ tempered bipolar fuzzy hypergraphs and present some of their
properties. We also present application examples of bipolar fuzzy hypergraphs.
