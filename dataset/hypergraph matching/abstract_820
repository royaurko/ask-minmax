Ontology Matching aims to find a set of semantic correspondences, called an
alignment, between related ontologies. In recent years, there has been a
growing interest in efficient and effective matching methods for large
ontologies. However, most of the alignments produced for large ontologies are
logically incoherent. It was only recently that the use of repair techniques to
improve the quality of ontology alignments has been explored. In this paper we
present a novel technique for detecting incoherent concepts based on ontology
modularization, and a new repair algorithm that minimizes the incoherence of
the resulting alignment and the number of matches removed from the input
alignment. An implementation was done as part of a lightweight version of
AgreementMaker system, a successful ontology matching platform, and evaluated
using a set of four benchmark biomedical ontology matching tasks. Our results
show that our implementation is efficient and produces better alignments with
respect to their coherence and f-measure than the state of the art repairing
tools. They also show that our implementation is a better alternative for
producing coherent silver standard alignments.
