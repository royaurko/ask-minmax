Let $F$ be a strictly $k$-balanced $k$-uniform hypergraph with $e(F)\geq
|F|-k+1$ and maximum co-degree at least two. The random greedy $F$-free process
constructs a maximal $F$-free hypergraph as follows. Consider a random ordering
of the hyperedges of the complete $k$-uniform hypergraph $K_n^k$ on $n$
vertices. Start with the empty hypergraph on $n$ vertices. Successively
consider the hyperedges $e$ of $K_n^k$ in the given ordering, and add $e$ to
the existing hypergraph provided that $e$ does not create a copy of $F$. We
show that asymptotically almost surely this process terminates at a hypergraph
with $\tilde{O}(n^{k-(|F|-k)/(e(F)-1)})$ hyperedges. This is best possible up
to logarithmic factors.
