We present a fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining approximate maximum
weight matching in general weighted graphs. The algorithm maintains a matching
${\cal M}$ whose weight is at least $1/8 M^{*}$ where $M^{*}$ is the weight of
the maximum weight matching. The algorithm achieves an expected amortized
$O(\log n \log \mathcal C)$ time per edge insertion or deletion, where
$\mathcal C$ is the ratio of the weights of the highest weight edge to the
smallest weight edge in the given graph. Using a simple randomized scaling
technique, we are able to obtain a matching whith expected approximation ratio
4.9108.
