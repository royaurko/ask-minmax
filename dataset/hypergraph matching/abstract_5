In this paper firstly, we generalize the concept of codismantlable graphs to
hypergraphs and show that some special vertex decomposable hypergraphs are
codismantlable. Then we introduce and generalize some combinatorial invariants
of graphs such as matching number and induced matching number and present some
upper bounds for the regularity of Stanley-Reisner ring of
$\Delta_{\mathcal{H}}$ for certain hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}$ in terms of the
introduced matching numbers. At last, we generalize the concept of bouquet in
graphs to hypergraphs to extend some combinatorial invariants of graphs about
disjointness of a set of bouquets. We use these invariants to characterize the
projective dimension of Stanley-Reisner ring of special hypergraphs in some
sense.
