The AdS/CFT correspondence relates dibaryons in superconformal gauge theories
to holomorphic curves in Kaehler-Einstein surfaces. The degree of the
holomorphic curves is proportional to the gauge theory conformal dimension of
the dibaryons. Moreover, the number of holomorphic curves should match, in an
appropriately defined sense, the number of dibaryons. Using AdS/CFT backgrounds
built from the generalized conifolds of Gubser, Shatashvili, and Nekrasov
(1999), we show that the gauge theory prediction for the dimension of
dibaryonic operators does indeed match the degree of the corresponding
holomorphic curves. For AdS/CFT backgrounds built from cones over del Pezzo
surfaces, we are able to match the degree of the curves to the conformal
dimension of dibaryons for the n'th del Pezzo surface, n=1,2,...,6. Also, for
the del Pezzos and the A_k type generalized conifolds, for the dibaryons of
smallest conformal dimension, we are able to match the number of holomorphic
curves with the number of possible dibaryon operators from gauge theory.
