We study the problem of finding a maximum matching in a graph given by an
input stream listing its edges in some arbitrary order, where the quantity to
be maximized is given by a monotone submodular function on subsets of edges.
This problem, which we call maximum submodular-function matching (MSM), is a
natural generalization of maximum weight matching (MWM), which is in turn a
generalization of maximum cardinality matching (MCM). We give two incomparable
algorithms for this problem with space usage falling in the semi-streaming
range---they store only $O(n)$ edges, using $O(n\log n)$ working memory---that
achieve approximation ratios of $7.75$ in a single pass and $(3+\epsilon)$ in
$O(\epsilon^{-3})$ passes respectively. The operations of these algorithms
mimic those of Zelke's and McGregor's respective algorithms for MWM; the
novelty lies in the analysis for the MSM setting. In fact we identify a general
framework for MWM algorithms that allows this kind of adaptation to the broader
setting of MSM.
  In the sequel, we give generalizations of these results where the
maximization is over "independent sets" in a very general sense. This
generalization captures hypermatchings in hypergraphs as well as independence
in the intersection of multiple matroids.
