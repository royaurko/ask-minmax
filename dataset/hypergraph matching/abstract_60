Despite of the extreme success of the spectral graph theory, there are
relatively few papers applying spectral analysis to hypergraphs. Chung first
introduced Laplacians for regular hypergraphs and showed some useful
applications. Other researchers treated hypergraphs as weighted graphs and then
studied the Laplacians of the corresponding weighted graphs. In this paper, we
aim to unify these very different versions of Laplacians for hypergraphs. We
introduce a set of Laplacians for hypergraphs through studying high-ordered
random walks on hypergraphs. We prove the eigenvalues of these Laplacians can
effectively control the mixing rate of high-ordered random walks, the
generalized distances/diameters, and the edge expansions.
