We introduce the notion of matched pairs of Courant algebroids and give
several examples arising naturally from complex manifolds, holomorphic Courant
algebroids, and certain regular Courant algebroids. We consider the matched sum
of two Dirac subbundles, one in each of two Courant algebroids forming a
matched pair.
