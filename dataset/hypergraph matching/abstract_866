We calculate one-loop matching factors for bilinear operators composed of
improved staggered fermions. We compare the results for different improvement
schemes used in the recent literature, including the HYP action and an action
close to the Asqtad action. We find that all improvement schemes substantially
reduce the size of the one-loop contributions to matching factors. The
resulting corrections are comparable to, or smaller than, those found with
Wilson and domain-wall fermions.
