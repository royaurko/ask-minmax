Recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new class of social networks,
that require us to move beyond previously employed representations of complex
graph structures. A notable example is that of the folksonomy, an online
process where users collaboratively employ tags to resources to impart
structure to an otherwise undifferentiated database. In a recent paper[1] we
proposed a mathematical model that represents these structures as tripartite
hypergraphs and defined basic topological quantities of interest. In this paper
we extend our model by defining additional quantities such as edge
distributions, vertex similarity and correlations as well as clustering. We
then empirically measure these quantities on two real life folksonomies, the
popular online photo sharing site Flickr and the bookmarking site CiteULike. We
find that these systems share similar qualitative features with the majority of
complex networks that have been previously studied. We propose that the
quantities and methodology described here can be used as a standard tool in
measuring the structure of tagged networks.
