The Kirchhoff index of a connected graph is the sum of resistance distances
between all unordered pairs of vertices in the graph. It found considerable
applications in a variety of fields. In this paper, we determine the minimum
Kirchhoff index among the unicyclic graphs with fixed number of vertices and
matching number, and characterize the extremal graphs.
