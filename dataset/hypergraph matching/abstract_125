We consider Stanley--Reisner rings $k[x_1,...,x_n]/I(\mc{H})$ where
$I(\mc{H})$ is the edge ideal associated to some particular classes of
hypergraphs. For instance, we consider hypergraphs that are natural
generalizations of graphs that are lines and cycles, and for these we compute
the Betti numbers. We also generalize upon some known results about chordal
graphs and study a weak form of shellability.
