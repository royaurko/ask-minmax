We propose a new matching algorithm, called DeepMatching, to compute dense
correspondences between images. DeepMatching relies on a deep, multi-layer,
convolutional architecture designed for matching images. The proposed matching
algorithm can handle non-rigid deformations and repetitive textures, and can
therefore efficiently determine dense correspondences in the presence of
significant changes between images. We evaluate the performance of
DeepMatching, in comparison with state-of-the-art matching algorithms, on resp.
the Mikolajczyk, the MPI-Sintel and the Kitti datasets. The performance measure
is "Accuracy@T" , that is the percentage of correct pixels for a specified
error threshold of T pixels. Deep-Matching outperforms the state-of-the-art
algorithms in terms of accuracy@T and shows excellent results in particular for
repetitive textures. We also propose a method for estimating optical flow,
called DeepFlow, by integrating a DeepMatching term in a variational energy
minimization approach. Robustness to large displacements is obtained due to
this matching term. DeepFlow obtains competitive performance on public
benchmarks for optical flow estimation. In particular, DeepFlow obtains
state-of-the-art results on the MPI-Sintel dataset.
