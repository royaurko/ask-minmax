Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) computations of semi-leptonic decays,
e.g. B -> pi l nu, require the knowledge of the parameters in the effective
theory for all components of the heavy-light flavor currents. So far
non-perturbative matching conditions have been employed only for the time
component of the axial current. Here we perform a check of matching conditions
for the time component of the vector current and the spatial component of the
axial vector current up to one-loop order of perturbation theory and to lowest
order of the 1/m-expansion. We find that the proposed observables have small
higher order terms in the 1/m-series and are thus excellent candidates for a
non-perturbative matching procedure.
