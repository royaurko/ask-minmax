An ordered set $W$ of vertices of a connected graph $G$ is called a resolving
set for $G$ if for every two distinct vertices $u,v \in V(G)$, there is a
vertex $w \in W$ such that $d(u,w) \neq d(v,w)$. A resolving set of minimum
cardinality is called a basis for $G$ and the number of vertices in a basis is
called the metric dimension of $G$, denoted by $dim(G)$. For a vertex $u$ of
$G$ and a subset $S$ of $V(G)$, the distance between $u$ and $S$ is the number
$\min \limits_{s \in S}d(u,s)$. An ordered $t$-partition $\Pi$ $=$ $\{S_1,
S_2,\ldots,S_t\}$ of $V(G)$ is called a resolving partition if for every two
distinct vertices $u,v \in V(G)$, there is a set $S_i$ in $\Pi$ such that
$d(u,S_i) \neq d(v,S_i)$. The minimum $t$ for which there is a resolving
$t$-partition of $V(G)$ is called the partition dimension of $G$, denoted by
$pd(G)$.
  A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph where edges can connect any
number of vertices. In this paper, we extend the study of metric and partition
dimension to hypergraphs. We give sharp lower bounds for the metric and
partition dimension of hypergraphs in general and give exact values with
specified conditions.
