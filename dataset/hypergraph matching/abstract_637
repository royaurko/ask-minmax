In this paper, we introduce a novel, non-recursive, maximal matching
algorithm for double auctions, which aims to maximize the amount of commodities
to be traded. It differs from the usual equilibrium matching, which clears a
market at the equilibrium price. We compare the two algorithms through
experimental analyses, showing that the maximal matching algorithm is favored
in scenarios where trading volume is a priority and that it may possibly
improve allocative efficiency over equilibrium matching as well. A
parameterized algorithm that incorporates both maximal matching and equilibrium
matching as special cases is also presented to allow flexible control on how
much to trade in a double auction.
