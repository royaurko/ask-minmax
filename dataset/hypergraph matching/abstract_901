We introduce Courant algebroids, providing definitions, some historical
notes, and some elementary properties. Next, we summarize basic properties of
graded manifolds. Then, drawing on the work of Roytenberg and others, we
introduce the graded or supergraded language demonstrating a cochain complex /
cohomology for (general) Courant algebroids. We review spectral sequences and
show how this tool is used to compute cohomology of regular Courant algebroids
with a split base. Finally we analyze matched pairs of Courant algebroids
including the complexified standard Courant algebroid of a complex manifold,
the matched pair arising from a holomorphic Courant algebroid, and certain
cases of regular Courant algebroids.
