The Frechet distance is a metric to compare two curves, which is based on
monotonous matchings between these curves. We call a matching that results in
the Frechet distance a Frechet matching. There are often many different Frechet
matchings and not all of these capture the similarity between the curves well.
We propose to restrict the set of Frechet matchings to "natural" matchings and
to this end introduce locally correct Frechet matchings. We prove that at least
one such matching exists for two polygonal curves and give an O(N^3 log N)
algorithm to compute it, where N is the total number of edges in both curves.
We also present an O(N^2) algorithm to compute a locally correct discrete
Frechet matching.
