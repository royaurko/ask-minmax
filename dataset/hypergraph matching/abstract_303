A $k$-uniform loose cycle $\mathcal{C}_n^k$ is a hypergraph with vertex set
$\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{n(k-1)}\}$ and with the set of $n$ edges
$e_i=\{v_{(i-1)(k-1)+1},v_{(i-1)(k-1)+2},\ldots,v_{(i-1)(k-1)+k}\}$, $1\leq
i\leq n$, where we use mod $n(k-1)$ arithmetic. The Ramsey number
$R(\mathcal{C}^k_n,\mathcal{C}^k_n)$ is asymptotically $\frac{1}{2}(2k-1)n$ as
has been proved by Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s, S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy and Szemer\'{e}di. In this
paper, we investigate to determining the exact value of diagonal Ramsey number
of $\mathcal{C}^k_n$ and we show that for $n\geq 2$ and $k\geq 8$
$$R(\mathcal{C}^k_n,\mathcal{C}^k_n)=(k-1)n+\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor.$$
