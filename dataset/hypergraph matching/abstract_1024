The Las Campanas Redshift Survey, an optically selected survey which contains
26,418 galaxy redshifts, has been correlated with ``The First ROSAT Source
Catalogue of Pointed Observations with the PSPC,'' which contains 50,408
sources from 2876 ROSAT pointed observations. Ten matches were found. The
optical spectra of most of the ten matches show weak narrow emission lines. Due
to their high x-ray luminosities, their high x-ray--to--optical flux ratios,
and the evidence of rapid x-ray variability in the two brightest matches, we
interpret the majority of these objects to be narrow-line Seyfert galaxies or
``hidden'' active galactic nuclei. Of the ten matches, only one galaxy shows
the characteristics of a bona fide starburst.
