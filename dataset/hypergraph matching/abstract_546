We review the relation of N=4 superconformal multi-particle models on the
real line to the WDVV equation and an associated linear equation for two
prepotentials, F and U. The superspace treatment gives another variant of the
integrability problem, which we also reformulate as a search for closed flat
Yang-Mills connections. Three- and four-particle solutions are presented. The
covector ansatz turns the WDVV equation into an algebraic condition, for which
we give a formulation in terms of partial isometries. Three ideas for
classifying WDVV solutions are developed: ortho-polytopes, hypergraphs, and
matroids. Various examples and counterexamples are displayed.
