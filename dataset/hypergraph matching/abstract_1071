Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) has long been considered a powerful
heuristic for attacking compressive sensing problems; however, its theoretical
development is, unfortunately, somewhat lacking. This paper presents an
improved Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) based performance guarantee for
T-sparse signal reconstruction that asymptotically approaches the conjectured
lower bound given in Davenport et al. We also further extend the
state-of-the-art by deriving reconstruction error bounds for the case of
general non-sparse signals subjected to measurement noise. We then generalize
our results to the case of K-fold Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (KOMP). We finish
by presenting an empirical analysis suggesting that OMP and KOMP outperform
other compressive sensing algorithms in average case scenarios. This turns out
to be quite surprising since RIP analysis (i.e. worst case scenario) suggests
that these matching pursuits should perform roughly T^0.5 times worse than
convex optimization, CoSAMP, and Iterative Thresholding.
