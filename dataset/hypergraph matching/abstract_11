We determine the exact minimum $\ell$-degree threshold for perfect matchings
in $k$-uniform hypergraphs when the corresponding threshold for perfect
fractional matchings is significantly less than $\frac{1}{2} \binom{n}{k-
\ell}$. This extends our previous results that determine the minimum
$\ell$-degree thresholds for perfect matchings in $k$-uniform hypergraphs for
all $\ell\ge k/2$ and provides two new (exact) thresholds: $(k,\ell)=(5,2)$ and
$(7,3)$.
