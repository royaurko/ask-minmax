In this paper we present the exact solution for the average minimum energy of
the random bipartite matching model with an arbitrary finite number of elements
where random paired interactions are described by independent exponential
distribution. This solution confirms the Parisi conjecture proposed for this
model earlier, as well as the result of the replica solution of this model in
the thermodynamic limit.
