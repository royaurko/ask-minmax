To date, the principal use case for schema matching research has been as a
precursor for code generation, i.e., constructing mappings between schema
elements with the end goal of data transfer. In this paper, we argue that
schema matching plays valuable roles independent of mapping construction,
especially as schemata grow to industrial scales. Specifically, in large
enterprises human decision makers and planners are often the immediate consumer
of information derived from schema matchers, instead of schema mapping tools.
We list a set of real application areas illustrating this role for schema
matching, and then present our experiences tackling a customer problem in one
of these areas. We describe the matcher used, where the tool was effective,
where it fell short, and our lessons learned about how well current schema
matching technology is suited for use in large enterprises. Finally, we suggest
a new agenda for schema matching research based on these experiences.
