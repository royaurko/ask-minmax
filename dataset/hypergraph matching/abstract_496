This paper addresses the problem of matching $N$ weighted graphs referring to
an identical object or category. More specifically, matching the common node
correspondences among graphs. This multi-graph matching problem involves two
ingredients affecting the overall accuracy: i) the local pairwise matching
affinity score among graphs; ii) the global matching consistency that measures
the uniqueness of the pairwise matching results by different chaining orders.
Previous studies typically either enforce the matching consistency constraints
in the beginning of iterative optimization, which may propagate matching error
both over iterations and across graph pairs; or separate affinity optimizing
and consistency regularization in two steps. This paper is motivated by the
observation that matching consistency can serve as a regularizer in the
affinity objective function when the function is biased due to noises or
inappropriate modeling. We propose multi-graph matching methods to incorporate
the two aspects by boosting the affinity score, meanwhile gradually infusing
the consistency as a regularizer. Furthermore, we propose a node-wise
consistency/affinity-driven mechanism to elicit the common inlier nodes out of
the irrelevant outliers. Extensive results on both synthetic and public image
datasets demonstrate the competency of the proposed algorithms.
