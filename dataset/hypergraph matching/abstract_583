Given a random 3-uniform hypergraph $H=H(n,p)$ on $n$ vertices where each
triple independently appears with probability $p$, consider the following graph
process. We start with the star $G_0$ on the same vertex set, containing all
the edges incident to some vertex $v_0$, and repeatedly add an edge $xy$ if
there is a vertex $z$ such that $xz$ and $zy$ are already in the graph and $xzy
\in H$. We say that the process propagates if it reaches the complete graph
before it terminates. In this paper we prove that the threshold probability for
propagation is $p=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}$. We conclude that
$p=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}$ is an upper bound for the threshold probability that a
random 2-dimensional simplicial complex is simply connected.
