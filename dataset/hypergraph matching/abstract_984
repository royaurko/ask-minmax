We discuss the difference between neutron halos and neutron skins matching to
our usual thinking of a skin as being connected to a body whereas a halo is, in
some sense, disconnected from the body. We emphasize that the existence of one
or more neutrons behaving incoherently with respect to the rest of the nucleons
in a nucleus can match the picture of a neutron halo.
