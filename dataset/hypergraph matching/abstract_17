Given positive integers k\geq 3 and r where k/2 \leq r \leq k-1, we give a
minimum r-degree condition that ensures a perfect matching in a k-uniform
hypergraph. This condition is best possible and improves on work of Pikhurko
who gave an asymptotically exact result. Our approach makes use of the
absorbing method, and builds on work in 'Exact minimum degree thresholds for
perfect matchings in uniform hypergraphs', where we proved the result for k
divisible by 4.
