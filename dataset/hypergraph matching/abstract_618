The matching basis in ?eld extentions is introduced by S. Eliahou and C.
Lecouvey in [2]. In this paper we de?ne the minimal and maximal linear matching
property for ?eld extensions and prove that if K is not algebraically closed,
then K has minimal linear matching property. In this paper we will prove that
algebraic number ?elds have maximal linear matching property. We also give a
shorter proof of a result established in [6] on the fundamental theorem of
algebra.
