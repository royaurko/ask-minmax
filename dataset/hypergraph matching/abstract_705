The popular Biometric used to authenticate a person is Fingerprint which is
unique and permanent throughout a person's life. A minutia matching is widely
used for fingerprint recognition and can be classified as ridge ending and
ridge bifurcation. In this paper we projected Fingerprint Recognition using
Minutia Score Matching method (FRMSM). For Fingerprint thinning, the Block
Filter is used, which scans the image at the boundary to preserves the quality
of the image and extract the minutiae from the thinned image. The false
matching ratio is better compared to the existing algorithm.
