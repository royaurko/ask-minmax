In 1970 Smith classified all connected graphs with the spectral radius at
most $2$. Here the spectral radius of a graph is the largest eigenvalue of its
adjacency matrix. Recently, the definition of spectral radius has been extended
to $r$-uniform hypergraphs. In this paper, we generalize the Smith's theorem to
$r$-uniform hypergraphs. We show that the smallest limit point of the spectral
radii of connected $r$-uniform hypergraphs is $\rho_r=(r-1)!\sqrt[r]{4}$. We
discovered a novel method for computing the spectral radius of hypergraphs, and
classified all connected $r$-uniform hypergraphs with spectral radius at most
$\rho_r$.
