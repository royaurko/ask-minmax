In 1965, Motzkin and Straus established a remarkable connection between the
order of a maximum clique and the Lagrangian of a graph and provided a new
proof of Tur\'an's theorem using the connection. The connection of Lagrangians
and Tur\'{a}n densities can be also used to prove the fundamental theorem of
Erd\"{o}s-Stone-Simonovits on Tur\'{a}n densities of graphs. Very recently, the
study of Tur\'{a}n densities of non-uniform hypergraphs have been motivated by
extremal poset problems. In this paper, we attempt to explore the applications
of Lagrangian method in determining Tur\'{a}n densities of non-uniform
hypergraphs. We first give a definition of the Lagrangian of a non-uniform
hypergraph, then give an extension of Motzkin-Straus theorem to non-uniform
hypergraphs whose edges contain 1 or 2 vertices. Applying it, we give an
extension of Erd\"{o}s-Stone-Simonovits theorem to non-uniform hypergraphs
whose edges contain 1 or 2 vertices.
