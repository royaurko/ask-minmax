We present a new scaling algorithm for maximum (or minimum) weight perfect
matching on general, edge weighted graphs. Our algorithm runs in
$O(m\sqrt{n}\log(nN))$ time, which matches the running time of the best {\em
bipartite} weighted matching algorithm (Gabow and Tarjan, 1989) and is within a
$\log(nN)$ factor of the best cardinality matching algorithm (Micali and
Vazirani, 1980). Here $m,n,$ and $N$ bound the number of edges, vertices, and
magnitude of any edge weight. In terms of running time our algorithm is just
slightly faster than the previous best (Gabow and Tarjan, 1991), by a
$\sqrt{\alpha(m,n)\log n}$ factor. However, it is dramatically simpler to
describe and analyze.
