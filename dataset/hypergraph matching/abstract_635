To improve confounder adjustments, observational studies are often matched on
potential confounders. While matched case-control studies are common and well
covered in the literature, our focus here is on matched cohort studies, which
are less common and sparsely discussed in the literature. Matched data also
arise naturally in twin studies, as a cohort of exposure-discordant twins can
be viewed as being matched on a large number of potential confounders. The
analysis of twin studies will be given special attention. We give an overview
of various analysis methods for matched cohort studies with binary exposures
and binary outcomes. In particular, our aim is to answer the following
questions: (1) What are the target parameters in the common analysis methods?
(2) What are the underlying assumptions in these methods? (3) How do the
methods compare in terms of statistical power?
