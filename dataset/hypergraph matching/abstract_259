Hypergraph is a powerful representation in several computer vision, machine
learning and pattern recognition problems. In the last decade, many researchers
have been keen to develop different hypergraph models. In contrast, no much
attention has been paid to the design of hyperedge weights. However, many
studies on pairwise graphs show that the choice of edge weight can
significantly influence the performances of such graph algorithms. We argue
that this also applies to hypegraphs. In this paper, we empirically discuss the
influence of hyperedge weight on hypegraph learning via proposing three novel
hyperedge weights from the perspectives of geometry, multivariate statistical
analysis and linear regression. Extensive experiments on ORL, COIL20, JAFFE,
Sheffield, Scene15 and Caltech256 databases verify our hypothesis. Similar to
graph learning, several representative hyperedge weighting schemes can be
concluded by our experimental studies. Moreover, the experiments also
demonstrate that the combinations of such weighting schemes and conventional
hypergraph models can get very promising classification and clustering
performances in comparison with some recent state-of-the-art algorithms.
