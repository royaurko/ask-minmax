We give an upper bound for the Stanley depth of the edge ideal of a complete
$k$-partite hypergraph and as an application we give an upper bound for the
Stanley depth of a monomial ideal in a polynomial ring $S$. We also give a
lower and an upper bound for the cyclic module $S/I$ associated to the complete
$k$-partite hypergraph.
