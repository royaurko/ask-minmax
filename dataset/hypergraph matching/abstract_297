We prove that, for a primitive permutation group G acting on a set of size n,
other than the alternating group, the probability that Aut(X,Y^G) = G for a
random subset Y of X, tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. So the property of the
title holds for all primitive groups except the alternating groups and finitely
many others. This answers a question of M. Klin. Moreover, we give an upper
bound n^{1/2+\epsilon} for the minimum size of the edges in such a hypergraph.
This is essentially best possible.
