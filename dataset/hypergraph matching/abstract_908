Lovasz and Plummer conjectured that there exists a fixed positive constant c
such that every cubic n-vertex graph with no cutedge has at least 2^(cn)
perfect matchings. Their conjecture has been verified for bipartite graphs by
Voorhoeve and planar graphs by Chudnovsky and Seymour. We prove that every
claw-free cubic n-vertex graph with no cutedge has more than 2^(n/12) perfect
matchings, thus verifying the conjecture for claw-free graphs.
