We present matching conditions for distributional sources of arbitrary
codimension in the context of Lovelock gravity. Then we give examples, treating
maximally symmetric distributional p-branes, embedded in flat, de Sitter and
anti-de Sitter spacetime. Unlike Einstein theory, distributional defects of
locally smooth geometry and codimension greater than 2 are demonstrated to
exist in Lovelock theories. The form of the matching conditions depends on the
parity of the brane codimension. For odd codimension, the matching conditions
involve discontinuities of Chern-Simons forms and are thus similar to junction
conditions for hypersurfaces. For even codimension, the bulk Lovelock densities
induce intrinsic Lovelock densities on the brane. In particular, this results
in the appearance of the induced Einstein tensor for p>2. For the matching
conditions we present, the effect of the bulk is reduced to an overall
topological solid angle defect which sets the Planck scale on the brane and to
extrinsic curvature terms. Moreover, for topological matching conditions and
constant solid angle deficit, we find that the equations of motion are obtained
from an exact p+1 dimensional action, which reduces to an induced Lovelock
theory for large codimension. In essence, this signifies that the
distributional part of the Lovelock bulk equations can naturally give rise to
induced gravity terms on a brane of even co-dimension. We relate our findings
to recent results on codimension 2 branes.
