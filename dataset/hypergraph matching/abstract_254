A k-uniform hypergraph is algebraic if its vertex set is n-dimensional
Euclidean space, for some n, and its hyperedge set is defined from the zero set
of some polynomial. The chromatic numbers of all algebraic hypergraphs are
determined, provided they are infinite. It is proved that for each infinite
cardinal b, the set of polynomials over the rationals that determine
hypergraphs having chromatic number at most b is computable. For countably
infinite b, this results in the computability of the set of rational, avoidable
polynomals, answering a question of mine from 2000.
