Let $r$ be a fixed constant and let $ {\mathcal H}$ be an $r$-uniform,
$D$-regular hypergraph on $N$ vertices. Assume further that $ D \to \infty$ as
$N \to \infty$ and that co-degrees of pairs of vertices in ${\mathcal H}$ are
at most $L$ where $L = o(D/ \log^5 N)$. We consider the random greedy algorithm
for forming a matching in $ \mc{H}$. We choose a matching at random by
iteratively choosing edges uniformly at random to be in the matching and
deleting all edges that share at least one vertex with a chosen edge before
moving on to the next choice. This process terminates when there are no edges
remaining in the graph. We show that with high probability the proportion of
vertices of $ {\mathcal H}$ that are not saturated by the final matching is at
most $ (L/D)^{\frac{1}{2(r-1)} + o(1)} $. This point is a natural barrier in
the analysis of the random greedy hypergraph matching process.
