We study the limiting object of a sequence of Markov chains analogous to the
limits of graphs, hypergraphs, and other objects which have been studied.
Following a suggestion of Aldous, we assign to a sequence of finite Markov
chains with bounded mixing times a unique limit object: an infinite Markov
chain with a measurable state space. The limits of the Markov chains we
consider have discrete spectra, which makes the limit theory simpler than the
general graph case, and illustrates how the discrete spectrum setting
(sometimes called "random-free" or "product measurable") is simpler than the
general case.
