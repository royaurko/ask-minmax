Autonomic management can improve the QoS provided by parallel/ distributed
applications. Within the CoreGRID Component Model, the autonomic management is
tailored to the automatic - monitoring-driven - alteration of the component
assembly and, therefore, is defined as the effect of (distributed) management
code. This work yields a semantics based on hypergraph rewriting suitable to
model the dynamic evolution and non-functional aspects of Service Oriented
Architectures and component-based autonomic applications. In this regard, our
main goal is to provide a formal description of adaptation operations that are
typically only informally specified. We contend that our approach makes easier
to raise the level of abstraction of management code in autonomic and adaptive
applications.
