We obtain the generating functions for partial matchings avoiding neighbor
alignments and for partial matchings avoiding neighbor alignments and left
nestings. We show that there is a bijection between partial matchings avoiding
three neighbor patterns (neighbor alignments, left nestings and right nestings)
and set partitions avoiding right nestings via an intermediate structure of
integer compositions. Such integer compositions are known to be in one-to-one
correspondence with self-modified ascent sequences or
$3\bar{1}52\bar{4}$-avoiding permutations, as shown by Bousquet-M\'elou,
Claesson, Dukes and Kitaev.
