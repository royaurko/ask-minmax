We investigate some properties of the entanglement of hypergraph states in
purely hypergraph theoretical terms. We first introduce an approach for
computing local entropic measure on qubit t of a hypergraph state by using the
Hamming weight of the so-called t-adjacent subhypergraph. Then we quantify and
characterize the entanglement of hypergraph states in terms of local entropic
measures obtained by using the above approach. Our results show that a class of
n-qubit hypergraph states can not be converted into any graph state under local
unitary transformations.
