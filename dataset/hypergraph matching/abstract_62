We show that the propositional model counting problem #SAT for CNF- formulas
with hypergraphs that allow a disjoint branches decomposition can be solved in
polynomial time. We show that this class of hypergraphs is incomparable to
hypergraphs of bounded incidence cliquewidth which were the biggest class of
hypergraphs for which #SAT was known to be solvable in polynomial time so far.
Furthermore, we present a polynomial time algorithm that computes a disjoint
branches decomposition of a given hypergraph if it exists and rejects
otherwise. Finally, we show that some slight extensions of the class of
hypergraphs with disjoint branches decompositions lead to intractable #SAT,
leaving open how to generalize the counting result of this paper.
