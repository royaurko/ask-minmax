Let V denote a set of N vertices. To construct a "hypergraph process", create
a new hyperedge at each event time of a Poisson process; the cardinality K of
this hyperedge is random, with arbitrary probability generating function r(x),
except that we assume P(K=1) +P(K=2) > 0. Given K=k, the k vertices appearing
in the new hyperedge are selected uniformly at random from V. Hyperedges of
cardinality 1 are called patches, and serve as a way of selecting root
vertices. Identifiable vertices are those which are reachable from these root
vertices, in a strong sense which generalizes the notion of graph component.
Hyperedges are also called identifiable if all of their vertices are
identifiable. We use "fluid limit" scaling: hyperedges arrive at rate N, and we
study structures of size O(1) and O(N). After division by N, numbers of
identifiable vertices and reducible hyperedges exhibit phase transitions, which
may be continuous or discontinuous depending on the shape of the structure
function -log(1 - x)/r'(x), for x in (0,1). Both the case P(K=1) > 0 and the
case P(K=1) = 0 < P(K=2) are considered; for the latter, a single extraneous
patch is added to mark the root vertex.
