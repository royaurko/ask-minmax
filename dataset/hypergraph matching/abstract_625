Let G be a bipartite graph with positive integer weights on the edges and
without isolated nodes. Let n, N and W be the node count, the largest edge
weight and the total weight of G. Let k(x,y) be log(x)/log(x^2/y). We present a
new decomposition theorem for maximum weight bipartite matchings and use it to
design an O(sqrt(n)W/k(n,W/N))-time algorithm for computing a maximum weight
matching of G. This algorithm bridges a long-standing gap between the best
known time complexity of computing a maximum weight matching and that of
computing a maximum cardinality matching. Given G and a maximum weight matching
of G, we can further compute the weight of a maximum weight matching of G-{u}
for all nodes u in O(W) time.
