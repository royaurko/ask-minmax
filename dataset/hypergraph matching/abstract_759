The generalization of quasi-phase-matching using polarization beating and of
multimode quasi-phase-matching (MMQPM) for the generation of high-order
harmonics is explored, and a method for achieving polarization beating is
proposed. If two (and in principle more) modes of a waveguide are excited,
modulation of the intensity, phase, and/or polarization of the guided radiation
will be achieved. By appropriately matching the period of this modulation to
the coherence length, quasi-phase-matching of high-order-harmonic radiation
generated by the guided wave can occur. We show that it is possible to achieve
efficiencies with multimode quasi-phase-matching greater than the ideal square
wave modulation. We present a Fourier treatment of QPM and use this to show
that phase modulation, rather than amplitude modulation, plays the dominant
role in the case of MMQPM. The experimental parameters and optimal conditions
for this scheme are explored.
