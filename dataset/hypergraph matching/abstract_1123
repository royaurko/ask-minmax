In this paper, we propose fusion of dynamic TOA (time of arrival) from
multiple non-coherent detectors like energy detectors operating at sub-Nyquist
rate through Kalman filtering. We also show that by using multiple of these
energy detectors, we can achieve the performance of a digital matched filter
implementation in the AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) setting. We derive
analytical expression for number of energy detectors needed to achieve the
matched filter performance. We demonstrate in simulation the validity of our
analytical approach. Results indicate that number of energy detectors needed
will be high at low SNRs and converge to a constant number as the SNR
increases. We also study the performance of the strategy proposed using IEEE
802.15.4a CM1 channel model and show in simulation that two sub-Nyquist
detectors are sufficient to match the performance of digital matched filter.
