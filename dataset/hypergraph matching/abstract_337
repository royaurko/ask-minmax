The expansion $G^+$ of a graph $G$ is the $3$-uniform hypergraph obtained
from $G$ by enlarging each edge of $G$ with a new vertex disjoint from $V(G)$
such that distinct edges are enlarged by distinct vertices. Let $ex_3(n,F)$
denote the maximum number of edges in a $3$-uniform hypergraph with $n$
vertices not containing any copy of a $3$-uniform hypergraph $F$. The study of
$ex_3(n,G^+)$ includes some well-researched problems, including the case that
$F$ consists of $k$ disjoint edges, $G$ is a triangle, $G$ is a path or cycle,
and $G$ is a tree. In this paper we initiate a broader study of the behavior of
$ex_3(n,G^+)$. Specifically, we show \[ ex_3(n,K_{s,t}^+) = \Theta(n^{3 -
3/s})\] whenever $t > (s - 1)!$ and $s \geq 3$. One of the main open problems
is to determine for which graphs $G$ the quantity $ex_3(n,G^+)$ is quadratic in
$n$. We show that this occurs when $G$ is any bipartite graph with Tur\'{a}n
number $o(n^{\varphi})$ where $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$, and in
particular, this shows $ex_3(n,Q^+) = \Theta(n^2)$ where $Q$ is the
three-dimensional cube graph.
