Let $G$ be an $r$-uniform hypergraph. When is it possible to orient the edges
of $G$ in such a way that every $p$-set of vertices has some $p$-degree equal
to $0$? (The $p$-degrees generalise for sets of vertices what in-degree and
out-degree are for single vertices in directed graphs.) Caro and Hansberg asked
if the obvious Hall-type necessary condition is also sufficient.
  Our main aim is to show that this is true for $r$ large (for given $p$), but
false in general. Our counterexample is based on a new technique in sparse
Ramsey theory that may be of independent interest.
