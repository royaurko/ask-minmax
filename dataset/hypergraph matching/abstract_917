We give upper bounds for the number $\Phi_\ell(G)$ of matchings of size
$\ell$ in (i) bipartite graphs $G=(X\cup Y, E)$ with specified degrees $d_x$
($x\in X$), and (ii) general graphs $G=(V,E)$ with all degrees specified. In
particular, for $d$-regular, $N$-vertex graphs, our bound is best possible up
to an error factor of the form $\exp[o_d(1)N]$, where $o_d(1) \rightarrow 0$ as
$d \rightarrow \infty$. This represents the best progress to date on the "Upper
Matching Conjecture" of Friedland, Krop, Lundow and Markstr\"om. Some further
possibilities are also suggested.
