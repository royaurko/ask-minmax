We present a new framework for computing resummed and matched distributions
in processes with many hard QCD jets. The intricate color structure of soft
gluon emission at large angles renders resummed calculations highly non-trivial
in this case. We automate all ingredients necessary for the color evolution of
the soft function at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy, namely the selection
of the color bases and the projections of color operators and Born amplitudes
onto those bases. Explicit results for all QCD processes with up to $2\to 5$
partons are given. We also devise a new tree-level matching scheme for resummed
calculations which exploits a quasi-local subtraction based on the
Catani-Seymour dipole formalism. We implement both resummation and matching in
the Sherpa event generator. As a proof of concept, we compute the resummed and
matched transverse-thrust distribution for hadronic collisions.
