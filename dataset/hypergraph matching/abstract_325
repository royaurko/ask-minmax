Let K_4^3-2e denote the hypergraph consisting of two triples on four points.
For an integer n, let t(n, K_4^3-2e) denote the smallest integer d so that
every 3-uniform hypergraph G of order n with minimum pair-degree \delta_2(G)
\geq d contains \floor{n/4} vertex-disjoint copies of K_4^3-2e. K\"uhn and
Osthus proved that t(n, K_4^3-2e) = (1 + o(1))n/4 holds for large integers n.
Here, we prove the exact counterpart, that for all sufficiently large integers
n divisible by 4, t(n, K_4^3-2e) = n/4 when n/4 is odd, and t(n, K_4^3-2e) =
n/4+1 when n/4 is even.
  A main ingredient in our proof is the recent `absorption technique' of
R\"odl, Ruci\'nski and Szemer\'edi.
