A hypergraph G with n vertices and m hyperedges with d endpoints each is
(k,l)-sparse if for all sub-hypergraphs G' on n' vertices and m' edges, m'\le
kn'-l. For integers k and l satisfying 0\le l\le dk-1, this is known to be a
linearly representable matroidal family.
  Motivated by problems in rigidity theory, we give a new linear representation
theorem for the (k,l)-sparse hypergraphs that is natural; i.e., the
representing matrix captures the vertex-edge incidence structure of the
underlying hypergraph G.
