Let $\mc{K}_{3,3}^3$ be the 3-graph with 15 vertices $\{x_i, y_i: 1 \le i \le
3\}$ and $\{z_{ij}: 1 \le i,j \le 3\}$, and 11 edges $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$,
$\{y_1, y_2, y_3\}$ and $\{\{x_i, y_j, z_{ij}\}: 1 \le i,j \le 3\}$. We show
that for large $n$, the unique largest $\mc{K}_{3,3}^3$-free 3-graph on $n$
vertices is a balanced blow-up of the complete 3-graph on 5 vertices. Our proof
uses the stability method and a result on lagrangians of intersecting families
that has independent interest.
