By applying Seifert's algorithm to a special alternating diagram of a link L,
one obtains a Seifert surface F of L. We show that the support of the sutured
Floer homology of the sutured manifold complementary to F is affine isomorphic
to the set of lattice points given as hypertrees in a certain hypergraph that
is naturally associated to the diagram. This implies that the Floer groups in
question are supported in a set of Spin^c structures that are the integer
lattice points of a convex polytope. This property has an immediate extension
to Seifert surfaces arising from homogeneous link diagrams (including all
alternating and positive diagrams).
  In another direction, together with work in progress of the second contributor and
others, our correspondence suggests a method for computing the "top"
coefficients of the HOMFLY polynomial of a special alternating link from the
sutured Floer homology of a Seifert surface complement for a certain dual link.
