We consider stable three-dimensional matchings of three categories of agents,
such as women, men and dogs. This was suggested long ago by Knuth (1976), but
very little seems to have been published on this problem. Based on computer
experiments, we present a couple of conjectures as well as a few
counter-examples to other natural but discarded conjectures. In particular, a
circular 3D matching is one where women only care about the man, men only care
about the dog, and dogs only care about the woman they are matched with. We
conjecture that a stable outcome always exists for any circular 3D matching
market, and we prove it for markets with at most four agents of each category.
