We show that, for a natural notion of quasirandomness in $k$-uniform
hypergraphs, any quasirandom $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with
constant edge density and minimum vertex degree $\Omega(n^{k-1})$ contains a
loose Hamilton cycle. We also give a construction to show that a $k$-uniform
hypergraph satisfying these conditions need not contain a Hamilton $\ell$-cycle
if $k-\ell$ divides $k$. The remaining values of $\ell$ form an interesting
open question.
