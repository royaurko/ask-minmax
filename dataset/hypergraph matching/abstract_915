We establish a central limit theorem for the log-determinant
$\log|\det(M_n)|$ of a Wigner matrix $M_n$, under the assumption of four
matching moments with either the GUE or GOE ensemble. More specifically, we
show that this log-determinant is asymptotically distributed like $N(\log
\sqrt{n!} - 1/2 \log n, 1/2 \log n)_\R$ when one matches moments with GUE, and
$N(\log \sqrt{n!} - 1/4 \log n, 1/4 \log n)_\R$ when one matches moments with
GOE.
