The slow-rotation approximation of Hartle is developed to a setting where a
charged rotating fluid is present. The linearized Einstein-Maxwell equations
are solved on the background of the Reissner-Nordstrom space-time in the
exterior electrovacuum region. The theory is put to action for the charged
generalization of the Wahlquist solution found by Garcia. The Garcia solution
is transformed to coordinates suitable for the matching and expanded in powers
of the angular velocity. The two domains are then matched along the zero
pressure surface using the Darmois-Israel procedure. We prove a theorem to the
effect that the exterior region is asymptotically flat if and only if the
parameter C_{2}, characterizing the magnitude of an external magnetic field,
vanishes. We obtain the form of the constant C_{2} for the Garcia solution. We
conjecture that the Garcia metric cannot be matched to an asymptotically flat
exterior electrovacuum region even to first order in the angular velocity. This
conjecture is supported by a high precision numerical analysis.
