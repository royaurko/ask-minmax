This paper introduces a statistical method to decide whether two blocks in a
pair of of images match reliably. The method ensures that the selected block
matches are unlikely to have occurred "just by chance." The new approach is
based on the definition of a simple but faithful statistical "background model"
for image blocks learned from the image itself. A theorem guarantees that under
this model not more than a fixed number of wrong matches occurs (on average)
for the whole image. This fixed number (the number of false alarms) is the only
method parameter. Furthermore, the number of false alarms associated with each
match measures its reliability. This "a contrario" block-matching method,
however, cannot rule out false matches due to the presence of periodic objects
in the images. But it is successfully complemented by a parameterless
"self-similarity threshold." Experimental evidence shows that the proposed
method also detects occlusions and incoherent motions due to vehicles and
pedestrians in non simultaneous stereo.
