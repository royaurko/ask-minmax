We exhibit a nonrelativistic ideal gas with a Kaluza-Klein tower of species,
featuring a singular behavior of thermodynamic functions at zero chemical
potential. In this way, we provide a qualitative match to the thermodynamics of
recently found black holes in backgrounds with asymptotic nonrelativistic
conformal symmetry.
