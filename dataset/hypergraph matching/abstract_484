In this paper, we propose a novel partition reservation system to study the
partition information and its transmission over a noise-free Boolean
multi-access channel. The objective of transmission is not message restoration,
but to partition active users into distinct groups so that they can,
subsequently, transmit their messages without collision. We first calculate (by
mutual information) the amount of information needed for the partitioning
without channel effects, and then propose two different coding schemes to
obtain achievable transmission rates over the channel. The first one is the
brute force method, where the codebook design is based on centralized source
coding; the second method uses random coding where the codebook is generated
randomly and optimal Bayesian decoding is employed to reconstruct the
partition. Both methods shed light on the internal structure of the partition
problem. A novel hypergraph formulation is proposed for the random coding
scheme, which intuitively describes the information in terms of a strong
coloring of a hypergraph induced by a sequence of channel operations and
interactions between active users. An extended Fibonacci structure is found for
a simple, but non-trivial, case with two active users. A comparison between
these methods and group testing is conducted to demonstrate the uniqueness of
our problem.
