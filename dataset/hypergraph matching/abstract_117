Let F be an r-uniform hypergraph. The chromatic threshold of the family of
F-free, r-uniform hypergraphs is the infimum of all non-negative reals c such
that the subfamily of F-free, r-uniform hypergraphs H with minimum degree at
least $c \binom{|V(H)|}{r-1}$ has bounded chromatic number. The study of
chromatic thresholds of various graphs has a long history, beginning with the
early work of Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits. One interesting question, first proposed by
\L{}uczak-Thomass\'{e} and then solved by
Allen-B\"{o}ttcher-Griffiths-Kohayakawa-Morris, is the characterization of
graphs having zero chromatic threshold, in particular the fact that there are
graphs with non-zero Tur\'{a}n density that have zero chromatic threshold. In
this paper, we make progress on this problem for r-uniform hypergraphs, showing
that a large class of hypergraphs have zero chromatic threshold in addition to
exhibiting a family of constructions showing another large class of hypergraphs
have non-zero chromatic threshold. Our construction is based on a special
product of the Bollob\'as-Erd\H{o}s graph defined earlier by the contributors.
