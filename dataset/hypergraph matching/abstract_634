Scoring goals in a soccer match can be interpreted as a stochastic process.
In the most simple description of a soccer match one assumes that scoring goals
can be described by a constant goal rate for each team, implying simple
Poissonian and Markovian behavior. Here a general framework for the
identification of deviations from this behavior is presented. For this endeavor
it is essential to formulate an a priori estimate of the expected number of
goals per team in a specific match. The analysis scheme is applied to
approximately 40 seasons of the German Bundesliga. It is possible to
characterize the impact of the previous course of the match on the present
match behavior. This allows one to identify interesting generic features about
soccer matches and thus to learn about the hidden complexities behind scoring
goals.
