Toward a partial classification of monomial ideals with $d$-linear
resolution, in this paper, some classes of $d$-uniform clutters which do not
have linear resolution, but every proper subclutter of them has a $d$-linear
resolution, are introduced and the regularity and Betti numbers of circuit
ideals of such clutters are computed. Also, it is proved that for given two
$d$-uniform clutters $\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2$, the Castelnuovo-Mumford
regularity of the ideal $I(\bar{\mathcal{C}_1 \cup \mathcal{C}_2})$ is equal to
the maximum of regularities of $I(\bar{\C}_1)$ and $I(\bar{\C}_2)$, whenever
$V(\mathcal{C}_1) \cap V(\mathcal{C}_2)$ is a clique or ${\rm
SC}(\mathcal{C}_1) \cap {\rm SC}(\mathcal{C}_2)=\emptyset$.
  As applications, alternative proofs are given for Fr\"oberg's Theorem on
linearity of edge ideal of graphs with chordal complement as well as for
linearity of generalized chordal hypergraphs defined by Emtander. Finally, we
find minimal free resolutions of the circuit ideal of a triangulation of a
pseudo-manifold and a homology manifold explicitly.
