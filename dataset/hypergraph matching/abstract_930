Integrating nano-scale objects, such as single molecules or carbon nanotubes,
into impedance transformers and performing radio-frequency measurements allows
for high time-resolution transport measurements with improved signal-to-noise
ratios. The realization of such transformers implemented with superconducting
transmission lines for the 2-10 GHz frequency range is presented here.
Controlled electromigration of an integrated gold break junction is used to
characterize a 6 GHz impedance matching device. The real part of the RF
impedance of the break junction extracted from microwave reflectometry at a
maximum bandwidth of 45 MHz of the matching circuit is in good agreement with
the measured direct current resistance.
