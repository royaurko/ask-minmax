This note is expository and is accessible to students who know basic geometry
of three-dimensional space and who are ready to learn straightforward
generalizations to four-dimensional space. We present short elementary proofs
of Conway-Gordon-Sachs Theorem on graphs in three-dimensional space, as well as
van Kampen-Flores' and Ummel's theorems on nonrealizability of certain
hypergraphs in four-dimensional space. The proofs use a reduction to lower
dimensions. Such a reduction exhibits relation between these results and allows
higher-dimensional generalization. We use the elementary language of
collections of points, so we do not need the formal notion of hypergraph.
