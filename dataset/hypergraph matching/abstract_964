Exact String Matching is an essential issue in many computer science
applications. Unfortunately, the performance of Exact String Matching
algorithms, namely, executing time, does not address the needs of these
applications. This paper proposes a general platform for improving the existing
Exact String Matching algorithms executing time, called the PXSMAlg platform.
The function of this platform is to parallelize the Exact String Matching
algorithms using the MPI model over the Master or Slaves paradigms. The PXSMAlg
platform parallelization process is done by dividing the Text into several
parts and working on these parts simultaneously. This improves the executing
time of the Exact String Matching algorithms. We have simulated the PXSMAlg
platform in order to show its competence, through applying the Quick Search
algorithm on the PXSMAlg platform. The simulation result showed significant
improvement in the Quick Search executing time, and therefore extreme
competence in the PXSMAlg platform.
