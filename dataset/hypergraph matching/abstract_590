Suppose that red and blue points occur as independent homogeneous Poisson
processes in R^d. We investigate translation-invariant schemes for perfectly
matching the red points to the blue points. For any such scheme in dimensions
d=1,2, the matching distance X from a typical point to its partner must have
infinite d/2-th moment, while in dimensions d>=3 there exist schemes where X
has finite exponential moments. The Gale-Shapley stable marriage is one natural
matching scheme, obtained by iteratively matching mutually closest pairs. A
principal result of this paper is a power law upper bound on the matching
distance X for this scheme. A power law lower bound holds also. In particular,
stable marriage is close to optimal (in tail behavior) in d=1, but far from
optimal in d>=3. For the problem of matching Poisson points of a single color
to each other, in d=1 there exist schemes where X has finite exponential
moments, but if we insist that the matching is a deterministic factor of the
point process then X must have infinite mean.
