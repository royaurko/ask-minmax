Large amplitude kinetic Alfv\'{e}non (exact Alfv\'{e}n soliton) matching
condition is investigated in quasineutral electron-ion and
electron-positron-ion plasmas immersed in a uniform magnetic field. Using the
standard pseudopotential method, the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations are
exactly solved and a global allowed matching condition for propagation of
kinetic solitary waves is derived. It is remarked that, depending on the plasma
parameters, the kinetic solitons can be sub- or super-Alfv\'{e}nic, in general.
It is further revealed that, either upper or lower soliton speed-limit is
independent of fractional plasma parameters. Furthermore, the soliton
propagation angle with respect to that of the uniform magnetic field is found
to play a fundamental role in controlling the soliton matching speed-range.
