We define a general product of two $n$-dimensional tensors $\mathbb {A}$ and
$\mathbb {B}$ with orders $m\ge 2$ and $k\ge 1$, respectively. This product is
a generalization of the usual matrix product, and satisfies the associative
law. Using this product, many concepts and known results of tensors can be
simply expressed and/or proved, and a number of applications of this product
will be given. Using this tensor product and some properties on the resultant
of a system of homogeneous equations on $n$ variables, we define the similarity
and congruence of tensors (which are also the generalizations of the
corresponding relations for matrices), and prove that similar tensors have the
same characteristic polynomials. We study two special kinds of similarity:
permutational similarity and diagonal similarity, and their applications in the
study of the spectra of hypergraphs and nonnegative irreducible tensors. We
define the direct product of tensors (in matrix case it is also called the
Kronecker product), and give its applications in the study of the spectra of
two kinds of the products of hypergraphs. We also give applications of this
tensor product in the study of nonnegative tensors, including a
characterization of primitive tensors, the upper bounds of primitive degrees
and the cyclic indices of some nonnegative irreducible tensors.
