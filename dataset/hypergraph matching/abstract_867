One-loop matching of heavy-light currents is carried out for a highly
improved lattice action, including the effects of dimension 4 O(1/M) and O(a)
operators. We use the NRQCD action for heavy quarks, the Asqtad improved naive
action for light quarks, and the Symanzik improved glue action. As part of the
matching procedure we also present results for the NRQCD self energy and for
massless Asqtad quark wavefunction renormalization with improved glue.
