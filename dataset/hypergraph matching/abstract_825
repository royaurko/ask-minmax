Recommendation systems for online dating have recently attracted much
attention from the research community. In this paper we proposed a two-side
matching framework for online dating recommendations and design an LDA model to
learn the user preferences from the observed user messaging behavior and user
profile features. Experimental results using data from a large online dating
website shows that two-sided matching improves significantly the rate of
successful matches by as much as 45%. Finally, using simulated matchings we
show that the the LDA model can correctly capture user preferences.
