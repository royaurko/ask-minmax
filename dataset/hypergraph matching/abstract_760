This paper concerns the analysis of the Shapley value in matching games.
Matching games constitute a fundamental class of cooperative games which help
understand and model auctions and assignments. In a matching game, the value of
a coalition of vertices is the weight of the maximum size matching in the
subgraph induced by the coalition. The Shapley value is one of the most
important solution concepts in cooperative game theory.
  After establishing some general insights, we show that the Shapley value of
matching games can be computed in polynomial time for some special cases:
graphs with maximum degree two, and graphs that have a small modular
decomposition into cliques or cocliques (complete k-partite graphs are a
notable special case of this). The latter result extends to various other
well-known classes of graph-based cooperative games.
  We continue by showing that computing the Shapley value of unweighted
matching games is #P-complete in general. Finally, a fully polynomial-time
randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) is presented. This FPRAS can be
considered the best positive result conceivable, in view of the #P-completeness
result.
