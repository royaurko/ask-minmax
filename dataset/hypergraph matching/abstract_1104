Greed is good. However, the tighter you squeeze, the less you have. In this
paper, a less greedy algorithm for sparse signal reconstruction in compressive
sensing, named orthogonal matching pursuit with thresholding is studied. Using
the global 2-coherence , which provides a "bridge" between the well known
mutual coherence and the restricted isometry constant, the performance of
orthogonal matching pursuit with thresholding is analyzed and more general
results for sparse signal reconstruction are obtained. It is also shown that
given the same assumption on the coherence index and the restricted isometry
constant as required for orthogonal matching pursuit, the thresholding
variation gives exactly the same reconstruction performance with significantly
less complexity.
