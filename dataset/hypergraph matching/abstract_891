We construct a regularization for light-like polygonal Wilson loops in ${\cal
N}=4$ SYM, which matches them to the off-shell MHV gluon scattering amplitudes.
Explicit calculations are performed for the 1-loop four gluon case. The off
light cone extrapolation has to be based on the local supersymmetric Wilson
loop. The observed matching concerns Feynman gauge. Furthermore, the leading
infrared divergent term is shown to be gauge parameter independent on 1-loop
level.
