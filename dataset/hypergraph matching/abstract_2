A perfect matching in a 4-uniform hypergraph is a subset of
$\lfloor\frac{n}{4}\rfloor$ disjoint edges. We prove that if $H$ is a
sufficiently large 4-uniform hypergraph on $n=4k$ vertices such that every
vertex belongs to more than ${n-1\choose 3} - {3n/4 \choose 3}$ edges then $H$
contains a perfect matching. This bound is tight and settles a conjecture of
H{\'a}n, Person and Schacht.
