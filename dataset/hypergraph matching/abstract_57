In this paper, we introduce the class of cored hypergraphs and power
hypergraphs, and investigate the properties of their Laplacian H-eigenvalues.
From an ordinary graph, one may generate a $k$-uniform hypergraph, called the
$k$th power hypergraph of that graph. Power hypergraphs are cored hypergraphs,
but not vice versa. Hyperstars, hypercycles, hyperpaths are special cases of
power hypergraphs, while sunflowers are a subclass of cored hypergraphs, but
not power graphs in general. We show that the largest Laplacian H-eigenvalue of
an even-uniform cored hypergraph is equal to its largest signless Laplacian
H-eigenvalue. Especially, we find out these largest H-eigenvalues for
even-uniform sunflowers. Moreover, we show that the largest Laplacian
H-eigenvalue of an odd-uniform sunflower, hypercycle and hyperpath is equal to
the maximum degree, i.e., 2. We also compute out the H-spectra of the class of
hyperstars. When $k$ is odd, the H-spectra of the hypercycle of size 3 and the
hyperpath of length 3 are characterized as well.
