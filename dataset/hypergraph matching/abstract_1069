We put forward a new approach to generate stable, fully three-dimensional
light bullets, which is based on the matching of the intrinsic material
dispersion with a suitable effective diffraction. The matching is achieved in
adequate waveguide arrays whose refractive index is periodically modulated
along the direction of light propagation. We show that by using
non-conventional, out-of-phase longitudinal modulation of the refractive index
of neighboring channels, it is possible to tune the effective diffraction to
match the intrinsic material group velocity dispersion. Three-dimensional light
bullets are shown to form at reduced energy levels, in settings where the
dispersion would be far too weak to generate bullets in the absence of array.
