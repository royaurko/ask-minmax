We derive one-loop matching condition for non-singlet quark distributions in
transverse-momentum cut-off scheme, including unpolarized, helicity and
transversity distributions. The matching is between the quasi-distribution
defined by static correlation at finite nucleon momentum and the light-cone
distribution measurable in experiments. The result is useful for extracting the
latter from the former in a lattice QCD calculation.
