One of the most annoying aspects in the formalization of mathematics is the
need of transforming notions to match a given, existing result. This kind of
transformations, often based on a conspicuous background knowledge in the given
scientific domain (mostly expressed in the form of equalities or isomorphisms),
are usually implicit in the mathematical discourse, and it would be highly
desirable to obtain a similar behavior in interactive provers. The paper
describes the superposition-based implementation of this feature inside the
Matita interactive theorem prover, focusing in particular on the so called
smart application tactic, supporting smart matching between a goal and a given
result.
