The evaluation mechanism of pattern matching with dynamic patterns is
modelled in the Pure Pattern Calculus by one single meta-rule. This
contribution presents a refinement which narrows the gap between the abstract
calculus and its implementation. A calculus is designed to allow reasoning on
matching algorithms. The new calculus is proved to be confluent, and to
simulate the original Pure Pattern Calculus. A family of new, matching-driven,
reduction strategies is proposed.
