The axial-vector coupling $g_A$ of a constituent quark is estimated from
matching the constituent quark model to the operator product expansion in QCD
in the limit of large number of colours under some assumptions. The obtained
relation is $g_A\simeq\sqrt{7/11}\approx0.80$, which is in agreement with the
existing model estimates.
