We present a systematic approach to the prediction of soccer matches. First,
we show that the information about chances for goals is by far more informative
than about the actual results. Second, we present a multivariate regression
approach and show how the prediction quality increases with increasing
information content. This prediction quality can be explicitly expressed in
terms of just two parameters. Third, by disentangling the systematic and random
components of soccer matches we can identify the optimum level of
predictability. These concepts are exemplified for the German Bundesliga.
