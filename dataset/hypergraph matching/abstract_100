The focus of this article is to develop computationally efficient
mathematical morphology operators on hypergraphs. To this aim we consider
lattice structures on hypergraphs on which we build morphological operators. We
develop a pair of dual adjunctions between the vertex set and the hyper edge
set of a hypergraph H, by defining a vertex-hyperedge correspondence. This
allows us to recover the classical notion of a dilation/erosion of a subset of
vertices and to extend it to subhypergraphs of H. Afterward, we propose several
new openings, closings, granulometries and alternate sequential filters acting
(i) on the subsets of the vertex and hyperedge set of H and (ii) on the
subhypergraphs of a hypergraph.
