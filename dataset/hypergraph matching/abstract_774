In this article we study the stable marriage game induced by the
men-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm. Our setting is standard: all the lists
are complete and the matching mechanism is the men-proposing Gale-Shapley
algorithm. It is well known that in this setting, men cannot cheat, but women
can. In fact, Teo, Sethuraman and Tan \cite{TST01}, show that there is a
polynomial time algorithm to obtain, for a given strategy (the set of all
lists) $Q$ and a woman $w$, the best partner attainable by changing her list.
However, what if the resulting matching is not stable with respect to $Q$?
Obviously, such a matching would be vulnerable to further manipulation, but is
not mentioned in \cite{TST01}. In this paper, we consider (safe) manipulation
that implies a stable matching in a most general setting. Specifically, our
goal is to decide for a given $Q$, if w can manipulate her list to obtain a
strictly better partner with respect to the true strategy $P$ (which may be
different from $Q$), and also the outcome is a stable matching for $P$.
