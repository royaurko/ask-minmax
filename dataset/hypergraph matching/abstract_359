For a finite set $X$ of points in the plane, a set $S$ in the plane, and a
positive integer $k$, we say that a $k$-element subset $Y$ of $X$ is captured
by $S$ if there is a homothetic copy $S'$ of $S$ such that $X\cap S' = Y$,
i.e., $S'$ contains exactly $k$ elements from $X$. A $k$-uniform $S$-capturing
hypergraph $H = H(X,S,k)$ has a vertex set $X$ and a hyperedge set consisting
of all $k$-element subsets of $X$ captured by $S$. In case when $k=2$ and $S$
is convex these graphs are planar graphs, known as convex distance function
Delaunay graphs.
  In this paper we prove that for any $k\geq 2$, any $X$, and any convex
compact set $S$, the number of hyperedges in $H(X,S,k)$ is at most $(2k-1)|X| -
k^2 + 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}a_i$, where $a_i$ is the number of $i$-element
subsets of $X$ that can be separated from the rest of $X$ with a straight line.
In particular, this bound is independent of $S$ and indeed the bound is tight
for all "round" sets $S$ and point sets $X$ in general position with respect to
$S$.
  This refines a general result of Buzaglo, Pinchasi and Rote stating that
every pseudodisc topological hypergraph with vertex set $X$ has $O(k^2|X|)$
hyperedges of size $k$ or less.
