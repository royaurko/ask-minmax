We study whether, in the pi-calculus, the match prefix-a conditional operator
testing two names for (syntactic) equality-is expressible via the other
operators. Previously, Carbone and Maffeis proved that matching is not
expressible this way under rather strong requirements (preservation and
reflection of observables). Later on, Gorla developed a by now widely-tested
set of criteria for encodings that allows much more freedom (e.g. instead of
direct translations of observables it allows comparison of calculi with respect
to reachability of successful states). In this paper, we offer a considerably
stronger separation result on the non-expressibility of matching using only
Gorla's relaxed requirements.
