In [6] G. Y. Katona and P. G. N. Szab\'o introduced a new natural definition
of hypertrees in $k$-uniform hypergraphs and gave lower and upper bounds on the
number of edges. They also defined edge-minimal, edge-maximal and
$l$-hypertrees and proved an upper bound on the edge-number of $l$-hypertrees.
In the present paper, we verify the sharpness of the $\binom{n}{k-1}$ upper
bound for the number of edges of $k$-uniform hypertrees given in [6]. We also
make an improvement on the upper bound of the edge-number of $2$-hypertrees and
give a general construction with its consequences. We give lower and upper
bounds on the maximal number of edges in $k$-uniform edge-minimal hypertrees
and a lower bound on the number of edges in $k$-uniform edge-maximal
hypertrees. In the first case, the sharp upper bound is conjectured to be
asymptotically $\frac{1}{k-1}\binom{n}{2}$.
