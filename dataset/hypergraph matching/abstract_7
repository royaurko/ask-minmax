More than forty years ago, Erd\H{o}s conjectured that for any T <= N/K, every
K-uniform hypergraph on N vertices without T disjoint edges has at most
max{\binom{KT-1}{K}, \binom{N}{K} - \binom{N-T+1}{K}} edges. Although this
appears to be a basic instance of the hypergraph Tur\'an problem (with a T-edge
matching as the excluded hypergraph), progress on this question has remained
elusive. In this paper, we verify this conjecture for all T < N/(3K^2). This
improves upon the best previously known range T = O(N/K^3), which dates back to
the 1970's.
