Intrinsic isometric shape matching has become the standard approach for pose
invariant correspondence estimation among deformable shapes. Most existing
approaches assume global consistency, i.e., the metric structure of the whole
manifold must not change significantly. While global isometric matching is well
understood, only a few heuristic solutions are known for partial matching.
Partial matching is particularly important for robustness to topological noise
(incomplete data and contacts), which is a common problem in real-world 3D
scanner data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to partial, intrinsic
isometric matching. Our method is based on the observation that isometries are
fully determined by purely local information: a map of a single point and its
tangent space fixes an isometry for both global and the partial maps. From this
idea, we develop a new representation for partial isometric maps based on
equivalence classes of correspondences between pairs of points and their
tangent spaces. From this, we derive a local propagation algorithm that find
such mappings efficiently. In contrast to previous heuristics based on RANSAC
or expectation maximization, our method is based on a simple and sound
theoretical model and fully deterministic. We apply our approach to register
partial point clouds and compare it to the state-of-the-art methods, where we
obtain significant improvements over global methods for real-world data and
stronger guarantees than previous heuristic partial matching algorithms.
