Since Tinhofer proposed the MinGreedy algorithm for maximum cardinality
matching in 1984, several experimental studies found the randomized algorithm
to perform excellently for various classes of random graphs and benchmark
instances. In contrast, only few analytical results are known. We show that
MinGreedy cannot improve on the trivial approximation ratio 1/2 whp., even for
bipartite graphs. Our hard inputs seem to require a small number of high-degree
nodes.
  This motivates an investigation of greedy algorithms on graphs with maximum
degree D: We show that MinGreedy achieves a (D-1)/(2D-3)-approximation for
graphs with D=3 and for D-regular graphs, and a guarantee of (D-1/2)/(2D-2) for
graphs with maximum degree D. Interestingly, our bounds even hold for the
deterministic MinGreedy that breaks all ties arbitrarily.
  Moreover, we investigate the limitations of the greedy paradigm, using the
model of priority algorithms introduced by Borodin, Nielsen, and Rackoff. We
study deterministic priority algorithms and prove a
(D-1)/(2D-3)-inapproximability result for graphs with maximum degree D; thus,
these greedy algorithms do not achieve a 1/2+eps-approximation and in
particular the 2/3-approximation obtained by the deterministic MinGreedy for
D=3 is optimal in this class. For k-uniform hypergraphs we show a tight
1/k-inapproximability bound. We also study fully randomized priority algorithms
and give a 5/6-inapproximability bound. Thus, they cannot compete with matching
algorithms of other paradigms.
