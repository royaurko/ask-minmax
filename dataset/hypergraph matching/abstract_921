We present a family of complete acyclic Morse matchings on the face lattice
of a hypersimplex. Since a hypersimplex is a convex polytope, there is a
natural way to form a CW complex from its faces. In a future paper we will
utilize these matchings to classify every subcomplex whose reduced homology
groups are concentrated in a single degree and describe a homology basis for
each of them.
