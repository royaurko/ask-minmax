We study the thermodynamic properties of spin systems with bond-disorder on
small-world hypergraphs, obtained by superimposing a one-dimensional Ising
chain onto a random Bethe graph with p-spin interactions. Using transfer-matrix
techniques, we derive fixed-point equations describing the relevant order
parameters and the free energy, both in the replica symmetric and one step
replica symmetry breaking approximation. We determine the static and dynamic
ferromagnetic transition and the spinglass transition within replica symmetry
for all temperatures, and demonstrate corrections to these results when one
step replica symmetry breaking is taken into account. The results obtained are
in agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations.
