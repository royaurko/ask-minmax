Cartesian products of graphs have been studied extensively since the 1960s.
They make it possible to decrease the algorithmic complexity of problems by
using the factorization of the product. Hypergraphs were introduced as a
generalization of graphs and the definition of Cartesian products extends
naturally to them. In this paper, we give new properties and algorithms
concerning coloring aspects of Cartesian products of hypergraphs. We also
extend a classical prime factorization algorithm initially designed for graphs
to connected conformal hypergraphs using 2-sections of hypergraphs.
