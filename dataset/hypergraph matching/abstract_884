Two-mode nonlinear interaction (second-harmonic and second-subharmonic
generation) in a planar waveguide with a small periodic corrugation at the
surface is studied. Scattering of the interacting fields on the corrugation
leads to constructive interference that enhances the nonlinear process provided
that all the interactions are phase matched. Conditions for the overall phase
matching are found. Compared with a perfectly quasi-phase-matched waveguide,
better values of squeezing as well as higher intensities are reached under
these conditions. Procedure for finding optimum values of parameters for
squeezed-light generation is described.
