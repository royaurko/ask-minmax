Circulant tensors naturally arise from stochastic process and spectral
hypergraph theory. The joint moments of stochastic processes are symmetric
circulant tensors. The adjacency, Laplacian and signless Laplacian tensors of
circulant hypergraphs are also symmetric circulant tensors. The adjacency,
Laplacian and signless Laplacian tensors of directed circulant hypergraphs are
circulant tensors, but they are not symmetric in general. In this paper, we
study spectral properties of circulant tensors and their applications in
spectral hypergraph theory and stochastic process. We show that in certain
cases, the largest H-eigenvalue of a circulant tensor can be explicitly
identified. In particular, the largest H-eigenvalue of a nonnegative circulant
tensor can be explicitly identified. This confirms the results in circulant
hypergraphs and directed circulant hypergraphs. We prove that an even order
circulant B$_0$ tensor is always positive semi-definite. This shows that the
Laplacian tensor and the signless Laplacian tensor of a directed circulant
even-uniform hypergraph are positive semi-definite. If a stochastic process is
$m$th order stationary, where $m$ is even, then its $m$th order moment, which
is a circulant tensor, must be positive semi-definite. In this paper, we give
various conditions for a circulant tensor to be positive semi-definite.
