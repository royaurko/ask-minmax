We investigate the properties of spacetimes resulting from matching together
exact solutions using the Darmois matching conditions. In particular we focus
on the asymptotically velocity term dominated property (AVTD). We propose a
criterion that can be used to test if a spacetime constructed from a matching
can be considered AVTD. Using the Cheese Slice universe as an example, we show
that a spacetime constructed from a such a matching can inherit the AVTD
property from the original spacetimes. Furthermore the singularity resulting
from this particular matching is an AVTD singularity.
