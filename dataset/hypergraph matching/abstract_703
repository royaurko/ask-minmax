Reduction rules in interaction nets are constrained to pattern match exactly
one argument at a time. Consequently, a programmer has to introduce auxiliary
rules to perform more sophisticated matches. In this paper, we describe the
design and implementation of a system for interaction nets which allows nested
pattern matching on interaction rules. We achieve a system that provides
convenient ways to express interaction net programs without defining auxiliary
rules.
