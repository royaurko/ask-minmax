The purpose of this paper is to introduce a cohomology theory for abelian
matched pairs of Hopf algebras and to explore its relationship to Sweedler
cohomology, to Singer cohomology and to extension theory. An exact sequence
connecting these cohomology theories is obtained for a general abelian matched
pair of Hopf algebras, generalizing those of Kac and Masuoka for matched pairs
of finite groups and finite dimensional Lie algebras. The morphisms in the low
degree part of this sequence are given explicitly, enabling concrete
computations.
