We investigate the famous conjecture by Erd\H os-Simonovits and Sidorenko
using information theory. Our method gives a unified treatment for all known
cases of the conjecture and it implies various new results as well. Our
topological type conditions allow us to extend Sidorenko's conjecture to large
families of $k$-uniform hypergraphs. This is somewhat unexpected since the
conjecture fails for $k$ uniform hypergraphs in general.
