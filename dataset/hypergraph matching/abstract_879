A stronger version of an anomaly matching theorem (AMT) is proven that allows
to anticipate the matching of continuous as well as discrete global anomalies.
The AMT shows a connection between anomaly matching and the geometry of the
null cone of SYM theories. Discrete symmetries are shown to be broken at the
origin of the moduli space in Seiberg-Witten theories.
