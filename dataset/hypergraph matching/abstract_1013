The purpose of this paper is to prove that every finite set of points that
can be constructed in the Euclidean plane by using a compass and a ruler can
also be constructed by using unitary match-sticks in a non-simultaneous way and
following to a certain set of postulates. To prove this, we will deduce the
Euclidean axioms for our defined set of axioms.
