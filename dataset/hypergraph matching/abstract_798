A fingerprint matching is a very difficult problem. Minutiae based matching
is the most popular and widely used technique for fingerprint matching. The
minutiae points considered in automatic identification systems are based
normally on termination and bifurcation points. In this paper we propose a new
technique for fingerprint matching using minutiae points and genetic
programming. The goal of this paper is extracting the mathematical formula that
defines the minutiae points.
