The Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) has a FODO lattice and Drift-Tube-Linacs
(DTL) in general also have FODO lattices. Therefore the natural solution for
the matching between these is a FODO lattice. For matching in all three planes
one then needs sixteen degrees of freedom. However, different requirements,
depending on the applications, may change this solution. For example, in the
production environment (like medical and industrial applications), one needs
fixed current and fixed beam quality. On the other hand, in the research
environment one not only needs all degrees of freedom, but may also want to
chop of beam pulse. This paper discusses matching solutions for these different
requirements.
