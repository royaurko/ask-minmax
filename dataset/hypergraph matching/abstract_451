Ramsey, Erdos-Rado, and Conlon-Fox-Sudakov have given proofs of the
3-hypergraph Ramsey Theorem with better and better upper bounds on the
3-hypergraph Ramsey Number. Ramsey and Erdos-Rado also prove the a-hypergraph
Ramsey Theorem. Conlon-Fox-Sudakov note that their upper bounds on the
3-hypergraph Ramsey Numbers, together with a recurrence of Erdos-Rado (which
was the key to the Erdos-Rado proof), yield improved bounds on the a-hypergraph
Ramsey numbers. We present all of these proofs and state explicit bounds for
the 2-color case and the c-color case. We give a more detailed analysis of the
construction of Conlon-Fox-Sudakov and hence obtain a slightly better bound.
