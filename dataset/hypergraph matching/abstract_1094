The orthogonal multi-matching pursuit (OMMP) is a natural extension of
orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). We denote the OMMP with the parameter $M$ as
OMMP(M) where $M\geq 1$ is an integer. The main difference between OMP and
OMMP(M) is that OMMP(M) selects $M$ atoms per iteration, while OMP only adds
one atom to the optimal atom set. In this paper, we study the performance of
orthogonal multi-matching pursuit (OMMP) under RIP. In particular, we show
that, when the measurement matrix A satisfies $(9s, 1/10)$-RIP, there exists an
absolutely constant $M_0\leq 8$ so that OMMP(M_0) can recover $s$-sparse signal
within $s$ iterations. We furthermore prove that, for slowly-decaying
$s$-sparse signal, OMMP(M) can recover s-sparse signal within $O(\frac{s}{M})$
iterations for a large class of $M$. In particular, for $M=s^a$ with $a\in
[0,1/2]$, OMMP(M) can recover slowly-decaying $s$-sparse signal within
$O(s^{1-a})$ iterations. The result implies that OMMP can reduce the
computational complexity heavily.
