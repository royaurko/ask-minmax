Our main result improves bounds of Markstrom and Rucinski on the minimum
d-degree which forces a perfect matching in a k-uniform hypergraph on n
vertices. We also extend bounds of Bollobas, Daykin and Erdos by asymptotically
determining the minimum vertex degree which forces a matching of size t <
n/2(k-1) in a k-uniform hypergraph on n vertices. Further asymptotically tight
results on d-degrees which force large matchings are also obtained. Our
approach is to prove fractional versions of the above results and then
translate these into integer versions.
