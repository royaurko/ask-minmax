We propose to determine the coefficients in the Fermilab heavy quark action
by matching the finite-volume, off-shell, gauge-fixed propagator and vertex
functions with those determined in the exact, relativistic theory. The matching
relativistic amplitudes may be determined either from short-distance
perturbation theory or from finite-volume step-scaling recursion. Tree-level
matching and non-perturbative off-shell amplitudes are presented.
