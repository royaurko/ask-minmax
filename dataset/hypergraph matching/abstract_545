We develop a tropical analogue of the classical double description method
allowing one to compute an internal representation (in terms of vertices) of a
polyhedron defined externally (by inequalities). The heart of the tropical
algorithm is a characterization of the extreme points of a polyhedron in terms
of a system of constraints which define it. We show that checking the
extremality of a point reduces to checking whether there is only one minimal
strongly connected component in an hypergraph. The latter problem can be solved
in almost linear time, which allows us to eliminate quickly redundant
generators. We report extensive tests (including benchmarks from an application
to static analysis) showing that the method outperforms experimentally the
previous ones by orders of magnitude. The present tools also lead to worst case
bounds which improve the ones provided by previous methods.
