Confidential Content-Based Publish/Subscribe (C-CBPS) is an interaction
(pub/sub) model that allows parties to exchange data while still protecting
their security and privacy interests. In this paper we advance the state of the
art in C-CBPS by showing how all predicate circuits in NC1 (logarithmic-depth,
bounded fan-in) can be securely computed by a broker while guaranteeing perfect
information-theoretic security. Previous work could handle only strictly
shallower circuits (e.g. those with depth O(\sqrt{\lg n}) [SYY99, V76]. We
present three protocols -- UGP-Match, FSGP-Match and OFSGP-Match -- all three
are based on (2-decomposable randomized encodings of) group programs and handle
circuits in NC1. UGP-Match is conceptually simple and has a clean proof of
correctness but it is inefficient and impractical. FSGP-Match uses a "fixed
structure" trick to achieve efficiency and scalability. And, finally,
OFSGP-Match uses hand-optimized group programs to wring greater efficiencies.
We complete our investigation with an experimental evaluation of a prototype
implementation.
