Mathematical morphology (MM) helps to describe and analyze shapes using set
theory. MM can be effectively applied to binary images which are treated as
sets. Basic morphological operators defined can be used as an effective tool in
image processing. Morphological operators are also developed based on graph and
hypergraph. These operators have found better performance and applications in
image processing. Bino et al. [8], [9] developed the theory of morphological
operators on hypergraph. A hypergraph structure is considered and basic
morphological operation erosion/dilation is defined. Several new operators
opening/closing and filtering are also defined on the hypergraphs. Hypergraph
based filtering have found comparatively better performance with morphological
filters based on graph. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of
hypergraph based ASF on binary images. Experimental results shows that
hypergraph based ASF filters have outperformed graph based ASF.
