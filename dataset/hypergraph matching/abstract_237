We study the following Maker/Breaker game. Maker and Breaker take turns in
choosing vertices from a given n-uniform hypergraph F, with Maker going first.
Maker's goal is to completely occupy a hyperedge and Breaker tries to avoid
this. Beck conjectures that if the maximum neighborhood size of F is at most
2^(n-1) then Breaker has a winning strategy. We disprove this conjecture by
establishing an n-uniform hypergraph with maximum neighborhood size 3*2^(n-3)
where Maker has a winning strategy. Moreover, we show how to construct an
n-uniform hypergraph with maximum degree 2^(n-1)/n where Maker has a winning
strategy. Finally we show that each n-uniform hypergraph with maximum degree at
most 2^(n-2)/(en) has a proper halving 2-coloring, which solves another open
problem posed by Beck related to the Neighborhood Conjecture.
