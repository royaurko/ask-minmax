Recently, settling a question of Erd\H{o}s, Balogh and
Pet\v{r}\'{i}\v{c}kov\'{a} showed that there are at most $2^{n^2/8+o(n^2)}$
$n$-vertex maximal triangle-free graphs, matching the previously known lower
bound. Here we characterize the typical structure of maximal triangle-free
graphs. We show that almost every maximal triangle-free graph $G$ admits a
vertex partition $X\cup Y$ such that $G[X]$ is a perfect matching and $Y$ is an
independent set.
  Our proof uses the Ruzsa-Szemer\'{e}di removal lemma, the
Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits stability theorem, and recent results of
Balogh-Morris-Samotij and Saxton-Thomason on characterization of the structure
of independent sets in hypergraphs. The proof also relies on a new bound on the
number of maximal independent sets in triangle-free graphs with many
vertex-disjoint $P_3$'s, which is of independent interest.
