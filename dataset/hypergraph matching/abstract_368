Frankl and F\"uredi (1989) conjectured that the $r$-graph with $m$ edges
formed by taking the first $m$ sets in the colex ordering of ${\mathbb
N}^{(r)}$ has the largest graph-Lagrangian of all $r$-graphs with $m$ edges. In
this paper, we establish some bounds for graph-Lagrangians of some special
$r$-graphs that support this conjecture.
