Aslam presents an algorithm he claims will count the number of perfect
matchings in any incomplete bipartite graph with an algorithm in the
function-computing version of NC, which is itself a subset of FP. Counting
perfect matchings is known to be #P-complete; therefore if Aslam's algorithm is
correct, then NP=P. However, we show that Aslam's algorithm does not correctly
count the number of perfect matchings and offer an incomplete bipartite graph
as a concrete counter-example.
