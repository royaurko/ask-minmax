A matching is indecomposable if it does not contain a nontrivial contiguous
segment of vertices whose neighbors are entirely contained in the segment. We
prove a Ramsey-like result for indecomposable matchings, showing that every
sufficiently long indecomposable matching contains a long indecomposable
matching of one of three types: interleavings, broken nestings, and proper pin
sequences.
