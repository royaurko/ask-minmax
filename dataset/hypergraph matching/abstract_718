The conventional way of identifying DNA motifs, solely based on match
alignment information, is susceptible to a high number of spurious sites. A
novel scoring system has been introduced by taking both match and mismatch
alignment information into account. The mismatch alignment information is
useful to remove spurious sites encountered in DNA motif searching. As an
example, a correct TATA box site in Homo sapiens H4/g gene has successfully
been identified based on match and mismatch alignment information.
