For $k \ge 2$, let $H$ be a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices and $m$
edges. The transversal number $\tau(H)$ of $H$ is the minimum number of
vertices that intersect every edge. Chv\'{a}tal and McDiarmid [Combinatorica 12
(1992), 19--26] proved that $\tau(H)\le ( n + \left\lfloor \frac k2
\right\rfloor m )/ ( \left\lfloor \frac{3k}2 \right\rfloor )$. When $k = 3$,
the connected hypergraphs that achieve equality in the Chv\'{a}tal-McDiarmid
Theorem were characterized by Henning and Yeo [J. Graph Theory 59 (2008),
326--348]. In this paper, we characterize the connected hypergraphs that
achieve equality in the Chv\'{a}tal-McDiarmid Theorem for $k = 2$ and for all
$k \ge 4$.
