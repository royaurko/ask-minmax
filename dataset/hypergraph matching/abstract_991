We analyze a probabilistic algorithm for matching shapes modeled by planar
regions under translations and rigid motions (rotation and translation). Given
shapes $A$ and $B$, the algorithm computes a transformation $t$ such that with
high probability the area of overlap of $t(A)$ and $B$ is close to maximal. In
the case of polygons, we give a time bound that does not depend significantly
on the number of vertices.
