We compute 2-enumerations of certain halved alternating sign matrices. In one
case the enumeration equals the number of perfect matchings of a halved Aztec
diamond. In the other case the enumeration equals the number of perfect
matchings of a halved fortress graph. Our results prove three conjectures by
