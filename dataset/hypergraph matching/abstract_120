We study the number of lines in hypergraphs in a more symmetric setting,
where both the hypergraph and its complement are considered. In the general
case and in some special cases, the lower bounds on the number of lines are
much higher than their counterparts in single hypergraph setting or admit more
elegant proofs. We show that the minimum value of product of the number of
lines in both hypergraphs on $n$ points is easily determined as $\binom{n}{2}$;
and the minimum value of their sum is between $\Omega(n)$ and $O(n \log n)$. We
also study some restricted classes of hypergraphs; and determine the tight
bounds on the minimum sum when the hypergraph is derived from an Euclidean
space, a real projective plane, or a tree.
