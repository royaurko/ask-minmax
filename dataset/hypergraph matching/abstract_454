We introduce a new background field method for N=2 superspace. (We treat
projective hyperspace, but similar remarks apply for the harmonic case.) In
analogy to N=1, background gauge fields are in the real representation, so the
lowest-dimension potentials are spinor and the usual non-renormalization
theorems are manifest. Another consequence is that the R-coordinates disappear
from the effective action.
