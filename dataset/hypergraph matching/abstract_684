Stimulated by odd-bipartite and even-bipartite hypergraphs, we define
odd-bipartite (weakly odd-bipartie) and even-bipartite (weakly even-bipartite)
tensors. It is verified that all even order odd-bipartite tensors are
irreducible tensors, while all even-bipartite tensors are reducible no matter
the parity of the order. Based on properties of odd-bipartite tensors, we study
the relationship between the largest H-eigenvalue of a $Z$-tensor with
nonnegative diagonal elements, and the largest H-eigenvalue of absolute tensor
of that $Z$-tensor. When the order is even and the $Z$-tensor is weakly
irreducible, we prove that the largest H-eigenvalue of the $Z$-tensor and the
largest H-eigenvalue of the absolute tensor of that $Z$-tensor are equal, if
and only if the $Z$-tensor is weakly odd-bipartite. Examples show the
authenticity of the conclusions. Then, we prove that a symmetric $Z$-tensor
with nonnegative diagonal entries and the absolute tensor of the $Z$-tensor are
diagonal similar, if and only if the $Z$-tensor has even order and it is weakly
odd-bipartite. After that, it is proved that, when an even order symmetric
$Z$-tensor with nonnegative diagonal entries is weakly irreducible, the
equality of the spectrum of the $Z$-tensor and the spectrum of absolute tensor
of that $Z$-tensor, can be characterized by the equality of their spectral
radii.
