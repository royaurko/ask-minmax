We present a spectral theory of hypergraphs that closely parallels Spectral
Graph Theory. A number of recent developments building upon classical work has
led to a rich understanding of "hyperdeterminants" of hypermatrices, a.k.a.
multidimensional arrays. Hyperdeterminants share many properties with
determinants, but the context of multilinear algebra is substantially more
complicated than the linear algebra required to address Spectral Graph Theory
(i.e., ordinary matrices). Nonetheless, it is possible to define eigenvalues of
a hypermatrix via its characteristic polynomial as well as variationally. We
apply this notion to the "adjacency hypermatrix" of a uniform hypergraph, and
prove a number of natural analogues of basic results in Spectral Graph Theory.
Open problems abound, and we present a number of directions for further study.
