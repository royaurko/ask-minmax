A total weighting of the vertices and edges of a hypergraph is called
vertex-coloring if the total weights of the vertices yield a proper coloring of
the graph, i.e., every edge contains at least two vertices with different
weighted degrees. In this note we show that such a weighting is possible if
every vertex has two, and every edge has three weights to choose from,
extending a recent result on graphs to hypergraphs.
