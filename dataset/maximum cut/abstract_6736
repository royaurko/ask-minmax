The structure of the pseudorapidity spectra of charged relativistic particles
with beta > 0.7 measured in Au+Em and Pb+Em collisions at AGS and SPS energies
are analyzed using Fourier transformation method and maximum entropy one. The
dependences of these spectra on the number of fast target protons (g-particles)
are studied. They show visually some plateau and "shoulder" which are at least
three selected points on the distributions. The plateau seems wider in Pb+Em
reactions. The existing of plateau is expected for the parton models. The
maximum entropy method confirms the existence of the plateau and the shoulder
of the distributions.
