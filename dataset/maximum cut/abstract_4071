The modelling of DNA mechanics under external constraints is discussed. Two
analytical models are widely known, but disagree for instance on the value of
the torsional modulus. The origin of this embarassing situation is located in
the concept of writhe. This letter presents a unified model for DNA
establishing a relation between the different approaches. I show that the
writhe created by the loops of DNA is at the origin of the discrepancy. To take
this into account, I propose a new treatment of loop statistics based on
numerical simulations using the most general formula for the writhe, and on
analytic calculations with only one fit parameter. One can then compute the
value of the torsional modulus of DNA without the need of any cut-off.
