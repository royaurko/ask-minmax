We study how the eightfold-degeneracy in the ($\theta_{13},\delta$) plane
observed in $\gamma \sim 100$ $\beta$-beams can be reduced by periodically
changing the ions in the storage ring. This ``ions cocktail'' allows to change
the neutrino energy, at fixed $\gamma$, by choosing ions with different decay
energies. We propose to combine the standard $^6$He and $^{18}$Ne beams with
$^8$Li and $^8$B ones. These latter two ions have peaked $\nu_e \to \nu_\mu$
oscillation probabilities for $\gamma = 100$ at a baseline $L \sim 700$ Km. At
this distance and this $\gamma$ the oscillation probability of $^6$He and
$^{18}$Ne neutrinos is at its second maximum. This setup is particularly suited
for large enough values of $\theta_{13}$ (within reach at T2K-I) and it allows
solving most of the eightfold-degeneracy, measuring $\theta_{13}, \delta$ and
the sign of the atmospheric mass difference for values of $\theta_{13} \geq
5^\circ$.
