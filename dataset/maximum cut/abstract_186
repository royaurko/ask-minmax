Millisecond pulsars are neutron stars (NSs) that are thought to have been
spun-up by mass accretion from a stellar companion. It is unknown whether there
is a natural brake for this process, or if it continues until the centrifugal
breakup limit is reached at submillisecond periods. Many NSs that are accreting
from a companion exhibit thermonuclear X-ray bursts that last tens of seconds,
caused by unstable nuclear burning on their surfaces. Millisecond brightness
oscillations during bursts from ten NSs (as distinct from other rapid X-ray
variability that is also observed) are thought to measure the stellar spin, but
direct proof of a rotational origin has been lacking. Here, we report the
detection of burst oscillations at the known spin frequency of an accreting
millisecond pulsar, and we show that these oscillations always have the same
rotational phase. This firmly establishes burst oscillations as nuclear-powered
pulsations tracing the spin of accreting NSs, corroborating earlier evidence.
The distribution of spin frequencies of the 11 nuclear-powered pulsars cuts off
well below the breakup frequency for most NS models, supporting theoretical
predictions that gravitational radiation losses can limit accretion torques in
spinning up millisecond pulsars.
