We present predictions for single inclusive distributions of charmed mesons,
relevant to the HERA experiments. Our results are based upon a computation that
correctly incorporates mass effects up to the next-to-leading order level, and
the resummation of transverse momentum logarithms up to
next-to-leading-logarithmic level. We apply the same acceptance cuts as the H1
and Zeus experiments, and compare our results to their data. We perform a study
of the sensitivity of our predictions on the charm mass, $\LambdaQCD$,
factorization scale, renormalization scale, and fragmentation parameters.
