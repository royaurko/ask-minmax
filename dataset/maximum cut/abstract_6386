Jaynes' information theory formalism of statistical mechanics is applied to
the stationary states of open, non-equilibrium systems. The key result is the
construction of the probability distribution for the underlying microscopic
phase space trajectories. Three consequences of this result are then derived :
the fluctuation theorem, the principle of maximum entropy production, and the
emergence of self-organized criticality for flux-driven systems in the
slowly-driven limit. The accumulating empirical evidence for these results
lends support to Jaynes' formalism as a common predictive framework for
equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
