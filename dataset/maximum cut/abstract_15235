In a previous study on thermonuclear (type I) nursts on accreting neutron
stars we addressed and demonstrated the importance of the effects of rotation,
through the Coriolis force, on the propagation of the burning flame. However,
that study only analysed cases of longitudinal propagation, where the Coriolis
force coefficient $2\Omega\cos\theta$ was constant. In this paper, we study the
effects of rotation on propagation in the meridional (latitudinal) direction,
where the Coriolis force changes from its maximum at the poles to zero at the
equator. We find that the zero Coriolis force at the equator, while affecting
the structure of the flame, does not prevent its propagation from one
hemisphere to another. We also observe structural differences between the flame
propagating towards the equator and that propagating towards the pole, the
second being faster. In the light of the recent discovery of the low spin
frequency of burster IGR~J17480-2446 rotating at 11 Hz (for which Coriolis
effects should be negligible) we also extend our simulations to slow rotation.
