The optical (BVRI) and radio (8.4 GHz) light curves of S5 1803+784 on a time
span of nearly 6 years are presented and discussed. The optical light curve
showed an overall variation greater than 3 mag, and the largest changes occured
in three strong flares. No periodicity was found in the light curve on time
scales up to a year. The variability in the radio band is very different, and
shows moderate oscillations around an average constant flux density rather than
relevant flares, with a maximum amplitude of $\sim$30%, without a simultaneous
correspondence between optical and radio luminosity. The optical spectral
energy distribution was always well fitted by a power law. The spectral index
shows small variations and there is indication of a positive correlation with
the source luminosity. Possible explanations of the source behaviour are
discussed in the framework of current models.
