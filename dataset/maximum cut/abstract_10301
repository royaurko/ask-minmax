We investigate the dynamic heterogeneities of glassy particle systems in the
theoretical schemes of bond breakage and four-point correlation functions. In
the bond-breakage scheme, we introduce the structure factor S_b(q,t) and the
susceptibility chi_b(t) to detect the spatial correlations of configuration
changes. Here chi_b(t) attains a maximum at t =t_b^max as a function of time t,
where the fraction of the particles with broken bonds phi_b(t)$ is about 1/2.
In the four-point scheme, treating the structure factor S_4(q,t) and the
susceptibility chi_4(t), we detect superpositions of the heterogeneity of bond
breakage and that of thermal low-frequency vibration modes. While the former
grows slowly, the latter emerges quickly to exhibit complex space-time
behavior. In two dimensions, the vibration modes extending over the system
yield significant contributions to the four-point correlations, which depend on
the system size logarithmically. A maximum of chi_4(t) is attained at t=
t_4^max, where these two contributions become of the same order. As a result,
t_4^max is considerably shorter than t_b^max.
