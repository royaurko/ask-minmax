We compare the large scale galaxy clustering in the new SDSS early data
release (EDR) with the clustering in the APM Galaxy Survey. We cut out pixel
maps (identical in size and shape) from the SDSS and APM data to allow a direct
comparison of the clustering. Here we concentrate our analysis on an equatorial
SDSS strip in the South Galactic Cap (EDR/SGC) with 166 deg^2, 2.5 wide and 65
degrees long. Only galaxies with Petrosian magnitudes 16.8 <g'<19.8 are
included to match the surface density of the 17< b_J<20 APM pixel maps (median
depth of 400 Mpc/h). Both the amplitude and shape of the angular 2-point
function and variance turn out to be in very good agreement with the APM on
scales smaller than 2 degrees (ie 15 Mpc/h). The 3-point function and skewness
are also in excellent agreement within a 90% confidence level. On one hand
these results illustrate that the EDR data and SDSS software pipelines, work
well and are suitable to do analysis of large scale clustering. On the other
hand it confirms that large scale clustering analysis is becoming "repeatable"
and therefore that our conclusions for structure formation models seem to stand
on solid scientific grounds.
