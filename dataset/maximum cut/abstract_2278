The FormCalc package automates the computation of FeynArts amplitudes up to
one loop including the generation of a Fortran code for the numerical
evaluation of the squared matrix element. Major new or enhanced features in
Version 5 are: iterative build-up of essentially arbitrary phase-spaces
including cuts, convolution with density functions, and uniform treatment of
kinematical variables. The LoopTools library supplies the one-loop integrals
necessary for evaluating the squared matrix element. Its most significant
extensions in Version 2.2 are the five-point family of integrals, and complex
and alternate versions.
