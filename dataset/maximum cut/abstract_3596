We investigate mode amplitudes in the active and quiet Sun in both maximum
and minimum phases of the solar activity cycle. We confirm previous studies
showing that p-mode amplitudes at solar minimum are higher than at solar
maximum. We mask active regions of a certain magnetic field strength and
compare the masked and unmasked acoustic power. After applying the masks, the
preliminary analysis indicates that the amplitude decreases over all degrees
during solar minimum, compared to the unmasked case, while at solar maximum the
amplitude first decreases up to l ~ 300 and then increases at higher degrees.
