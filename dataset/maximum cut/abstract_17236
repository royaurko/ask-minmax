We study the power control problem in wireless ad hoc networks with selfish
users. Without incentive schemes, selfish users tend to transmit at their
maximum power levels, causing significant interference to each other. In this
paper, we study a class of incentive schemes based on intervention to induce
selfish users to transmit at desired power levels. An intervention scheme can
be implemented by introducing an intervention device that can monitor the power
levels of users and then transmit power to cause interference to users. We
mainly consider first-order intervention rules based on individual transmit
powers. We derive conditions on design parameters and the intervention
capability to achieve a desired outcome as a (unique) Nash equilibrium and
propose a dynamic adjustment process that the designer can use to guide users
and the intervention device to the desired outcome. The effect of using
intervention rules based on aggregate receive power is also analyzed. Our
results show that with perfect monitoring intervention schemes can be designed
to achieve any positive power profile while using interference from the
intervention device only as a threat. We also analyze the case of imperfect
monitoring and show that a performance loss can occur. Lastly, simulation
results are presented to illustrate the performance improvement from using
intervention rules and compare the performances of different intervention
rules.
