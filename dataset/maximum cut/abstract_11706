The relation between relaxation, the time scale of Lyapunov instabilities,
and the Kolmogorov-Sinai time in a one-dimensional gravitating sheet system is
studied. Both the maximum Lyapunov exponent and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy
decrease as proportional to $N^{-1/5}$. The time scales determined by these
quantities evidently differ from any type of relaxation time found in the
previous investigations. The relaxation time to quasiequilibria (microscopic
relaxation) is found to coincide with the inverse of the minimum positive
Lyapunov exponent. The relaxation time to the final thermal equilibrium differs
to the inverse of the Lyapunov exponents and the Kolmogorov-Sinai time.
