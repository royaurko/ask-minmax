In this work I present a full analysis of proton decay in an $SO(10)$ model
previously proposed by Dutta, Mimura, and Mohapatra. The $\bf{10}$,
$\overline{\bf{126}}$, and $\bf{120}$ Yukawa couplings contributing to fermion
masses in this model have well-motivated restrictions on their textures
intended to give favorable results for proton lifetime as well as a realistic
fermion sector without the need for fine-tuning and for either type-I or
type-II dominance in the neutrino mass matrix. I obtain a valid fit for the
entire fermion sector for both types of seesaw dominance, including
$\theta_{13}$ in good agreement with the most recent data. For the case with
type-II seesaw, I find that using the Yukawa couplings fixed by the successful
fermion sector fit, proton partial lifetime limits are satisfied for nearly
every pertinent decay mode, even for nearly arbitrary values of the triplet
Higgs mixing parameters, with only the $K^+ \bar\nu$ mode requiring a minor
${\cal O}(10^{-1})$ cancellation in order to satisfy the experimental limit. I
also find a maximum lifetime for that mode of $\tau(K^+ \bar\nu) \sim 10^{36}$
years, which should be tested by forthcoming experiments. For the type-I seesaw
case, I find that all six pertinent decay modes of interest are satisfied for
values of the triplet mixing parameters giving no major enhancement, with modes
other than $K^+ \bar\nu$ easily satisfied for arbitrary mixing values, and with
a maximum lifetime for $K^+ \bar\nu$ of nearly $10^{38}$ years.
