We reply to the comment by Andreotti and Claudin (submitted to Phys. Rev. E,
arXiv:0705.3525) on our paper ``Minimal Size of a Barchan Dune'' [Phys. Rev. E
{\bf{75,}} 011301 (2007)]. We show that the equations of the dune model used in
our calculations are self-consistent and effectively lead to a dependence of
the minimal dune size on the wind speed through the saturation length.
Furthermore, we show that Meridiani Planum ripples are probably not a good
reference to estimate the grain size of Martian dune sands: the soil in the
ripple troughs at the landing site is covered with nonerodible elements
(``blueberries''), which increase the minimal threshold for saltation by a
factor of 2.0. We conclude that, in the absence of large fragments as the ones
found at the landing site, basaltic grains of diameter $d=500 \pm 100 {\mu}$m
that compose the large, typical dark Martian dunes [K. S. Edgett and P. R.
Christensen, J. Geophys. Res. {\bf{96,}} 22765 (1991)] probably saltate during
the strongest storms on Mars. We also show that the wind friction speed
$u_{\ast} \approx 3.0$ m/s that we found from the calculations of Martian dunes
is within the values of maximum wind speeds that occur during Martian storms a
few times a decade [R. E. Arvidson {\em{et al.}}, Science {\bf{222,}} 463
(1983); H. J. Moore, J. Geophys. Res. {\bf{90,}} 163 (1985); R. Sullivan
{\em{et al.}}, Nature {\bf{436,}} 58 (2005); D. J. Jerolmack {\em{et al.}}, J.
Geophys. Res. {\bf{111,}} E12S02 (2006)]. In this manner, the dune model
predicts that Martian dunes can be formed under present Martian conditions,
with no need to assume other conditions of wind and atmosphere that could have
prevailed in the past.
