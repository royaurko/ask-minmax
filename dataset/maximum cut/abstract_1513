We present a calculation of the O(alpha_s) QCD corrections to the production
of a Z boson in association with two photons and to triple photon production at
hadron colliders. All final-state photons are taken as real. For the Z boson,
we consider the decays both into charged leptons and into neutrinos including
all off-shell effects. Numerical results are obtained via a Monte Carlo program
based on the structure of the VBFNLO program package. This allows us to
implement general cuts and distributions of the final-state particles. We find
that the NLO QCD corrections are sizable and significantly exceed the
expectations from a scale variation of the leading-order result. In addition,
differential distributions of important observables change considerably. The
prediction of two-photon-associated Z production with Z decays into neutrinos
from the charged-lepton rate works well, once we use an additional cut on the
invariant mass of the charged-lepton pair.
