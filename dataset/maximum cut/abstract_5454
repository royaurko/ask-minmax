Hydrogenated graphene edges are assumed to be either armchair, zigzag or a
combination of the two. We show that the zigzag is not the most stable fully
hydrogenated structure along the <2-1-10> direction. Instead hydrogenated Klein
and reconstructed Klein based edges are found to be energetically more
favourable, with stabilities approaching that of armchair edges. These new
structures "unify" graphene edge topology, the most stable flat hydrogenated
graphene edges always consisting of pairwise bonded C2H4 edge groups,
irrespective the edge orientation. When edge rippling is included, CH3 edge
groups are most stable. These new fundamental hydrogen terminated edges have
important implications for graphene edge imaging and spectroscopy, as well as
mechanisms for graphene growth, nanotube cutting, and nanoribbon formation and
behaviour.
