Relic neutrino nu_r light masses clustering in Galactic and Local Hot Dark
Halos act as a beam dump calorimeter. Ultra High Energy nu, above ZeV, born by
AGNs, GRBs at cosmic edges, overcoming (GZK) cut-off, may hit near Z resonance
and WW-ZZ channels energies: their showering into UHECR fit observed data . Any
tiny neutrino mass splitting may reflect into a twin bump at highest GZK energy
cut-off. The Z or WW,ZZ showering explain a peculiar clustering in observed
UHECR spectra at 10^19, 210^19, 4 10^19 eV found by AGASA. Coincidence of
clustered UHECR with highest gamma BLac sources is well tuned to Z-Showering
Scenario. Additional prompt TeVs signals occur offering a natural solution of
growing Infrared-TeV cut-off paradoxes related to distant TeV BLac sources and
a GRB at TeV energy. Electromagnetic Cascades tail explain correlation found
between GeV-EGRET Sources and UHECR. Such UHE nu Astrophysics might trace into
Horizontal Tau Air-Showers originated by the UHE nu_tau Earth-Skimming in wide
Corona Earth Crust around the observer. These Upward and Horizontal tau
Air-Showers UPTAUS, HORTAUS, monitor huge volumes from high mountains as well
as observing from planes, balloons and satellites. HORTAUS from mountains
observe corona masses at UHE neutrino at EeVs energies comparable to few km^3,
while from satellites at orbit altitudes, at GZK energies, their corresponding
Horizontal Corona Masses may even exceed 150 km^3. The expected event rate may
exceed a dozen of event a year in Z-WW Showering model from satellite.
