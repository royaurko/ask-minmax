A direct fit of the isoscalar spin-orbit (SO) and both isoscalar and
isovector tensor coupling constants to the f5/2-f7/2 SO splittings in 40Ca,
56Ni, and 48Ca nuclei requires a drastic reduction of the isoscalar SO strength
and strong attractive tensor coupling constants. The aim of this work is to
address further consequences of these strong attractive tensor and weak SO
fields on binding energies, nuclear deformability, and high-spin states. In
particular, we show that contribution to the nuclear binding energy due to the
tensor field shows generic magic structure with tensorial magic numbers at
N(Z)=14, 32, 56, or 90 corresponding to the maximum spin-asymmetries in 1d5/2,
1f7/2-2p3/2, 1g9/2-2d5/2 and 1h11/2-2f7/2 single-particle configurations and
that these numbers are smeared out by pairing correlations and deformation
effects. We also examine the consequences of strong attractive tensor fields
and weak SO interaction on nuclear stability at the drip lines, in particular
close to the tensorial doubly magic nuclei and discuss the possibility of an
entirely new tensor-force driven deformation effect.
