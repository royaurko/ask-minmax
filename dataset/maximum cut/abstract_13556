A detailed investigation of the reaction np -> pp\pi^{-} has been carried out
using the data obtained with the continuous neutron beam produced by charge
exchange scattering of protons off a deuterium target. A partial wave
event-by-event based maximum likelihood analysis was applied to determine
contributions of different partial waves to the pion production process. The
combined analysis of the np -> pp\pi^{-} and pp -> pp\pi^{0} data measured in
the same energy region allows us to determine the contribution of isoscalar
partial waves (I=0) in the momentum range from 1.1 up to 1.8 GeV/c. The decay
of isoscalar partial waves into (^1S_0)_{pp}\pi$ channel provides a good tool
for a determination of the pp S-wave scalar scattering length in the final
state which was found to be a_{pp}=-7.5\pm 0.3 fm.
