HIJING generator simulation of nucleus-nucleus collisions at
ultrarelativistic energies are presented. Is shown, that the global
characteristics of nucleus-nucleus collisions, such as of distribution of a
charge multiplicity, total and electromagnetic transverse energy over
pseudorapidity are rather sensitive to some predictions of formation models of
high-exited nuclear medium, namely parton energy losses in dense nuclear
matter. This losses results to appearance of a broad maximum in global variable
distributions over pseudorapidity. The most profound of this effect occurs at
central heavy ion collisions at LHC energy.
