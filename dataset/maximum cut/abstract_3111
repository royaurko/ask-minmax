Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the Gaussian pseudo-maximum
likelihood estimate of the parameters in a wide class of ARCH$(\infty)$
processes are established. The conditions are shown to hold in case of
exponential and hyperbolic decay in the ARCH weights, though in the latter case
a faster decay rate is required for the central limit theorem than for the law
of large numbers. Particular parameterizations are discussed.
