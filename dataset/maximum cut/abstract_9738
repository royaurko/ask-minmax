We show that the use of a dispersion oscillating fiber in passive cavities
significantly extend modulational instability to novel high-frequency bands,
which also destabilize the branches of the steady response which are stable
with homogeneous dispersion. By means of Floquet theory, we obtain exact
explicit expression for the sideband gain, and a simple analytical estimate for
the frequencies of maximum gain. Numerical simulations show that stable
stationary trains of pulses can be excited in the cavity.
