We find constraints on minimum and maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars
imposed by their early evolution (protoneutron star stage). We calculate models
of protoneutron stars using a realistic standard equation of state of hot,
dense matter valid for both supranuclear and subnuclear densities. Results for
different values of the nuclear incompressibility are presented.
