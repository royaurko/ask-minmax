We show that, at finite temperature, the maximum spin squeezing achievable
using interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates has a finite limit when the
atom number $N\to \infty$ at fixed density and interaction strength. We
calculate the limit of the squeezing parameter for a spatially homogeneous
system and show that it is bounded from above by the initial non-condensed
fraction.
