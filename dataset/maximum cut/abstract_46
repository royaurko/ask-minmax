The two-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) can be used as
a model of phenomena in physical systems ranging from waves on deep water to
pulses in optical fibers. In this paper, we establish that every
one-dimensional traveling wave solution of NLS with trivial phase is unstable
with respect to some infinitesimal perturbation with two-dimensional structure.
If the coefficients of the linear dispersion terms have the same sign then the
only unstable perturbations have transverse wavelength longer than a
well-defined cut-off. If the coefficients of the linear dispersion terms have
opposite signs, then there is no such cut-off and as the wavelength decreases,
the maximum growth rate approaches a well-defined limit.
