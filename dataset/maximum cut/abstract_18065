The induced gravitational collapse (IGC) paradigm explains a class of
energetic, $E_{\rm iso}\gtrsim 10^{52}$~erg, long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) associated with Ic supernovae, recently named binary-driven hypernovae
(BdHNe). The progenitor is a tight binary system formed of a carbon-oxygen (CO)
core and a neutron star companion. The supernova ejecta of the exploding CO
core triggers a hypercritical accretion process onto the neutron star, which
reaches in a few seconds the critical mass, and gravitationally collapses to a
black hole emitting a GRB. In our previous simulations of this process we
adopted a spherically symmetric approximation to compute the features of the
hypercritical accretion process. We here present the first estimates of the
angular momentum transported by the supernova ejecta, $L_{\rm acc}$, and
perform numerical simulations of the angular momentum transfer to the neutron
star during the hyperaccretion process in full general relativity. We show that
the neutron star: i) reaches in a few seconds either mass-shedding limit or the
secular axisymmetric instability depending on its initial mass; ii) reaches a
maximum dimensionless angular momentum value, $[c J/(G M^2)]_{\rm max}\approx
0.7$; iii) can support less angular momentum than the one transported by
supernova ejecta, $L_{\rm acc} > J_{\rm NS,max}$, hence there is an angular
momentum excess which necessarily leads to jetted emission.
