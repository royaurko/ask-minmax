The dynamics of the skew information (SI) is investigated for a single Cooper
Pair Box,CPB interacts with a single cavity mode. The effect of the cavity and
CPB's parameters on the SI is discussed. We show that, it is possible to
increase the skew information to reach its maximum value either by increasing
the number of photons inside the cavity or considering non-resonant case with
larger detuning parameter. The effect of the relative ratio of Josephson
junction capacity and the gate capacity is investigated, where the number of
oscillations of the skew information increases by decreasing this ratio and
consequently the travelling time between the maximum and minimum values
decreases.
