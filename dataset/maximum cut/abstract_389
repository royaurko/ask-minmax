We study the convergence rate to stationarity for a class of exchangeable
partition-valued Markov chains called cut-and-paste chains. The law governing
the transitions of a cut-and-paste chain are determined by products of i.i.d.
stochastic matrices, which describe the chain induced on the simplex by taking
asymptotic frequencies. Using this representation, we establish upper bounds
for the mixing times of ergodic cut-and-paste chains, and under certain
conditions on the distribution of the governing random matrices we show that
the "cutoff phenomenon" holds.
