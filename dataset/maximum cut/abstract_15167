In this paper, we consider the problem of automatic modulation classification
with multiple sensors in the presence of unknown time offset, phase offset and
received signal amplitude. We develop a novel hybrid maximum likelihood (HML)
classification scheme based on a generalized expectation maximization (GEM)
algorithm. GEM is capable of finding ML estimates numerically that are
extremely hard to obtain otherwise. Assuming a good initialization technique is
available for GEM, we show that the classification performance can be greatly
improved with multiple sensors compared to that with a single sensor,
especially when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. We further demonstrate
the superior performance of our approach when simulated annealing (SA) with
uniform as well as nonuniform grids is employed for initialization of GEM in
low SNR regions. The proposed GEM based approach employs only a small number of
samples (in the order of hundreds) at a given sensor node to perform both time
and phase synchronization, signal power estimation, followed by modulation
classification. We provide simulation results to show the computational
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
