We present an optical spectropolarimetric observation of the unique Type Ib
supernova (SN) 2005bf at 8 days after the second maximum. The data, combined
with the polarization spectrum taken at 6 days before the second maximum (Maund
et al. 2007a), enable us to closely examine the intrinsic properties of the SN.
The polarization percentage is smaller at the later epoch over a wide
wavelength range, while the position angle is similar at the two epochs. We
find that an assumption of complete depolarization of strong lines at the
emission peak is not necessarily correct. The intrinsic polarization of the SN
is larger, and thus, the ejecta of SN 2005bf would be more asymmetric than
previously expected. The axis ratio of the photosphere projected on the sky
deviates from unity by at least 20 %. If the position angle of interstellar
polarization is aligned with the spiral arm of the host galaxy, the deviation
is larger than 25 %. The line polarization at the He I, Ca II and Fe II lines
is also smaller at the later epoch. The changes in the position angle across
these lines, which were observed at the earlier epoch, are still marginally
present at the later epoch. The similar polarimetric behavior suggests that the
distributions of these ions are correlated. Properties of polarization, as well
as the light curve and the spectra both at photospheric and nebular phases, can
be explained by an aspherical, possibly unipolar explosion of a WN star in
which the blob of 56Ni penetrates C+O core and stops within the He layer.
