One of the long-standing research problems on logic programming is to treat
the cut predicate in a logical, high-level way. We argue that this problem can
be solved by adopting linear logic and choice-disjunctive goal formulas of the
form $G_0 \add G_1$ where $G_0, G_1$ are goals. These goals have the following
intended semantics: $choose$ the true disjunct $G_i$ and execute $G_i$ where $i
(= 0\ {\rm or}\ 1)$, while $discarding$ the unchosen disjunct. Note that only
one goal can remain alive during execution. These goals thus allow us to
specify mutually exclusive tasks in a high-level way.
