The maximum entropy method has been used to reconstruct images in a wide
range of astronomical fields, but in its traditional form it is restricted to
the reconstruction of strictly positive distributions. We present an extension
of the standard method to include distributions that can take both positive and
negative values. The method may therefore be applied to a much wider range of
astronomical reconstruction problems. In particular, we derive the form of the
entropy for positive/negative distributions and use direct counting arguments
to find the form of the entropic prior. We also derive the measure on the space
of positive/negative distributions, which allows the definition of probability
integrals and hence the proper quantification of errors.
