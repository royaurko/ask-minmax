We present a calculation that allows for an estimation of the NNLO
contributions to the Higgs production in the weak boson fusion channel. A
possible deterioration of this important channel for the Higgs discoveries at
the LHC can be ruled out by this calculation due to the small remaining cross
section after the weak boson cuts.
