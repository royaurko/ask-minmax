The supermassive black holes observed at the centers of almost all
present-day galaxies, had a profound impact on their environment. I highlight
the principle of self-regulation, by which supermassive black holes grow until
they release sufficient energy to unbind the gas that feeds them from their
host galaxy. This principle explains several observed facts, including the
correlation between the mass of a central black hole and the depth of the
gravitational potential well of its host galaxy, and the abundance and
clustering properties of bright quasars in the redshift interval of z~2-6. At
lower redshifts, quasars might have limited the maximum mass of galaxies
through the suppression of cooling flows in X-ray clusters. The seeds of
supermassive black holes were likely planted in dwarf galaxies at redshifts
z>10, through the collapse of massive or supermassive stars. The minimum seed
mass can be identified observationally through the detection of gravitational
waves from black hole binaries by Advanced LIGO or LISA. Aside from shaping
their host galaxies, quasar outflows filled the intergalactic medium with
magnetic fields and heavy elements. Beyond the reach of these outflows, the
brightest quasars at z>6 have ionized exceedingly large volumes of gas (tens of
comoving Mpc) prior to global reionization, and must have suppressed the faint
end of the galaxy luminosity function in these volumes before the same occurred
through the rest of the universe.
