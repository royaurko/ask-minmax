Packet classification is a vital and complicated task as the processing of
packets should be done at a specified line speed. In order to classify a packet
as belonging to a particular flow or set of flows, network nodes must perform a
search over a set of filters using multiple fields of the packet as the search
key. Hence the matching of packets should be much faster and simpler for quick
processing and classification. A hardware accelerator or a classifier has been
proposed here using a modified version of the HyperCuts packet classification
algorithm. A new pre-cutting process has been implemented to reduce the memory
size to fit in an FPGA. This classifier can classify packets with high speed
and with a power consumption factor of less than 3W. This methodology removes
the need for floating point division to be performed by replacing the region
compaction scheme of HyperCuts by pre-cutting, while classifying the packets
and concentrates on classifying the packets at the core of the network.
