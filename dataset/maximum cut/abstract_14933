This work concerns the study of the properties of convective cores in
main-sequence models of solar-like pulsators and what information they may hold
about stellar ages. We verified that the maximum absolute frequency derivative
of particular combinations of frequencies, which we name "the slopes", provides
information on the relative size of the discontinuity in the sound-speed
profile at the border of the convectively mixed region. Since the latter is
related to the evolutionary state of stars, we show that for models with masses
above $1.3\,\rm M_\odot$, it may be possible to estimate the fraction of
stellar main-sequence evolution from the slopes. Moreover, for models with
masses below $1.2\,\rm M_\odot$ we verified that it may be possible to use the
slopes to discriminate against models with small amounts of core overshoot.
