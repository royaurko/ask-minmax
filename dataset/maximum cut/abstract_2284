NLO-QCD corrections to vector boson pair production via weak boson fusion
have recently been calculated and implemented into flexible parton-level
Monte-Carlo programs. These allow for the computation of cross sections and
kinematical distributions within realistic experimental cuts. We summarize the
basic elements of the calculation and review phenomenological results for the
LHC.
