We give the definition of the Seiberg-Witten-Floer homology group for a
homology 3-sphere. Its Euler characteristic number is a Casson-type invariant.
For a four-manifold with boundary a homology sphere, a relative Seiberg-Witten
invariant is defined taking values in the Seiberg-Witten-Floer homology group,
these relative Seiberg-Witten invariants are applied to certain homology
spheres bounding Stein surfaces.
