The influence of fractal clusters of a normal phase on the dynamics of a
magnetic flux trapped in a percolative superconductor is considered. The
critical current distribution and the current-voltage characteristics of
fractal superconducting structures in the resistive state are obtained for an
arbitrary fractal dimension of the cluster boundaries. The range of fractal
dimensions, where the dispersion of critical currents becomes infinite, is
found. It is revealed that the fractality of clusters depresses of the electric
field caused by the magnetic flux motion thus increasing the critical current
value. It is expected that the maximum current-carrying capability of a
superconductor can be achieved in the region of giant dispersion of critical
currents.
