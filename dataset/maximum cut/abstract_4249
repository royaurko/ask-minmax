The triviality of the scalar sector of the standard one-doublet Higgs model
implies that it is only an effective low-energy theory valid below some cut-off
scale $\Lambda$. In this note we show that the experimental constraint on the
amount of custodial symmetry violation, $|\Delta \rho_* | = \alpha |T | \le
0.4\%$, implies that the scale $\Lambda$ must be greater than of order 7.5 TeV.
For theories defined about the infrared-stable Gaussian fixed-point, we
estimate that this lower bound on $\Lambda$ yields an upper bound of
approximately 550 GeV on the Higgs boson's mass, independent of the regulator
chosen to define the theory. We also show that some regulator schemes, such as
higher-derivative regulators, used to define the theory about a different
fixed-point are particularly dangerous because an infinite number of
custodial-isospin-violating operators become relevant.
