We present the general analytic solution for the evolution of radiative
supernova remnants in a uniform interstellar medium, under thin-shell
approximation. This approximation is shown to be very accurate approach to this
task. For a given set of parameters, our solution closely matches the results
of numerical models, showing a transient in which the deceleration parameter
reaches a maximum value of 0.33, followed by a slow convergence to the
asymptotic value 2/7. Oort (1951) and McKee and Ostriker (1977) analytic
solutions are discussed, as special cases of the general solution we have
found.
