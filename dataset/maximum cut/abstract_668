Paper is presented the results of computer simulation. Effect of the
homogeneous dc electric field influence on the propagation of zero and first
order Lamb and SH waves in piezoelectric langasite single crystal plates for a
lot of cuts and directions have been calculated. Crystalline directions and
cuts with maximal and minimal influence of dc electric field have indicated.
Effect of hybridization of plate modes has been discussed.
