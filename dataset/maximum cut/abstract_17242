Light Ion Beams are providing an efficient system for high energy
applications using confinement reaction (ICF). This paper will demonstrate the
mathematical properties of ion beams leaving ICF reactors and hitting a solid
target. A single Hydrogen heavy nucleus current has been demonstrated using
Child-Langmuir in an infinite radius as it leaves the reactor chamber. The
maximum energy emission has been recorded by examining the total energy loss of
the beam pulse using Bethe-Bloch (dE/dx) where it hits the target and forming
plasma. Also the target has been analysed by measuring the induction energy,
drift and collision current. A set of formula has been developed for charge and
current neutrality, the ion beam is being rotated in azimuthal direction, this
induces self-magnetism in this purposes. The concept of self-magnetism Er and
Br also has been introduced to the rotating-propagating beam inverse to the
beam current through ionized and neutral gas. This has been advanced by
developing a set of magnetic field equations. And finally by introducing the
particles' decay including D-D Reaction briefly in an inelastic collision the
total amount of energy has been examined.
