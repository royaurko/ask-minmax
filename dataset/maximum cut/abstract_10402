In information theory, one area of interest is gambling, where mutual
information characterizes the maximal gain in wealth growth rate due to
knowledge of side information; the betting strategy that achieves this maximum
is named the Kelly strategy. In the field of physics, it was recently shown
that mutual information can characterize the maximal amount of work that can be
extracted from a single heat bath using measurement-based control protocols,
i.e., using "information engines". However, to the best of our knowledge, no
relation between gambling and information engines has been presented before. In
this paper, we briefly review the two concepts and then demonstrate an analogy
between gambling, where bits are converted into wealth, and information
engines, where bits representing measurements are converted into energy. From
this analogy follows an extension of gambling to the continuous-valued case,
which is shown to be useful for investments in currency exchange rates or in
the stock market using options. Moreover, the analogy enables us to use
well-known methods and results from one field to solve problems in the other.
We present three such cases: maximum work extraction when the probability
distributions governing the system and measurements are unknown, work
extraction when some energy is lost in each cycle, e.g., due to friction, and
an analysis of systems with memory. In all three cases, the analogy enables us
to use known results in order to obtain new ones.
