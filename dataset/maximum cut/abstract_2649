We consider a dual description of the technicolor-like gauge theory within
the D4/D8 brane configuration with varying confinement and elecroweak symmetry
breaking scales. Constructing an effective truncated model valid below a
certain cut-off, we identify the particle spectrum with Kaluza-Klein modes of
the model in a manner consistent with the hidden local symmetry. Integrating
out heavy states, we find that the low-energy action receives nontrivial
corrections stemming from the mixing between Standard Model and heavy gauge
bosons which results in reduction of oblique parameters.
