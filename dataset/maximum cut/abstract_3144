In random cellular systems, both observation and maximum entropy inference
give a specific form to the topological pair correlation: it is bi-affine in
the cells number of edges with coefficients depending on the distance between
the two cells of the pair. Assuming this form for the pair correlations, we
make explicit the conditions of statistical independence at large distance.
When, on average, the defects do not contribute, the layer population and the
enclosed topological charge both increase polynomially with distance. In
dimension 2, the exponent of the leading terms depend on sum rules satisfied,
or not, by the maximum entropy coefficients.
