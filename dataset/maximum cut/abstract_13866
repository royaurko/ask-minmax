The maximum entropy method is used to compute the dressed-quark spectral
density from the self-consistent numerical solution of a rainbow truncation of
QCD's gap equation at temperatures above that for which chiral symmetry is
restored. In addition to the normal and plasmino modes, the spectral function
also exhibits an essentially nonperturbative zero mode for temperatures
extending to 1.4-1.8-times the critical temperature, T_c. In the neighbourhood
of T_c, this long-wavelength mode contains the bulk of the spectral strength
and so long as this mode persists, the system may fairly be described as a
strongly-coupled state of matter.
