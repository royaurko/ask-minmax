In this paper, we consider a three node relay network comprising a source, a
relay, and a destination. The source transmits the message to the destination
using hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) with incremental redundancy (IR).
The relay overhears the transmitted message, amplifies it using a variable gain
amplifier, and then forwards the message to the destination. This latter
combines both the source and the relay message and tries to decode the
information. In case of decoding failure, the destination sends a negative
acknowledgement. A new replica of the message containing new parity bits is
then transmitted in the subsequent HARQ round. This process continues until
successful decoding occurs at the destination or a maximum number $M$ of rounds
is reached. We study the performance of HARQ-IR over the considered relay
channel from an information theoretic perspective. We derive exact expressions
and bounds for the information outage probability, the average number of
transmissions, and the average transmission rate. Moreover, we evaluate the
delay experienced by Poisson arriving packets over the considered relay
network. We also provide analytical expressions for the expected waiting time,
the sojourn time, and the energy efficiency. The derived exact expressions are
validated by Monte Carlo simulations.
