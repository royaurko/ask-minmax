A logic calculus is presented that is a conservative extension of linear
logic. The motivation beneath this work concerns lazy evaluation, true
concurrency and interferences in proof search. The calculus includes two new
connectives to deal with multisequent structures and has the cut-elimination
property. Extensions are proposed that give first results concerning our
objectives.
