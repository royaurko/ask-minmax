The ALICE experiment has measured at mid-rapidity electrons from
heavy-flavour decays in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 and 7 TeV, and in
Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. In pp collisions, electrons
from charm-hadron and from beauty-hadron decays are identified by applying cuts
on displaced vertices. The relative yield of electrons from beauty-hadron
decays to those from heavy-flavour decays is extracted using electron-hadron
correlations. Results are compared to pQCD-based calculations. In Pb-Pb
collisions, the $p_{\rm T}$ dependence of the nuclear modification factor of
electrons from heavy-flavour decays is presented in two centrality classes. The
status on the analysis of electrons from beauty-hadron decays is reported in
Pb-Pb collisions, in view of the measurement of the corresponding nuclear
modification factor.
