We give conditions characterizing holomorphic and meromorphic functions in
the unit disk of the complex plane in terms of certain weak forms of the
maximum principle. Our work is directly inspired by recent results of John
Wermer, and by the theory of the projective hull of a compact subset of complex
projective space developed by Reese Harvey and Blaine Lawson.
