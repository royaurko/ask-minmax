Bundle methods have been intensively studied for solving both convex and
nonconvex optimization problems. In most of the bundle methods developed thus
far, at least one quadratic programming (QP) subproblem needs to be solved in
each iteration. In this paper, we exploit the feasibility of developing a
bundle algorithm that only solves linear subproblems. We start from
minimization of a convex function and show that the sequence of major
iterations converge to a minimizer. For nonconvex functions we consider
functions that are locally Lipschitz continuous and prox-regular on a bounded
level set, and minimize the cutting-plane model over a trust region with
infinity norm. The para-convexity of such functions allows us to use the
locally convexified model and its convexity properties. Under some conditions
and assumptions, we study the convergence of the proposed algorithm through the
outer semicontinuity of the proximal mapping. Encouraging results of
preliminary numerical experiments on standard test sets are provided.
