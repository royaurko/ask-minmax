The total irregularity of a simple undirected graph $G$ is denoted by
$irr_t(G)$ and is defined as $irr_t(G) = \frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{u,v \in
V(G)}|d(u) - d(v)|$. In this paper, the concept called edge-transformation in
relation to total irregularity of simple undirected graphs with at least one
cut edge is introduced. We also introduce the concept of an edge-joint between
two simple undirected graphs. We also introduce the concept of total
irregularity in respect of in-degree and out-degree in simple directed graphs.
These invariants are called total in-irregularity and total out-irregularity
respectively. In this paper, we initiate a study on these parameters of given
simple undirected graphs and simple digraphs.
