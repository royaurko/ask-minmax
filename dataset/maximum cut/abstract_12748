The uncertainty relation for angle and angular momentum has a lower bound
which depends on the form of the state. Surprisingly, this lower bound can be
very large. We derive the states which have the lowest possible uncertainty
product for a given uncertainty in the angle or in the angular momentum. We
show that, if the given angle uncertainty is close to its maximum value, the
lowest possible uncertainty product tends to infinity.
