The Turan number of a graph H, ex(n,H), is the maximum number of edges in a
graph on n vertices which does not have H as a subgraph. We determine the Turan
number and find the unique extremal graph for forests consisting of paths when
n is sufficiently large. This generalizes a result of Bushaw and Kettle [
Combinatorics, Probability and Computing 20:837--853, 2011]. We also determine
the Turan number and extremal graphs for forests consisting of stars of
arbitrary order.
