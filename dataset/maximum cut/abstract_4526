Aldous and Pitman (1994) studied asymptotic distributions, as n tends to
infinity, of various functionals of a uniform random mapping of a set of n
elements, by constructing a mapping-walk and showing these mapping-walks
converge weakly to a reflecting Brownian bridge. Two different ways to encode a
mapping as a walk lead to two different decompositions of the Brownian bridge,
each defined by cutting the path of the bridge at an increasing sequence of
recursively defined random times in the zero set of the bridge. The random
mapping asymptotics entail some remarkable identities involving the random
occupation measures of the bridge fragments defined by these decompositions. We
derive various extensions of these identities for Brownian and Bessel bridges,
and characterize the distributions of various path fragments involved, using
the theory of Poisson processes of excursions for a self-similar Markov process
whose zero set is the range of a stable subordinator of index between 0 and 1.
