Parent compounds AFe2As2 (A=Ca, Ba, Eu) of the 122 family of the iron-based
superconductors have been studied by 57Fe Moessbauer spectroscopy in the
temperature range 4.2 K - ~300 K. Spin density waves (SDW) have been found with
some confidence. They are either incommensurate with the lattice period or the
ratio of the respective periods is far away from ratio of small integers. SDW
shape is very unconventional i.e. differs from the sinusoidal shape. Magnetic
order starts with lowered temperature as narrow sheets of the significant
electron spin density separated by areas with very small spin density. Magnetic
sheets are likely to be ordered in the alternate anti-ferromagnetic fashion as
the material as whole behaves similarly to collinear anti-ferromagnet. Further
lowering of temperature simply expands sheet thickness leading to the near
triangular SDW. Finally, sheets fill the whole available space and almost
rectangular shape of SDW is reached. Substantial maximum amplitude of SDW
appears at the temperature just below the magnetic onset temperature, and this
maximum amplitude increases slightly with lowering temperature. The square root
from the mean squared hyperfine field behaves versus temperature according to
the universality class (1, 2), i.e., with the electronic spin space having
dimensionality equal unity and the real space having dimensionality equal two.
The more or less pronounced tail above transition temperature due to the
development of incoherent SDW is seen.
