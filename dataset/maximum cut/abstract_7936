We introduce a category whose objects are stationary set preserving complete
boolean algebras and whose arrows are complete homomorphisms with a stationary
set preserving quotient. We show that the cut of this category at a rank
initial segment of the universe of height a super compact which is a limit of
super compact cardinals is a stationary set preserving partial order which
forces $MM^{++}$ and collapses its size to become the second uncountable
cardinal. Next we argue that any of the known methods to produce a model of
$MM^{++}$ collapsing a superhuge cardinal to become the second uncountable
cardinal produces a model in which the cutoff of the category of stationary set
preserving forcings at any rank initial segment of the universe of large enough
height is forcing equivalent to a presaturated tower of normal filters. We let
$MM^{+++}$ denote this statement and we prove that the theory of
$L(Ord^{\omega_1})$ with parameters in $P(\omega_1)$ is generically invariant
for stationary set preserving forcings that preserve $MM^{+++}$. Finally we
argue that the work of Larson and Asper\'o shows that this is a next to optimal
generalization to the Chang model $L(Ord^{\omega_1})$ of Woodin's generic
absoluteness results for the Chang model $L(Ord^{\omega})$. It remains open
whether $MM^{+++}$ and $MM^{++}$ are equivalent axioms modulo large cardinals
and whether $MM^{++}$ suffices to prove the same generic absoluteness results
for the Chang model $L(Ord^{\omega_1})$.
