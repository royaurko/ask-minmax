We investigate the discovery potential of the LHC experiments for R-parity
violating supersymmetric models with a stau as the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP) in the framework of minimal supergravity. We classify the final
states according to their phenomenology for different R-parity violating decays
of the LSP. We then develop event selection cuts for a specific benchmark
scenario with promising signatures for the first beyond the Standard Model
discoveries at the LHC. For the first time in this model, we perform a detailed
signal over background analysis. We use fast detector simulations to estimate
the discovery significance taking the most important Standard Model backgrounds
into account. Assuming an integrated luminosity of 1 inverse femtobarn at a
center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, we perform scans in the parameter space around
the benchmark scenario we consider. We then study the feasibility to estimate
the mass of the stau-LSP. We briefly discuss difficulties, which arise in the
identification of hadronic tau decays due to small tau momenta and large
particle multiplicities in our scenarios.
