A simple coupled oscillator system with chemotaxis is introduced to study
morphogenesis of cellular slime molds. The model successfuly explains the
migration of pseudoplasmodium which has been experimentally predicted to be
lead by cells with higher intrinsic frequencies. Results obtained predict that
its velocity attains its maximum value in the interface region between total
locking and partial locking and also suggest possible roles played by partial
synchrony during multicellular development.
