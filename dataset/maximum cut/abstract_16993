Most searches for ultra-high energy (UHE) astrophysical neutrinos look for
radio emission from the electromagnetic and hadronic showers produced in their
interactions. The radio frequency spectrum and angular distribution depend on
the shower development, so are sensitive to the interaction cross sections. At
energies above about 10^{16} eV (in ice), the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM)
effect significantly reduces the cross sections for the two dominant
electromagnetic interactions: bremsstrahlung and pair production. At higher
energies, above about 10^{20} eV, the photonuclear cross section becomes larger
than that for pair production, and direct pair production and electronuclear
interactions become dominant over bremsstrahlung. The electron interaction
length reaches a maximum around 10^{21} eV, and then decreases slowly as the
electron energy increases further. In this regime, the growth in the photon
cross section and electron energy loss moderates the rise in nu_e shower
length, which rises from ~10 m at 10^{16} eV to ~50 m at 10^{19} eV and ~100 m
at 10^{20} eV, but only to ~1 km at 10^{24} eV. In contrast, without
photonuclear and electronuclear interactions, the shower length would be over
10 km at 10^{24} eV.
