Far-ultraviolet spectra of Venus and Mars in the range 820-1840 A at 4 A
resolution were obtained on 13 and 12 March 1995, respectively, by the Hopkins
Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT), which was part of the Astro-2 observatory on the
Space Shuttle Endeavour. Longward of 1250 A, the spectra of both planets are
dominated by emission of the CO Fourth Positive band system and strong OI and
CI multiplets. In addition, CO Hopfield-Birge bands, B - X (0,0) at 1151 A and
C - X (0,0) at 1088 A, are detected for the first time, and there is a weak
indication of the E - X (0,0) band at 1076 A in the spectrum of Venus. The B -
X band is blended with emission from OI 1152. Modeling the relative intensities
of these bands suggests that resonance fluorescence of CO is the dominant
source of the emission, as it is for the Fourth Positive system. Shortward of
Lyman-alpha, other emission features detected include OII 834, OI lambda 989,
HI Lyman-beta, and NI 1134 and 1200. For Venus, the derived disk brightnesses
of the OI, OII, and HI features are about one-half of those reported by Hord et
al. (1991) from Galileo EUV measurements made in February 1990. This result is
consistent with the expected variation from solar maximum to solar minimum. The
ArI 1048, 1066 doublet is detected only in the spectrum of Mars and the derived
mixing ratio of Ar is of the order of 2%, consistent with previous
determinations.
