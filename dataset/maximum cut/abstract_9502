The Pierre Auger Observatory is currently the largest observatory of Ultra
High Energy Cosmic Rays. Having more data collected than any previous
experiment and using a hybrid technique, it can provide important information
to unveil the origin and composition of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays. Here, we
report some results of the Pierre Auger Observatory, namely on the energy
spectrum, average depth of the shower maximum and its fluctuations (both
sensitive to primary mass composition) and number of muons at ground.
