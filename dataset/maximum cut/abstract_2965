Different search strategies for supersymmetry have been employed by the LHC
general-purpose experiments using early data. As proven by their early results,
these strategies are promising, but raise the question of how well they will
generalize for the future. We address this question by studying two thousand
phenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model parameter space points
that come from a fit to indirect and cosmological data. We examine the 5 sigma
discoverability of the points employing a typical ATLAS-type search based on
missing transverse momentum (MET), a search based on an optimised MT2 cut and a
combination of the two, taking into account standard model backgrounds. The
discovery reach of the strategies can depend strongly on the systematic
uncertainty in the background, subject to the stringency of the cuts and the
details of the background simulation. By combining the MET and MT2 based
strategies, with an integrated luminosity of 1 fb^-1 (10 fb^-1) at 7 TeV, 4-8%
(42%) of the points are discoverable, depending on the systematic uncertainty
on the background. At 14 TeV and with 10 fb^-1, 96% of the points are
discoverable. While the majority of points can be discovered by both strategies
at sqrt{s} = 14 TeV and with 1 fb^-1, there are some that are left undiscovered
by a MET search strategy, but which are discovered by the MT2 strategy, and
vice versa, therefore it is essential that one performs both in parallel. We
discuss some of the factors that can make points more difficult to observe.
