The doping and temperature dependence of the electronic Raman response in
cuprate superconductors is studied within the framework of the kinetic energy
driven superconducting mechanism for the t-J model. It is shown that the
temperature dependent depletion at low-energy shifts is faster in B_{1g}
symmetry than in B_{2g} symmetry. In analogy to the domelike shape of the
doping dependent superconducting transition temperature, the pair-breaking peak
energy in B_{2g} channel increases with increasing doping in the underdoped
regime, and reaches a maximum in the optimal doping, then decreases in the
overdoped regime. Moreover, the overall Cooper pair density increases with
increasing doping in the underdoped regime.
