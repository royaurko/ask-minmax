We consider a population of genotype sequences evolving on a rugged fitness
landscape with many local fitness peaks. The population walks uphill until it
encounters a local fitness maximum. We find that the statistical properties of
the walk length depend on whether the underlying fitness distribution has a
finite mean. If the mean is finite, all the walk length cumulants grow with the
sequence length but approach a constant otherwise. Experimental implications of
our analytical results are also discussed.
