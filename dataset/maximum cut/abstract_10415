In this work some families of relativistic anisotropic charged fluid spheres
have been obtained by solving Einstein-Maxwell field equations with preferred
form of one of the metric potentials, a suitable forms of electric charge
distribution and pressure anisotropy functions. The resulting equation of state
(EOS) of the matter distribution has been obtained. Physical analysis shows
that the relativistic stellar structure for matter distribution obtained in
this work may reasonably model an electrically charged compact star whose
energy density associated with the electric fields is on the same order of
magnitude as the energy density of fluid matter itself (e.g. electrically
charged bare strange stars). These models permit a simple method of
systematically fixing bounds on the maximum possible mass of cold compact
electrically charged self-bound stars. It has been demonstrated numerically
that the maximum compactness and mass increase in the presence of electric
field and anisotropic pressures. Based on the analytic model developed in this
present work, the values of the relevant physical quantities have been
calculated by assuming the estimated masses and radii of some well known
potential strange star candidates like PSR J1614-2230, PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1,
and 4U 1820-30.
