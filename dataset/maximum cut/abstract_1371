We investigate the spectral response of a Brillouin amplifier in the
frequency regime within the SBS bandwidth. This is done by amplitude modulating
the pump with a low frequency, and therefore, unlike previous studies, the
spectrum of the modulated pump is, in all cases, smaller than the SBS
bandwidth. We show both theoretically and experimentally that unlike phase
modulation, which was reported in the literature, the amplitude modulation
increases the Brillouin amplifier gain, and that this effect has a very narrow
bandwidth. Only modulation frequencies that are lower than a certain cut-off
frequency increase the gain. This cut-off frequency is inversely proportional
to the fiber's length, and can therefore be arbitrarily small.
