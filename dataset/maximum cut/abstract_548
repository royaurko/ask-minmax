Maximum-likelihood decoding is one of the central algorithmic problems in
coding theory. It has been known for over 25 years that maximum-likelihood
decoding of general linear codes is NP-hard. Nevertheless, it was so far
unknown whether maximum- likelihood decoding remains hard for any specific
family of codes with nontrivial algebraic structure. In this paper, we prove
that maximum-likelihood decoding is NP-hard for the family of Reed-Solomon
codes. We moreover show that maximum-likelihood decoding of Reed-Solomon codes
remains hard even with unlimited preprocessing, thereby strengthening a result
of Bruck and Naor.
