In this paper we derive the asymptotic behaviour of the survival function of
both random sum and random maximum of log-normal risks. As for the case of
finite sum and maximum investigated in Asmussen and Rojas-Nandaypa (2008) also
for the more general setup of random sums and random maximum the principle of a
single big jump holds. We investigate both the log-normal sequences and some
related dependence structures motivated by stationary Gaussian sequences.
