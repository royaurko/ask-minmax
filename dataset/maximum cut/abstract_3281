We are interested in the maximum value achieved by the systole function over
all complete finite area hyperbolic surfaces of a given signature $(g,n)$. This
maximum is shown to be strictly increasing in terms of the number of cusps for
small values of $n$. We also show that this function is greater than a function
that grows logarithmically in function of the ratio $g/n$.
