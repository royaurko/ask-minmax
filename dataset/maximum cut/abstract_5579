We study the prospects for LHC discovery of a narrow resonance that decays to
two Higgs bosons, using the final state of two photons and two bottom jets. Our
work is motivated in part by a scenario in which two-body flavor-preserving
decays of the top squark are kinematically forbidden. Stoponium, a hadronic
bound state of the top squark and its anti-particle, will then form, and may
have a large branching fraction into the two Higgs boson final state. We
estimate the cross-section needed for a 5-sigma discovery at the 14 TeV LHC for
such a narrow di-Higgs resonance, using the invariant mass distributions of the
final state bottom jets and photons, as a function of the integrated
luminosity. The results are also applicable to any other di-Higgs resonance
produced by gluon fusion.
