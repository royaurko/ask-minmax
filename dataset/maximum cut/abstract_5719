Reliable halo mass estimation for a given galaxy system plays an important
role both in cosmology and galaxy formation studies. Here we set out to find
the way that can improve the halo mass estimation for those galaxy systems with
limited brightest member galaxies been observed. Using four mock galaxy samples
constructed from semi-analytical formation models, the subhalo abundance
matching method and the conditional luminosity functions, respectively, we find
that the luminosity gap between the brightest and the subsequent brightest
member galaxies in a halo (group) can be used to significantly reduce the
scatter in the halo mass estimation based on the luminosity of the brightest
galaxy alone. Tests show that these corrections can significantly reduce the
scatter in the halo mass estimations by $\sim 50\%$ to $\sim 70\%$ in massive
halos depending on which member galaxies are considered. Comparing to the
traditional ranking method, we find that this method works better for groups
with less than five members, or in observations with very bright magnitude cut.
