Ta$_{2}$S$_{2}$C compound undergoes superconducting transitions at $T_{cl} =
3.60 \pm 0.02$ K and $T_{cu} = 9.0 \pm 0.2$ K. The nature of successive
superconducting transitions has been studied from electrical resistivity,
linear and nonlinear AC magnetic susceptibilities. The resistivity $\rho$ at
$H$ = 0 shows a local maximum near $T_{cu}$, a kink-like behavior around
$T_{cl}$, and reduces to zero at below $T_{0}$ = 2.1 K. The $\ln T$ dependence
of $\rho$ is observed at $H$ = 50 kOe at low temperatures, which is due to
two-dimensional weak-localization effect. Below $T_{cu}$ a two-dimensional
superconducting phase occurs in each TaC layer. The linear and nonlinear
susceptibilities $\chi_{1}^{\prime\prime}$, $\chi_{3}^{\prime}$,
$\chi_{5}^{\prime}$, and $\chi_{7}^{\prime}$ as well as the difference
$\delta\chi$ ($= \chi_{FC} - \chi_{ZFC}$) between the FC and ZFC
susceptibilities, start to appear below 6.0 K, the onset temperature of
irreversibility. A drastic growth of the in-plane superconducting coherence
length below 6.0 K gives rise to a three-dimensional superconducting phase
below $T_{cl}$, through interplanar Josephson couplings between adjacent TaC
layers. The oscillatory behavior of $\chi_{3}^{\prime\prime}$,
$\chi_{5}^{\prime\prime}$, and $\chi_{7}^{\prime\prime} $ below $T_{cl}$ is
related to the nonlinear behavior arising from the thermally activated flux
flow.
