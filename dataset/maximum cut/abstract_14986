Clay and soil containing it have shrinkage curves that are qualitatively
different in shape. The objective of this work is to qualitatively show with
maximum simplicity, how a clay shrinkage curve turns into a soil shrinkage
curve. Because of the crack volume the measured shrinkage curve is not the
single-valued feature of a soil. We use a concept of the reference shrinkage
curve that is only stipulated by soil shrinkage without cracking,
single-valued, and qualitatively similar to an observed shrinkage curve. We
also use new concepts of an intra-aggregate soil structure: (i) a rigid
superficial layer of aggregates that loses water during shrinkage; and (ii)
lacunar pores (micro-cracks) inside an intra-aggregate clay that change in
volume during shrinkage. Then, through a series of consecutive steps,
illustrating each step by a separate graphic presentation, we move from a clay
shrinkage curve to a soil shrinkage curve with predicted qualitative features
that coincide with those experimentally observed in numerous soil shrinkage
publications. We thereby demonstrate the qualitative physical impact of the
intra-aggregate structure on soil shrinkage.
