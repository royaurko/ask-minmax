We employ the chiral nucleon-nucleon potential derived using the method of
unitary transformation up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) to study
bound and scattering states in the two-nucleon system. The predicted partial
wave phase shifts and mixing parameters for higher energies and higher angular
momenta beyond the ones which are fitted are mostly well described for energies
below 300 MeV. Various deuteron properties are discussed. We also apply the
next-to-leading order (NLO) potential to 3N and 4N systems. The resulting 3N
and 4N binding energies are in the same range what is found using standard NN
potentials. Experimental low-energy 3N scattering observables are also very
well reproduced like for standard NN forces. Surprisingly the long standing
Ay-puzzle is resolved at NLO. The cut-off dependence of the scattering
observables is rather mild.
