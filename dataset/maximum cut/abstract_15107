We present an overview of different tomographic methods for determining the
quantum-mechanical density matrix of a single qubit: (scaled) direct inversion,
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), minimum Fisher information distance, and
Bayesian mean estimation (BME). We discuss the different prior densities in the
space of density matrices, on which both MLE and BME depend, as well as ways of
including experimental errors and of estimating tomography errors. As a measure
of the accuracy of these methods we average the trace distance between a given
density matrix and the tomographic density matrices it can give rise to through
experimental measurements. We find that the BME provides the most accurate
estimate of the density matrix, and suggest using either the pure-state prior,
if the system is known to be in a rather pure state, or the Bures prior if any
state is possible. The MLE is found to be slightly less accurate. We comment on
the extrapolation of these results to larger systems.
