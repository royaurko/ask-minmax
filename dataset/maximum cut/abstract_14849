We elucidate the theoretically maximal thermal radiation power from real
materials at a given temperature. Our results demonstrate that the thermal
radiation from real materials may be larger than the blackbody emission in free
space,and indicate that this is rooted in the high refractive index of the
materials. The refractive index contrast between the materials and environment
dictates the radiation of real materials genetically not under thermodynamic
equilibrium, but on the other hand can give rise to a larger density of
photonic modes than that of the blackbody. One key to maximize the thermal
radiation is to minimize the impedance mismatch of the materials with
environment. By following this principle, we present a design of a carbon core
coated by a four-layer transparent shell with gradually changed refractive
indexes that can emit > 30 times more power than the blackbody, which
reasonably approaches the predicted radiation maximum.
