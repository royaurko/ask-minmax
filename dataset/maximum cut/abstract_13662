In this paper fusion of visual and thermal images in wavelet transformed
domain has been presented. Here, Daubechies wavelet transform, called as D2,
coefficients from visual and corresponding coefficients computed in the same
manner from thermal images are combined to get fused coefficients. After
decomposition up to fifth level (Level 5) fusion of coefficients is done.
Inverse Daubechies wavelet transform of those coefficients gives us fused face
images. The main advantage of using wavelet transform is that it is well-suited
to manage different image resolution and allows the image decomposition in
different kinds of coefficients, while preserving the image information. Fused
images thus found are passed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
reduction of dimensions and then those reduced fused images are classified
using a multi-layer perceptron. For experiments IRIS Thermal/Visual Face
Database was used. Experimental results show that the performance of the
approach presented here achieves maximum success rate of 100% in many cases.
