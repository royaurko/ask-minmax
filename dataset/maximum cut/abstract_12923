The mean-field thermodynamic limit is studied for a class of isolated
Newtonian N-body systems whose Hamiltonian admits several invariants of motion.
It is shown that the macrostates of individual members of a statistical
equilibrium ensemble are not necessarily themselves in a state of global
thermal equilibrium in the strict sense. Yet they are always locally in
thermodynamic equilibrium, and always global maximizers of the pertinent
maximum entropy principle.
