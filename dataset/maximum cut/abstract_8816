Elliptic instability in fluids is discussed in the context of the
Lagrangian-averaged Navier-Stokes-alpha (LANS$-\alpha$) turbulence model. This
model preserves the Craik-Criminale (CC) family of solutions consisting of a
columnar eddy and a Kelvin wave. The LANS$-\alpha$ model is shown to preserve
the elliptic instability for the inviscid case. However, the model shifts the
critical stability angle. This shift increases (resp. decreases) the maximum
growth rate for long (resp. short) waves. It also introduces a band of stable
CC solutions for short waves.
