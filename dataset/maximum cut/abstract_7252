We study the impact of the convective terms on the global solvability or
finite time blow up of solutions of dissipative PDEs. We consider the model
examples of 1D Burger's type equations, convective Cahn-Hilliard equation,
generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and KdV type equations, we establish
the following common scenario: adding sufficiently strong (in comparison with
the destabilizing nonlinearity) convective terms to equation prevents the
solutions from blowing up in finite time and makes the considered system
globally well-posed and dissipative and for weak enough convective terms the
finite time blow up may occur similarly to the case when the equation does not
involve convective term.
  This kind of result has been previously known for the case of Burger's type
equations and has been strongly based on maximum principle. In contrast to
this, our results are based on the weighted energy estimates which do not
require the maximum principle for the considered problem.
