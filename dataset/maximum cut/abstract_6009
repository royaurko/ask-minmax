In this note, we consider all possible extensions G of a non-trivial perfect
group H acting faithfully on a K3 surface X. The pair (X, G) is proved to be
uniquely determined by G if the transcendental value of G is maximum. In
particular, we have G/H < Z/(2) + Z/(2), if H is the alternating group A_5 and
normal in G.
