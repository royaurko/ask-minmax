Polymer's network is treated as an anisotropic fractal with fractional
dimensionality D = 1 + \epsilon close to one. Percolation model on such a
fractal is studied. Using the real space renormalization group approach of
Migdal and Kadanoff we find threshold value and all the critical exponents to
be strongly nonanalytic functions of \epsilon, e.g. the critical exponent of
the conductivity was obtained to be \epsilon^{-2}\exp(-1-1/\epsilon). The main
part of the finite size conductivities distribution function at the threshold
was found to be universal if expressed in terms of the fluctuating variable,
which is proportional to the large power of the conductivity, but with
dimensionally-dependent low-conductivity cut-off. Its reduced central momenta
are of the order of \exp(-1/\epsilon) up to the very high order.
