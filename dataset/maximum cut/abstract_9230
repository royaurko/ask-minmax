We present an operational approach to address the in-medium behavior of
charmonium and analyze the reliability of maximum entropy method (MEM). We
study the dependences of the ratio of correlators to the reconstructed one and
the free one on the resonance's width and the continuum's threshold.
Furthermore, we discuss the issue of the default model dependence of the
spectral function obtained from MEM.
