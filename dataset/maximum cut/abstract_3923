Radio astronomy provides a unique window on the universe, allowing us to
study: non-thermal processes (galactic nuclei, quasars, pulsars) at the highest
angular resolution using VLBI, with low opacity. It is the most interesting
wave band for SETI searches. To date it has yielded 3 Nobel prizes (microwave
background, pulsars, gravitational radiation). There are both exciting
possibilities and substantial challenges for radio astronomy to remain at the
cutting edge over the next 3 decades. New instruments like ALMA and the SKA
will open up new science if the challenge of dealing human generated
interference can be met. We summarise some of the issues and technological
developments that will be essential to the future success of radio astronomy.
