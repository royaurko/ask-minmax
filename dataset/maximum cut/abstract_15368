Resolving a conjecture of Abbe, Bandeira and Hall, the contributors have recently
shown that the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the maximum
likelihood estimator achieves the sharp threshold for exactly recovering the
community structure under the binary stochastic block model of two equal-sized
clusters. The same was shown for the case of a single cluster and outliers.
Extending the proof techniques, in this paper it is shown that SDP relaxations
also achieve the sharp recovery threshold in the following cases: (1) Binary
stochastic block model with two clusters of sizes proportional to network size
but not necessarily equal; (2) Stochastic block model with a fixed number of
equal-sized clusters; (3) Binary censored block model with the background graph
being Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is given for an
SDP procedure to achieve exact recovery for the general case of a fixed number
of clusters plus outliers. These results demonstrate the versatility of SDP
relaxation as a simple, general purpose, computationally feasible methodology
for community detection.
