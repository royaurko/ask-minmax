One the most cited papers in astronomy is Ken Freeman's 1970 paper on
exponential disks in galaxies. In this contribution I review what has been done
in this area since then and what we can infer about systematic properties of
disks in galaxies from surface photometry, HI synthesis observations and
measurements of stellar kinematics. Most disks have radial truncations at $3.6
\pm 0.6$ radial scalelengths $h\subr{R}$. Galaxy disk thicknesses
$h\subr{R}/h\subr{z}= 7.3 \pm 2.2$ imply that these disk cannot be ``maximum
disks''. I briefly discuss a recent study of the ``superthin'' edge-on galaxy
IC 5249.
