Motivated by the problem about HOMO-LUMO separation that arises in
mathematical chemistry, Fowler and Pisanski introduced the notion of the
HL-index which measures how large in absolute value may be the median
eigenvalues of a graph. In this note we provide rather tight lower and upper
bounds on the maximum value of the HL-index among all graphs with given average
degree. In particular, we determine the exact value of this parameter when
restricted to chemically relevant graphs, i.e.\ graphs of maximum degree $3$,
and thus answer a question of Fowler and Pisanski. The proof provides
additional insight about eigenvalue distribution of large subcubic graphs.
