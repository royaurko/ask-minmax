Young, rapidly rotating neutron stars could accelerate protons to energies of
$\sim 1$ PeV close to the stellar surface, which scatter with x-rays from the
stellar surface through the $\Delta$ resonance and produce pions. The pions
subsequently decay to produce muon neutrinos. We find that the energy spectrum
of muon neutrinos consists of a sharp rise at $\sim 50$ TeV, corresponding to
the onset of the resonance, above which the flux drops as $\epsilon_\nu^{-2}$
up to an upper-energy cut-off that is determined by either kinematics or by the
maximum energy to which protons are accelerated. We predict event rates as high
as 10-50 km$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ from relatively young, close neutron stars. Such
fluxes would be detectable by IceCube.
