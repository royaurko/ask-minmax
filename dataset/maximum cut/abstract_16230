Cold dark matter hierarchical clustering (CDMHC) cosmology based on the Jeans
1902 criterion for gravitational instability gives predictions about the early
universe contrary to fluid mechanics and observations. Jeans neglected
viscosity, diffusivity, and turbulence: factors that determine gravitational
structure formation and contradict small structures (CDM halos) forming from
non-baryonic dark matter particle candidates. From hydro-gravitational-dynamics
(HGD) cosmology, viscous-gravitational fragmentation produced supercluster
(10^46 kg), cluster, and galaxy-mass (10^42 kg) clouds in the primordial plasma
with the large fossil density turbulence (rho_o ~ 3x10-17 kg m-3) of the first
fragmentation at 10^12 s, and a protogalaxy linear and spiral clump morphology
reflecting maximum stretching near vortex lines of the plasma turbulence at the
10^13 s plasma-gas transition. Gas protogalaxies fragmented into
proto-globular-star-cluster mass (10^36 kg) clumps of protoplanet gas clouds
that are now frozen as earth-mass (10^24-^25 kg) Jovian planets of the baryonic
dark matter, about 30,000,000 rogue planets per star. Observations contradict
the CDMHCC prediction of large explosive Population III first stars at 10^16 s,
but support the immediate gentle formation of small Population II first stars
at 10^13 s in globular-star-clusters from HGD.
