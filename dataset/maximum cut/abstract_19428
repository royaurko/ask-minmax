We present the statistics of the ratio, ${\mathrm R}$, between the prompt and
afterglow "plateau" fluxes of GRB. This we define as the ratio between the mean
prompt energy flux in the {\em Swift} BAT and the {\em Swift} XRT, immediately
following the steep transition between these two states and the beginning of
the afterglow stage referred to as the "plateau". Like the distribution of
other GRB observables, the histogram of ${\mathrm R}$ is close to log-normal,
with maximum at ${\mathrm R = R}_{\rm m} \simeq 2,000$, FWHM of about 2 decades
and with the entire distribution spanning about 6 decades in the value of
${\mathrm R}$. We note that the peak of the distribution is close to the
proton-to-electron mass ratio $({\mathrm R}_{\rm m} \simeq m_p/m_e = 1836)$, as
proposed by us earlier, on the basis of a specific model for the conversion of
the GRB blast wave kinetic energy into radiation, before any similar analysis
were made. It therefore appears that, in addition to the values of the energy
of peak luminosity ${E_{\rm pk}\sim m_{e} c^2}$, GRB present us with one more
quantity with an apparently characteristic value. The fact that the values of
both these quantities (i.e. $E_{\rm pk}$ and ${\mathrm R}$) comply with those
implied by the same specific model devised to account for an altogether
different issue, namely the efficient conversion of the GRB blast wave kinetic
energy into radiation, argues favorably for its underlying assumptions.
