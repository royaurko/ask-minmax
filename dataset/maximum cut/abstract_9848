We find an expression for mass of spherically symmetric system solving
Euler-Lagrangian equation by Homotopy Perturbation Method. With the help of
this expression and the Einstien Field equations we obtain an interior
solutions set. Thereafter we explain different aspects of the solution
describing the system in connection to mass, density, pressures, energy,
stability, mass-radius ratio, compactness factor and surface redshift. This
analysis shows that all the physical properties, in connection to brown dwarf
stars, are valid with the observed features except that of stability of the
model which seems suffers from instability.
