For a left-compressed intersecting family \A contained in [n]^(r) and a set X
contained in [n], let \A(X) = {A in \A : A intersect X is non-empty}. Borg
asked: for which X is |\A(X)| maximised by taking \A to be all r-sets
containing the element 1? We determine exactly which X have this property, for
n sufficiently large depending on r.
