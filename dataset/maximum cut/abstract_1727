The maximum likelihood degree (ML degree) measures the algebraic complexity
of a fundamental computational problem in statistics: maximum likelihood
estimation. The Euler characteristic is a classic topological invariant that
enjoys many nice properties. In this paper, we use Euler characteristics to
prove an outstanding conjecture by Hauenstein, the first contributor, and Sturmfels;
we prove a closed form expression for the ML degree of 3 by n rank 2 matrices.
More broadly, we show how these techniques give a recursive expression for the
ML degree of m by n rank 2 matrices.
