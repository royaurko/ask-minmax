We study a model of a lattice gas with orientational degrees of freedom which
resemble the formation of hydrogen bonds between the molecules. In this model,
which is the simplified version of the Henriques-Barbosa model, no distinction
is made between donors and acceptors in the bonding arms. We solve the model in
the grand-canonical ensemble on a Husimi lattice built with hexagonal
plaquettes with a central site. The ground-state of the model, which was
originally defined on the triangular lattice, is exactly reproduced by the
solution on this Husimi lattice. In the phase diagram, one gas and two liquid
(high density-HDL and low density-LDL) phases are present. All phase
transitions (GAS-LDL, GAS-HDL, and LDL-HDL) are discontinuous, and the three
phases coexist at a triple point. A line of temperatures of maximum density
(TMD) in the isobars is found in the metastable GAS phase, as well as another
line of temperatures of minimum density (TmD) appears in the LDL phase, part of
it in the stable region and another in the metastable region of this phase.
These findings are at variance with simulational results for the same model on
the triangular lattice, which suggested a phase diagram with two critical
points. However, our results show very good quantitative agreement with the
simulations, both for the coexistence loci and the densities of particles and
of hydrogen bonds. We discuss the comparison of the simulations with our
results.
