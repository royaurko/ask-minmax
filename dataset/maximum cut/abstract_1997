We suggest that the low viscosity in close binary accretion disks during
quiescence is due to magnetic fields from the companion star. In very late
evolutionary phase the companion stars become brown dwarfs and have cooled down
to such low a temperature that this process cannot work anymore. The extremely
low viscosity in WZ Sge stars supports this connection between companion stars
and viscosity. We further suggest that magnetic activity in such very cool
stars is cut off by their poor electric conductivity.
