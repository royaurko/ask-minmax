We investigate the role of lifetime effects from resonances and emission
duration tails in femtoscopy at RHIC in two Blast-Wave models. We find the
non-Gaussian components compare well with published source imaged data, but the
value of R_out obtained from Gaussian fits is not insensitive to the
non-Gaussian contributions when realistic acceptance cuts are applied to
models.
