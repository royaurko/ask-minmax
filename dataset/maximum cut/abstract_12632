We investigate a random matrix model [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 65} 024302 (2002] for
the decay-out of a superdeformed band as a function of the parameters:
$\Gamma^\downarrow/\Gamma_S$, $\Gamma_N/D$, $\Gamma_S/D$ and $\Delta/D$. Here
$\Gamma^\downarrow$ is the spreading width for the mixing of an SD state $|0>$
with a normally deformed (ND) doorway state $|d>$, $\Gamma_S$ and $\Gamma_N$
are the electromagnetic widths of the the SD and ND states respectively, $D$ is
the mean level spacing of the compound ND states and $\Delta$ is the energy
difference between $|0>$ and $|d>$. The maximum possible effect of an
order-chaos transition is inferred from analytical and numerical calculations
of the decay intensity in the limiting cases for which the ND states obey
Poisson and GOE statistics. Our results show that the sharp attenuation of the
decay intensity cannot be explained solely by an order-chaos transition.
