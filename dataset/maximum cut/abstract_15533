We experimentally investigate the dynamics of water cooled from below at 0^oC
and heated from above. Taking advantage of the unusual property that water's
density maximum is at about 4^oC, this set-up allows us to simulate in the
laboratory a turbulent convective layer adjacent to a stably stratified layer,
which is representative of atmospheric and stellar conditions. High precision
temperature and velocity measurements are described, with a special focus on
the convectively excited internal waves propagating in the stratified zone.
Most of the convective energy is at low frequency, and corresponding waves are
localized to the vicinity of the interface. However, we show that some energy
radiates far from the interface, carried by shorter horizontal wavelength,
higher frequency waves. Our data suggest that the internal wave field is
passively excited by the convective fluctuations, and the wave propagation is
correctly described by the dissipative linear wave theory.
