We report single and multiband linear polarizers for terahertz (THz)
frequencies using cut-wire metamaterials (MM). The MMs are designed by finite
element method, fabricated by electron beam lithography, and characterized by
THz time-domain spectroscopy. The MM unit cells consist of single or multiple
length cut-wire pads of gold on semi-insulating Gallium Arsenide for single or
multiple band polarizers. The dependence of the resonance frequency of the
single band polarizer on the length of the cut-wires is explained based a
transmission line model.
