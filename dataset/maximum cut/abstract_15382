For ITER-relevant runaway electron studies, such as suppression, mitigation,
termination and/or control of runaway beam, obtaining the runaway electrons
after the disruption is important. In this paper we report on the first
achieved discharges with post-disruptive runaway electron beam, entitled
"runaway plateau", in the COMPASS tokamak. The runaway plateau is produced by
massive gas injection of argon. Almost all of the disruptions with runaway
electron plateaus occurred during the plasma current ramp-up phase. Comparison
between the Ar injection discharges with and without plateau has been done for
various parameters. Parametrisation of the discharges shows that COMPASS
disruptions fulfill the range of parameters important for the runaway plateau
occurrence. These parameters include electron density, electric field,
disruption speed, effective safety factor, maximum current quench electric
field. In addition to these typical parameters, the plasma current value just
before the massive gas injection surprisingly proved to be important.
