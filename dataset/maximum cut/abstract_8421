The Hall constant R_H is considered for the stripe structures. In order to
explain the vanishing of R_H in LNSCO at x = 1/8, we use the relation of R_H to
the Drude weight D as well as direct numerical calculation, to obtain results
within the t-J model, where the stripes are imposed via a charge potential and
a staggered magnetic field. The origin of R_H ~ 0 is related to a maximum in D
and the minimal kinetic energy in stripes with a hole filling ~ 1/2. The same
argument indicates on a possibility of R_H ~ 0 in the whole range of static
stripes for x < 1/8.
