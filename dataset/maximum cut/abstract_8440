We consider an ensemble of coupled nonlinear noisy oscillators demonstrating
in the thermodynamic limit an Ising-type transition. In the ordered phase and
for finite ensembles stochastic flips of the mean field are observed with the
rate depending on the ensemble size. When a small periodic force acts on the
ensemble, the linear response of the system has a maximum at a certain system
size, similar to the stochastic resonance phenomenon. We demonstrate this
effect of system size resonance for different types of noisy oscillators and
for different ensembles -- lattices with nearest neighbors coupling and
globally coupled populations. The Ising model is also shown to demonstrate the
system size resonance.
