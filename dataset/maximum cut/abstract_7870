In this paper we demonstrate connections between three seemingly unrelated
concepts.
  (1) The discrete isoperimetric problem in the infinite binary tree with all
the leaves at the same level, $ {\mathcal T}_{\infty}$:
  The $n$-th edge isoperimetric number $\delta(n)$ is defined to be
$\min_{|S|=n, S \subset V({\mathcal T}_{\infty})} |(S,\bar{S})|$, where
$(S,\bar{S})$ is the set of edges in the cut defined by $S$.
  (2) Signed almost binary partitions: This is the special case of the
coin-changing problem where the coins are drawn from the set
  ${\pm (2^d - 1): $d$ is a positive integer}$. The quantity of interest is
$\tau(n)$, the minimum number of coins necessary to make change for $n$ cents.
  (3) Certain Meta-Fibonacci sequences: The Tanny sequence is defined by
$T(n)=T(n{-}1{-}T(n{-}1))+T(n{-}2{-}T(n{-}2))$ and the Conolly sequence is
defined by $C(n)=C(n{-}C(n{-}1))+C(n{-}1{-}C(n{-}2))$, where the initial
conditions are $T(1) = C(1) = T(2) = C(2) = 1$.
  These are well-known "meta-Fibonacci" sequences.
  The main result that ties these three together is the following: $$ \delta(n)
= \tau(n) = n+ 2 + 2 \min_{1 \le k \le n} (C(k) - T(n-k) - k).$$ Apart from
this, we prove several other results which bring out the interconnections
between the above three concepts.
