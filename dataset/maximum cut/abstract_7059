Experimental results recently published by C. Poher provide independent
evidence for the anomalous radiation emitted from YBCO electrodes under short,
intense current pulses previously reported by E. Podkletnov. The generation
conditions are somewhat different: lower applied voltage, longer duration of
the pulses, absence of a discharge chamber. The microstructure of the emitter
is also different in the two cases. While Podkletnov's radiation beam is
collimated, Poher's beam is more or less diverging, depending on the emitter
type. In coincidence with the radiation emission Poher measures a strong recoil
of the emitter, with maximum momentum of the order of 1 kg m/s. We compare and
discuss several details of the experiments and give a brief outline of the
proposed theoretical explanations. We also report numerical simulations of the
maximum electromagnetic recoil force on a Josephson junction, as a benchmark
for a possible alternative explanation of the recoil.
