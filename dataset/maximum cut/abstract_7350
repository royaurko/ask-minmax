An observed correlation Ep \propto (E_{iso})^{1/2} extending from Gamma-ray
Bursts (GRBs) to X-ray flashes (XRFs) poses problems both for a power-law
universal jet model where the energy per solid angle decreases as the inverse
square of the angle respect to the jet axis, and for a conical jet model with a
uniform energy density within the jet beam and a sharp energy cut-off at the
jet edge. Here we show that the current GRB-XRF prompt emission/afterglow data
can be understood in terms of a picture in which the GRB-XRF jets are
quasi-universal and structured, with a Gaussian-like or similar structure,
i.e., one where the jet has a characteristic angle, with a mild variation of
energy inside and a rapid (e.g. exponential) decrease of energy outside of it.
A Monte Carlo simulation shows that the current data is compatible with such a
quasi-universal Gaussian jet with a typical opening angle of 5.7(+3.4)(-2.1)
degrees, and with a standard jet energy of about log (E_j/1 erg)= 51.1+-0.3.
According to this model, the true-to-observed number ratio of the whole GRB-XRF
population is about 14 with the current instrumental sensitivity.
