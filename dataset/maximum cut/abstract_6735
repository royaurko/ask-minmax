We study the winding number dependence of the stationary states of a
Bose-Einstein condensate in a ring-shaped lattice. The system is obtained by
confining atoms in a toroidal trap with equally spaced radial barriers. We
calculate the energy and angular momentum as functions of the winding number
and the barrier height for two quite distinct particle numbers. In both cases
we observe two clearly differentiated regimes. For low barriers, metastable
vortex states are obtained up to a maximum winding number which depends on the
particle number and barrier height. In this regime, the angular momentum and
energy show, respectively, almost linear and quadratic dependences on the
winding number. For large barrier heights, on the other hand, stationary states
are obtained up to a maximum winding number which depends only on the number of
lattice sites, whereas energy and angular momentum are shown to be sinusoidal
functions of the winding number.
