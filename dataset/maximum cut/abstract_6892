Charmonia spectral functions at finite temperature are studied using QCD sum
rules in combination with the maximum entropy method. This approach enables us
to directly obtain the spectral function from the sum rules, without having to
introduce any specific assumption about its functional form. As a result, it is
found that while J/psi and eta_c manifest themselves as significant peaks in
the spectral function below the deconfinement temperature T_c, they quickly
dissolve into the continuum and almost completely disappear at temperatures
between 1.0 T_c and 1.1 T_c.
