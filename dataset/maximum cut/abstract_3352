In this paper we study the maximum number $N$ of limit cycles that can
exhibit a planar piecewise linear differential system formed by two pieces
separated by a straight line. More precisely, we prove that this maximum number
satisfies $2\leq N \leq 3$ if one of the two linear differential systems has
its equilibrium point on the straight line of discontinuity.
