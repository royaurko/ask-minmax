Given a directed graph, an acyclic set is a set of vertices inducing a
subgraph with no directed cycle. In this note we show that there exist oriented
planar graphs of order $n$ for which the size of the maximum acyclic set is at
most $\lceil \frac{n+1}{2} \rceil$, for any $n$. This disproves a conjecture of
Harutyunyan and shows that a question of Albertson is best possible.
