We address the issue of three-quark clusters in a medium of finite
temperatures and densities. We use the light front approach and utilize a Green
function formalism. We consider first the isolated case using a zero-range
interaction and introducing an invariant cut-off and then medium effects. The
Mott lines are shown for different values of the cut-off.
