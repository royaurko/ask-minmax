We test predictability on asset price using stock selection rules based on
maximum drawdown and consecutive recovery. Monthly momentum- and weekly
contrarian-style portfolios ranked by the alternative selection criteria are
implemented in various asset classes. Regardless of market, the alternative
ranking rules are superior in forecasting asset prices and capturing
cross-sectional return differentials. In a monthly period, alternative
portfolios constructed by maximum drawdown measures dominate other momentum
portfolios including the cumulative return-based momentum portfolios.
Recovery-related stock selection criteria are the best ranking measures for
predicting mean-reversion in a weekly scale. Prediction on future directions
becomes more consistent, because the alternative portfolios are less riskier in
various reward-risk measures such as Sharpe ratio, VaR, CVaR and maximum
drawdown. In the Carhart four-factor analysis, higher factor-neutral intercepts
for the alternative strategies are another evidence for the robust prediction
by the alternative stock selection rules.
