We report a study of the central exclusive production of $\pi^{+} \pi^{-}$
and $K^{+}K^{-}$ pairs in high energy hadron-hadron collisions. The amplitude
is calculated in the Regge approach including both pomeron and secondary
reggeon exchanges and absorption effects due to proton-proton interaction and
$\pi\pi$ ($KK$) rescattering. We discuss a measurement of exclusive production
of a scalar $\chi_{c0}$ meson via $\chi_{c0} \to \pi^{+} \pi^{-}$, $K^{+}
K^{-}$ decay. We find that the relative contribution of resonance states and
the $\pi\pi$ ($KK$) continuum strongly depend on the cut on pion (kaon)
transverse momentum. We compare the results with the existing experimental data
and present predictions for the RHIC, Tevatron and LHC colliders. We discuss
also the $f_{2}(1270)$ meson production mediated by an effective tensor pomeron
exchanges.
