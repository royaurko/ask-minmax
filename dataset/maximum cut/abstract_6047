Let $K$ be a convex body and $K^\circ$ its polar body. Call
$\phi(K)=\frac{1}{|K||K^\circ|}\int_K\int_{K^\circ}< x,y>^2 dxdy$. It is
conjectured that $\phi(K)$ is maximum when $K$ is the euclidean ball. In
particular this statement implies the Blaschke-Santalo inequality. We verify
this conjecture when $K$ is restricted to be a $p$--ball.
