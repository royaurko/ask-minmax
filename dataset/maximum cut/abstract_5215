We analyze Aharonov-Bohm radiation of charged fermions from oscillating
solenoids and cosmic strings. We find that the angular pattern of the radiation
has features that differ significantly from that for bosons. For example,
fermionic radiation in the lowest harmonic is approximately isotropically
distributed around an oscillating solenoid, whereas for bosons the radiation is
dipolar. We also investigate the spin polarization of the emitted
fermion-antifermion pair. Fermionic radiation from kinks and cusps on cosmic
strings is shown to depend linearly on the ultraviolet cut-off, suggesting
strong emission at an energy scale comparable to the string energy scale.
