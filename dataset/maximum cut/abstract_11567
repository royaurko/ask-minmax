We present the large-scale sidereal anisotropy ofgalactic cosmic-ray
intensity in the multi-TeV region observed with the Tibet-IIIair shower array
during the period from 1999 through 2003. The sidereal daily variation of
cosmic rays observed in this experiment shows an excess of relative intensity
around $4\sim7 $ hours local sidereal time, as well as a deficit around 12
hours local sidereal time. While the amplitude of the excess is not significant
when averaged over all declinations, the excess in individual declinaton bands
becomes larger and clearer as the viewing direction moves toward the south. The
maximum phase of the excess intensity changes from $\sim$7 at the northern
hemisphere to $\sim$4 hours at the equatorial region. We also show that both
the amplitude and the phase of the first harmonic vector of the daily variation
are remarkably independent of primary energy in the multi-TeV region. This is
the first result determining the energy and declination dependences of the full
24-hour profiles of the sidereal daily variation in the multi-TeV region with a
single air shower experiment.
