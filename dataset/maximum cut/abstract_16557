This paper extends the semiconservative quasispecies equations to account for
arbitrary post-replication lesion repair efficiency. Such an extension could be
an important tool for understanding processes such as cancer development and
stem cell growth. Starting from the quasispecies dynamics over the space of
genomes, we derive an equivalent dynamics over the space of ordered sequence
pairs. From this set of equations, we are able to derive the infinite sequence
length form of the dynamics for a class of ``master-genome''-based fitness
landscapes. We use these equations to solve for a ``generalized''
single-fitness-peak landscape, where the master genome can sustain a maximum
number of lesions and remain viable. The central pattern that emerges from our
studies is that imperfect lesion repair often leads to increased mutational
robustness over semiconservative replication with completely efficient lesion
repair. The reason for this is that imperfect lesion repair breaks some of the
correlation between the parent and daughter strands, thereby preventing
replication errors from destroying the information in the original genome. The
result is a delayed error catastrophe over that expected from the original
semiconservative quasispecies model. In particular, we show that when only of
the strands is necessary for conferring viability, then, when lesion repair is
turned off, a semiconservatively replicating system becomes an effectively
conservatively replicating one.
