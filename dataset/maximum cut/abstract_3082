In this paper, we first introduce the concept of elementary linear subspace,
which has similar properties to those of a set of coordinates. Using this new
concept, we derive properties of maximum rank distance (MRD) codes that
parallel those of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. Using these
properties, we show that the decoder error probability of MRD codes with error
correction capability t decreases exponentially with t^2 based on the
assumption that all errors with the same rank are equally likely. We argue that
the channel based on this assumption is an approximation of a channel corrupted
by crisscross errors.
