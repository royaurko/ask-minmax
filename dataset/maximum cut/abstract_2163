The total $\tau$ hadronic width can be accurately calculated using
analyticity and the operator product expansion. The theoretical analysis of
this observable is updated to include all available perturbative and
non-perturbative corrections. The experimental determination of
$\alpha_s(M_\tau^2)$ and its actual uncertainties are discussed.
