We study the list-decoding problem of alternant codes, with the notable case
of classical Goppa codes. The major consideration here is to take into account
the size of the alphabet, which shows great influence on the list-decoding
radius. This amounts to compare the \emph{generic} Johnson bound to the
\emph{$q$-ary} Johnson bound. This difference is important when $q$ is very
small. Essentially, the most favourable case is $q=2$, for which the decoding
radius is greatly improved, notably when the relative minimum distance gets
close to 1/2. Even though the announced result, which is the list-decoding
radius of binary Goppa codes, is new, it can be rather easily made up from
previous sources (V. Guruswami, R. M. Roth and I. Tal, R .M. Roth), which may
be a little bit unknown, and in which the case of binary Goppa codes has
apparently not been thought at. Only D. J. Bernstein treats the case of binary
Goppa codes in a preprint. References are given in the introduction. We propose
an autonomous treatment and also a complexity analysis of the studied
algorithm, which is quadratic in the blocklength $n$, when decoding at some
distance of the relative maximum decoding radius, and in $O(n^7)$ when reaching
the maximum radius.
