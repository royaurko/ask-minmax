An improved method is presented for the numerical evaluation of multi-loop
integrals in dimensional regularization. The technique is based on
Mellin-Barnes representations, which have been used earlier to develop
algorithms for the extraction of ultraviolet and infrared divergencies. The
coefficients of these singularities and the non-singular part can be integrated
numerically. However, the numerical integration often does not converge for
diagrams with massive propagators and physical branch cuts. In this work,
several steps are proposed which substantially improve the behavior of the
numerical integrals. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated by calculating
several two-loop examples, some of which have not been known before.
