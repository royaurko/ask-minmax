The properties of wave-like helically twisted normal mode structures on
steady relativistic jets are summarized. Wave speeds are a function of the
wavelength and less than the jet speed. However, normal mode interference can
lead to both stationary and superluminal phase effects. A maximum pressure
fluctuation criterion suggested by numerical simulations of axisymmetric
relativistic jets is used to find the maximum asymmetric jet distortions and
velocity fluctuations. Cyclic transverse velocity fluctuation can lead to
variation in the flow direction on the order of the relativistic beaming angle.
Resulting variation in the Doppler boost factor can lead to significant
brightness asymmetries as helical structures twist around the jet beam. Growth
of these structures is reduced as the jet density, Lorentz factor or Mach
number are increased. Maximum jet distortion is reduced as the Lorentz factor
increases and this suggests a reduction in mass entrainment or other non-linear
disruptive processes that influence the morphological development of radio
sources.
