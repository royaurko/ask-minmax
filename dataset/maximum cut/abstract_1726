We calculate the probability $p_c$ that the maximum of a reflected Brownian
motion $U$ is achieved on a complete excursion, i.e.
$p_c:=P\big(\overline{U}(t)=U^*(t)\big)$ where $\overline{U}(t)$ (respectively
$U^*(t)$) is the maximum of the process $U$ over the time interval $[0,t]$
(resp. $\big[0,g(t)\big]$ where $g(t)$ is the last zero of $U$ before $t$).
