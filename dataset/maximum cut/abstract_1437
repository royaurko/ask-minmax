Motivated by the recent works of one of us [1,2] we study the holographic
dark energy in Brans-Dicke gravity with the Granda-Oliveros cut-off proposed
recently in literature. We find out that when the present model is combined
with Brans-Dicke field the transition from normal state where $w_D >-1 $ to the
phantom regime where $w_D <-1 $ for the equation of state of dark energy can be
more easily achieved for than when resort to the Einstein field equations is
made. Furthermore, the phantom crossing is more easily achieved when the matter
and the holographic dark energy undergo an exotic interaction. We also
calculate some relevant cosmological parameters and their evolution.
