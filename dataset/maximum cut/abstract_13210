We observed two surges in H-alpha from the super-active region NOAA 10484.
The first surge was associated with an SF/C4.3 class flare. The second one was
a major surge associated with a SF/C3.9 flare. This surge was also observed
with SOHO/EIT in 195 angstrom and NoRh in 17 GHz, and showed similar evolution
in these wavelengths. The major surge had an ejective funnel-shaped spray
structure with fast expansion in linear (about 1.2 x 10^5 km) and angular
(about 65 deg) size during its maximum phase. The mass motion of the surge was
along open magnetic field lines, with average velocity about 100 km/s. The
de-twisting motion of the surge reveals relaxation of sheared and twisted
magnetic flux. The SOHO/MDI magnetograms reveal that the surges occurred at the
site of companion sunspots where positive flux emerged, converged, and canceled
against surrounding field of opposite polarity. Our observations support
magnetic reconnection models for the surges and jets.
