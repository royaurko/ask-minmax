We construct the off-shell BV realization of N=1, d=10 SYM with 7 auxillary
fields. This becomes possible due to materialized ghost phenomenon. Namely,
supersymmetry ghosts are coordinates on a manifold B of 10-dimensional spinors
with pure spinors cut out. Auxillary fields are sections of a bundle over B,
and supersymmetry transformations are nonlinear in ghosts. By integrating out
axillary fields we obtain on-shell supersymmetric BV action with terms
quadratic in antifields. Exactly this on-shell BV action was obtained in our
previous paper after integration out of auxiliary fields in the framework of
Pure Spinor Superfield Formalism.
