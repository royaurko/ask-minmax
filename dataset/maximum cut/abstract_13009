Antivortices in ferromagnetic thin-film elements are in-plane magnetization
configurations with a core pointing perpendicular to the plane. By using
micromagnetic simulations, we find that magnetic antivortices gyrate on
elliptical orbits similar to magnetic vortices when they are excited by
alternating magnetic fields or by spin-polarized currents. The phase between
high-frequency excitation and antivortex gyration is investigated. In case of
excitation by spin-polarized currents the phase is determined by the
polarization of the antivortex, while for excitation by magnetic fields the
phase depends on the polarization as well as on the in-plane magnetization.
Simultaneous excitation by a current and a magnetic field can lead to a maximum
enhancement or to an entire suppression of the amplitude of the core gyration,
depending on the angle between excitation and in-plane magnetization. This
variation of the amplitude can be used to experimentally distinguish between
spin-torque and Oersted-field driven motion of an antivortex core.
