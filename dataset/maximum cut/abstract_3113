We consider a one-dimensional model for many-electron atoms in strong
magnetic fields in which the Coulomb potential and interactions are replaced by
one-dimensional regularizations associated with the lowest Landau level. For
this model we show that the maximum number of electrons is bounded above by
2Z+1 + c sqrt{B}.
 We follow Lieb's strategy in which convexity plays a critical role. For the
case of two electrons and fractional nuclear charge, we also discuss the
critical value at which the nuclear charge becomes too weak to bind two
electrons.
