The specific heat of Nd(Y)Ba2Cu3Ox single crystals without substitution of Nd
for Ba has been measured for various oxygen contents. In comparison with
YBa2Cu3Ox, the maximum attainable transition temperature of the crystals is
about 4 K higher and shifted from x = 6.92 to x = 7.0, the highest possible
oxygen content. In spite of the difference in the Tc(x) dependences, the jump
in the specific heat DeltaC/Tc in both systems increases continuously being
maximum at x = 7.0. Bond valence sum calculations based on neutron diffraction
data point to a retarded generation of holes with increasing oxygen content in
the Nd system and a different hole distribution between the chains and the
planes in comparison to YBa2Cu3Ox accounting for the different behaviour of
both systems.
