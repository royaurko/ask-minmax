We employ an old field theory model, formulated and discussed by Born,
Infeld, Hoffman and Rosen during 1930s. Our method of cutting-gluing of
spacetimes resolves the double-valuedness in the displacement vector D(E),
pointed out by these contributors. A characteristic feature of their model is to
contain a logarithmic term, and by bringing forth such a Lagrangian anew, we
aim to attract the interest of field theorists to such a Lagrangian. We adopt
the Hoffman-Born-Infeld (HBI) Lagrangian in general relativity to construct
black holes and investigate the possibility of viable thin-shell wormholes. In
particular, the stability of thin-shell wormholes supported by normal matter in
5-dimensional Einstein-HBI-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is highlighted.
