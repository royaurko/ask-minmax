It is shown using Lund Monte Carlo that, unlike the average properties of the
hadronic system inside jets, the anisotropy of dynamical fluctuations in these
systems changes abruptly with the variation of the cut parameter $y_cut$. A
transition point exists, where the dynamical fluctuations in the hadronic
system inside jet behave like those in soft hadronic collisions. Thus the
anisotropy property of the dynamical fluctuations can serve as a probe for the
soft and hard processes in high energy collisions.
