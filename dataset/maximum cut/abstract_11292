We calculate the mean power spectrum of galaxies using published power
spectra of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. On small scales we use the power
spectrum derived from the 2-dimensional distribution of APM galaxies, on large
scales we use power spectra derived from 3-dimensional data for galaxy and
cluster samples. Spectra are reduced to real space and to the amplitude of the
power spectrum of APM galaxies. Available data indicate the presence of two
different populations in the nearby Universe. Clusters of galaxies sample a
relatively large region in the Universe where rich, medium and poor
superclusters are well represented. Their mean power spectrum has a spike on
scale 120 h^{-1}Mpc, followed by an approximate power-law spectrum of index n =
-1.9 towards small scales. The power spectrum found from LCRS and IRAS 1.2 Jy
surveys is flatter around the maximum, which may represent regions of the
Universe with medium-rich and poor superclusters.
