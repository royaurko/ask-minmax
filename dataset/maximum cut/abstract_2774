In this note, we revisit the modified diagonal cycle of Gross and Schoen. We
look at degenerations of this cycle, induced by a degeneration of the curve C,
and explain how the specialization map with respect to the central fiber
produces a higher Chow cycle. When C is non-hyperelliptic of genus three, and
degenerates to a nodal curve, the degeneration of the cycle corresponds to an
indecomposable higher Chow cycle on a curve of genus two.
