We examine how the signature of the strange-dibaryon resonances in the
barKNN-piSigmaN system shows up in the scattering amplitude on the physical
real energy axis within the framework of Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas (AGS)
equations. The so-called point method is applied to handle the three-body
unitarity cut in the amplitudes. We also discuss the possibility that the
strange-dibaryon production reactions can be used for discriminating between
existing models of the two-body barKN-piSigma system with Lambda(1405).
