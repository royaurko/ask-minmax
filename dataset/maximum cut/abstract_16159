The stellar population stripped from galaxies in clusters evolve under the
extreme conditions imposed by the intracluster (IC) medium. Intracluster stars
generally suffer very high systemic velocities, and evolve within a rarefied
and extremely hot IC medium. We present numerical simulations which aim to
explore the evolution and survival of IC Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)
envelopes and Planetary Nebula (PN) shells. Our models reflect the evolution of
a low-mass star under the observed conditions in the Virgo IC medium. We find
that the integrated hydrogen-recombination line emission of a PN is dominated
by the inner dense shell, whose evolution is unaffected by the environment. Ram
pressure stripping affects mainly the outermost IC PN shell, which hardly
influences the emission when the PN is observed as a point source. More
importantly, we find that a PN with progenitor mass of 1 Msun fades to ~30% and
10% of its maximum emission, in 5,000 and 10,000 yr respectively, disclosing an
actual PN lifetime t_PN several times shorter to what is usually adopted
(25,000 yr). This result affects the theoretical calculation of the
luminosity-specific density of IC PNe, which scales with t_PN. For t_PN=10,000
yr, our more conservative estimate, we obtain that the luminosity-specific
density of PNe is in fair agreement with the value obtained from Red Giants.
With our more realistic PN lifetime we infer a higher fraction (above 15%) of
IC starlight in the Virgo core than current estimates.
