In this study we investigate the functional behavior of the intensity in
high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron micrograph
(STEM) images. The model material is a silica particle (20 nm) gel at 5 wt%. By
assuming that the intensity response is monotonically increasing with
increasing mass thickness of silica, an estimate of the functional form is
calculated using a maximum likelihood approach. We conclude that a linear
functional form of the intensity provides a fair estimate but that a power
function is significantly better for estimating the amount of silica in the
z-direction. The work adds to the development of quantifying material
properties from electron micrographs, especially in the field of tomography
methods and three-dimensional quantitative structural characterization from a
STEM micrograph. It also provides means for direct three-dimensional
quantitative structural characterization from a STEM micrograph.
