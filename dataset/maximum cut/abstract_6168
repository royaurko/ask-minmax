We study a 1D transport equation with nonlocal velocity. First, we prove
eventual regularization of the viscous regularization when dissipation is in
the supercritical range with non-negative initial data. Next, we will prove
global regularity for solutions when dissipation is slightly supercritical.
Both results utilize a nonlocal maximum principle.
