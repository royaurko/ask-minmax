The BeppoSAX Catalog has been very recently published. In this paper we
analyze - using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method - the duration distribution
of the 1003 GRBs listed in the catalog with duration. The ML method can
identify the long and the intermediate duration groups. The short population of
the bursts is identified only at a 96% significance level. MC simulation has
been also applied and gives a similar significance level; 95%. However, the
existence of the short bursts is not a scientific question after the Compton
Gamma-Ray Observatory's observation. Our minor result is this well-known fact
that in the BeppoSAX data the short bursts are underrepresented, mainly caused
by the different triggering system. Our major result is the identification of
the intermediate group in the BeppoSAX data. Therefore, four different
satellites (CGRO, Swift, RHESSI and BeppoSAX) observed the intermediate type
Gamma-Ray Burst.
