It is generally considered that the emission of microwave zebra pattern (ZP)
structures requires high density and high temperatures, which is similar to the
situation of the flaring region where primary energy releases. Therefore, the
parameters analysis of ZPs may reveal the physical conditions of the flaring
source region. This work investigates the variations of 74 microwave ZP
structures observed by Chinese Solar Broadband Radio Spectrometer
(SBRS/Huairou) at 2.6-3.8 GHz in 9 solar flares, and found that the ratio
between the plasma density scale height LN and the magnetic field scale height
LB in emission source displays a tendency of decrease during the flaring
processes. The ratio LN/LB is about 3-5 before the maximum of flares. It
decreases to about 2 after the maximum. The detailed analysis of three typical
X-class flares implied that the variation of LN/LB during the flaring process
is most likely due to the topological changes of the magnetic field in the
flaring source region, and the step-wise decrease of LN/LB possibly reflects
the magnetic field relaxation relative to the plasma density when the flaring
energy released. This result may also constrain the solar flare modeling to
some extent.
