In this note, we revisit the algorithm of Har-Peled et. al. [HRZ07] for
computing a linear maximum margin classifier. Our presentation is self
contained, and the algorithm itself is slightly simpler than the original
algorithm. The algorithm itself is a simple Perceptron like iterative
algorithm. For more details and background, the reader is referred to the
original paper.
