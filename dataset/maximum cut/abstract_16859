The interaction of relativistic magnetized ejecta with an ambient medium is
studied for a range of structures and magnetization of the unshocked ejecta. We
particularly focus on the effect of the ambient medium on the dynamics of an
impulsive, high-sigma shell. It is found that for sufficiently high values of
the initial magnetization $\sigma_0$ the evolution of the system is
significantly altered by the ambient medium well before the shell reaches its
coasting phase. The maximum Lorentz factor of the shell is limited to values
well below $\sigma_0$; for a shell of initial energy $E=10^{52}E_{52}$ ergs and
size $r_0=10^{12}T_{30}$ cm expelled into a medium having a uniform density
$n_i$ we obtain $\Gamma_{\rm max}\simeq180(E_{52}/T_{30}^3 n_i)^{1/8}$ in the
high sigma limit. The reverse shock and any internal shocks that might form if
the source is fluctuating are shown to be very weak. The restriction on the
Lorentz factor is more severe for shells propagating in a stellar wind.
Intermittent ejection of small sub-shells doesn't seem to help, as the shells
merge while still highly magnetized. Lower sigma shells start decelerating
after reaching the coasting phase and spreading away. The properties of the
reverse shock then depend on the density profiles of the coasting shell and the
ambient medium. For a self-similar cold shell the reverse shock becomes strong
as it propagates inwards, and the system eventually approaches the self-similar
solution derived recently by Nakamura \& Shigeyama.
