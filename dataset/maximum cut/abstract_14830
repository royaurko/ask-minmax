Information on the nature of the dominant inelastic processes operative in
correlated metallic systems can be obtained from an analysis of their AC
optical response. An electron-boson spectral density can usefully be extracted.
This density is closely related to the optical scattering rate. However, in the
underdoped region of the high Tc cuprate phase diagram a new energy scale (the
pseudogap) emerges, which alters the optical scattering and needs to be taken
into account in any fit to data. This can influence the shape and strength of
the recovered boson spectral function. Including a pseudogap in an extended
maximum entropy inversion for optimally doped Bi-2212 is more consistent with
existing data than when it is left out as done previously.
