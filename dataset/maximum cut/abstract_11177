We have detected circumstellar molecular gas around a small sample of T Tauri
stars through aperture synthesis imaging of CO(2-1) emission at ~2-3''
resolution. RY Tauri, DL Tauri, DO Tauri, and AS 209 show resolved and
elongated gaseous emission. For RY Tau, the deconvolved, half-maximum radius
along the direction of elongation, PA~48deg, is 110 AU. Corresponding radii and
orientations for the other sources are: DL Tau -- 250 AU at PA~84deg; DO Tau --
350 AU at PA~160deg; AS 209 -- 290 AU at PA~138deg. RY Tau, DL Tau, and AS 209
show velocity gradients parallel to the elongation, suggesting that the
circumstellar material is rotating. RY Tau and AS 209 also exhibit
double-peaked spectra characteristic of a rotating disk. Line emission from DO
Tau is dominated by high-velocity blue-shifted gas which complicates the
interpretation. Nevertheless, there is in each case sufficient evidence to
speculate that the circumstellar emission may arise from a protoplanetary disk
similar to that from which our solar system formed.
