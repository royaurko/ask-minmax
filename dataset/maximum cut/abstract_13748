The generation of entanglement between three identical coupled cavities, each
containing a single three-level atom, is studied when the cavities exchange two
coherent photons and are in the N=2, 4, and 6 manifolds, where $N$ represents
the maximum number of photons possible in any one cavity. The combined states
of the atom and the photon in a cavity is given by a qutrit for N=2, a
five-dimensional qudit for N=4, and a seven-dimensional qudit for N=6. The
conservation of the operator $\hat{N}$ for the interacting three-cavity system
limits the total number of tripartite states to only 6, 18, and 38, rather than
the usual $3^3=27$, $5^3=125$, and $7^3 =343$ states for N=2, 4, and 6,
respectively. The deterministic generation of entanglement from general
initially unentangled tripartite states is studied in the limit of large
hopping strength, where all the solutions are analytic and given in terms of
exponential functions. Several types of resulting tripartite entanglement are
analyzed in order to obtain maximally entangled states.
