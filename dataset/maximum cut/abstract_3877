We present a combined, non-simultaneous, ASCA GIS and CGRO OSSE spectrum of
the Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC 7172, and make broad band spectral fits. The only
Seyfert 2 galaxy previously studied over such a broad band is NGC 4945. We find
that the most probable model for the data is a power law with an exponential
cut-off being affected by a neutral absorber. The best fit parameters are found
to be $\Gamma = 1.47 \pm 0.15$ and $\NH = (7.8 \pm 0.6) 10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$. The spectral index of the underlying power law of NGC 7172 has
therefore varied from 1.8 to 1.5 since the Ginga observations in 1989. For this
simple model the e-folding energy at $88^{+65}_{-28}$ keV is relatively well
constrained. The observed flux in the 2-10 keV range is $F_{2-10}=4.7
10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a small increase since
the Ginga measurement in October 1989.
