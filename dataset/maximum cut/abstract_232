Separable nucleon-nucleon potentials are calculated using inverse scattering
techniques as presented in previously published work. The dependence of the
potentials on the momentum cut-off of the scattering phase-shifts is studied.
Some comparison is made with the V-low-k potential. The effect of the cut-off
on nuclear matter binding energy calculated by standard Brueckner theory is
also presented. It is foumd that a cut-off larger than about 4 fm-1 will keep
the error to within one Mev around saturation density. While the potentials are
cut-off dependent the effective interaction represented by the Brueckner
K-matrix is less sensitive to this cut-off. This is in particular found to be
the case for the 1S0 state.
