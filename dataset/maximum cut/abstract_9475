The blow-up of a graph is obtained by replacing every vertex with a finite
collection of copies so that the copies of two vertices are adjacent if and
only if the originals are. If every vertex is replaced with the same number of
copies, then the resulting graph is called a balanced blow-up.
  We show that any graph which contains the maximum number of induced copies of
a sufficiently large balanced blow-up of H is itself essentially a blow-up of
H. This gives an asymptotic answer to a question in [BEHJ95].
