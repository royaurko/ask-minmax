This paper demonstrates the usefulness and importance of the concept of
honest times to financial modeling. It studies a financial market with asset
prices that follow jump-diffusions with negative jumps. The central building
block of the market model is its growth optimal portfolio (GOP), which
maximizes the growth rate of strictly positive portfolios. Primary security
account prices, when expressed in units of the GOP, turn out to be nonnegative
local martingales. In the proposed framework an equivalent risk neutral
probability measure need not exist. Derivative prices are obtained as
conditional expectations of corresponding future payoffs, with the GOP as
numeraire and the real world probability as pricing measure. The time when the
global maximum of a portfolio with no positive jumps, when expressed in units
of the GOP, is reached, is shown to be a generic representation of an honest
time. We provide a general formula for the law of such honest times and compute
the conditional distributions of the global maximum of a portfolio in this
framework. Moreover, we provide a stochastic integral representation for
uniformly integrable martingales whose terminal values are functions of the
global maximum of a portfolio. These formulae are model independent and
universal. We also specialize our results to some examples where we hedge a
payoff that arrives at an honest time.
