In the Standard Model, the coupling of the Higgs boson to b quarks is weak,
leading to small cross sections for producing a Higgs boson in association with
b quarks. However, Higgs bosons with enhanced couplings to b quarks, such as
occur in supersymmetric models for large values of tan beta, will be copiously
produced at both the Tevatron and the LHC in association with b quarks, which
will be an important discovery channel. We investigate the connections between
the production channels, bg -> bh and gg ->b bbar h, at next-to-leading order
(NLO) in perturbative QCD and present results for the cases with two high p_T b
jets and with one high p_T b jet at both the Tevatron the the LHC. Finally, the
total cross sections without cuts are compared between gg -> b bbar h at NLO
and b bbar ->h at NNLO.
