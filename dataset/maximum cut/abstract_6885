Shock wave reaction results in various characteristic regimes in porous
material. The geometrical and topological properties of these regimes are
highly concerned in practical applications. Via the morphological analysis to
characteristic regimes with high temperature, we investigate the thermodynamics
of shocked porous materials whose mechanical properties cover a wide range from
hyperplasticity to elasticity. It is found that, under fixed shock strength,
the total fractional area $A$ of the high-temperature regimes with $T \geq
T_{th}$ and its saturation value first increase, then decrease with the
increasing of the initial yield $\sigma_{Y0}$, where $T_{th}$ is a given
threshold value of temperature $T$. In the shock-loading procedure, the
fractional area $A(t)$ may show the same behavior if $T_{th}$ and $\sigma_{Y0}$
are chosen appropriately. Under the same $A(t)$ behavior, $T_{th}$ first
increases then decreases with $\sigma_{Y0}$. At the maximum point
$\sigma_{Y0M}$, the shock wave contributes the maximum plastic work. Around
$\sigma_{Y0M}$, two materials with different mechanical properties may share
the same $A(t)$ behavior even for the same $T_{th}$. The characteristic regimes
in the material with the larger $\sigma_{Y0}$ are more dispersed.
