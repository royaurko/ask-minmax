The unequivocal detection of entanglement between two distinct matter-wave
pulses is a significant challenge that has yet to be experimentally
demonstrated. We describe a realistic scheme to generate and detect continuous
variable entanglement between two atomic matter-wave pulses produced via
degenerate four-wave-mixing from an initially trapped Bose-Einstein condensate
loaded into a one-dimensional optical lattice. We perform a comprehensive
numerical investigation for fixed condensate parameters to determine the
maximum violation of separability and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen inequalities for
field quadrature entanglement, and describe and simulate an experimental scheme
for measuring the necessary quadratures.
