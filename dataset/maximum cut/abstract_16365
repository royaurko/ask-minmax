The off-diagonal magneto-impedance in Co-based amorphous ribbons was measured
using a pick-up coil wound around the sample. The ribbons were annealed in air
or in vacuum in the presence of a weak magnetic field. The evolution of the
first and second harmonics in the pick-up coil voltage as a function of the
current amplitude was studied. At low current amplitudes, the first harmonic
dominates in the frequency spectrum of the voltage, and at sufficiently high
current amplitudes, the amplitude of the second harmonic becomes higher than
that of the first harmonic. For air-annealed ribbons, the asymmetric two-peak
behaviour of the field dependences of the harmonic amplitudes was observed,
which is related to the coupling between the amorphous phase and surface
crystalline layers appearing after annealing. For vacuum-annealed samples, the
first harmonic has a maximum at zero external field, and the field dependence
of the second harmonic exhibits symmetric two-peak behaviour. The experimental
results are interpreted in terms of a quasi-static rotational model. It is
shown that the appearance of the second harmonic in the pick-up coil voltage is
related to the anti-symmetrical distribution of the transverse field induced by
the current. The calculated dependences are in a qualitative agreement with the
experimental data.
