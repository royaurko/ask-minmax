It is shown that there is one-to-one correspondence between two, apparently
different problems: \\ 1. The determination of the meanvalues of transverse
moments $\la \vec{k}_{\perp}^{2n} \ra $ for the nonperturbative pion wave
function $\psi(\k, x)$ and \\ 2. The evaluation of the mixed vacuum condensates
$ \la \bar{q}G_{\mu\nu}^n q\ra $. eneral properties of the theory. We define
and model $\psi(\k, x)$, satisfying all these constraints.
