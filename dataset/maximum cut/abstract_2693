We present predictions for a variety of single-inclusive observables that
stem from the production of charm and bottom quark pairs at the 7 TeV LHC. They
are obtained within the FONLL semi-analytical framework, and with two "Monte
Carlo + NLO" approaches, MC@NLO and POWHEG. Results are given for final states
and acceptance cuts that are as close as possible to those used by experimental
collaborations and, where feasible, are compared to LHC data.
