We present a 0.2-10 keV spectrum of the low-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2
obtained using the Low Energy Concentrator Spectrometer on-board Bepposax. The
spectrum can be described by a cut-off power-law model with absorption of (2.28
+/- 0.07) 10^{21} atoms/cm^2, a power-law index of 0.78 +/- 0.02 and a cut-off
energy of 4.30 +/- 0.08 keV (68% confidence errors), except at energies near ~1
keV where excess emission is present. This can be modeled by a broad Gaussian
line feature with an energy of 1.02 +/- 0.04 keV, a full width half-maximum of
0.47 +/- 0.07 keV and an equivalent width of 74 +/-^{25}_{11} eV. This result
confirms earlier reports of line emission near 1 keV and shows the intensity
and structure of the feature to be variable.
