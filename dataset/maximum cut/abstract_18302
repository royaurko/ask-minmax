Repeated imaging observations have been made of NGC 4527 with the Hubble
Space Telescope between April and June 1999, over an interval of 69 days.
Images were obtained on 12 epochs in the F555W band and on five epochs in the
F814W band. The galaxy hosted the type Ia supernova SN1991T, which showed
relatively unusual behavior by having both an abnormal spectrum near light
maximum, and a slower declining light curve than the proto-typical Branch
normal SNe Ia.
  A total of 86 variables that are putative Cepheids have been found, with
periods ranging from 7.4 days to over 70 days. From photometry with the DoPHOT
program, the de-reddened distance modulus is determined to be (m-M)_0 = 30.67
+/- 0.12 (internal uncertainty) using a subset of the Cepheid data whose
reddening and error parameters are secure. A parallel analysis of the Cepheids
using photometry with ROMAFOT yields (m -M)_0 =30.82 +/- 0.11. The final
adopted modulus is (m -M)_0 =30.74 +/- 0.12 +/- 0.12 (d=14.1 +/- 0.8 +/- 0.8
Mpc).
  The photometric data for SN1991T are used in combination with the Cepheid
distance to NGC 4527 to obtain the absolute magnitude for this supernova of
M_V^0(max) = -19.85 +/- 0.29. The relatively large uncertainty is a result of
the range in estimates of the reddening to the supernova. Thus SN1991T is seen
to be only moderately brighter (by ~ 0.3 mag) than the mean for
spectroscopically normal supernovae, although magnitude differences of up to
0.6 mag cannot be ruled out.
