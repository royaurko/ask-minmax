In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. {\bf A64}, 042113 (2001)] S. D\"urr proposed an
interesting multibeam generalization of the quantitative formulation of
interferometric wave-particle duality, discovered by Englert for two-beam
interferometers. The proposed generalization is an inequality that relates a
generalized measure of the fringe visibility, to certain measures of the
maximum amount of which-way knowledge that can be stored in a which-way
detector. We construct an explicit example where, with three beams in a pure
state, the scheme proposed by D\"{u}rr leads to the possibility of an ideal
which-way detector, that can achieve a better path-discrimination, at the same
time as a better fringe visibility. In our opinion, this seems to be in
contrast with the intuitive idea of complementarity, as it is implemented in
the two-beams case, where an increase in path discrimination always implies a
decrease of fringe visibility, if the beams and the detector are in pure
states.
