We present a predictive warped model of flavor, cut off at an ultraviolet
scale O(10^3) TeV, called the "Little Randall-Sundrum (LRS)" model. This model
corresponds to a volume-truncation, by a factor y \approx 6, of the RS scenario
and is holographically dual to dynamics with number of colors larger by y. With
separate gauge and flavor dynamics, several unwanted contributions to precision
electroweak, Z b \bar b, and flavor observables are suppressed in the LRS
framework, compared with the corresponding RS case. The LRS truncation leads to
a significant enhancement of the clean (golden) di-lepton LHC signals, by
O(y^3).
