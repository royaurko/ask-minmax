A population genetics formulation of Eigen's molecular quasispecies model is
proposed and several simple replication landscapes are investigated
analytically. Our results show a remarcable similarity to those obtained with
the original kinetics formulation of the quasispecies model. However, due to
the simplicity of our approach, the space of the parameters that define the
model can be explored. In particular, for the simgle-sharp-peak landscape our
analysis yelds some interesting predictions such as the existence of a maximum
peak height and a mini- mum molecule length for the onset of the error
threshold transition.
