Let $\phi$ be a 3CNF formula with n variables and m clauses. A simple
nonconstructive argument shows that when m is sufficiently large compared to n,
most 3CNF formulas are not satisfiable. It is an open question whether there is
an efficient refutation algorithm that for most such formulas proves that they
are not satisfiable. A possible approach to refute a formula $\phi$ is: first,
translate it into a graph $G_{\phi}$ using a generic reduction from 3-SAT to
max-IS, then bound the maximum independent set of $G_{\phi}$ using the Lovasz
$\vartheta$ function. If the $\vartheta$ function returns a value $< m$, this
is a certificate for the unsatisfiability of $\phi$. We show that for random
formulas with $m < n^{3/2 -o(1)}$ clauses, the above approach fails, i.e. the
$\vartheta$ function is likely to return a value of m.
