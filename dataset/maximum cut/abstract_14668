Recently at LHC one has obtained measurements of the total, elastic and
diffractive cross sections in pp collisions at very high energy. The total
cross section is in good agreement with predictions based on a leading behavior
\sigma_{tot} (s) \propto (\ln s/s_0)^2, on the other hand the elastic cross
section is lower than most expectations and the diffractive cross section is
higher. It is remarkable that the ratio
  (\sigma_{el} + \sigma_{diff})/\sigma_{tot} calculated combining the results
of the TOTEM and ALICE detectors is 0.495^{+0.05}_{-0.06}, very close to the
maximum theoretically allowed value of 1/2 known as the Miettinen Pumplin
bound. In this work we discuss these results using the frameworks of single and
multi--channel eikonal models, and outline the main difficulties for a
consistent interpretation of the data.
