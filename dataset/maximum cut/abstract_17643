A latent internal process describes the state of some system, e.g. the social
tension in a political conflict, the strength of an industrial component or the
health status of a person. When this process reaches a predefined threshold,
the process terminates and an observable event occurs, e.g. the political
conflict finishes, the industrial component breaks down or the person has a
heart attack. Imagine an intervention, e.g., a political decision, maintenance
of a component or a medical treatment, is initiated to the process before the
event occurs. How can we evaluate whether the intervention had an effect?
  To answer this question we describe the effect of the intervention through
parameter changes of the law governing the internal process. Then, the time
interval between the start of the process and the final event is divided into
two subintervals: the time from the start to the instant of intervention,
denoted by $S$, and the time between the intervention and the threshold
crossing, denoted by $R$. The first question studied here is: What is the joint
distribution of $(S,R)$? The theoretical expression is provided and serves as a
basis to answer the main question: Can we estimate the parameters of the model
from observations of $S$ and $R$ and compare them statistically? Maximum
likelihood estimators are illustrated on simulated data under the assumption
that the process before and after the intervention is described by the same
type of model, i.e. a Brownian motion, but with different parameters.
