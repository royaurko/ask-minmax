We determine the asymptotic behavior of the maximum subgraph density of large
random graphs with a prescribed degree sequence. The result applies in
particular to the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, where it settles a conjecture of
Hajek (1990). Our proof consists in extending the notion of balanced loads from
finite graphs to their local weak limits, using unimodularity. This is a new
illustration of the objective method described by Aldous and Steele (2004).
