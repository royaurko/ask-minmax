We present measurements of the linear diameter of the emission region of the
Vela pulsar at observing wavelength lambda=18 cm. We infer the diameter as a
function of pulse phase from the distribution of visibility on the
Mopra-Tidbinbilla baseline. As we demonstrate, in the presence of strong
scintillation, finite size of the emission region produces a characteristic
W-shaped signature in the projection of the visibility distribution onto the
real axis. This modification involves heightened probability density near the
mean amplitude, decreased probability to either side, and a return to the
zero-size distribution beyond. We observe this signature with high statistical
significance, as compared with the best-fitting zero-size model, in many
regions of pulse phase. We find that the equivalent full width at half maximum
of the pulsar's emission region decreases from more than 400 km early in the
pulse to near zero at the peak of the pulse, and then increases again to
approximately 800 km near the trailing edge. We discuss possible systematic
effects, and compare our work with previous results.
