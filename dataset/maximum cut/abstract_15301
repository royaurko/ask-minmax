We have developed a new model of the Doppler tomography using total variation
minimization (DTTVM). This method can reconstruct localized and
non-axisymmetric profiles having sharp edges in the Doppler map. This
characteristic is emphasized in the case that the number of the input data is
small. We apply this model to real data of the dwarf novae, WZ Sge in
superoutburst and TU Men in quiescence. We confirmed that DTTVM can reproduce
the observed spectra with a high precision. Compared with the models based on
the maximum entropy method, DTTVM provides the Doppler maps that little depend
on the hyper-parameter and on the presence of the absorption core. We also
introduce a cross-validation method to estimate reasonable values of a
hyperparameter in the model by the data itself.
