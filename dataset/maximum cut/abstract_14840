In this paper we study a spectrally negative L\'evy process which is
refracted at its running maximum and at the same time reflected from below at a
certain level. Such a process can for instance be used to model an insurance
surplus process subject to tax payments according to a loss-carry-forward
scheme together with the flow of minimal capital injections required to keep
the surplus process non-negative. We characterize the first passage time over
an arbitrary level and the cumulative amount of injected capital up to this
time by their joint Laplace transform, and show that it satisfies a simple
power relation to the case without refraction. It turns out that this identity
can also be extended to a certain type of refraction from below. The net
present value of tax collected before the cumulative injected capital exceeds a
certain amount is determined, and a numerical illustration is provided.
