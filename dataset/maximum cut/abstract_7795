We consider an effective theory with an $SU(2)\times U(1)\times A_{4}\times
Z_{2}\times Z_{4}$ symmetry and investigate the possibility of a linking
TeV-leptogenesis with a reactor angle $|U_{e3}|$ through spontaneous $A_{4}$
symmetry breaking which is at a scale higher than electroweak scale under the
framework of radiative seesaw. It has been shown that tri-bimaximal(TBM) can be
obtained by forging vacuum expectation value (VEV) alignment of the $A_{4}$.
Especially, one $A_{4}$ triplet scalar field with cut-off scale $\Lambda$ is
added in neutrino Yukawa sector, which is responsible for the deviation of the
exact TBM, to explain leptogenesis as well as a non-zero $|U_{e3}|$. Above the
scale of $\Lambda$ the leptonic Yukawa sectors will lead to the exact TBM. We
analyze possible spectrums of light neutrinos and their flavor mixing angles
corresponding to heavy Majorana neutrino mass ordering, and show that
non-resonance leptogenesis at TeV-scale constrained by low energy data is
achievable, both analytically as well as numerically. We show that only normal
hierarchical spectrum of light neutrino would be strongly favored by the
current Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, and also show that a
relatively large $|U_{e3}|$ corresponds to the value of baryon asymmetry
$6.2\times10^{-10}$.
