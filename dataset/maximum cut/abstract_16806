Solar-like oscillations have now been observed in several stars, thanks to
ground-based spectroscopic observations and space-borne photometry. CoRoT,
which has been in orbit since December 2006, has observed the star HD49933
twice. The oscillation spectrum of this star has proven difficult to interpret.
Thanks to a new timeseries provided by CoRoT, we aim to provide a robust
description of the oscillations in HD49933, i.e., to identify the degrees of
the observed modes, and to measure mode frequencies, widths, amplitudes and the
average rotational splitting. Several methods were used to model the Fourier
spectrum: Maximum Likelihood Estimators and Bayesian analysis using Markov
Chain Monte-Carlo techniques. The different methods yield consistent result,
and allow us to make a robust identification of the modes and to extract
precise mode parameters. Only the rotational splitting remains difficult to
estimate precisely, but is clearly relatively large (several microHz in size).
