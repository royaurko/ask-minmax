We analyse the interplay between nucleon-nucleon potentials deduced from
chiral perturbation theory and a coarse grained representation of the short
distance interactions by delta-shells potentials below a certain cut-off
distance. While we find that the number of parameters is greatly reduced when
Chiral Two Pion Exchange contributions are included we also observe that
discerning the necessity of improvements on the interaction requires a detailed
analysis of all error sources. Our points are best illustrated by computing
deuteron static properties as well as electromagnetic form factors after error
propagation.
