A graph is pseudo-outerplanar if each of its blocks has an embedding in the
plane so that the vertices lie on a fixed circle and the edges lie inside the
disk of this circle with each of them crossing at most one another. It is
proved that every pseudo-outerplanar graph with maximum degree \Delta\geq 5 is
totally (\Delta+1)-choosable.
