Let $D_{T}$ and $B_{\Omega }$ denote the operators which cut the time content
outside $T$ and the frequency content outside $\Omega $, respectively. The
prolate spheroidal functions are the eigenfunctions of the operator
$P_{T,\Omega }=D_{T}B_{\Omega }D_{T}$. With the aim of formulating in precise
mathematical terms the notion of Nyquist rate, Landau and Pollack have shown
that, asymptotically, the number of such functions with eigenvalue close to one
is $\approx \frac{\left\vert T\right\vert \left\vert \Omega \right\vert }{2\pi
}$. We have recently revisited this problem with a new approach: instead of
counting the number of eigenfunctions with eigenvalue close to one, we count
the maximum number of orthogonal $\epsilon$-pseudoeigenfunctions with $\epsilon
$-pseudoeigenvalue one. Precisely, we count how many orthogonal functions have
a maximum of energy $\epsilon $ outside the domain $T\times \Omega $, in the
sense that $\left\Vert P_{T,\Omega }f-f\right\Vert ^{2}\leq \epsilon $. We have
recently discovered that the sharp asymptotic number is $\approx (1-\epsilon
)^{-1}\frac{\left\vert T\right\vert \left\vert \Omega \right\vert }{2\pi }$.
The proof involves an explicit construction of the pseudoeigenfunctions of
$P_{T,\Omega }$. When $T$ and $\Omega$ are intervals we call them pseudo
prolate spheroidal functions. In this paper we explain how they are
constructed.
