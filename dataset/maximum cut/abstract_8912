The entanglement in one-dimensional Anderson model is studied. We show that
the pairwise entanglement measured by the average concurrence has a direct
relation to the localization length. The numerical study indicates that the
disorder significantly reduces the average entanglement, and entanglement
distribution clearly displays the entanglement localization. The maximal
pairwise entanglement exhibits a maximum as the disorder strength
increases,experiencing a transition from increase to decrease. The entanglement
between the center of localization and other site decreases exponentially along
the spatial direction. Finally,we study effects of disorder on dynamical
properties of entanglement.
