We consider positive solutions to a singular semilinear elliptic equation in
bounded smooth domains, with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. We provide
some weak and strong maximum principles for the H^1_0 part of the solution that
allow to deduce symmetry and monotonicity properties of the solutions, via the
Moving Plane Method.
