A generalized linear point process is specified in terms of an intensity that
depends upon a linear predictor process through a fixed non-linear function. We
present a framework where the linear predictor is parametrized by a Banach
space and give results on Gateaux differentiability of the log-likelihood. Of
particular interest is when the intensity is expressed in terms of a linear
filter parametrized by a Sobolev space. Using that the Sobolev spaces are
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces we derive results on the representation of
the penalized maximum likelihood estimator in a special case and the gradient
of the negative log-likelihood in general. The latter is used to develop a
descent algorithm in the Sobolev space. We conclude the paper by extensions to
multivariate and additive model specifications. The methods are implemented in
the R-package ppstat.
