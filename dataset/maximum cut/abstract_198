We present a statistical method for the photometric search of rare
astronomical sources based on the weighted k-NN method. A metric is defined in
a multi-dimensional color-magnitude space based only on the photometric
properties of template sources and the photometric uncertainties of both
templates and data, without the need to define ad-hoc color and magnitude cuts
which could bias the search. The metric is defined as a function of two
parameters, the number of neighbors k and a threshold distance D_th that can be
optimized for maximum selection efficiency and completeness. We apply the
method to the search of L and T dwarfs in the Spitzer Extragalactic First Look
Survey and the Bootes field of the Spitzer Shallow Survey, as well as to the
search of sub-stellar mass companions around nearby stars. With high level of
completeness, we confirm the absence of late-T dwarfs detected in at least two
bands in the First Look Survey, and only one in the Shallow Survey (previously
discovered by Stern et al. 2007). This result is in agreement with the expected
statistics for late-T dwarfs. One L/early-T candidate is found in the First
Look Survey, and 3 in the Shallow Surveys, currently undergoing follow-up
spectroscopic verification. Finally, we discuss the potential for brown dwarf
searches with this method in the Spitzer warm mission Exploration Science
programs.
