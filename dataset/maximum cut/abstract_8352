The influence of the boundary layer properties on the heat transport in
turbulent thermal convection is experimentally investigated in a cell with a
rough bottom plate.It is shown that the standard 2/7 exponent of the convective
heat flow dependence on the Rayleigh number, usually observed in cell with
smooth boundaries, increases if the roughness has power law distributed
asperity heights and the thermal boundary layer thickness is smaller than the
maximum asperity size. In contrast a periodic roughness does not influence the
heat transportlaw exponent.
