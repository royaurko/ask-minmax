Following Ruffini and Bonazzola, we use a quantized boson field to describe
condensates of axions forming compact objects. Without substantial
modifications, the method can only be applied to axions with decay constant,
$f_a$, satisfying $\delta=(f_a\,/\,M_P)^2\ll 1$, where $M_P$ is the Planck
mass. Similarly, the applicability of the Ruffini-Bonazzola method to axion
stars also requires that the relative binding energy of axions satisfies
$\Delta=\sqrt{1-(E_a\,/\,m_a)^2}\ll1$, where $E_a$ and $m_a$ are the energy and
mass of the axion. The simultaneous expansion of the equations of motion in
$\delta$ and $\Delta$ leads to a simplified set of equations, depending only on
the parameter, $\lambda=\sqrt{\delta}\,/\,\Delta$ in leading order of the
expansions. Keeping leading order in $\Delta$ is equivalent to the infrared
limit, in which only relevant and marginal terms contribute to the equations of
motion. The number of axions in the star is uniquely determined by $\lambda$.
Numerical solutions are found in a wide range of $\lambda$. At small $\lambda$
the mass and radius of the axion star rise linearly with $\lambda$. While at
larger $\lambda$ the radius of the star continues to rise, the mass of the
star, $M$, attains a maximum at $\lambda_{\rm max}\simeq 0.58$. All stars are
unstable for $\lambda>\lambda_{\rm max}$ . We discuss the relationship of our
results to current observational constraints on dark matter and the
phenomenology of Fast Radio Bursts.
