We investigate scaling ansatz with texture zeros within the framework of
linear seesaw mechanism. In this variant of seesaw mechanism a simplified
expression of effective neutrino mass matrix $m_\nu$ containing two Dirac type
matrices ($m_D$ and $m_{DS}$) and one Majorana type matrix ($m_{RS}$) is
obtained by virtue of neglecting the global $U(1)_L$ symmetry breaking term in
the mass term of the Lagrangian. Along with the charged lepton mass matrix, the
matrix $m_{RS}$ too, is chosen in a diagonal basis whereas a scaling relation
is incorporated in $m_D$ and $m_{DS}$ with different scale factors. Our goal in
this work is to achieve a completely phenomenologically acceptable $m_\nu$
generated by combinations of $m_D$ and $m_{DS}$ containing least number of
independent parameters or maximum number of zeros. At the end of the numerical
analysis it is found that number of zeros in any of the constituent Dirac type
matrices ($m_D$ and $m_{DS}$) of $m_\nu$ cannot be greater than six in order to
meet the phenomenological requirements. The hierarchy obtained here is normal
and also the values of the two parameters sum mass ($\sum m_i$) and
$|m_{\nu_{ee}}|$ are below the present experimental lower limit.
