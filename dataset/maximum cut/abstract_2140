We present the results of a detailed study of the effects of $b$-tagging on
the heavy top-quark signal and backgrounds for the modes of the di-lepton plus
two high transverse energy jets at the Fermilab Tevatron. The general
characteristics of the heavy top-quark signal events are also discussed so that
a comparison can be made between $b$-tagging and imposing stringent kinematical
cuts to eliminate backgrounds.
