Newly-determined mass of 1.97 $\pm$ 0.04 $M_{\odot}$ for PSR J1614-2230 has
been a challenge for the neutron star with a hyperon core (namely hyperon
star), since hyperons usually reduce the theoretical maximum mass of the star.
In this article, we consider dark matter as another possible constituent in
hyperon stars' interior to loose this mass constrain. We take dark matter as
self-interacting Fermi gas with certain repulsive interaction among the dark
matter particles and non-interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter as
is generally assumed. We find that the star maximum mass is sensitive to the
particle mass of dark matter, and a high enough star mass larger than 2
$M_{\odot}$ could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. In this
particular model, a strong upper limit 0.64 GeV for dark matter mass is
obtained in strongly-interacting dark matter and 0.16 GeV for dark matter mass
in weakly-interacting dark matter. Dark matter accumulated around the star
could also contribute to the mass measurement, however, such contribution could
be safely ignored when the generally used dark matter density is assumed.
