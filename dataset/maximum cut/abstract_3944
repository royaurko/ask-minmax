We present a catalog of 97 spectroscopic redshifts of z<1 galaxies in the
Hubble Deep Field South (HDFS) and its Flanking Fields (FFs). In the HDFS
proper, we observed approximately half the galaxies brighter than I(AB)=24 and
obtained redshifts for 76% of them. Targets in our HDFS sample were
pre-selected to be at z<1 based on photometric redshifts, while in the FFs a
simple magnitude cut was used. The photometric redshift pre-selection in the
HDFS resulted in a spectroscopic success rate that is significantly higher than
in the FFs, where no pre-selection was applied. The RMS precision of our
redshift measurements, determined from repeat observations, is delta_z=0.0003.
We present the photometry and redshifts for the 97 objects for which we secured
spectroscopic redshifts and describe the basic properties of this sample.
