A maximum stable set in a graph G is a stable set of maximum cardinality. S
is a local maximum stable set of G, if S is a maximum stable set of the
subgraph induced by its closed neighborhood.
  It is known that the family of all local maximum stable sets of a forest
forms a greedoid on its vertex set. Bipartite, triangle-free, and well-covered
graphs whose families of local maximum stable sets form greedoids have been
analyzed as well.
  A unicycle graph owns only one cycle. In this paper we characterize the
unicycle graphs whose families of local maximum stable sets form greedoids.
