A construction is introduced for modifying hyperkaehler manifolds with
tri-Hamiltonian circle action, that in favourable situations increases the
second Betti number by one. This is based on the symplectic cut construction of
Lerman. In 4 or 8 dimensions the construction may be interpreted as adding a
D6-brane. A number of examples are given and generalisations to three-Sasaki
and hypersymplectic geometry discussed.
