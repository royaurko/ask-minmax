We construct an estimator of the unknown drift parameter $\theta\in
{\mathbb{R}}$ in the linear model \[X_t=\theta
t+\sigma_1B^{H_1}(t)+\sigma_2B^{H_2}(t),\;t\in[0,T],\] where $B^{H_1}$ and
$B^{H_2}$ are two independent fractional Brownian motions with Hurst indices
$H_1$ and $H_2$ satisfying the condition $\frac{1}{2}\leq H_1<H_2<1.$ Actually,
we reduce the problem to the solution of the integral Fredholm equation of the
2nd kind with a specific weakly singular kernel depending on two power
exponents. It is proved that the kernel can be presented as the product of a
bounded continuous multiplier and weak singular one, and this representation
allows us to prove the compactness of the corresponding integral operator.
This, in turn, allows us to establish an existence--uniqueness result for the
sequence of the equations on the increasing intervals, to construct accordingly
a sequence of statistical estimators, and to establish asymptotic consistency.
