The radiative capture process $n p \to d \gamma$ is considered within the
framework of a recently developed six-quark dressed-bag model for the
nucleon-nucleon interaction. The calculations presented here include both the
nucleon current and the meson-exchange current contributions. The latter uses
short-range hadronic form factors for the pion exchange currents consistent
with the soft cut-off parameter $\Lambda_{\pi NN}$ from the $NN$-potential.
Contributions of the pion exchange current and $\Delta$-isobar current to the
total cross section still cannot explain the discrepancy between the
theoretical and experimental cross sections. Possibilities for new types of
meson exchange currents associated with chiral fields inside multi-quark
dressed-bag states in nuclei are discussed.
