We show that skyrmions arising from compact five dimensional models have
stable sizes. We numerically obtain the skyrmion configurations and calculate
their size and energy. Although their size strongly depends on the magnitude of
localized kinetic-terms, their energy is quite model-independent ranging
between 50-65 times F_pi^2/m_rho, where F_pi is the Goldstone decay constant
and m_rho the lowest Kaluza-Klein mass. These skyrmion configurations
interpolate between small 4D YM instantons and 4D skyrmions made of Goldstones
and a massive vector boson. Contrary to the original 4D skyrmion and previous
5D extensions, these configurations have sizes larger than the inverse of the
cut-off scale and therefore they are trustable within our effective 5D
approach. Such solitonic particles can have interesting phenomenological
consequences as they carry a conserved topological charge analogous to baryon
number.
