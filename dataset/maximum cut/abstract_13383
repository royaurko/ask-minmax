Reflection of an obliquely incident solitary wave onto a vertical wall is
studied analytically and experimentally. We use the Kadomtsev-Petviashivili
(KP) equation to analyze the evolution and its asymptotic state. Laboratory
experiments are performed using the laser induced fluorescent (LIF) technique,
and detailed features and amplifications at the wall are measured. We find that
proper physical interpretation must be made for the KP solutions when the
experimental results are compared with the theory under the assumptions of
quasi-two dimensionality and weak nonlinearity. Due to the lack of physical
interpretation of the theory, the numerical results were previously thought not
in good agreement with the theory. With proper treatment, the KP theory
provides an excellent model to predict the present laboratory results as well
as the previous numerical results. The theory also indicates that the present
laboratory apparatus must be too short to achieve the asymptotic state. The
laboratory and numerical results suggest that the maximum of the predicted
four-fold amplification would be difficult to be realized in the real-fluid
environment. The reality of this amplification remains obscure.
