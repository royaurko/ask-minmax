We study the `separated bump conjecture' of Cruz-Uribe & Perez, and
Cruz-Uribe & Reznikov & Volberg. In the L^p setting, we formulate a stronger
version of this conjecture, and show that under it, a two weight inequality
holds for all CZOs. When p=2, this is the result of Nazarov & Reznikov &
Volberg (1306.2653). Our argument is based on stopping time arguments and the
extra hypothesis is used in a clear-cut and seemingly essential way. This
argument could be of some help in searching for a counterexample to the
conjecture.
