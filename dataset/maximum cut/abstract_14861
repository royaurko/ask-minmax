We study the implications of a pseudo-phase-space density power-law for the
anisotropy profile of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo. Requiring that the
anisotropy parameter does not take non-physical values within the virial radius
places a maximum value on the local radial velocity dispersion. For a plausible
range of halo parameters, it is possible to take a local total velocity
dispersion of up to about $300\,\mathrm{km/s}$. Making this choice uniquely
specifies the anisotropy and dispersion profiles. We introduce a way to model
the local velocity distribution that incorporates this anisotropy and study the
impact on direct detection.
