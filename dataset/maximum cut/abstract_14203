This paper considers several linear beamformer design paradigms for multiuser
time-invariant multiple-input multiple-output interference channels. Notably,
interference alignment and sum-rate based algorithms such as the maximum
signal-to-interference-plus noise (max-SINR) algorithm are considered. Optimal
linear beamforming under interference alignment consists of two layers; an
inner precoder and decoder (or receive filter) accomplish interference
alignment to eliminate inter-user interference, and an outer precoder and
decoder diagonalize the effective single-user channel resulting from the
interference alignment by the inner precoder and decoder. The relationship
between this two-layer beamforming and the max-SINR algorithm is established at
high signal-to-noise ratio. Also, the optimality of the max-SINR algorithm
within the class of linear beamforming algorithms, and its local convergence
with exponential rate, are established at high signal-to-noise ratio.
