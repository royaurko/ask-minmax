Perturbative spectra and related factorization properties of one-loop open
string amplitudes in the presence of a constant external background B are
analysed in detail. While the pattern of the closed string spectrum, obtained
after a careful study of the properly symmetrized amplitudes, turns out to be
unaffected by the presence of B, a series of double open-string poles, which
would be absent when B is turned off, can couple owing to a partial symmetry
loss. These features are studied first in a bosonic setting and then
generalized in the more satisfactory superstring context. When the background
is of an ``electric'' type, a classical perturbative instability is produced
beyond a critical value of the electric field. In the Seiberg-Witten limit this
instability is the origin of the unphysical tachyonic cut occurring in the
non-planar amplitudes of the corresponding noncommutative field theories.
