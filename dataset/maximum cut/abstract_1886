A {\em total coloring} of a graph $G$ is an assignment of colors to the
vertices and the edges of $G$ such that every pair of adjacent/incident
elements receive distinct colors. The {\em total chromatic number} of a graph
$G$, denoted by $\chiup''(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed in a
total coloring of $G$. The most well-known Total Coloring Conjecture (TCC) says
that every graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ admits a total coloring with at
most $\Delta + 2$ colors. A graph is {\em 1-toroidal} if it can be drawn on
torus such that every edge crosses at most one other edge. In this paper, we
investigate the total coloring of 1-toroidal graphs, and prove that the TCC
holds for the 1-toroidal graphs with maximum degree at least 11 and some
restrictions on the triangles. Consequently, if $G$ is a 1-toroidal graph with
maximum degree $\Delta$ at least 11 and without adjacent triangles, then $G$
admits a total coloring with at most $\Delta + 2$ colors.
