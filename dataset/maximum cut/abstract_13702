We study superconductivity in doped solid picene (C22H14) with linear
response calculations of the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon (ep)
interaction. We show that the coupling of the high-energy C bond-stretching
phonons to the {\pi} molecular orbitals for a doping of ~3 electrons per picene
molecule is sufficiently strong to reproduce the experimental Tc of 18 K within
Migdal-Eliashberg theory. For hole doping, we predict a similar coupling
leading to a maximum Tc of 6 K. However, we argue that, due to its molecular
nature, picene may belong to the same class of strongly correlated ep
superconductors as fullerides. We propose several experimental tests for this
hypothesis and suggest that intercalated hydrocarbons with different
arrangements and numbers of benzene rings may be used to study the interplay
between ep interaction and strong electronic correlations in the highly
nonadiabatic limit.
