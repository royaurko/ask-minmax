New heavy charged lepton production and decay signatures at future
electron-positron colliders are investigated at $\sqrt {s}=500$ GeV. The
consequences of model dependence for vector singlets and vector doublets are
studied. Distributions are calculated including hadronization effects and
experimental cuts that suppress the standard model background. The final state
leptonic energy distributions are shown to give a very clear signature for
heavy charged leptons.
