The onset of macroscopic phase coherence in superconducting cuprates is
considered to be determined by random percolation between mesoscopic
Jahn-Teller pairs, stripes or clusters. The model is found to predict the onset
of superconductivity near 6% doping, maximum Tc near 15% doping and Tc= T* at
optimum doping, and accounts for the destruction of superconductivity by Zn
doping near 7%. The model also predicts a relation between the pairing
(pseudogap) energy and Tc in terms of experimentally measurable quantities.
