The production of W or Z bosons in association with two jets is an important
background to the Higgs boson search in vector-boson fusion at the LHC. The
purely electroweak component of this background is dominated by vector-boson
fusion, which exhibits kinematic distributions very similar to the Higgs boson
signal. We consider the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the
electroweak production of l nu_l jj and l^+ l^- jj events at the LHC, within
typical vector-boson fusion cuts. We show that the QCD corrections are modest,
increasing the total cross sections by about 10%. Remaining scale uncertainties
are below 2%. A fully-flexible next-to-leading order partonic Monte Carlo
program allows to demonstrate these features for cross sections within typical
vector-boson-fusion acceptance cuts. Modest corrections are also found for
distributions.
