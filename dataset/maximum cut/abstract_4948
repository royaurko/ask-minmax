Within the framework of the nonrelativistic QCD factorization approach, we
compute the cross section and polarization of prompt J/psi produced from
proton-proton collisions at the center-of-momentum energy sqrt{s}=200 GeV. We
present the transverse-momentum distribution in the forward-rapidity region 1.2
< |y| < 2.2 and the rapidity distribution over the transverse-momentum range 2
GeV < p_T < 20 GeV. The perturbative contributions are computed at leading
order in the strong coupling constant. We predict slight transverse
polarization of J/psi in the forward-rapidity region, while that for the
mid-rapidity region is slightly longitudinal. The transverse-momentum
distribution agrees well with the PHENIX preliminary data and the
color-singlet-model prediction at next-to-leading order in alpha_s, but
disagrees with the result from the leading-order color-singlet model or the
s-channel-cut method.
