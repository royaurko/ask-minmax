We present a first study of the channel H, A -> tau+tau -> h+ + h- + X in CMS
at high m(A) values where no triggering difficulties are expected with QCD
jets. At present the tau selection is based solely on the presence of a hard
isolated track in the "tau" jet, but further refinements based on calorimeter
collimation or impact parameter selections are obviously possible. The main
irreducible background in these conditions is due to QCD jets with hard
fragmentations. A large reduction of this background and improvement in the
expected signal to background ratio is provided by Etmiss cuts. The expected
high-mass reach in the m(A) tan(beta) parameter space for 3 x 10**4pb**-1 is
shown. This H -> tau+tau channel provides the highest mass reach and the best
mass resolution when compared to tau,tau -> lepton+hadron + Xand tau,tau ->
electton + muon + X final states. To the extent that with further calorimetric
and impact parameter based selection criteria the QCD background can be kept
under control, i.e. below the irreducible Z,gamma* -> tau+tau background, we
should strive to have a first level trigger allowing to explore the mass range
down to ~ 150 - 200 GeV.
