We investigate magnetic, thermal, and dielectric properties of SrCuTe2O6,
which is isostructural to PbCuTe2O6, a recently found, Cu-based 3D frustrated
magnet with a corner sharing triangular spin network having dominant first and
second nearest neighbor (nn) couplings [B. Koteswararao, et al. Phys. Rev. B
90, 035141 (2014)]. Although SrCuTe2O6 has a structurally similar spin network,
but the magnetic data exhibit the characteristic features of a typical quasi
-one-dimensional magnet, which mainly resulted from the magnetically dominant
third nn coupling, uniform chains. The magnetic properties of this system are
studied via magnetization (M), heat capacity (Cp), dielectric constant,
measurements along with ab-initio band structure calculations. Magnetic
susceptibility chi(T) data show a broad maximum at 32 K and the system orders
at low temperatures TN1=5.5 K and TN2=4.5 K, respectively. The analysis of
chi(T) data gives an intra-chain coupling, J3/kB, to be about - 42 K with
non-negligible frustrated inter-chain couplings (J1/kB and J2/kB). The hopping
parameters obtained from LDA band structure calculations also suggest the
presence of coupled uniform chains. The observation of simultaneous anomalies
in dielectric constant at TN1 and TN2 suggests the presence of
magneto-dielectric effect in SrCuTe2O6. A magnetic phase diagram is also built
based on M, C p, and dielectric constant results.
