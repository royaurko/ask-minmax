In this paper we study similarity measures for moving curves which can, for
example, model changing coastlines or retreating glacier termini. Points on a
moving curve have two parameters, namely the position along the curve as well
as time. We therefore focus on similarity measures for surfaces, specifically
the Fr\'echet distance between surfaces. While the Fr\'echet distance between
surfaces is not even known to be computable, we show for variants arising in
the context of moving curves that they are polynomial-time solvable or
NP-complete depending on the restrictions imposed on how the moving curves are
matched. We achieve the polynomial-time solutions by a novel approach for
computing a surface in the so-called free-space diagram based on max-flow
min-cut duality.
