Calculation of gravitational radiation during binary inspiral leading to
possible formation of a Thorne-Zytkow (TZ) object (a neutron star inside a
supergiant core) is performed. The calculations were done for polytropic
density distributions with different indeces $n$, as well as for realistic
models of supergiants. A maximum frequency of the emitted gravitational waves
during this process was found to range from a few to 300 initial keplerian
orbital frequensies, that is from $10^{-5}$ to $\sim 0.1$ Hz, depending on the
model. A dimensionless strain metric amplitude can reach $h\sim 10^{-23.5}$ for
a source lying 10 kpc away from the Sun. We conclude that TZ objects forming at
a rate of 1 per 500 yrs in the Galaxy could be potential astrophysical targets
for space laser intereferometers. Analysis of gravitational waveforms emitted
during TZ-object formation could bring a unique information about stellar
structure.
