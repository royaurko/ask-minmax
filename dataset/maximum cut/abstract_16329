Optical and magneto-optical properties of YVO$_3$ single crystal were studied
in FIR, visible, and UV regions. Two structural phase transitions at 75 K and
200 K were observed and established to be of the first and second order,
respectively. The lattice has an orthorhombic $Pbnm$ symmetry both above 200 K
as well as below 75 K, and is found to be dimerized monoclinic $Pb11$ in
between. We identify YVO$_3$ as a Mott-Hubbard insulator with the optical gap
of 1.6 eV. The electronic excitations in the visible spectrum are determined by
three $d$-bands at 1.8, 2.4, and 3.3 eV, followed by the charge-transfer
transitions at about 4 eV. The observed structure is in good agreement with
LSDA+$U$ band structure calculations. By using ligand field considerations, we
assigned these bands to the transitions to the $^4A_{2g}$, $^2E_{g} +
^2T_{1g}$, and $^2T_{2g}$ states. The strong temperature dependence of these
bands is in agreement with the formation of orbital order. Despite the small
net magnetic moment of 0.01 $\mu_B$ per vanadium, the Kerr effect of the order
of $0.01^\circ$ was observed for all three $d$-bands in the magnetically
ordered phase $T_{\text{N\'eel}}<116 K$. A surprisingly strong enhancement of
the Kerr effect was found below 75 K, reaching a maximum of $0.1^\circ$. The
effect is ascribed to the non-vanishing net orbital magnetic moment.
