The analytical expression for frequency of the maximum of radio emission
intensity in pulsars with free electron emission from the stellar surface has
been found. We have explained the correlation, known from observations, between
the high-frequency cut-off and low-frequency turnover in radio emission
spectrum of the pulsars. The explanation is based on peculiarities of electron
acceleration in the inner polar gap, which we have analyzed.
