The PROmotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT) cluster-randomized
a program encouraging breastfeeding to new mothers in hospital centers. The
original studies indicated that this intervention successfully increased
duration of breastfeeding and lowered rates of gastrointestinal tract
infections in newborns. Additional scientific and popular interest lies in
determining the causal effect of longer breastfeeding on gastrointestinal
infection. In this study, we estimate the expected infection count under
various lengths of breastfeeding in order to estimate the effect of
breastfeeding duration on infection. Due to the presence of baseline and
time-dependent confounding, specialized "causal" estimation methods are
required. We demonstrate the double-robust method of Targeted Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) in the context of this application and review some
related methods and the adjustments required to account for clustering. We
compare TMLE (implemented both parametrically and using a data-adaptive
algorithm) to other causal methods for this example. In addition, we conduct a
simulation study to determine (1) the effectiveness of controlling for
clustering indicators when cluster-specific confounders are unmeasured and (2)
the importance of using data-adaptive TMLE.
