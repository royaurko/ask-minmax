The anisotropy of electrical resistivity was measured in parent compounds of
the iron-arsenic high temperature superconductors, AEFe2As2 with Alkali Earth
elements AE=Ca,Sr, Ba. Measurements were performed using both the Montgomery
technique and direct resistivity measurements on samples cut along principal
crystallographic directions. The anisotropy ratio \gamma_\rho=\rho_c/\rho_a is
well below 10 for all compounds in the whole temperature range studied (4 to
300 K), in notable contrast to previous reports. The anisotropy at room
temperature increases from about 2 in Ca, to about 4 in Sr and Ba. In all
compounds the resistivity ratio decreases on cooling through the
structural/antiferromagnetic transition temperature T_{SM}, with the change
mainly coming from stronger variation in \rho_a as compared with \rho_c. This
suggests that the transitions stronger affect the two-dimensional parts of the
Fermi surface. We compare our experimental observations with band structure
calculations, and find similar trend in the evolution of anisotropy with the
size of AE ion. Our results show that the electronic structure of the iron
pnictides has large contribution from three-dimensional areas of the Fermi
surface.
