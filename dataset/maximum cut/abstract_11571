A recent laboratory experiment (Blaauwgeers et al. 2003) suggests that a
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability at the interface between two superfluids, one
rotating and anisotropic, the other stationary and isotropic, may trigger
sudden spin-up of the stationary superfluid. This result suggests that a KH
instability at the crust-core ($^1S_0$-$^3P_2$-superfluid) boundary of a
neutron star may provide a trigger mechanism for pulsar glitches. We calculate
the dispersion relation of the KH instability involving two different
superfluids including the normal fluid components and their effects on
stability, particularly entropy transport. We show that an entropy difference
between the core and crust superfluids reduces the threshold differential shear
velocity and threshold crust-core density ratio. We evaluate the wavelength of
maximum growth of the instability for neutron star parameters and find the
resultant circulation transfer to be within the range observed in pulsar
glitches.
