A general prescription for the construction of $\pi \pi$ interaction
potentials which preserve scattering length constraints from chiral symmetry
when iterated in scattering equations is derived. The prescription involves
only minor modifications of typical meson-exchange models, so that coupling
constants and cut-off masses in the models are not greatly affected.
Calculations of $s$-wave $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitudes in nuclear matter for
two models are compared with those for similar models which violate the chiral
constraint. While the prescription tends to suppress the accumulation of the
near sub-threshold strength of the $\pi \pi$ interaction, an earlier conjecture
that amplitudes which satisfy chiral constraints will not exhibit an
instability towards $\pi \pi~s-$wave pair condensation appears to be incorrect.
At the same time, however, conventional $\pi \pi$ interaction models which fit
scattering data well can readily be adjusted to avoid the instability in
nuclear matter without recourse to exotic mechanisms.
