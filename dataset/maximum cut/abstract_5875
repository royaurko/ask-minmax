The linear relationship between the maximum amplitudes (R$_{max}$) of sunspot
cycles and preceding minima (R$_{min}$) is one of the precursor methods used to
predict the amplitude of the upcoming solar cycle. In the recent past this
method has been subjected to severe criticism. In this communication we show
that this simple method is reliable and can profitably be used for prediction
purposes. With the 13-month smoothed R$_{min}$ of 1.8 at the beginning, it is
predicted that the R$_{max}$ of the ongoing cycle will be around 85$\pm$17,
suggesting that Cycle 24 may be of moderate strength. Based on a second order
polynomial dependence between the rise time (T$_R$) and R$_{max}$, it is
predicted that Cycle 24 will reach its smoothed maximum amplitude during the
third quarter of the year 2013. An important finding of this paper is that the
rise time cycle amplitude relation reaches a minimum at about 3 to 3.5 years
corresponding to a cycle amplitude of about 160. The Waldmeier effect breaks at
this point and T$_{R}$ increases further with increase in R$_{max}$. This
feature, we believe, may put a constraint on the flux transport dynamo models
and lead to more accurate physical principles based predictions.
