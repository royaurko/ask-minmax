We theoretically study the propagation through a resonant absorbing medium of
a time-dependent perturbation modulating the amplitude of a continuous wave
(cw). Modeling the medium as a system of two-level atoms and linearizing the
Maxwell-Bloch equations for the perturbation, we establish an exact analytical
expression of the transfer function relating the Fourier transforms of the
incident and transmitted perturbations. It directly gives the gain and the
phase shift undergone in the medium by a harmonic modulation. For the case of a
pulse modulation, it enables us to determine the transmission time of the pulse
center-of-mass (group delay), evidencing the relative contributions of the
coherent and incoherent (population) relaxation. We show that the group delay
has a negative value (fast light) fixed by the coherent effects when the cw
intensity is small compared to the saturation intensity and becomes positive
(slow light) when this intensity increases, before attaining a maximum that
cannot exceed the population relaxation time. The analytical results are
completed by numerical determinations of the shape of the transmitted pulses in
the different regimes.
