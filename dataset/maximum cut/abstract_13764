In a recent paper, Phys. Rev E 81, 041137 (2010), the contributor attempts to
derive ten necessary conditions for stability of dissipative fluids and
plasmas. Assuming the validity of the local equilibrium principle, these
criteria have been obtained solely from the first and the second laws of
thermodynamics. The Onsager reciprocity relations have not been invoked and
contributor's results are supposed to be valid independently of the choice of the
boundary conditions. In the present paper, in agreement with the general theory
established by Glansdorff-Prigogine in 1954 and 1970, we shall show that there
is no variational principle expressing the necessary conditions for stability
of dissipative systems involving convective effects when the system is out of
the Onsager region. In particular, we shall prove that the basic equations
constituting the starting point of the analysis of the contributor, attempting to
derive ten necessary conditions for the stability involving
magneto-hydrodynamical effects, are incorrect and in contradiction with the
laws of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes.
