Constraints on minimum and maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars are imposed
by the consideration of their early evolution (protoneutron star stage).
Calculations are performed for a realistic standard model of hot, dense matter
(Lattimer & Swesty 1991) valid for both supranuclear and subnuclear densities.
Various assumptions concerning protoneutron star interior (large trapped lepton
number, no trapped lepton number, isentropic, isothermal) are taken into
account.
