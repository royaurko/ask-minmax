The energy and four-momentum (Q^2) dependence of the photo-absorption cross
section on the proton is calculated for helicity -1/2 and -3/2 states. An
effective Lagrangian model is used, formulated in terms of meson and baryon
degrees of freedom, which obeys crossing symmetry, unitarity, Lorentz and gauge
invariance. The difference in the cross sections for the two helicity states,
the Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov integral $I_{DHG}(Q^2)$, is evaluated at different
$Q^2$. We find that at small momentum transfer the absolute value of
$I_{DHG}(Q^2)$ first increases to reach a maximum at $Q^2 \approx 0.05 GeV^2$
before decreasing at higher $Q^2$.
