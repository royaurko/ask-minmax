We report the results of the analysis of high resolution photospheric line
spectra obtained with the UVES instrument on the VLT for a sample of 15
solar-type stars selected from a recent survey of the distribution of H and K
chromospheric line strengths in the solar-age open cluster M67. We find upper
limits to the projected rotation velocities that are consistent with solar-like
rotation (i.e., v sini ~< 2-3 km/s) for objects with Ca II chromospheric
activity within the range of the contemporary solar cycle. Two solar-type stars
in our sample exhibit chromospheric emission well in excess of even solar
maximum values. In one case, Sanders 1452, we measure a minimum rotational
velocity of vsini = 4 +/- 0.5 km/s, or over twice the solar equatorial
rotational velocity. The other star with enhanced activity, Sanders 747, is a
spectroscopic binary. We conclude that high activity in solar-type stars in M67
that exceeds solar levels is likely due to more rapid rotation rather than an
excursion in solar-like activity cycles to unusually high levels. We estimate
an upper limit of 0.2% for the range of brightness changes occurring as a
result of chromospheric activity in solar-type stars and, by inference, in the
Sun itself. We discuss possible implications for our understanding of angular
momentum evolution in solar-type stars, and we tentatively attribute the rapid
rotation in Sanders 1452 to a reduced braking efficiency.
