We show how studying leading singularities of Feynman diagrams, when all
momenta are complex, gives a simple way of writing multi-loop and
multi-particle scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills. The simplicity of
the method is equivalent to that of the quadruple cut technique introduced in
hep-th/0412103 at one-loop. The new technique only involves the computation of
residues and the solution of linear equations. In our technique both parity
even and parity odd pieces of a coefficient are computed simultaneously and it
is only at the end that a separation can be made if desired. We explain the
procedure via examples. The main example, which we compute in detail, is the
five-particle two-loop amplitude first given in hep-th/0604074. Another feature
of our method is that the helicity structure of the amplitude only enters in
the inhomogeneous part of the linear equations. In other words, the homogeneous
part is universal. We illustrate this feature by presenting the linear
equations which determine a large class of terms for MHV and next-to-MHV
six-particle two-loop amplitudes.
