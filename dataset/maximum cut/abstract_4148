Measurements of the ratio of Drell-Yan yields from an 800 \rm{GeV/c} proton
beam incident on liquid hydrogen and deuterium targets are reported.
Approximately 360,000 Drell-Yan muon pairs remained after all cuts on the data.
  From these data, the ratio of anti-down ($\bar{d}$) to anti-up ($\bar{u}$)
quark distributions in the proton sea is determined over a wide range in
Bjorken-$x$. These results confirm previous measurements by E866 and extend
them to lower $x$. From these data, $(\bar{d}-\bar{u})$ and
$\int(\bar{d}-\bar{u})dx$ are evaluated for $0.015<x<0.35$. These results are
compared with parameterizations of various parton distribution functions,
models and experimental results from NA51, NMC, and HERMES.
