We present a new procedure using on-shell recursion to determine coefficients
of integral functions appearing in one-loop scattering amplitudes of gauge
theories, including QCD. With this procedure, coefficients of integrals,
including bubbles and triangles, can be determined without resorting to
integration. We give criteria for avoiding spurious singularities and boundary
terms that would invalidate the recursion. As an example where the criteria are
satisfied, we obtain all cut-constructible contributions to the one-loop
n-gluon scattering amplitude, A_n^{oneloop}(...--+++...), with split-helicity
from an N=1 chiral multiplet and from a complex scalar. Using the
supersymmetric decomposition, these are ingredients in the construction of QCD
amplitudes with the same helicities. This method requires prior knowledge of
amplitudes with sufficiently large numbers of legs as input. In many cases,
these are already known in compact forms from the unitarity method.
