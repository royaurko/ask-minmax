Recently, a new class of binary codes for overloaded CDMA systems are
proposed that not only has the ability of errorless communication but also
suitable for detecting active users. These codes are called COWDA [1]. In [1],
a Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoder is proposed for this class of codes. Although
the proposed scheme of coding/decoding show impressive performance, the decoder
can be improved. In this paper by assuming more practical conditions for the
traffic in the system, we suggest an algorithm that increases the performance
of the decoder several orders of magnitude (the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) is divided
by a factor of 400 in some Eb/N0's The algorithm supposes the Poison
distribution for the time of activation/deactivation of the users.
