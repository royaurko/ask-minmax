We introduce a new class of finite dimensional gentle algebras, the surface
algebras, which are constructed from an unpunctured Riemann surface with
boundary and marked points by introducing cuts in internal triangles of an
arbitrary triangulation of the surface. We show that surface algebras are
endomorphism algebras of partial cluster-tilting objects in generalized cluster
categories, we compute the invariant of Avella-Alaminos and Geiss for surface
algebras and we provide a geometric model for the module category of surface
algebras.
