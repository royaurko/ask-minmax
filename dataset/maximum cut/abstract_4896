The computation of the NLO QCD corrections to the cross sections for W+W-
gamma and ZZgamma production in hadronic collisions is presented. We consider
the case of a real photon in the final state, but include full leptonic decays
of the W and Z bosons. Numerical results for the LHC and the Tevatron are
obtained through a fully flexible parton level Monte Carlo based on the
structure of the VBFNLO program, allowing an easy implementation of arbitrary
cuts and distributions. We show the dependence on scale variations of the
integrated cross sections and provide evidence that NLO QCD corrections
strongly modify the LO predictions for observables at the LHC both in magnitude
and in shape.
