We investigate bistability and memory effects in a molecular junction weakly
coupled to metallic leads with the latter being subject to an adiabatic
periodic change of the bias voltage. The system is described by a simple
Anderson-Holstein model and its dynamics is calculated via a master equation
approach. The controlled electrical switching between the many-body states of
the system is achieved due to polaron shift and Franck-Condon blockade in the
presence of strong electron-vibron interaction. Particular emphasis is given to
the role played by the excited vibronic states in the bistability and
hysteretic switching dynamics as a function of the voltage sweeping rates. In
general, both the occupation probabilities of the vibronic states and the
associated vibron energy show hysteretic behaviour for driving frequencies in a
range set by the minimum and maximum lifetimes of the system. The consequences
on the transport properties for various driving frequencies and in the limit of
DC-bias are also investigated.
