Using recent data for the photosphere-chromosphere region of the solar
atmosphere the magnetic reconnection in tripolar geometry has been investigated
through the procedure of Sturrock (1999). Particular attention has been given
to the width of the reconnecting region, wave number of the rapidly growing
tearing mode, island length scales, frequency of MHD fluctuations, tearing mode
growth rate, energy dissipation rate and minimum magnetic field strength
required to heat chromospheric plasma to coronal temperatures. It is found that
small length scales are formed in the upper chromosphere. The maximum growth
rate of tearing mode instability coincides with the peak in the energy
dissipation rate both of which occur in the upper chromosphere at the same
height. It is realized that the distribution of magnetic field with height is
essential for a better understanding of the coronal heating problem.
