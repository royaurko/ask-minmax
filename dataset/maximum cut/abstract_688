Paper is presented the results of computer simulation. Effect of the dc
electric field influence on the propagation of Lamb and SH waves and its
temperature coefficients of delay in piezoelectric langasite crystal plate for
a lot of cuts and directions have been calculated. There were found the cuts
possessing the thermostability and sufficient electromechanical coupling.
