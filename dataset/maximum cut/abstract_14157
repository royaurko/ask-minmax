We investigate the dynamical relations among entanglement, mixedness and
nonlocality, quantifed by concurrence C, purity P and maximum of Bell function
B, respectively, in a system of two qubits in a common structured reservoir. To
this aim we introduce the C-P-B parameter space and analyze the time evolution
of the point representative of the system state in such a space. The dynamical
interplay among entanglement, mixedness and nonlocality strongly depends on the
initial state of the system. For a two-excitation Bell state the representative
point draws a multi-branch curve in the C-P-B space and we show that a closed
relation among these quantifers does not hold. By extending the known relation
between C and B for pure states, we give an expression among the three
quantifers for mixed states. In this equation we introduce a quantity,
vanishing for pure states which has not in general a closed form in terms of C,
P and B. Finally we demonstrate that for an initial one-excitation Bell state a
closed C-P-B relation instead exists and the system evolves remaining always a
maximally entangled mixed state.
