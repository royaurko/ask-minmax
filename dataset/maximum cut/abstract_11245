The results of a series of five \sax observations of the TeV BL Lac object
1ES2344+514 are briefly presented. Large amplitude luminosity variability,
associated to impressive spectral changes in the hard X-rays, have been found.
The shape of the lightcurve depends on energy, with the flare starting and
ending in the hard band, but with maximum intensity possibly reached earlier in
the soft X-rays. The luminosity and spectral changes may be due to a shift of
the peak of the synchrotron emission from the soft X-rays to the hard X-ray
band similar to that detected during \sax observations of MKN 501.
