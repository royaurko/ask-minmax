The trace norm $\left\Vert G\right\Vert _{\ast}$ of a graph $G$ is the sum of
its singular values, i.e., the absolute values of its eigenvalues. The norm
$\left\Vert G\right\Vert _{\ast}$ has been intensively studied under the name
of graph energy, a concept introduced by Gutman in 1978.
  This note studies the maximum trace norm of $r$-partite graphs, which raises
some unusual problems for $r>2$. It is shown that, if $G$ is an $r$-partite
graph of order $n,$ then \[ \left\Vert G\right\Vert
_{\ast}<\frac{n^{3/2}}{2}\sqrt{1-1/r}+\left( 1-1/r\right) n. \] For some
special $r$ this bound is tight: e.g., if $r$ is the order of a symmetric
conference matrix, then, for infinitely many $n,$ there is a graph $G\ $of
order $n$ with \[ \left\Vert G\right\Vert
_{\ast}>\frac{n^{3/2}}{2}\sqrt{1-1/r}-\left( 1-1/r\right) n.\]
