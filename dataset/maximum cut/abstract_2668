We present a search for chargino and neutralino supersymmetric particles
yielding same signed dilepton final states including one hadronically decaying
tau lepton using 6.0 $fb^{-1}$ of data collected by the the CDF II detector.
This signature is important in SUSY models where, at high $\tan{\beta}$, the
branching ratio of charginos and neutralinos to tau leptons becomes dominant.
We study event acceptance, lepton identification cuts, and efficiencies. We set
limits on the production cross section as a function of SUSY particle mass for
certain generic models.
