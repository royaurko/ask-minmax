The classical electromagnetic field of a spinless point electron is described
in a formalism with extended causality by discrete finite transverse
point-vector fields with discrete and localized point interactions. These
fields are taken as a classical representation of photons, ``classical
photons". They are all transversal photons; there are no scalar nor
longitudinal photons as these are definitely eliminated by the gauge condition.
The angular distribution of emitted photons coincides with the directions of
maximum emission in the standard formalism. The Maxwell formalism and its
standard field are retrieved by the replacement of these discrete fields by
their space-time averages, and in this process scalar and longitudinal photons
are necessarily created and added. Divergences and singularities are
by-products of this averaging process. This formalism enlighten the meaning and
the origin of the non-physical photons, the ones that violate the Lorentz
condition in manifestly covariant quantization methods.
