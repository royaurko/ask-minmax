We studied the cooling of a column of water, primarily in a freezer, and
analyzed the development and movement of an isothermal line at ~4 degC in H2O
and ~11 degC in D2O. Our experiments show that the vertical velocity of the
symmetrical isothermal line moving up the column of water is inversely
proportional to the diameter of the column of water. It has a measured maximum
velocity of 1.4 +/- 0.1 cm/min when the column diameter is 22 mm and decreases
to 0.4 +/- 0.1 cm/min when the diameter is increased to 125 mm. The measurement
of the velocity becomes increasingly difficult to obtain when the column
diameter is less than 22 mm because of the lack of complete development of the
isothermal line. The data and discussion presented in this paper raise serious
questions to the claim of new phase transitions in water made by S. Esposito,
