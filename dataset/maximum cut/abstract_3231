We give a simple derivation of the distribution of the maximum L of the
length of the queue during a busy period for the M/M/1 queue with lambda<1 the
ratio between arrival rate and service rate. We observe that the asymptotic
behavior of the moments of L is related to that of Lambert series for the
generating functions for the sums of powers of divisors of positive integers.
We show how to obtain asymptotic expansions for these moments with error terms
having order as large a power of 1-lambda as desired.
