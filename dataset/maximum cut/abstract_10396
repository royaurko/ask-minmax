We present a theoretical study of gravity waves generated by an anisotropic
moving disturbance. We model the moving object by an elliptical pressure field
of given aspect ratio $\mathcal W$. We study the wake pattern as a function of
$\mathcal W$ and the longitudinal hull Froude number $Fr = V/\sqrt{gL}$, where
$V$ is the velocity, $g$ the acceleration of gravity and $L$ the size of the
disturbance in the direction of motion. For large hull Froude numbers, we
analytically show that the rescaled surface profiles for which $\sqrt{\mathcal
W}/Fr$ is kept constant coincide. In particular, the angle outside which the
surface is essentially flat remains constant and equal to the Kelvin angle, and
the angle corresponding to the maximum amplitude of the waves scales as
$\sqrt{\mathcal W}/Fr$, thus showing that previous work on the wake's angle for
isotropic objects can be extended to anisotropic objects of given aspect ratio.
We then focus on the wave resistance and discuss its properties in the case of
an elliptical Gaussian pressure field. We derive an analytical expression for
the wave resistance in the limit of very elongated objects, and show that the
position of the speed corresponding to the maximum wave resistance scales as
$\sqrt{gL}/\sqrt{\mathcal W}$.
