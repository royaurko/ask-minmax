The aim of this article is to study the functorial properties of the ``formal
geometric quantization'' procedure which is defined for non-compact Hamiltonian
manifolds (when the moment map is proper). For this purpose, we introduce a
technique of symplectic cutting that uses the wonderfull compactification of
Concini-Procesi.
