The energy dependence of hadron production in central Pb+Pb collisions is
presented and discussed. In particular, midrapidity $m_T$-spectra for $\pi^-$,
$K^-$, $K^+$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, $d$, $\phi$, $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ at 40,
80 and 158 $A$GeV are shown. In addition $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ spectra are
available at 158 $A$GeV. The spectra allow to determine the thermal freeze-out
temperature $T$ and the transverse flow velocity $\beta_T$ at the three
energies. We do not observe a significant energy dependence of these
parameters; furthermore there is no indication of early thermal freeze-out of
$\Xi$ and $\Omega$ at 158 $A$GeV. Rapidity spectra for $\pi^-$, $K^-$, $K^+$
and $\phi$ at 40, 80 and 158 $A$GeV are shown, as well as first results on
$\Omega$ rapidity distributions at 158 $A$GeV. The chemical freeze-out
parameters $T$ and $\mu_B$ at the three energies are determined from the total
yields. The parameters are close to the expected phase boundary in the SPS
energy range and above. Using the total yields of kaons and lambdas, the energy
dependence of the strangeness to pion ratio is discussed. A maximum in this
ratio is found at 40 $A$GeV. This maximum could indicate the formation of
deconfined matter at energies above 40 $A$GeV. A search for open charm in a
large sample of 158 $A$GeV events is presented. No signal is observed. This
result is compared to several model predictions.
