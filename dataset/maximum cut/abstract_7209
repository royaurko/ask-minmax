As a new topological material, ZrTe5 exhibits novel properties. Pressure is
believed to be effective for studying the topological phase transitions
experimentally. In this work, we have performed resistance and ac magnetic
susceptibility measurements for ZrTe5 single crystal at various pressures up to
68.5 GPa. We show that, accompanied by complete suppression of the high
temperature resistance anomaly, superconductivity is induced at a critical
pressure of 6.2 GPa. The superconducting transition temperature Tc initially
increases with pressure then decreases slightly with a maximum of 4.0 K at 14.6
GPa. At pressures above 21.2 GPa, a second superconducting phase with the
maximum Tc of about 6.0 K manifests and coexists with the original one. We also
performed the density functional theory calculations to explore the possibility
of topological superconductivity in the pressurized ZrTe5.
