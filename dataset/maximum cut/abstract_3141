We study the problem of maximum likelihood estimation for general patterns of
bivariate missing data for normal and multinomial random variables, under the
assumption that the data is missing at random (MAR). For normal data, the score
equations have nine complex solutions, at least one of which is real and
statistically significant. Our computations suggest that the number of real
solutions is related to whether or not the MAR assumption is satisfied. In the
multinomial case, all solutions to the score equations are real and the number
of real solutions grows exponentially in the number of states of the underlying
random variables, though there is always precisely one statistically
significant local maxima.
