Recent literature has seen an ongoing discussion on the limiting mass of
strongly magnetized white dwarfs, since such objects may prove to be a source
of over-luminous type-Ia supernovae. In an earlier paper, we have presented the
mass-radius relation of white dwarfs with a strong poloidal magnetic field in
Newtonian gravity. The inclusion of effects such as general relativistic
gravity and many-body corrections to the equation of state can alter the
mass-radius relation and the maximum mass. In this work we estimate the extent
to which these effects may modify the earlier results. We find that the general
relativistic effects tend to reduce the maximum mass by about 2% and many-body
corrections by another additional $\sim$2%, for an assumed carbon composition.
We also explore field geometries that are purely toroidal or a mixture of
poloidal and toroidal and find that the limiting mass of such equilibrium
configurations can be substantially higher than in the case of a purely
poloidal field.
