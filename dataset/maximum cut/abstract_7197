In this paper we study the problem of estimating innercyclic time intervals
within repetitive motion sequences of top-class swimmers in a swimming channel.
Interval limits are given by temporal occurrences of key-poses, i.e.
distinctive postures of the body. A key-pose is defined by means of only one or
two specific features of the complete posture. It is often difficult to detect
such subtle features directly. We therefore propose the following method: Given
that we observe the swimmer from the side, we build a pictorial structure of
poselets to robustly identify random support poses within the regular motion of
a swimmer. We formulate a maximum likelihood model which predicts a key-pose
given the occurrences of multiple support poses within one stroke. The maximum
likelihood can be extended with prior knowledge about the temporal location of
a key-pose in order to improve the prediction recall. We experimentally show
that our models reliably and robustly detect key-poses with a high precision
and that their performance can be improved by extending the framework with
additional camera views.
