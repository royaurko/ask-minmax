The differential spectrum of TeV gamma rays between 1.5 TeV and 20 TeV from
the north-east rim of SN1006 was obtained from the data observed in 1996 and
1997 using the 3.8m CANGAROO \v{C}erenkov telescope. This spectrum matches the
model calculated using the Inverse Compton (IC) process with 2.7k Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB). This enables us to estimate the absolute strength
of the magnetic field around the shock and the maximum energy of accelerated
electrons with the considerable accuracy: the obtained field strength and
maximum electron energy are $4\pm1$ $\mu$G and 50 TeV respectively.
  Also we have detected again the TeV gamma-ray emission from the same position
using the 10m CANGAROO-II telescope in 2000, and the preliminary spectrum
around 1 TeV region is presented in this conference. The two spectra agree well
in the overlapped energy region.
