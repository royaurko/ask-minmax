After the final analyses of the H1 and ZEUS collaborations for the
diffractive photoproduction of dijets have appeared, we have recalculated these
cross sections in next-to-leading order (NLO) of perturbative QCD to see
whether they can be interpreted consistently. The results of these calculations
are compared to the data of both collaborations. We find that at NLO the cross
sections disagree with the data, showing that factorization breaking occurs at
this order. If direct and resolved contributions are both suppressed by the
same amount, the global suppression factor depends on the transverse-energy cut
and is 0.42 for the H1 and 0.71 for the ZEUS analysis. However, by suppressing
only the resolved contribution by a factor of approximately three, also
reasonably good agreement with all the data is found. The size of the
factorization breaking effects for resolved photons agrees with
absorptive-model predictions.
