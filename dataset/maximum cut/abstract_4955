Stereoscopic visualization adds an additional dimension to the viewer's
experience, giving them a sense of distance. In a general relativistic
visualization, distance can be measured in a variety of ways. We argue that the
affine distance, which matches the usual notion of distance in flat spacetime,
is a natural distance to use in curved spacetime. As an example, we apply
affine distance to the visualization of the interior of a black hole. Affine
distance is not the distance perceived with normal binocular vision in curved
spacetime. However, the failure of binocular vision is simply a limitation of
animals who have evolved in flat spacetime, not a fundamental obstacle to depth
perception in curved spacetime. Trinocular vision would provide superior depth
perception.
