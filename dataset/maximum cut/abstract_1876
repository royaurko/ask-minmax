The mean kinetic energy of protons in water is determined by Deep Inelastic
Neutron Scattering experiments, performed above and below the temperature of
maximum density and in the supercooled phase. The temperature dependence of
this energy shows an anomalous behavior, as it occurs for many water
properties. In particular two regions of maximum kinetic energy are identified:
the first one, in the supercooled phase in the range 269 K - 272 K, and a
second one above 273 K. In both these regions the measured proton kinetic
energy exceedes the theoretical prediction based on a semi-classical model.
Noteworthy, the proton mean kinetic energy has a maximum at 277 K, the
temperature of the maximum density of water. In the supercooled metastable
phase the measured mean kinetic energy and the proton momentum distribution
clearly indicate proton delocalization between two H-bonded oxygens.
