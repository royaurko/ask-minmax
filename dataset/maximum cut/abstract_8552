We study nonlocal vortex transport in mesoscopic amorphous Nb0.7Ge0.3
samples. A dc current I is passed through a wire connected via a perpendicular
channel, of a length L= 2-5 um, with a pair of voltage probes where a nonlocal
response Vnl ~ I is measured. The maximum of Rnl=Vnl/I for a given temperature
occurs at an L-independent magnetic field and is proportional to 1/L. The
results are interpreted in terms of the dissipative vortex motion along the
channel driven by a remote current, and can be understood in terms of a simple
model.
