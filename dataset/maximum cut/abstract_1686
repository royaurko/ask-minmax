Algebraic immunity of Boolean function $f$ is defined as the minimal degree
of a nonzero $g$ such that $fg=0$ or $(f+1)g=0$. Given a positive even integer
$n$, it is found that the weight distribution of any $n$-variable symmetric
Boolean function with maximum algebraic immunity $\frac{n}{2}$ is determined by
the binary expansion of $n$. Based on the foregoing, all $n$-variable symmetric
Boolean functions with maximum algebraic immunity are constructed. The amount
is $(2\wt(n)+1)2^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor}$
