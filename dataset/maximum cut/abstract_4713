The hadronic kt-spectrum inside a high energy jet is determined including
corrections of relative magnitude O{\sqrt{\alpha_s}} with respect to the
Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA), in the limiting spectrum
approximation (assuming an infrared cut-off Q0 =Lambda_{QCD}) and beyond
Q_0\ne\Lambda_{QCD}. The results in the limiting spectrum approximation are
found to be, after normalization, in impressive agreement with preliminary
measurements by the CDF collaboration, unlike what occurs at MLLA, pointing out
small overall non-perturbative contributions. Within the same framework,
2-particle correlations inside a jet are also predicted at NMLLA and compared
to previous MLLA calculations.
