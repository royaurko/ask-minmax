A new model is proposed to a collapsing star consisting of an anisotropic
fluid with bulk viscosity, radial heat flow and outgoing radiation. In a
previous paper one of us has introduced a function time dependent into the
$g_{rr}$, besides the time dependent metric functions $g_{\theta\theta}$ and
$g_{\phi\phi}$. The aim of this work is to generalize this previous model by
introducing bulk viscosity and compare it to the non-viscous collapse. The
behavior of the density, pressure, mass, luminosity and the effective adiabatic
index is analyzed. Our work is also compared to the case of a collapsing fluid
with bulk viscosity of another previous model, for a star with 6 $M_{\odot}$.
The pressure of the star, at the beginning of the collapse, is isotropic but
due to the presence of the bulk viscosity the pressure becomes more and more
anisotropic. The black hole is never formed because the apparent horizon
formation condition is never satisfied, in contrast of the previous model where
a black hole is formed. An observer at infinity sees a radial point source
radiating exponentially until reaches the time of maximum luminosity and
suddenly the star turns off. In contrast of the former model where the
luminosity also increases exponentially, reaching a maximum and after it
decreases until the formation of the black hole. The effective adiabatic index
diminishes due to the bulk viscosity, thus increasing the instability of the
system, in both models, in the former paper and in this work.
