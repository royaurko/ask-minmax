We demonstrate a smooth and low loss silver (Ag) optical superlens capable of
resolving features at 1/12th of the illumination wavelength with high fidelity.
This is made possible by utilizing state-of-the-art nanoimprint technology and
intermediate wetting layer of germanium (Ge) for the growth of flat silver
films with surface roughness at sub-nanometer scales. Our measurement of the
resolved lines of 30nm half-pitch shows a full-width at half-maximum better
than 37nm, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. The development
of this unique optical superlens lead promise to parallel imaging and
nanofabrication in a single snapshot, a feat that are not yet available with
other nanoscale imaging techniques such as atomic force microscope or scanning
electron microscope.
