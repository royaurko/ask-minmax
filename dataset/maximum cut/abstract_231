A symplectic cut of a manifold M with a Hamiltonian circle action is a
symplectic quotient of M x C. If M is Kaehler then, since C is Kaehler, the cut
space is Kaehler as well. The symplectic structure on the cut is well
understood. In this paper we describe the complex structure (and hence the
metric) on the cut. We then generalize the construction to the case where M has
a torus action and C is replaced by a toric Kaehler manifold.
