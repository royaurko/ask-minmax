We report a systematic study on the effect of sintering temperature on the
structural and superconducting properties of nominal SmO0.8F0.2FeAs fabricated
by simple one-step solid state reaction method. A detailed correlation between
the sintering temperature, structure, onset transition temperature (Tc) and
critical current density (Jc) has been found in all samples of each batch. Most
importantly, samples sintered at a low temperature clearly shows high Tc, for
example the Tc of the samples sintered at 850C is even above 53 K, and the
samples prepared at 1000C display the highest Tc of 56.1 K reported so far.
Furthermore, the samples sintered at 1000C also show the highest RRR and the
lowest resistivity(57K), indicating the low impurity scattering and enhanced
carrier density. However, the maximum Jc of 10510 A/cm^2 at 5 K in self field
was achieved in the samples sintered at 1100oC. The dependence of Tc on a-axis
lattice constant indicates that the sintering temperature has strong influence
on the effective substitution level of F for O. This result suggests that
annealing at a temperature of ~1000C seems much better for obtaining high
quality 1111 phase oxypnictides, compared to commonly used temperatures of
around 1200C.
