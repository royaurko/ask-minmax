We investigate the efficiency of systems of molecular motors operating at
maximum power. We consider two models of kinesin motors on a microtubule: for
both the simplified and the detailed model, we find that the many-body
exclusion effect enhances the efficiency at maximum power of the many-motor
system, with respect to the single motor case. Remarkably, we find that this
effect occurs in a limited region of the system parameters, compatible with the
biologically relevant range.
