Using a generalized cut vertex expansion we introduce the concept of an
extended fracture function for the description of semi-inclusive deep inelastic
processes in the target fragmentation region. Extended fracture functions are
shown to obey a standard homogeneous DGLAP-type equation which, upon
integration over t, becomes the usual inhomogeneous evolution equation for
ordinary fracture functions.
