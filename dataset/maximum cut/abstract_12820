Using the local density approximation (LDA) and a realistic phonon spectrum
we determine the momentum and frequency dependence of $\alpha^2F({\bf
k},\omega)$ in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ for the bonding, antibonding, and chain band.
The resulting self-energy $\Sigma$ is rather small near the Fermi surface. For
instance, for the antibonding band the maximum of $Re \Sigma$ as a function of
frequency is about 7 meV at the nodal point in the normal state and the ratio
of bare and renormalized Fermi velocities 1.18. These values are a factor 3-5
too small compared to the experiment showing that only a small part of $\Sigma$
can be attributed to phonons. Furthermore, the frequency dependence of the
renormalization factor $Z({\bf k},\omega)$ is smooth and has no anomalies at
the observed kink frequencies which means that phonons cannot produce
well-pronounced kinks in stoichiometric YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$, at least, within
the LDA.
