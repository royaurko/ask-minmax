We investigate the detection of exotic massive strongly interacting hadrons
(uhecrons) in ultra high energy cosmic ray telescopes. The conclusion is that
experiments such as the Pierre Auger Observatory have the potential to detect
these particles. It is shown that uhecron showers have clear distinctive
features when compared to proton and nuclear showers. The simulation of uhecron
air showers, and its detection and reconstruction by fluorescence telescopes is
described. We determine basic cuts in observables that will separate uhecrons
from the cosmic ray bulk, assuming this is composed by protons. If these are
composed by heavier nucleus the separation will be much improved. We also
discuss photon induced showers. The complementarity between uhecron detection
in accelerator experiments is discussed.
