Electronic energy-eigen-states of graphene in an orthogonal electromagnetic
field with relative magnitude beta=E/vf*B>=1 or in a pure electric field are
obtained by a differential-equation method. Gaussian wave packets of
probability density are constructed and found to transform form two-dimensional
solitons into one-dimension ones at beta=1, when beta increases form beta<1
into beta>1. The maximum number of one-dimensional solitons of a finite
graphene in the field is used to determine the electronic energy levels. These
energy levels and the velocity of solitons lead to nonlinear dependence of the
current on the Hall voltage for the field with beta>1 and nonlinear
current-voltage curves for the pure electric field including the step-like ones
at low temperatures, according to the ballistic transport of solitons.
