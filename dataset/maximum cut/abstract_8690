The complete O(\alpha) corrections including soft-photon bremsstrahlung to
the process e^+ e^- -> W^+ W^- in the MSSM are calculated for on-shell W
bosons. The relative difference between the MSSM and Standard Model corrections
is generally quite small. The maximum deviation from the Standard Model within
the scanned region of parameter space is \lesssim 1.5% for unpolarized and
transversally polarized W bosons, and \lesssim 2.7% for longitudinal W bosons.
