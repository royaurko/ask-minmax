SiGe islands are used to induce tensile strain in the Si channel of Field
Effect Transistors to achieve larger transconductance and higher current
driveabilities. We report on x-ray diffraction experiments on a single
fully-processed and functional device with a TiN+Al gate stack and source,
gate, and drain contacts in place. The strain fields in the Si channel were
explored using an x-ray beam focused to 400 nm diameter combined with finite
element simulations. A maximum in-plane tensile strain of about 1% in the Si
channel was found, which is by a factor of three to four higher than achievable
for dislocation-free tensile strained Si in state-of-the-art devices.
