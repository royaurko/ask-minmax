The paper studies large sample asymptotic properties of the Maximum
Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for the parameter of a continuous time Markov chain,
observed in white noise. Using the method of weak convergence of likelihoods
due to I.Ibragimov and R.Khasminskii, consistency, asymptotic normality and
convergence of moments are established for MLE under certain strong ergodicity
conditions of the chain.
