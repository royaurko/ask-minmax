We study the possibility of detecting the Higgs boson in the intermediate
mass range via its two jet channel. We consider only Higgs bosons produced in
association with a $t \bar{t}$ pair. Both $t$ and $\bar{t}$ are required to
decay semileptonically to reduce the QCD background. The signal is compared
with the main background, $t \bar{t} + 2$ jets, after appropriate cuts. A
sizable signal above background is seen in our simulation at the parton level.
Use of the $t\bar{t}Z$ channel with $ Z$ decaying to $l^+ l^-$ is suggested for
eliminating theoretical uncertainties in determining the $t \bar{t}H$ signal.
