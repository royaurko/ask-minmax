We propose a general statistical inference framework to capture the privacy
threat incurred by a user that releases data to a passive but curious
adversary, given utility constraints. We show that applying this general
framework to the setting where the adversary uses the self-information cost
function naturally leads to a non-asymptotic information-theoretic approach for
characterizing the best achievable privacy subject to utility constraints.
Based on these results we introduce two privacy metrics, namely average
information leakage and maximum information leakage. We prove that under both
metrics the resulting design problem of finding the optimal mapping from the
user's data to a privacy-preserving output can be cast as a modified
rate-distortion problem which, in turn, can be formulated as a convex program.
Finally, we compare our framework with differential privacy.
