The Xi^+_c lifetime is measured using 9.0 fb^-1 of e+e- annihilation data
collected on and just below the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the CLEO II.V
detector at CESR. This is the first measurement of the Xi^+_c lifetime from a
collider experiment. Using an unbinned maximum likelihood fit, the Xi^+_c
lifetime is measured to be 503 +/- 47 (stat.) +/- 18 (syst.) fs. The precision
of this measurement is comparable to previous measurements carried out by fixed
target experiments with different sources of systematic uncertainties.
