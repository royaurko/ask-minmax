In the minimal Standard Model, it is commonly believed that the Higgs mass
cannot be too small, otherwise Top quark dynamics makes the Higgs potential
unstable. Although this Higgs mass lower bound is relevant for current
phenomenology, we show that the Higgs vacuum instability in fact does not exist
and only appears when treating incorrectly the cut-off in the renormalization
of a trivial theory. We also demonstrate how to calculate correctly the
regulator-dependent Higgs mass lower bound.
