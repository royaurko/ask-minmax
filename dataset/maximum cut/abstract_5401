We measured the cross-correlation of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP) 7 year temperature map and the full sky data release of the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) galaxy map. Using careful mapmaking and masking
techniques we find a positive cross-correlation signal. The results are fully
consistent with a Lambda-CDM Universe, although not statistically significant.
Our findings are robust against changing the galactic latitude cut from |b|>10
to |b|>20 and no color dependence was detected when we used WMAP Q, V or W
maps. We confirm higher significance correlations found in the preliminary data
release. The change in significance is consistent with cosmic variance.
