Proton-proton correlations from spectator decays following Au + Au collisions
at 1000 AMeV have been measured with an highly efficient detector hodoscope.
The constructed correlation functions indicate a moderate expansion and low
breakup densities similar to assumptions made in statistical multifragmentation
models. In agreement with a volume breakup rather short time scales were
deduced employing directional cuts in proton-proton correlations.
