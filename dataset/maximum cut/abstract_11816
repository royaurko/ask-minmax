Shear yielding of glassy polymers is usually described in terms of the
pressure-dependent Tresca or von Mises yield criteria. We test these criteria
against molecular dynamics simulations of deformation in amorphous polymer
glasses under triaxial loading conditions that are difficult to realize in
experiments. Difficulties and ambiguities in extending several standard
definitions of the yield point to triaxial loads are described. Two
definitions, the maximum and offset octahedral stresses, are then used to
evaluate the yield stress for a wide range of model parameters. In all cases,
the onset of shear is consistent with the pressure-modified von Mises
criterion, and the pressure coefficient is nearly independent of many
parameters. Under triaxial tensile loading, the mode of failure changes to
cavitation.
