We prove the existence of a function $f :\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that
the vertices of every planar graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ can be
3-colored in such a way that each monochromatic component has at most
$f(\Delta)$ vertices. This is best possible (the number of colors cannot be
reduced and the dependence on the maximum degree cannot be avoided) and answers
a question raised by Kleinberg, Motwani, Raghavan, and Venkatasubramanian in
1997. Our result extends to graphs of bounded genus.
