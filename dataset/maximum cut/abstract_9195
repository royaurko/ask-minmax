The performance of principal component analysis (PCA) suffers badly in the
presence of outliers. This paper proposes two novel approaches for robust PCA
based on semidefinite programming. The first method, maximum mean absolute
deviation rounding (MDR), seeks directions of large spread in the data while
damping the effect of outliers. The second method produces a low-leverage
decomposition (LLD) of the data that attempts to form a low-rank model for the
data by separating out corrupted observations. This paper also presents
efficient computational methods for solving these SDPs. Numerical experiments
confirm the value of these new techniques.
