Traditionally the exponential canonical distributions of Gibbsian statistical
mechanics are given theoretical justification in at least four different ways:
steepest descent method, counting method, Khinchin's method based on te central
limit theorem, and maximum entropy principle of Jaynes. Equally ubiquitous
power-law canonical distributions are shown to be given similar justification
by appropriately adopting these formulations.
