We study the minimal model of conformal technicolor, an SU(2) gauge theory
near a strongly coupled conformal fixed point, with conformal symmetry softly
broken by technifermion mass terms. Conformal symmetry breaking triggers chiral
symmetry breaking in the pattern SU(4) -> Sp(4), which gives rise to a
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson that can act as a composite Higgs boson. The top
quark is elementary, and the top and electroweak gauge loop contributions to
the Higgs mass are cut off entirely by Higgs compositeness. In particular, the
model requires no top partners and no "little Higgs" mechanism. A nontrivial
vacuum alignment results from the interplay of the top loop and technifermion
mass terms. The composite Higgs mass is completely determined by the top loop,
in the sense that m_h/m_t is independent of the vacuum alignment and is
computable by a strong-coupling calculation. There is an additional composite
pseudoscalar A with mass larger than m_h and suppressed direct production at
LHC. We discuss the electroweak fit in this model in detail. Corrections to Z
-> bb and the T parameter from the top sector are suppressed by the enhanced
Sp(4) custodial symmetry. Even assuming that the strong contribution to the S
parameter is positive and usuppressed, a good electroweak fit can be obtained
for v/f ~ 0.25, where v and f are the electroweak and chiral symmetry breaking
scales respectively. This requires fine tuning at the 10% level.
