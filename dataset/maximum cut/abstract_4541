This note is devoted to a trick which yields almost trivial proofs that
certain complexes associated to topological surfaces are connected or simply
connected. Applications include new proofs that the complexes of curves,
separating curves, nonseparating curves, pants, and cut systems are all
connected for genus $g \gg 0$. We also prove that two new complexes are
connected : one involves curves which split a genus $2g$ surface into two genus
$g$ pieces, and the other involves curves which are homologous to a fixed
curve. The connectivity of the latter complex can be interpreted as saying the
``homology'' relation on the surface is (for $g \geq 3$) generated by
``embedded/disjoint homologies''. We finally prove that the complex of
separating curves is simply connected for $g \geq 4$.
