We have developed a fermionic boot-strap method to solve a class of chiral
one dimensional fermion model which cannot be tackled by bosonization. Using
this scheme, we show that Luttinger liquid behavior in a gas of four
interacting chiral Majorana fermions is highly sensitive to the velocity
degeneracy. Upon changing the velocity of a one chiral fermion, a sharp bound
(or anti-bound) state splits off from the original Luttinger liquid continuum,
cutting off the X-ray singularity to form a broad incoherent excitation with a
lifetime that grows linearly with frequency.
