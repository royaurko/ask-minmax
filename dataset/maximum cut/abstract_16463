A review is given of recent developments on the implications of supergravity
grand unification with SU(5)-type proton decay under the condition $M_{H_3}
/m_G < 10$ (where $M_{H_3}$ is the Higgs triplet mass) and the naturalness
condition that the universal scalar mass $m_0$ and the gluino mass are $<$
1~TeV. It is shown that the maximum achievable lifetime limits on proton
lifetime at Super Kamiokande and ICARUS will exhaust the full parameter space
of the model under the constraint $m_{\tilde W_1} >$~100~GeV. Thus the model
predicts the observation of either a light chargino with mass $\lappeq$~100~GeV
, or the observation of a $\bar \nu K^+$ mode at Super Kamiokande and ICARUS
within the above naturalness constraints.Analysis of the $b \rightarrow s\gamma
$ branching ratio within this model is also discussed. It is shown that there
is a significant region of the parameter space where the branching ratio
predicted by the model lies within the current experimental bounds. It is
pointed out that improved measurements of $B(b\rightarrow s\gamma)$ will
significantly delineate the parameter space of the model and allow for a more
stringent determination of their allowed ranges.
