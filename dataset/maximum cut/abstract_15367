Hypersound Absorption of acoustic phonons having $ql>>1$ in a degenerate
Carbon Nanotube (CNT) with linear energy dispersion near the Fermi level was
theoretically studied. The general expression for the absorption coefficient
($\Gamma$) under a non-quantizing electric field ($E$) with drift velocity
($V_D$)was obtained. At $T = 10K$ and scattering angle $\theta > 0$, the
dependence of $\Gamma$ on acoustic wave number ($\vec{q}$), frequency
($\omega_q$), and $\gamma = 1-\frac{V_D}{V_s}$, ($V_s$ being the speed of
sound) were analysed numerically at $n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2$ (where $n$ represent
the various harmonics) and presented graphically. In a $3D$ representation,
when $\gamma < 0$, the maximum amplification was attained at $V_D = 1.1V_s$
which occurred at $E = 51.7Vcm^{-1}$. In the second harmonics, ($n =\pm 2$),
the absorption obtained was compared to experimental measurement of
acoustoelectric current via the Weinreich relation. From the graphs, the
observed amplification of acoustic phonons caused by intraband transition shows
CNT as a promising hypersound generator (SASER).
