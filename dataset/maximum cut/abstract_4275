We present a new analysis of parton distributions of the proton. This
incorporates a wide range of new data, an improved treatment of heavy flavours
and a re-examination of prompt photon production. The new set (MRST) shows
systematic differences from previous sets of partons which can be identified
with particular features of the new data and with improvements in the analysis.
We also investigate the sensitivities of the results to (i) the uncertainty in
the determination of the gluon at large x, (ii) the value of alpha_S(M_Z^2) and
(iii) the minimum Q^2 cut on the data that are included in the global fit.
