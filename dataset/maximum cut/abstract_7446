We have used two-fluid dynamics to study the discrepancy between the work of
Thouless, Ao and Niu (TAN) and that of Iordanskii. In TAN no transverse force
on a vortex due to normal fluid flow was found, whereas the earlier work found
a transverse force proportional to normal fluid velocity u and normal fluid
density. We have linearized the time-independent two-fluid equations about the
exact solution for a vortex, and find three solutions which are important in
the region far from the vortex. Uniform superfluid flow gives rise to the usual
superfluid Magnus force. Uniform normal fluid flow gives rise to no forces in
the linear region, but does not satisfy reasonable boundary conditions at short
distances. A logarithmically increasing normal fluid flow gives a viscous
force. As in classical hydrodynamics, and as in the early work of Hall and
Vinen, this logarithmic increase must be cut off by nonlinear effects at large
distances; this gives a viscous force proportional to u/ln(u), and a transverse
contribution which goes like u/(ln u)^2, even in the absence of an explicit
Iordanskii force. In the limit u goes to zero the TAN result is obtained, but
at nonzero u there are important corrections that were not found in TAN. We
argue that the Magnus force in a superfluid at nonzero temperature is an
example of a topological relation for which finite-size corrections may be
large.
