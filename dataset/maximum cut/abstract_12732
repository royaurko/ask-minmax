We report the realization of a light source specifically designed for the
generation of bright continuous-variable entangled beams and for
Heisenberg-limited inteferometry. The source is a nondegenerate, single-mode,
continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator in Na:KTP, operated at frequency
degeneracy and just above threshold, which is also of interest for the study of
critical fluctuations at the transition point. The residual
frequency-difference jitter is $\pm$ 150 kHz for a 3 MHz cold cavity half-width
at half maximum. We observe 4 dB of photon-number-difference squeezing at 200
kHz. The Na:KTP crystal is noncritically phase-matched for a 532 nm pump and
polarization crosstalk is therefore practically nonexistent.
