The FITS is the standard file format in astronomy, and it has been extended
to agree with astronomical needs of the day. However, astronomical datasets
have been inflating year by year. In case of ALMA telescope, a ~ TB scale
4-dimensional data cube may be produced for one target. Considering that
typical Internet bandwidth is a few 10 MB/s at most, the original data cubes in
FITS format are hosted on a VO server, and the region which a user is
interested in should be cut out and transferred to the user (Eguchi et al.,
2012). The system will equip a very high-speed disk array to process a TB scale
data cube in a few 10 seconds, and disk I/O speed, endian conversion and data
processing one will be comparable. Hence to reduce the endian conversion time
is one of issues to realize our system. In this paper, I introduce a technique
named "just-in-time endian conversion", which delays the endian conversion for
each pixel just before it is really needed, to sweep out the endian conversion
time; by applying this method, the FITS processing speed increases 20% for
single threading, and 40% for multi-threading compared to CFITSIO. The speed-up
by the method tightly relates to modern CPU architecture to improve the
efficiency of instruction pipelines due to break of "causality", a programmed
instruction code sequence.
