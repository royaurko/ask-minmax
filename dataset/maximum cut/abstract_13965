We investigate the dissipative loss in the $\pm J$ Ising spin glass in three
dimensions through the scaling of the hysteresis area, for a maximum magnetic
field that is equal to the saturation field. We perform a systematic analysis
for the whole range of the bond randomness as a function of the sweep rate, by
means of frustration-preserving hard-spin mean field theory. Data collapse
within the entirety of the spin-glass phase driven adiabatically (i.e.,
infinitely-slow field variation) is found, revealing a power-law scaling of the
hysteresis area as a function of the antiferromagnetic bond fraction and the
temperature. Two dynamic regimes separated by a threshold frequency $\omega_c$
characterize the dependence on the sweep rate of the oscillating field. For
$\omega < \omega_c$, the hysteresis area is equal to its value in the adiabatic
limit $\omega = 0$, while for $\omega > \omega_c$ it increases with the
frequency through another randomness-dependent power law.
