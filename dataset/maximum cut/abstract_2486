Experimental prospects for studying high-energy photon-photon and
photon-proton interactions at the LHC are discussed. Assuming a typical LHC
multipurpose detector, various signals and their irreducible backgrounds are
presented after applying acceptance cuts. Selection strategies based on photon
interaction tagging techniques are presented. Prospects are discussed for the
Higgs boson search, detection of SUSY particles and of anomalous quartic gauge
couplings, as well as for the top quark physics.
