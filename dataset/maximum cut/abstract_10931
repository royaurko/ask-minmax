Proton acceleration by high-intensity laser pulses from ultra-thin foils for
hadron therapy is discussed. With the improvement of the laser intensity
contrast ratio to 10-11 achieved on Hercules laser at the University of
Michigan, it became possible to attain laser-solid interactions at intensities
up to 1022 W/cm2 that allows an efficient regime of laser-driven ion
acceleration from submicron foils. Particle-In-Cell (PIC) computer simulations
of proton acceleration in the Directed Coulomb explosion regime from ultra-thin
double-layer (heavy ions / light ions) foils of different thicknesses were
performed under the anticipated experimental conditions for Hercules laser with
pulse energies from 3 to 15 J, pulse duration of 30 fs at full width half
maximum (FWHM), focused to a spot size of 0.8 microns (FWHM). In this regime
heavy ions expand predominantly in the direction of laser pulse propagation
enhancing the longitudinal charge separation electric field that accelerates
light ions. The dependence of the maximum proton energy on the foil thickness
has been found and the laser pulse characteristics have been matched with the
thickness of the target to ensure the most efficient acceleration. Moreover the
proton spectrum demonstrates a peaked structure at high energies, which is
required for radiation therapy. 2D PIC simulations show that a 150-500 TW laser
pulse is able to accelerate protons up to 100-220 MeV energies.
