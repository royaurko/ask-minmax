The associate $J/\psi+\gamma$ production at the LHC is studied completely at
next-to-leading-order (NLO) within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD. By
using three sets of color-octet long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) obtained
in previous prompt $J/\psi$ studies, we find that only one of them can result
in a positive transverse momentum ($p_t$) distribution of $J/\psi$ production
rate at large $p_t$ region. Based on reasonable consideration to cut down
background, our estimation is measurable upto $p_t=50$GeV with present data
sample collected at $8$TeV LHC. All the color-octet LDMEs in $J/\psi$
production could be fixed sensitively by including this proposed measurement
and our calculation, and then confident conclusion on $J/\psi$ polarization
puzzle could be achieved.
