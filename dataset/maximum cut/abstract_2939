We follow the evolution of galaxy systems in numerical simulation. Our goal
is to understand the role of density perturbations of various scales in the
formation and evolution of the cosmic web. We perform numerical simulations
with the full power spectrum of perturbations, and with spectrum cut at long
wavelengths. Additionally, we have one model, where we cut the intermediate
waves. We analyze the density field and study the void sizes and density field
clusters in different models. Our analysis shows that the fine structure
(groups and clusters of galaxies) is created by small-scale density
perturbations of scale $\leq 8$ \Mpc. Filaments of galaxies and clusters are
created by perturbations of intermediate scale from $\sim 8$ to $\sim 32$ \Mpc,
superclusters of galaxies by larger perturbations. We conclude that the scale
of the pattern of the cosmic web is determined by density perturbations of
scale up to $\sim 100$ \Mpc. Larger perturbations do not change the pattern of
the web, but modulate the richness of galaxy systems, and make voids emptier.
The stop of the increase of the scale of the pattern of the cosmic web with
increasing scale of density perturbations can probably be explained as the
freezing of the web at redshift $z\simeq 0.7$.
