We show that the dipole, a system usually proposed to model relaxation
phenomena, exhibits a maximum in the signal-to-noise ratio at a non-zero noise
level, thus indicating the appearance of stochastic resonance. The phenomenon
occurs in two different situations, i.e. when the minimum of the potential of
the dipole remains fixed in time and when it switches periodically between two
equilibrium points. We have also found that the signal-to-noise ratio has a
maximum for a certain value of the amplitude of the oscillating field.
