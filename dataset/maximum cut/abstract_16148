We present an analysis of the thin layer of Galactic warm ionized gas at an
angular resolution ~ 10'. This is carried out using radio continuum data at 1.4
GHz, 2.7 GHz and 5 GHz in the coordinate region 20 < l < 30 deg, -1.5 < b <
+1.5 deg. For this purpose, we evaluate the zero level of the 2.7 and 5 GHz
surveys using auxiliary data at 2.3 GHz and 408 MHz. The derived zero level
corrections are T_{zero}(2.7 GHz)=0.15 +/- 0.06 K and T_{zero}(5 GHz)=0.1 +/-
0.05 K. We separate the thermal (free-free) and non-thermal (synchrotron)
component by means of a spectral analysis performed adopting an antenna
temperature spectral index -2.1 for the free-free emission, a realistic spatial
distribution of indices for the synchrotron radiation and by fitting,
pixel-by-pixel, the Galactic spectral index. We find that at 5 GHz, for |b| = 0
deg, the fraction of thermal emission reaches a maximum value of 82%, while at
1.4 GHz, the corresponding value is 68%. In addition, for the thermal emission,
the analysis indicates a dominant contribution of the diffuse component
relative to the source component associated with discrete HII regions.
