In this article we use the adiabatic method to prove the gluing formula of
real analytic torsion forms for a flat vector bundle on a smooth fibration
under the assumption that the fiberwise twisted cohomology groups associated to
the fibration of the cutting hypersurface are vanished. In this paper we assume
that the metrics have product structures near the cutting hypersurface.
