Color encoding of depth is shown to occur naturally in images of objects
observed through diffraction gratings under common white light illumination. A
synthetic image is then obtained from a single point of view, a phenomenon that
can be applied to stereophotography. The image can be recorded in a common
color photograph, providing a simple method of visual decoding by means of
ordinary colored 3D spectacles. The fundamental equation and the photographic
procedure for maximum fidelity in three-dimensional reproduction are described.
The result is a photograph that has the capability of registering all the views
of an object in a continuous sequence, which is called holophotography and was
previously obtained by means of a hologram. By eliminating the need for a laser
and holographic film, a new technique for holography in white light is
foreseen.
