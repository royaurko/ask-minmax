The advancements in microwave power transfer (MPT) over past decades have
enabled wireless power transfer over long distances. The latest breakthroughs
in wireless communication, namely massive MIMO, small cells and millimeter-wave
communication, make wireless networks suitable platforms for implementing MPT.
This can lead to the elimination of the "last wires" connecting mobile devices
to the grid for recharging, thereby tackling a long-standing ICT grand
challenge. Furthermore, the seamless integration between MPT and wireless
communication opens a new area called wirelessly powered communications (WPC)
where many new research directions arise e.g., simultaneous
information-and-power transfer, WPC network architectures, and techniques for
safe and efficient WPC. This article provides an introduction to WPC by
describing the key features of WPC, shedding light on a set of frequently asked
questions, and identifying the key design issues and discussing possible
solutions.
