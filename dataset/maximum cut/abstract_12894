A discussion of results for short and long-range multiplicity correlations
(forward-backward) are presented for several systems (Au+Au, Cu+Cu, and pp) and
energies (e.g. $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200, 62.4, and $\approx$ 20 GeV). These
correlations are measured with increasing values of a gap in pseudorapidity,
from no gap at midrapidity to a separation of 1.6 units ($|\eta|$ = 0.8). For
the highest energy, central A+A collisions, the forward-backward correlation
strength maintains a constant value across the measurement region. In
peripheral collisions, at lower energies, and in pp data, the maximum appears
at midrapidity. This result may indicate the possible formation of high density
matter for central A+A collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.
