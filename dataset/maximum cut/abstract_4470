We give a detailed study of the associativity anomaly in open string field
theory from the viewpoint of the split string and Moyal formalisms. The origin
of the anomaly is reduced to the properties of the special infinite size
matrices which relate the conventional open string to the split string
variables, and is intimately related to midpoint issues. We discuss two steps
to cope with the anomaly. We identify the field subspace that causes the
anomaly which is related to the existence of closed string configurations, and
indicate a decomposition of open/closed string sectors. We then propose a
consistent cut off method with a finite number of string modes that guarantees
associativity at every step of any computation.
