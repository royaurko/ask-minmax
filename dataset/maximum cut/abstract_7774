Blue hook (BHk) stars are a rare class of horizontal branch stars that so far
have been found in only very few Galactic globular clusters (GCs). The dominant
mechanism for producing these objects is currently still unclear. In order to
test if the presence of BHk populations in a given GC is linked to specific
physical or structural cluster properties, we have constructed a parent sample
of GCs for which existing data is sufficient to establish the presence or
absence of BHk populations with confidence. We then compare the properties of
those clusters in our parent sample that do contain a BHk population to those
that do not. We find that there is only one compelling difference between BHk
and non-BHk clusters: all known BHk clusters are unusually massive. However, we
also find that the BHk clusters are consistent with being uniformly distributed
within the cumulative mass distribution of the parent sample. Thus, while it is
attractive to suggest there is is a lower mass cut-off for clusters capable of
forming BHk stars, the data do not require this. Instead, the apparent
preference for massive clusters could still be a purely statistical effect:
intrinsically rare objects can only be found by searching a sufficiently large
number of stars.
