We have studied polariton spin dynamics in a GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity by means
of polarization- and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as a function
of excitation density and normal mode splitting. The experiments reveal a novel
behavior of the degree of polarization of the emission, namely the existence of
a finite delay to reach its maximum value. We have also found that the
stimulated emission of the lower polariton branch has a strong influence on
spin dynamics: in an interval of $\sim$150 ps the polarization changes from
+100% to negative values as high as -60%. This strong modulation of the
polarization and its high speed may open new possibilities for spin-based
devices.
