The article guides the reader through four consecutive definitions of
progressing scope. Fuzzy intervals are represented as an ordered pair of
functions, and fuzzy numbers are defined as a subcase. The four arithmetic
operations are defined utilizing the notion of generalized inverse functions as
practised in statistics. This new approach has the advantage that in most cases
the outcome of an arithmetic operation may be stated explicitly, in closed
form, which is not possible using the original definition [Zadeh65] or when
working with alpha-cuts. Although the presented material is original the text
is formulated in the style of an introductory textbook and many completely
worked examples are provided and graphically illustrated.
