We present numerical calculations of a four-point dynamic susceptibility,
chi_4(t), for the Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones mixture as a function of
temperature T and density rho. Over a relevant range of T and rho, the full
t-dependence of chi_4(t) and thus the maximum in chi_4(t), which is
proportional to the dynamic correlation volume, are invariant for state points
for which the scaling variable rho^gamma/T is constant. The value of the
material constant gamma is the same as that which superposes the relaxation
time, tau, of the system versus rho^gamma/T. Thus, the dynamic correlation
volume is directly related to tau for any thermodynamic condition in the regime
where density scaling holds. Finally, we examine the conditions under which the
density scaling properties are related to the existence of strong correlations
between pressure and energy fluctuations.
