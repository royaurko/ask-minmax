A simple and efficient algorithm of the molecular-dynamics simulation of the
hard disk system based on the Event-Driven method is developed. From the
analysis of algorithm, the complexity is O(log N) per 1 event, and the constant
coefficient of the complexity is smaller than conventional efficient algorithm
based on the concept of Cell-Crossing Event. The maximum performance more than
460 millions of collisions per CPU-hour on the Alpha600 compatible in 2500
particle system is achieved. An extension to the infinite-space system based on
this algorithm is also proposed.
