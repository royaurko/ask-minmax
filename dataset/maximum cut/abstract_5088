We report an experimental assessment of surface kinetic roughening properties
that are anisotropic in space. Working for two specific instances of silicon
surfaces irradiated by ion-beam sputtering under diverse conditions (with and
without concurrent metallic impurity codeposition), we verify the predictions
and consistency of a recently proposed scaling Ansatz for surface observables
like the two-dimensional (2D) height Power Spectral Density (PSD). In contrast
with other formulations, this Ansatz is naturally tailored to the study of
two-dimensional surfaces, and allows to readily explore the implications of
anisotropic scaling for other observables, such as real-space correlation
functions and PSD functions for 1D profiles of the surface. Our results confirm
that there are indeed actual experimental systems whose kinetic roughening is
strongly anisotropic, as consistently described by this scaling analysis. In
the light of our work, some types of experimental measurements are seen to be
more affected by issues like finite space resolution effects, etc. that may
hinder a clear-cut assessment of strongly anisotropic scaling in the present
and other practical contexts.
