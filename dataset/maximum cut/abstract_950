A clique in a graph is a set of vertices, each of which is adjacent to every
other vertex in this set. A k-clique relaxes this requirement, requiring
vertices to be within a distance k of each other, rather than directly
adjacent. In theory, a maximum clique algorithm can easily be adapted to solve
the maximum k-clique problem. We use a state of the art maximum clique
algorithm to show that this is feasible in practice, and introduce a lazy
global domination rule which sometimes vastly reduces the search space. We
include experimental results for a range of real-world and benchmark graphs,
and a detailed look at random graphs.
