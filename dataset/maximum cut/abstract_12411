The jet shape modification due to partonic energy loss in the dense QCD
matter is investigated by the help of the special transverse energy-energy
correlator in the vicinity of maximum energy deposition of every event. In the
accepted scenario with scattering of jet hard partons off comoving medium
constituents this correlator is independent of the pseudorapidity position of a
jet axis and becomes considerably broader (symmetrically over the
pseudorapidity and the azimuthal angle) in comparison with $pp$-collisions. At
scattering off "slow" medium constituents the broadening of correlation
functions is dependent on the pseudorapidity position of a jet axis and
increases noticeably in comparison with the previous scenario for jets with
large enough pseudorapidities. These two considered scenarios result also in
the different dependence of jet quenching on the pseudorapidity.
