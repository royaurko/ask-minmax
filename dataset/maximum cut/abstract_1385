The discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson is possible when experimental
cuts are applied which increase the ratio of signal and background
cross-sections. In this paper we study the pp->H->WW signal cross-section at
the LHC which requires a selection of Higgs bosons with small transverse
momentum. We compare predictions for the efficiency of the experimental cuts
from a NNLO QCD calculation, a calculation of the resummation of logarithms in
the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson at NNLL, and the event generator
MC@NLO. We also investigate the impact of various jet-algorithms, the
underlying event and hadronization on the signal cross-section.
