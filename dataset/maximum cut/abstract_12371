After a brief summary of the QCD phase structure with light quarks, we
discuss two recent developments on in-medium hadrons. First topic is the
sigma-meson which is a fluctuation of the chiral order parameter \bar{q}q.
Although sigma is at best a broad resonance in the vacuum, it may suffer a
substantial red-shift and show a characteristic spectral enhancement at the 2
m_{pi} threshold at finite temperature and baryon density. Possible
experimental signatures of this phenomenon are also discussed. Another topic is
the first principle lattice QCD calculation of the hadronic spectral functions
using the maximum entropy method (MEM). The basic idea and a successful example
of MEM are presented. Possible applications of MEM to study the in-medium
hadrons in lattice QCD simulations are discussed.
