We propose an estimator defined in real space for the reconstruction of the
weak lensing potential due to the intervening large scale structure from high
resolution maps of the cosmic microwave background. This estimator was
motivated as an alternative to the quadratic estimator in harmonic space to
surpass the difficulties of the analysis of maps containing galactic cuts and
point source excisions. Using maps synthesised by pixel remapping, we implement
the estimator for two experiments, namely one in the absence and one in the
presence of detector noise, and compare the reconstruction of the convergence
field with that obtained with the quadratic estimator defined in harmonic
space. We find good agreement between the input and the reconstructed power
spectra using the proposed real space estimator. We discuss interesting
features of the real space estimator and future extensions of this work.
