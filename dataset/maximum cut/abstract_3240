We evaluate the relaxation rate of high-energy quasiparticles in a weakly
interacting one-dimensional Bose gas. Unlike in higher dimensions, the rate is
a nonmonotonic function of temperature, with a maximum at the crossover to the
state of suppressed density fluctuations. At the maximum, the relaxation rate
may significantly exceed its zero-temperature value. We also find the
dependence of the differential inelastic scattering rate on the transferred
energy. This rate yields information about temperature dependence of local pair
correlations.
