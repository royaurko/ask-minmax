Populations of mobile and communicating agents describe a vast array of
technological and natural systems, ranging from sensor networks to animal
groups. Here, we investigate how a group-level agreement may emerge in the
continuously evolving network defined by the local interactions of the moving
individuals. We adopt a general scheme of motion in two dimensions and we let
the individuals interact through the minimal naming game, a prototypical scheme
to investigate social consensus. We distinguish different regimes of
convergence determined by the emission range of the agents and by their
mobility, and we identify the corresponding scaling behaviors of the consensus
time. In the same way, we rationalize also the behavior of the maximum memory
used during the convergence process, which determines the minimum
cognitive/storage capacity needed by the individuals. Overall, we believe that
the simple and general model presented in this paper can represent a helpful
reference for a better understanding of the behavior of populations of mobile
agents.
