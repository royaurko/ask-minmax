We present a measurement of the unitarity triangle angle phi_3 using a Dalitz
plot analysis of the three-body decay of the D0 meson from the B+- -> D(*)K+-
process. The method employs the interference between D0 and D0bar to extract
both the weak and strong phases. We apply this method to the 140 fb-1 of data
collected by Belle experiment. The analysis uses B+- -> DK+- and B+- -> D*K+-
with D*->Dpi0 modes, where the neutral D meson decays into K_s pi+ pi-. From a
combined maximum likelihood fit of B+- -> DK+- and B+- -> D*K+- modes, we
obtain phi_3=81^{\circ}+-19^{\circ}+-13(syst)+-11^{\circ}(model). The 95%
confidence interval is 35^{\circ}<phi_3<127^{\circ}.
