We have investigated the influence of 3d-4f spin interaction on magnetic and
magnetocaloric properties of DyCrO$_4$ and HoCrO$_4$ compounds by magnetization
and heat capacity measurements. Both the compounds exhibit complicated magnetic
properties and huge magnetic entropy change around the ferromagnetic transition
due to the strong competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
superexchange interactions. For a field change of 8 T, the maximum values of
magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_{M}^{max}$), adiabatic temperature change
($\Delta T_{ad}$), and refrigerant capacity (RC) reach 29 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$,
8 K, and 583 J kg$^{-1}$, respectively for DyCrO$_4$ whereas the corresponding
values for HoCrO$_4$ are 31 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, 12 K, and 622 J kg$^{-1}$.
$\Delta S_{M}^{max}$, $\Delta T_{ad}$, and RC are also quite large for a
moderate field change. The large values of magnetocaloric parameters suggest
that the zircon-type DyCrO$_4$ and HoCrO$_4$ could be the potential magnetic
refrigerant materials for liquefaction of hydrogen.
