We examine two corollaries of MOND pertaining to the properties of the
equivalent dark-matter halo. MOND predicts for pure exponential discs a tight
relation involving the halo and disc scale lengths and the mean acceleration in
the disc, which we find to test favorably against the Verheijen sample of Ursa
Major galaxies. A correlation between halo and disc length scales is also
apparent when the "maximum disc" contribution is assumed, but we demonstrate
that this follows from the more general MOND prediction. The second MOND
prediction involves the existence of a maximum halo acceleration, which also
tests favorably against the Ursa Major sample for different assumptions on the
disc contribution.
