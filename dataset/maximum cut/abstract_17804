Let $G$ be a fixed graph and let ${\mathcal F}$ be a family of graphs. A
subgraph $J$ of $G$ is ${\mathcal F}$-saturated if no member of ${\mathcal F}$
is a subgraph of $J$, but for any edge $e$ in $E(G)-E(J)$, some element of
${\mathcal F}$ is a subgraph of $J+e$. We let $\text{ex}({\mathcal F},G)$ and
$\text{sat}({\mathcal F},G)$ denote the maximum and minimum size of an
${\mathcal F}$-saturated subgraph of $G$, respectively. If no element of
${\mathcal F}$ is a subgraph of $G$, then $\text{sat}({\mathcal F},G) =
\text{ex}({\mathcal F}, G) = |E(G)|$.
  In this paper, for $k\ge 3$ and $n\ge 100$ we determine
$\text{sat}(K_3,K_k^n)$, where $K_k^n$ is the complete balanced $k$-partite
graph with partite sets of size $n$. We also give several families of
constructions of $K_t$-saturated subgraphs of $K_k^n$ for $t\ge 4$. Our results
and constructions provide an informative contrast to recent results on the
edge-density version of $\text{ex}(K_t,K_k^n)$ from [A. Bondy, J. Shen, S.
Thomass\'e, and C. Thomassen, Density conditions for triangles in multipartite
graphs, Combinatorica 26 (2006), 121--131] and [F. Pfender, Complete subgraphs
in multipartite graphs, Combinatorica 32 (2012), no. 4, 483--495].
