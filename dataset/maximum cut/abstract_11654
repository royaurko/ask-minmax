The result of the recent publication [M. Kachelriess and D. V. Semikoz
Astropart. Phys. 26, 10 (2006)] of a broad maximum around 25 degrees in the
two-point autocorrelation function of ultra-high energy cosmic ray arrival
directions has been intriguingly interpreted as the first imprint of the large
scale structures (LSS) of baryonic matter in the near universe. We analyze this
suggestion in light of the clustering properties expected from the PSCz
astronomical catalogue of LSS. The chance probability of the signal is
consistent within 2 sigma with the predictions based on the catalogue. No
evidence for a significant cross-correlation of the observed events with known
overdensities in the LSS is found, which may be due to the role of the galactic
and extragalactic magnetic fields, and is however consistent with the limited
statistics. The larger statistics to be collected by the Pierre Auger
Observatory is needed to answer definitely the question.
