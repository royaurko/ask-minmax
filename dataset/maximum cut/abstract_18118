We report synthesis of non superconducting parent compound of iron
chalcogenide, i.e., FeTe single crystal by self flux method. The FeTe single
crystal is crystallized in tetragonal structure with the P4/nmm space group.
The detailed SEM (scanning electron microscopy) results showed that the
crystals are formed in slab like morphology and are near (slight deficiency of
Te) stoichiometric with homogenous distribution of Fe and Te. The coupled
structural and magnetic phase transition is seen at around 70K in both
electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements, which is hysteric
(deltaT = 5K) in nature with cooling and warming cycles. Magnetic
susceptibility (chi-T) measurements showed the magnetic transition to be of
antiferromagnetic nature, which is substantiated by isothermal magnetization
(M-H) plots as well. The temperature dependent electrical resistivity measured
in 10kOe field in both in plane and out of plane field directions showed that
the hysteric width nearly becomes double to deltaT = 10K, and is maximum for
the out of plane field direction for the studied FeTe single crystal. We also
obtained a sharp spike like peak in heat capacity Cp(T) measurement due to the
coupled structural and magnetic order phase transitions.
