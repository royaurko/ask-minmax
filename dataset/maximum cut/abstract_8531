We report a method for probing electromechanical properties of multiwalled
carbon nanotubes(CNTs). This method is based on AFM measurements on a doubly
clamped suspended CNT electrostatically deflected by a gate electrode. We
measure the maximum deflection as a function of the applied gate voltage. Data
from different CNTs scale into an universal curve within the experimental
accuracy, in agreement with a continuum model prediction. This method and the
general validity of the scaling law constitute a very useful tool for designing
actuators and in general conducting nanowire-based NEMS.
