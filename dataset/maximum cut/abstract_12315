We present an analysis of the composition of inclusive semileptonic B meson
decays using 9.4/fb of e+ e- data taken with the CLEO detector at the
Upsilon(4S) resonance. In addition to measuring the charged lepton kinematics,
the neutrino 4-vector is inferred using the hermeticity of the detector. We
perform a maximum likelihood fit over the full three-dimensional differential
decay distribution for the fractional contributions from the B -> Xc l nu
processes with Xc = D, D*, D**, and non-resonant Xc, and the process B -> Xu l
nu. From the fit results we extract |V_ub|= (4.05 +- 0.18 +- 0.58 +- 0.25 +-
0.21 +-0.56) x 10^{-3} where the errors are statistical, detector systematics,
B -> Xc l nu model dependence, B -> Xu l nu model dependence, and theoretical
uncertainty respectively.
