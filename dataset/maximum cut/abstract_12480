In this paper we consider the following biharmonic equation with critical
exponent $P_\epsilon$ : $\Delta^2 u= Ku^{(n+4)/(n-4)-\epsilon}, u>0$ in
$\Omega$ and $u=\Delta u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is a domain in
$R^n$, $n\geq 5$, $\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter and $K$ is smooth
positive function. We construct solutions of $P_\epsilon$ which blow up and
concentrate at strict local maximum of $K$ either at the boundary or in the
interior of $\Omega$. We also construct solutions of $P_\epsilon$ concentrating
at an interior strict local minimum of $K$. Finally, we prove a nonexistense
result for the corresponding supercritical problem which is in sharp contrast
with what happened for $P_\epsilon$.
