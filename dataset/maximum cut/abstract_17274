In this paper, we report the results from the analysis of a numerical model
used for the design of a magnetic linear actuator with applications to
fin-based locomotion. Most of the current robotic fish generate bending motion
using rotary motors which implies at least one mechanical conversion of the
motion. We seek a solution that directly bends the fin and, at the same time,
is able to exploit the magneto-mechanical properties of the fin material. This
strong fin-actuator coupling blends the actuator and the body of the robot,
allowing cross optimization of the system's elements.
  We study a simplified model of an elastic element, a spring-mass system
representing a flexible fin, subjected to nonlinear forcing, emulating magnetic
interaction. The dynamics of the system is studied under unforced and periodic
forcing conditions. The analysis is focused on the limit cycles present in the
system, which allows the periodic bending of the fin and the generation of
thrust. The frequency, maximum amplitude and center of the periodic orbits
(offset of the bending) depend directly on the stiffness of the fin and the
intensity of the forcing; we use this dependency to sketch a simple parameter
controller. Although the model is strongly simplified, it provides means to
estimate first values of the parameters for this kind of actuator and it is
useful to evaluate the feasibility of minimal actuation control of such
systems.
