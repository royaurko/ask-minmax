The mass--energy formula of black holes implies that up to 50% of the energy
can be extracted from a static black hole. Such a result is reexamined using
the recently established analytic formulas for the collapse of a shell and
expression for the irreducible mass of a static black hole. It is shown that
the efficiency of energy extraction process during the formation of the black
hole is linked in an essential way to the gravitational binding energy, the
formation of the horizon and the reduction of the kinetic energy of implosion.
Here a maximum efficiency of 50% in the extraction of the mass energy is shown
to be generally attainable in the collapse of a spherically symmetric shell:
surprisingly this result holds as well in the two limiting cases of the
Schwarzschild and extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m space-times. Moreover, the
analytic expression recently found for the implosion of a spherical shell onto
an already formed black hole leads to a new exact analytic expression for the
energy extraction which results in an efficiency strictly less than 100% for
any physical implementable process. There appears to be no incompatibility
between General Relativity and Thermodynamics at this classical level.
