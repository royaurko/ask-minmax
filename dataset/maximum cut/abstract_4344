Recent comparisons of minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) model predictions with
WMAP measurements of the neutralino relic density point to preferred regions of
model parameter space. We investigate the reach of linear colliders (LC) with
$\sqrt{s}=0.5$ and 1 TeV for SUSY in the framework of the mSUGRA model. We find
that LCs can cover the entire stau co-annihilation region provided $\tan\beta
\alt 30$. In the hyperbolic branch/focus point (HB/FP) region of parameter
space, specialized cuts are suggested to increase the reach in this important
``dark matter allowed'' area. In the case of the HB/FP region, the reach of a
LC extends well past the reach of the CERN LHC. We examine a case study in the
HB/FP region, and show that the MSSM parameters $\mu$ and $M_2$ can be
sufficiently well-measured to demonstrate that one would indeed be in the HB/FP
region, where the lightest chargino and neutralino have a substantial higgsino
component.
