In this paper, a downlink communication system, in which a Base Station (BS)
equipped with $M$ antennas communicates with $N$ users each equipped with $K$
receive antennas, is considered. An efficient suboptimum algorithm is proposed
for selecting a set of users in order to maximize the sum-rate throughput of
the system. For the asymptotic case when $N$ tends to infinity, the necessary
and sufficient conditions in order to achieve the maximum sum-rate throughput,
such that the difference between the achievable sum-rate and the maximum value
approaches zero, is derived. The complexity of our algorithm is investigated in
terms of the required amount of feedback from the users to the base station, as
well as the number of searches required for selecting the users. It is shown
that the proposed method is capable of achieving a large portion of the
sum-rate capacity, with a very low complexity.
