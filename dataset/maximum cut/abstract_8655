We examine the link approach to constructing a lattice theory of N=2 super
Yang Mills theory in two dimensions. The goal of this construction is to
provide a discretization of the continuum theory which preserves all
supersymmetries at non-zero lattice spacing. We show that this approach suffers
from an inconsistency and argue that a maximum of just one of the
supersymmetries can be implemented on the lattice.
