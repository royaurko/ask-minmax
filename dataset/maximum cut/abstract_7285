We investigate in details the properties of the disk surrounding the 8 Myr
old star HR 4796A, one of the few stars bringing precious clues to better
understand the scenario which lead to planetary system formation. We propose a
model able to reproduce all the available observations : the full spectral
energy distribution from the mid-infrared to the millimeter wavelengths,
resolved scattered light and thermal emission observations. We show that the
circumstellar matter splits into two dust components : a cold annulus, peaked
at 70 AU from the star, made of ISM-like grains (amorphous composition,
porosity ~ 0.6) larger than 10 microns and a population of hot dust close to
the star (at about 9 AU) made of comet-like grains (crystalline composition,
porosity ~ 0.97). Both dust populations are highly collisional and the grain
size distribution in the cold annulus is found to be cut-off by radiation
pressure. At 70 AU, bodies as large as a few meters are required to fit the
data leading to a minimum disk mass of a few Earth masses and to a gas to dust
ratio less than 1. We discuss aftewards some implications on the disk structure
and effects of larger bodies.
