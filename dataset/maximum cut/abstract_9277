It is shown that a ferroelastic lattice distortion is associated with the
superconducting transition both in low- and high-temperature superconductors.
In layered tetragonal superconductors with a sufficiently high transition
temperature, a ferroelastic distortion is improper and is caused by an
out-of-plane charge ordering. The relation between the out-of-plane charge gap
and the maximum superconducting transition temperature for these
superconductors is obtained. It is shown also that the specific heat jump at
the superconducting transition temperature in pnictide and cuprate
superconductors is produced by ferroelastic fluctuations just below the
transition temperature. The amplitude of the corresponding lattice distortion
is estimated.
