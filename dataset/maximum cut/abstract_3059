Uniform dipole magnetic fields from 1.9 to 22.4 kOe were permanently trapped,
with high fidelity to the original field, transversely to the axes of hollow
Nb3Sn superconducting cylinders. These cylinders were constructed by helically
wrapping multiple layers of superconducting ribbon around a mandrel. This is
the highest field yet trapped, the first time trapping has been reported in
such helically wound taped cylinders, and the first time the maximum trappable
field has been experimentally determined as a function of cylinder wall
thickness.
