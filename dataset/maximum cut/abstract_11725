The thermoelectric properties of La-filled skutterudites are discussed from
the point of view of their electronic structures. These are calculated from
first principles within the local density approximation. The electronic
structure is in turn used to determine transport related quantities. Virtual
crystal calculations for La(Fe,Co)_4Sb_{12} show that the system obeys near
rigid band behavior with varying Co concentration, and has a substantial band
gap at a position corresponding to the composition LaFe_3% CoSb_{12}. The
valence band maximum occurs at the $\Gamma$ point and is due to a singly
degenerate dispersive band, which by itself would not be favorable for high
thermopower. However, very flat transition metal derived bands occur in close
proximity and become active as the doping level is increased, giving a
non-trivial dependence of the properties on carrier concentration and
explaining the favorable thermoelectric properties.
