The dynamic spin susceptibility, $\chi''(\omega)$, has been measured over the
energy range of $2 \leq \omega \leq 10$ meV for overdoped
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$. Incommensurate (IC) spin excitations are observed
at 8 K for all superconducting samples for $0.25 \leq x \leq 0.28$ with
$\chi''$ peaking at $\sim 6$ meV. The IC peaks at 6 meV become smaller in
intensity with increasing $x$ and, finally, become unobservable for a sample
with $x=0.30$ which has no bulk superconductivity. The maximum $\chi''$
decreases linearly with $T_c$(onset) in the overdoped region, implying a direct
cooperative relation between the spin fluctuations and the superconductivity.
