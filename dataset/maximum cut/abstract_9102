Exploiting an improved analysis of the electronic antineutrinos signal from
the explosion of a galactic core collapse supernova, we show that it is
possible to identify within about ten milliseconds the time of the bounce,
which is strongly correlated to the time of the maximum amplitude of the
gravitational signal. This allows to precisely identify the gravitational wave
burst timing.
