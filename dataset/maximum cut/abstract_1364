We address the question whether the cut-off dependence, which has to be
introduced in order to properly define the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the
one pion exchange potential plus local (delta-function) potentials, can be
removed (up to inverse powers of it) by a suitable tuning of the various (bare)
coupling constants. We prove that this is indeed so both for the spin singlet
and for the spin triplet channels. However, the latter requires such a strong
cut-off dependence of the coupling constant associated to the non-local term
which breaks orbital angular momentum conservation, that the renormalized
amplitude lacks from partial wave mixing. We argue that this is an indication
that this term must be treated perturbatively.
