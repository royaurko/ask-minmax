The longitudinal form factors of the weak vector current of particles with
spin $ J = 1/2 $ and isospin $ I = 1/2 $ are determined by the mass difference
and the charge radii of members of the isotopic doublets. The most promising
reactions to measure these form factors are the reactions with large momentum
transfers involving the spin-1/2 isotopic doublets with a maximum mass
splitting. Numerical estimates of longitudinal form factors are given for
nucleons and eight nuclear spin-1/2 isotopic doublets.
