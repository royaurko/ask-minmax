The coherent-nuclear reaction a + A -> a* + A is in the small-angle region
dominated by the one-photon-exchange mechanism, often referred to as the
Primakoff effect. In this region information about the electromagnetic decay a*
-> a + gamma can be obtained. Well-known examples are the two-photon decays of
the pi- and eta-mesons. Also decays of charged hadrons can be studied. For
charged hadrons the one-photon-exchange amplitude comes with a Coulomb-phase
factor and a Coulomb-form factor, which depend on the ratio between transverse-
and logitudinal-momentum transfers, the latter being fixed. At the peak of the
cross-section distribution, where the two momentum transfers are equal, the
form factor could cut down the cross-section value by as much as 40 %.
Consequently, a determination of a radiative-decay rate that relies on the peak
value becomes sensitive to a proper treatment of the Coulomb-form factor.
