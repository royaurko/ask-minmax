We measured neutron triple-differential cross sections from
multiplicity-selected Au-Au collisions at 150, 250, 400, and 650 \AMeV. The
reaction plane for each collision was estimated from the summed transverse
velocity vector of the charged fragments emitted in the collision. We examined
the azimuthal distribution of the triple-differential cross sections as a
function of the polar angle and the neutron rapidity. We extracted the average
in--plane transverse momentum $\langle P_x\rangle$ and the normalized
observable $\langle P_x/P_\perp\rangle$, where $P_\perp$ is the neutron
transverse momentum, as a function of the neutron center-of-mass rapidity, and
we examined the dependence of these observables on beam energy. These
collective flow observables for neutrons, which are consistent with those of
protons plus bound nucleons from the Plastic Ball Group, agree with the
Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (BUU) calculations with a momentum--dependent
interaction. Also, we calculated the polar-angle-integrated maximum azimuthal
anisotropy ratio R from the value of $\langle P_x/P_\perp\rangle$.
