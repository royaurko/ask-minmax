We propose a description of dark energy and acceleration of the universe in
extended supergravities with de Sitter (dS) solutions. Some of them are related
to M-theory with non-compact internal spaces. Masses of ultra-light scalars in
these models are quantized in units of the Hubble constant: m^2 = n H^2. If dS
solution corresponds to a minimum of the effective potential, the universe
eventually becomes dS space. If dS solution corresponds to a maximum or a
saddle point, which is the case in all known models based on N=8 supergravity,
the flat universe eventually stops accelerating and collapses to a singularity.
We show that in these models, as well as in the simplest models of dark energy
based on N=1 supergravity, the typical time remaining before the global
collapse is comparable to the present age of the universe, t = O(10^{10})
years. We discuss the possibility of distinguishing between various models and
finding our destiny using cosmological observations.
