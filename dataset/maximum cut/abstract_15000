Tsallis entropy is a generalized diversity index first derived in Patil and
Taillie (1982) and then rediscovered in community ecology by Keylock (2005).
Bayesian nonparametric estimation of Shannon entropy and Simpson's diversity
under uniform and symmetric Dirichlet priors has been already advocated as an
alternative to maximum likelihood estimation based on frequency counts, which
is negatively biased in the undersampled regime. Here we present a fully
general Bayesian nonparametric estimation of the whole class of Tsallis
diversity indices under Gnedin-Pitman priors, a large family of random discrete
distributions recently deeply investigated in posterior predictive species
richness and discovery probability estimation. We provide both prior and
posterior analysis. The results, illustrated through examples and an
application to a real dataset, show the procedure is easily implementable,
flexible and overcomes limitations of previous frequentist and Bayesian
solutions.
