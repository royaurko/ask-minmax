How do peculiar velocities affect observed voids? To answer this question we
use the VIDE toolkit to identify voids in mock galaxy populations embedded
within an N-body simulation both with and without peculiar velocities included.
We compare the resulting void populations to assess the impact on void
properties. We find that void abundances and spherically-averaged radial
density profiles are mildly affected by peculiar velocities. However, peculiar
velocities can distort by up to 10% the shapes for a particular subset of voids
depending on the void size and density contrast, which can lead to increased
variance in Alcock-Paczy\'nski test. We offer guidelines for performing optimal
cuts on the void catalogue to reduce this variance by removing the most
severely affected voids while preserving the unaffected ones. In addition,
since this shape distortion is largely limited to the line of sight, we show
that the void radii are only affected at the $\sim$ 10% level and the
macrocenter positions at the $\sim$ 20% (even before performing cuts), meaning
that cosmological probes based on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe and gravitational
lensing are not severely impacted by peculiar velocities.
