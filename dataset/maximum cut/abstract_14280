In the game of \emph{cops and robbers} on a graph $G = (V,E)$, $k$ cops try
to catch a robber. On the cop turn, each cop may move to a neighboring vertex
or remain in place. On the robber's turn, he moves similarly. The cops win if
there is some time at which a cop is at the same vertex as the robber.
Otherwise, the robber wins. The minimum number of cops required to catch the
robber is called the \emph{cop number} of $G$, and is denoted $c(G)$. Let $m_k$
be the minimum order of a connected graph satisfying $c(G) \geq k$. Recently,
Baird and Bonato determined via computer search that $m_3=10$ and that this
value is attained uniquely by the Petersen graph. Herein, we give a
self-contained mathematical proof of this result. Along the way, we give some
characterizations of graphs with $c(G) >2$ and very high maximum degree.
