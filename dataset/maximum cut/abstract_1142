We show that under appropriate hypotheses, a plumbing of symplectic surfaces
in a symplectic 4-manifold admits strongly convex neighborhoods. Moreover the
neighborhoods are Lefschetz fibered with an easily-described open book on the
boundary supporting the induced contact structure. We point out some
applications to cut-and-paste constructions of symplectic 4-manifolds.
