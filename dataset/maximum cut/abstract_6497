Recently, interesting 4-D Lorentz violating models have been proposed, in
which all particles have a common maximum velocity $c$, but gravity propagates
(in the preferred frame) with a different maximum velocity $c_g \neq c$. We
show that the case $c_g < c$ is very tightly constrained by the observation of
the highest energy cosmic rays. Assuming a galactic origin for the cosmic rays
gives a conservative bound of $c-c_g < 2 \times 10^{-15} c$; if the cosmic rays
have an extragalactic origin the bound is orders of magnitude tighter, of order
$c-c_g < 2 \times 10^{-19} c$.
