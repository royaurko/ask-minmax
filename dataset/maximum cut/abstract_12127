The existence of a peak effect in transport properties (a maximum of the
critical current as function of magnetic field) is a well-known but still
intriguing feature of type II superconductors such as NbSe2 and Bi-2212. Using
a model of pinning by surface irregularities in anisotropic superconductors, we
have developed a calculation of the critical current which allows estimating
quantitatively the critical current in both the high critical current phase and
in the low critical current phase. The only adjustable parameter of this model
is the angle of the vortices at the surface. The agreement between the
measurements and the model is really very impressive. In this framework, the
anomalous dynamical properties close to the peak effect is due to co-existence
of two different vortex states with different critical currents. Recent neutron
diffraction data in NbSe2 crystals in presence of transport current support
this point of view.
