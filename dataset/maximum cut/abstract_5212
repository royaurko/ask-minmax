Geo-neutrinos, electron anti-neutrinos produced in beta decays of naturally
occurring radioactive isotopes in the Earth, are a unique direct probe of our
planet's interior. We report the first observation at more than 3$\sigma$ C.L.
of geo-neutrinos, performed with the Borexino detector at Laboratori Nazionali
del Gran Sasso. Anti-neutrinos are detected through the neutron inverse beta
decay reaction. With a 252.6 ton-yr fiducial exposure after all selection cuts,
we detected 9.9^{+4.1}_{-3.4}(^{+14.6}_{-8.2}) geo-neutrino events, with errors
corresponding to a 68.3%(99.73%) C.L. From the $\ln{\cal{L}}$ profile, the
statistical significance of the Borexino geo-neutrino observation corresponds
to a 99.997% C.L. Our measurement of the geo-neutrinos rate is
3.9^{+1.6}_{-1.3}(^{+5.8}_{-3.2}) events/(100ton-yr). This measurement rejects
the hypothesis of an active geo-reactor in the Earth's core with a power above
3 TW at 95% C.L. The observed prompt positron spectrum above 2.6 MeV is
compatible with that expected from european nuclear reactors (mean base line of
approximately 1000 km). Our measurement of reactor anti-neutrinos excludes the
non-oscillation hypothesis at 99.60% C.L.
