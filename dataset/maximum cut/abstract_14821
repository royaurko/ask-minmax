The robust improper maximum likelihood estimator (RIMLE) is a new method for
robust multivariate clustering finding approximately Gaussian clusters. It
maximizes a pseudo-likelihood defined by adding a component with improper
constant density for accommodating outliers to a Gaussian mixture. A special
case of the RIMLE is MLE for multivariate finite Gaussian mixture models. In
this paper we give a comprehensive treatment of existence, consistency, and
breakdown theory for the RIMLE. RIMLE existence is proved under non-smooth
covariance matrix constraints, it is shown that these can be implemented via a
computationally feasible EM-algorithm
