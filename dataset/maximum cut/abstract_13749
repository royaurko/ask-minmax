The gravitational wave signal from a binary neutron star inspiral contains
information on the nuclear equation of state. This information is contained in
a combination of the tidal polarizability parameters of the two neutron stars
and is clearest in the late inspiral, just before merger. We use the recently
defined tidal extension of the effective one-body formalism to construct a
controlled analytical description of the frequency-domain phasing of neutron
star inspirals up to merger. Exploiting this analytical description we find
that the tidal polarizability parameters of neutron stars can be measured by
the advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network from gravitational wave signals having
a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio of $\rho=16$. This measurability result
seems to hold for all the nuclear equations of state leading to a maximum mass
larger than $1.97M_\odot$. We also propose a promising new way of extracting
information on the nuclear equation of state from a coherent analysis of an
ensemble of gravitational wave observations of separate binary merger events.
