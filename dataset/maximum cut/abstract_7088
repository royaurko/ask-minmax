This paper studies distance estimation for diffusive molecular communication.
The Cramer-Rao lower bound on the variance of the distance estimation error is
derived. The lower bound is derived for a physically unbounded environment with
molecule degradation and steady uniform flow. The maximum likelihood distance
estimator is derived and its accuracy is shown via simulation to perform very
close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound. An existing protocol is shown to be
equivalent to the maximum likelihood distance estimator if only one observation
is made. Simulation results also show the accuracy of existing protocols with
respect to the Cramer-Rao lower bound.
