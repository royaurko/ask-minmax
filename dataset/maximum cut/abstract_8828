We use a modified SU(2) chiral sigma model to study nuclear matter at high
density using mean field approach. We also study the phase transition of
nuclear matter to quark matter in the interior of highly dense neutron stars.
Stable solutions of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations representing hybrid
stars are obtained with a maximum mass of 1.69 $M_{\odot}$, radii around 9.3
kms and a quark matter core constituting nearly 55-85 % of the star radii.
