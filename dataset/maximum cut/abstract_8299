Nova Vel 1999 (V382 Vel) was observed with BeppoSAX twice, 15 days and 6
months after the optical maximum. A hard X-ray source was detected in the first
observation, while the second time also a very luminous supersoft X-ray source
was detected.
  The continuum observed in the supersoft range with the BeppoSAX LECS cannot
be fitted with atmospheric models of hot hydrogen burning while dwarfs. We
suggest that we are observing instead mainly a ``pseudocontinuum'', namely a
blend of very strong emission lines in the supersoft X-ray range.
