Given a network and a partition in n communities, we address the issues ``how
communities influence each other'' and ``when two given communities do
communicate''. We prove that, for a small-world network, among communities, a
simple superposition principle applies and each community plays the role of a
microscopic spin governed by a sort of effective TAP (Thouless, Anderson and
Palmer) equations. The relative susceptibilities derived from these equations
calculated at finite or zero temperature (where the method provides an
effective percolation theory) give us the answers to the above issues. As for
the already studied case n=1, these equations are exact in the paramagnetic
regions (at T=0 this means below the percolation threshold) and provide
effective approximations in the other regions. However, unlike the case n=1,
asymmetries among the communities may lead, via the TAP-like structure of the
equations, to many metastable states whose number, in the case of negative
short-cuts among the communities, may grow exponentially fast with n and glassy
scenarios with a remarkable presence of abrupt jumps take place. Furthermore,
as a byproduct, from the relative susceptibilities a natural and efficient
method to detect the community structure of a generic network emerges.
