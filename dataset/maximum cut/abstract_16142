We have measured maximum rotation velocities (Vrot) for a sample of 111
emission-line galaxies with 0.1 < z < 1, observed in the fields of 6 clusters.
  From these data we construct 'matched' samples of 58 field and 22 cluster
galaxies, covering similar ranges in redshift (0.25 < z < 1.0) and luminosity
(M_B < -19.5 mag), and selected in a homogeneous manner. We find the
distributions of M_B, Vrot, and scalelength, to be very similar for the two
samples. However, using the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) we find that cluster
galaxies are systematically offset with respect to the field sample by
-0.7+-0.2 mag. This offset is significant at 3 sigma and persists when we
account for an evolution of the field TFR with redshift. Extensive tests are
performed to investigate potential differences between the measured emission
lines and derived rotation curves of the cluster and field samples. However, no
such differences which could affect the derived Vrot values and account for the
offset are found. The most likely explanation for the TFR offset is that giant
spiral galaxies in distant clusters are on average brighter, for a given
rotation velocity, than those in the field. We discuss the potential mechanisms
responsible for this, and consider alternative explanations.
