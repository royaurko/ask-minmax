The finite temperature transport properties of a spin-1/2 anisotropic
Heisenberg chain with an embedded spin-S impurity are studied. Using primarily
numerical diagonalization techniques, we study the dependence of the dynamical
spin and thermal conductivities on the lattice size, the magnitude of the
impurity spin, the host-impurity coupling, the easy axis anisotropy, as well as
the dependence on temperature. Particularly for the temperature dependence, we
discuss the screening of the impurity by the chain eventually leading to the
cutting or healing of the host chain. Numerical results are supported by
analytical arguments obtained in the strong host-impurity coupling regime.
