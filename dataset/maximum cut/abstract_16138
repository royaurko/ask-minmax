We report the results of a recent (July 2004) XMM-Newton Target of
Opportunity observation of the Anomalous X-ray pulsar 1E 1048.1-5937, together
with a detailed re-analysis of previous observations carried out in 2000 and
2003. In July 2004 the source had a 2-10 keV flux of 6.2$\times10^{-12}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and a pulsed fraction P$_F$=0.68. The comparison of the
three data sets shows the presence of an anti-correlation between flux and
pulsed fraction, implying that previous estimates of the source energetics
based on the assumption of a large and constant pulsed fraction might be
significantly underestimated. The source spectrum is well described by a power
law plus blackbody model (kT~0.63 keV, photon index $\Gamma$~2.7-3.5) or,
alternatively, by the sum of two blackbodies of which the hotter is Comptonized
by relativistic electrons. In this case the temperatures are kT${_1}$~0.2-0.3
keV and kT${_2}$~0.4-0.5 keV and the emitting area of the cooler component is
consistent with the whole neutron star surface. The long term luminosity
variation of a factor >~2 is accompanied by relatively small variations in the
spectral shape. Phase resolved spectroscopy indicates a harder spectrum in
correspondence of the pulse maximum. No spectral features have been detected
with 4$\sigma$ limits on the equivalent width in the range ~10-220 eV,
depending on line energy and width.
