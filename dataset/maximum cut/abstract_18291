We have obtained U and R band observations of the depletion of background
galaxies due to the gravitational lensing of the galaxy cluster CL0024+1654
(z=0.39). The radial depletion curves show a significant depletion in both
bands within a radius of 40''-70'' from the cluster center. This is the first
time depletion is detected in the U band. This gives independent evidence for a
break in the slope of the U band luminosity function at faint magnitudes. The
radially averaged R band depletion curve is broader and deeper than in the U
band. The differences can be attributed to the wavelength dependence of the
slope of the luminosity function and to the different redshift distribution of
the objects probed in the two bands. We estimate the Einstein radius of a
singular isothermal sphere lens model using maximum likelihood analysis.
Adopting a slope of the number counts of 0.2 and using the background density
found beyond 150'' from the cluster center we find an Einstein radius of
17''+/-3'' and 25''+/-3'' in the U and R band, respectively. When combined with
the redshift of the single background galaxy at z=1.675 seen as four giant arcs
around 30'' from the cluster center, these values indicate a median redshift in
the range 0.7 to 1.1 for the U_AB > 24 mag and R_AB > 24 mag populations.
