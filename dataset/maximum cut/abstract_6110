We summarize, simplify and extend recent work showing that small deviations
from exact thermality in Hawking radiation, first uncovered by Kraus and
Wilczek, have the capacity to carry off the maximum information content of a
black hole. This goes a considerable way toward resolving a long-standing
"information-loss paradox".
