According to the definition of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),
contributing banks should give fair estimates of their own borrowing costs in
the interbank market. Between 2007 and 2009, several banks made inappropriate
submissions of LIBOR, sometimes motivated by profit-seeking from their trading
positions. In 2012, several newspapers' articles began to cast doubt on LIBOR
integrity, leading surveillance contributorities to conduct investigations on banks'
behavior. Such procedures resulted in severe fines imposed to involved banks,
who recognized their financial inappropriate conduct. In this paper, we uncover
such unfair behavior by using a forecasting method based on the Maximum Entropy
principle. Our results are robust against changes in parameter settings and
could be of great help for market surveillance.
