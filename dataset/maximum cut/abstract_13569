We present results of reanalysis of old electrophotometric data of early type
close binary system RY Scuti obtained at the Abastumani Astrophysical
Observatory, Georgia, during 1972-1990 years and at the Maidanak Observatory,
Uzbekistan, during 1979-1991 years. It is revealed non-stable processes in RY
Sct from period to period, from month to month and from year to year. This
variation consists from the hundredths up to the tenths of a magnitude.
Furthermore, periodical changes in the system's light are displayed near the
first maximum on timescales of a few years. That is of great interest with
regard to some similar variations seen in luminous blue variable (LBV) stars.
This also could be closely related to the question of why RY Sct ejected its
nebula.
