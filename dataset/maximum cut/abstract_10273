The magnetic behaviour of a disordered ferrimagnetic system Ap B1-p where
both A and B represent the magnetic atoms with respective spin SA = 1/2 and SB
= 1 in presence of high magnetic field is treated theoretically.Assuming the
magnetic interaction can be described through Ising Hamiltonian the approximate
free energy is obtained using the cluster-variational method. The field
dependence of the magnetization is then obtained for different concentration p
and exchange parameters (JAA, JBB and JAB). For p = 0.5,the magnetization M in
ferrimagnetic state and in absence of compensation temperature Tcm vanishes at
TC.Field induced reversal of M is found at switching temperature TS (<TC) which
is decreasing function of field H.A maximum in M is found above TS and the
maximum value of M increases with field.In ferrimagnetic state M increases
almost linearly at high H region. For system with large ferromagnetic JAA,the
compensation temperature Tcm is increasing function of JBB and JAB .The
decrease in compensation temperature is linear at small field and tends to
saturate at higher field.The sharpness of the magnetization reversal is
increased with H.For fully compensated state of the system with p = 2/3,the
magnetization in presence of H also exhibits switching behaviour at TS .For p =
0.2 the field induced reversal of magnetization occurs more sharply.The
orientational switching of the sublattice magnetization MA and MB with field
increases the Zeeman energy and is the origin of magnetization reversal at Ts
