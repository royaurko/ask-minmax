We have studied Forbush decrease (FD) event occurred on February 14, 1978
using 43 neutron monitor observatories to understand the global signature of
FD. We have studied rigidity dependence of shock amplitude and total FD
amplitude. We have found almost the same power law index for both shock phase
amplitude and total FD amplitude. Local time variation of shock phase amplitude
and maximum depression time of FD have been investigated which indicate
possible effect of shock/CME orientation. We have analyzed rigidity dependence
of time constants of two phase recovery. Time constants of slow component of
recovery phase show rigidity dependence and implies possible effect of
diffusion. Solar wind speed was observed to be well correlated with slow
component of FD recovery phase. This indicates solar wind speed as possible
driver of recovery phase. To investigate the contribution of interplanetary
drivers, shock and CME in FD, we have used shock-only and CME-only models. We
have applied these models separately to shock phase and main phase amplitudes
respectively. This confirms present accepted physical scenario that the first
step of FD is due to propagating shock barrier and second step is due to flux
rope of CME/magnetic cloud.
