We present Spitzer observations of the dark globule CB190 (L771). We observe
a roughly circular 24 micron shadow with a 70 arcsec radius. The extinction
profile of this shadow matches the profile derived from 2MASS photometry at the
outer edges of the globule and reaches a maximum of ~32 visual magnitudes at
the center. The corresponding mass of CB190 is ~10 Msun. Our 12CO and 13CO J =
2-1 data over a 10 arcmin X 10 arcmin region centered on the shadow show a
temperature ~10 K. The thermal continuum indicates a similar temperature for
the dust. The molecular data also show evidence of freezeout onto dust grains.
We estimate a distance to CB190 of 400 pc using the spectroscopic parallax of a
star associated with the globule. Bonnor-Ebert fits to the density profile, in
conjunction with this distance, yield xi_max = 7.2, indicating that CB190 may
be unstable. The high temperature (56 K) of the best fit Bonnor-Ebert model is
in contradiction with the CO and thermal continuum data, leading to the
conclusion that the thermal pressure is not enough to prevent free-fall
collapse. We also find that the turbulence in the cloud is inadequate to
support it. However, the cloud may be supported by the magnetic field, if this
field is at the average level for dark globules. Since the magnetic field will
eventually leak out through ambipolar diffusion, it is likely that CB190 is
collapsing or in a late pre-collapse stage.
