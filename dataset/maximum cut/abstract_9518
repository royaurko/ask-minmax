We report on the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying into two
photons based on proton-proton collision data with a center-of-mass energy of 7
TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The dataset has an integrated
luminosity of about 1.08 fb-1. The expected cross section exclusion at 95%
confidence level varies between 2.0 and 5.8 times the Standard Model cross
section over the diphoton mass range 110 - 150 GeV. The maximum deviations from
the background-only expectation are consistent with statistical fluctuations.
