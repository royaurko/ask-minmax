In this paper we present a cut-free sequent calculus, called SeqS, for some
standard conditional logics, namely CK, CK+ID, CK+MP and CK+MP+ID. The calculus
uses labels and transition formulas and can be used to prove decidability and
space complexity bounds for the respective logics. We also present CondLean, a
theorem prover for these logics implementing SeqS calculi written in SICStus
Prolog.
