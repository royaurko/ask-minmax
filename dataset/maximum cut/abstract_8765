A simpler proof of the four color theorem is presented. The proof was reached
using a series of equivalent theorems. First the maximum number of edges of a
planar graph is obatined as well as the minimum number of edges for a complete
graph. Then it is shown that for the theorem to be false there must exist a
complete planar graph of $h$ edges such that $h>4$. Finally the theorem is
proved to be true by showing that there does not exist a complete planar graph
with $h>4$.
