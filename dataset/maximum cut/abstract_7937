The zero-width approximation (ZWA) restricts the intermediate unstable
particle state to the mass shell and, when combined with the decorrelation
approximation, fully factorizes the production and decay of unstable particles.
The ZWA uncertainty is expected to be of O(Gamma/M), where M and Gamma are the
mass and width of the unstable particle. We review the ZWA and demonstrate that
errors can be much larger than expected if a significant modification of the
Breit-Wigner lineshape occurs. A thorough examination of the recently
discovered candidate Standard Model Higgs boson is in progress. For M_H ~ 125
GeV, one has Gamma_H/M_H < 10^(-4), which suggests an excellent accuracy of the
ZWA. We show that this is not always the case. The inclusion of off-shell
contributions is essential to obtain an accurate Higgs signal normalization at
the 1% precision level. For gg -> H -> VV, V = W,Z, O(5-10%) corrections occur
due to an enhanced Higgs signal in the region M_VV > 2 M_V, where also sizable
Higgs-continuum interference occurs. We discuss how experimental selection cuts
can be used to suppress this region in search channels where the Higgs mass
cannot be reconstructed. We note that H -> VV decay modes in non-gluon-fusion
channels are similarly affected.
