We present accurate nonrelativistic ground-state energies of the transition
metal atoms of the 3d series calculated with Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo
(FN-DMC). Selected multi-determinantal expansions obtained with the CIPSI
method (Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made
Iteratively) and including the most prominent determinants of the full CI
expansion are used as trial wavefunctions. Using a maximum of a few tens of
thousands determinants, fixed-node errors on total DMC energies are found to be
greatly reduced for some atoms with respect to those obtained with Hartree-Fock
nodes. The FN-DMC/(CIPSI nodes) ground-state energies presented here are, to
the best of our knowledge, the most accurate values reported so far. Thanks to
the variational property of FN-DMC total energies, the results also provide
lower bounds for the absolute value of all-electron correlation energies,
$|E_c|$.
