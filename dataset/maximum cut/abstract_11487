Outburst mechanisms of SU UMa-type dwarf novae are discussed. Two competing
models were proposed; a pure disk instability model called the thermal-tidal
instability model (TTI model) and the enhanced mass transfer model (EMT model).
Observational evidence for enhanced mass transfer from the secondary star
during outbursts is critically examined. It is demonstrated that most evidence
for enhanced mass transfer is not well substantiated. Patterson et al. (2002)
have recently claimed to have found evidence for enhanced mass transfer during
the 2001 outburst of WZ Sge. We show that their evidence is probably due to a
misinterpretation of their observed light curves. Our theoretical analysis also
shows that irradiation during outburst should not affect the mass transfer
rate. A refinement of the TTI model is proposed that can explain why superhumps
appear a few days after the superoutburst maximum in some SU UMa stars. We
present our own interpretation of the overall development of the 2001 outburst
of WZ Sge based on the TTI model that does not require the assumption of an
unproved enhanced mass transfer.
