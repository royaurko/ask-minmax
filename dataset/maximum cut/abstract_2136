We present a calculation of the coupling constants in the massive spin-1
field chiral Lagrangian to chiral ${\cal O}(p^3)$ in the context of an extended
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio cut-off model. Phenomenological applications of this
Lagrangian to anomalous and non-anomalous low-energy hadronic transitions
involving spin-1 particles are also discussed.
