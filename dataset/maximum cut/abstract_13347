The detection of an extremely broad iron line in XMM-Newton MOS data from the
low/hard state of the black hole binary GX339-4 is the only piece of evidence
which unambiguously conflicts with the otherwise extremely successful truncated
disc interpretation of this state. However, it also conflicts with some aspect
of observational data for all other alternative geometries of the low/hard
state, including jet models, making it very difficult to understand. We
re-analyse these data and show that they are strongly affected by pileup even
with extensive centroid removal as the source is ~200x brighter than the
recommended maximum countrate. Instead, we extract the simultaneous PN timing
mode data which should not be affected by pileup. These show a line which is
significantly narrower than in the MOS data. Thus these data are easily
consistent with a truncated disc, and indeed, strongly support such an
interpretation.
