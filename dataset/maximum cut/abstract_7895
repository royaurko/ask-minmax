We present the design of a structured search engine which returns a
multi-column table in response to a query consisting of keywords describing
each of its columns. We answer such queries by exploiting the millions of
tables on the Web because these are much richer sources of structured knowledge
than free-format text. However, a corpus of tables harvested from arbitrary
HTML web pages presents huge challenges of diversity and redundancy not seen in
centrally edited knowledge bases. We concentrate on one concrete task in this
paper. Given a set of Web tables T1, . . ., Tn, and a query Q with q sets of
keywords Q1, . . ., Qq, decide for each Ti if it is relevant to Q and if so,
identify the mapping between the columns of Ti and query columns. We represent
this task as a graphical model that jointly maps all tables by incorporating
diverse sources of clues spanning matches in different parts of the table,
corpus-wide co-occurrence statistics, and content overlap across table columns.
We define a novel query segmentation model for matching keywords to table
columns, and a robust mechanism of exploiting content overlap across table
columns. We design efficient inference algorithms based on bipartite matching
and constrained graph cuts to solve the joint labeling task. Experiments on a
workload of 59 queries over a 25 million web table corpus shows significant
boost in accuracy over baseline IR methods.
