We describe a calculation of the O(alpha_s^2) QCD corrections to the fully
differential cross section for W and Z boson production in hadronic collisions.
The result is fully realistic in that it includes spin correlations, finite
width effects, gamma-Z interference and allows for the application of arbitrary
cuts on the leptonic decay products of the W and Z. We have implemented this
calculation into a numerical program. We demonstrate the use of this code by
presenting phenomenological results for several future LHC analyses and recent
Tevatron measurements, including the W cross section in the forward rapidity
region and the central over forward cross section ratio.
