We study the probe spectrum of light generated by spontaneous emission into
the mode of a cavity QED system. The probe spectrum has a maximum on-resonance
when the number of inverted atoms for an input drive is maximal. For a larger
number of atoms N, the maximum splits and develops into a doublet, but its
frequencies are different from those of the so-called vacuum Rabi splitting.
