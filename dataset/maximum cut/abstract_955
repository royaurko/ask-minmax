The classical heat equation is incompatible with relativity, since the strong
maximum principle allows for disturbances to propagate instantaneously. Some
contributors have proposed limiting the propagation speed by adding a linear
hyperbolic correction term, but then even a weak maximum principle fails to
hold. We study a more recently introduced relativistic heat equation, which
replaces the Laplace operator by a quasilinear elliptic operator, and show that
strong and weak maximum principles hold for stationary and time-varying
solutions, respectively, as well as for sub- and supersolutions. Moreover, by
transforming the equation into an equivalent form, related to the mean
curvature operator, we prove even stronger tangency and comparison principles.
