The angular resolution of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes depends on
the employed event reconstruction methods. By taking the weighted average of
intersections of shower axes, the H.E.S.S. experiment achieves a 0.08 degree
angular resolution at 20 degree zenith angle with an image size cut of 160 p.e.
for sources with a spectral index of 2. However, the angular resolution
degrades to 0.14 degree at 60 degree zenith angle, due to the larger fraction
of nearly parallel images. The Disp method reduces the impact of parallel
images by including an estimation of the image displacement (disp), inferred
from the Hillas parameters, in the reconstruction procedure. By using this
technique, the angular resolution at large zenith angles can be improved by
50%. An additional cut on the estimated direction uncertainty can further
improve the angular resolution to around 0.05 degrees at the expense of a loss
of 50% of effective area. The performance of this reconstruction method on
simulated gamma-ray events and real data is presented.
