The operational characteristics of a Micromegas operating in pure xenon at
the pressure range of 1 to 10 bar are investigated. The maximum charge gain
achieved in each pressure is approximately constant, around 4x10^2, for xenon
pressures up to 5 bar and decreasing slowly above this pressure down to values
somewhat above 10^2 at 10 bar. The MM presents the highest gains for xenon
pressures above 4 bar, when compared to other micropattern gaseous multipliers.
The lowest energy resolution obtained for X-rays of 22.1 keV exhibits a steady
increase with pressure, from 12% at 1bar to about 32% at 10 bar. The effective
scintillation yield, defined as the number of photons exiting through the MM
mesh holes per primary electron produced in the conversion region was
calculated. This yield is about 2x10^2 photons per primary electron at 1 bar,
increasing to about 6x10^2 at 5 bar and, then, decreasing again to 2x10^2 at 10
bar. The readout of this scintillation by a suitable photosensor will result in
higher gains but with increased statistical fluctuations.
