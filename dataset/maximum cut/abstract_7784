Most models of weak scale supersymmetry (SUSY) predict observable rates for
production of SUSY matter at the CERN LHC. The SUSY collider events are
expected to be rich in jets, isolated (and non-isolated) leptons and missing
E_T. After first discussing the merits of mixed axion/axino vs. neutralino cold
dark matter in SUSY models, I then survey prospects for detecting SUSY matter
at the LHC via leptonic signatures. In the paradigm mSUGRA model, cascade
decays of gluinos and squarks should yield high rates for multi-jet plus
multi-lepton events, allowing values of m_{\tg}\sim 3 (1.8) TeV to be probed
for m_{\tq}\simeq m_{\tg} (m_{\tq}\gg m_{\tg}) with 100 fb^{-1} of integrated
luminosity. Direct production of gauginos and sleptons should also be possible
in limited regions of parameter space. Even in the first year of LHC running,
observable signals in multi-muon plus jets channel (without cutting on missing
E_T) can occur for interesting ranges of parameters. The highly motivated
Yukawa unified SUSY models-- where the dark matter is expected to be of mixed
axion/axino type-- should likely be testable in the first year of LHC running
due to large rates for gluino pair production followed by cascade decays.
