We develop a closed-form three-parameter model for unsaturated hydraulic
conductivity associated with the Kosugi three-parameter lognormal moisture
retention model. The model derivation uses a slight modification to Mualem's
theory, which is nearly exact for non-clay soils. Kosugi's three-parameter
lognormal moisture retention model uses physically meaningful parameters, but a
corresponding closed-form relative hydraulic conductivity model has never been
developed. The model is further extended to a four -parameter model by
truncating the underlying pore size distribution at physically permissible
minimum and maximum pore radii. The proposed closed-form models are fitted to
well-known experimental data, to illustrate their utility. They have the same
physical basis as Kosugi's two-parameter model, but are more general.
