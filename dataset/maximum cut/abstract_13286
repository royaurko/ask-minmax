The extraordinary magnetic Ap star HD75049 has been studied with data
obtained with the ESO VLT and 2.2-m telescopes. Direct measurements reveal that
the magnetic field modulus at maximum reaches 30kG. The star shows photometric,
spectral and magnetic variability with a rotation period of 4.049d. Variations
of the mean longitudinal magnetic field can be described to first order by a
centred dipole model with an inclination i = 25 degrees, an obliquity beta = 60
degrees, and a polar field B_p = 42kG.
  The combination of the longitudinal and surface magnetic field measurements
imply a radius of R = 1.7 R sun, suggesting the star is close to the zero-age
main sequence. HD75049 displays moderate overabundances of Si, Ti, Cr, Fe and
large overabundances of rare earth elements. This star has the second strongest
magnetic field of any main sequence star after Babcock's star, HD215441, which
it rivals.
