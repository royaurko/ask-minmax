We rederive the thermodynamical properties of a non interacting gas in the
presence of a minimal uncertainty in length. Apart from the phase space measure
which is modified due to a change of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, the
presence of an ultraviolet cut-off plays a tremendous role.
 The theory admits an intrinsic temperature above which the fermion
contribution to energy density, pressure and entropy is negligible.
