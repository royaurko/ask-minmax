We show that the density of states in an anisotropic superconductor with
intersecting line nodes in the gap function is proportional to $E log (\alpha
\Delta_0 /E)$ for $|E| << \Delta_0$, where $\Delta_0$ is the maximum value of
the gap function and $\alpha$ is constant, while it is proportional to $E$ if
the line nodes do not intersect. As a result, a logarithmic correction appears
in the temperature dependence of the NMR relaxation rate and the specific heat,
which can be observed experimentally. By comparing with those for the heavy
fermion superconductors, we can obtain information about the symmetry of the
gap function.
