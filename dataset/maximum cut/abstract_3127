A four-state mutation-selection model for the evolution of populations of
DNA-sequences is investigated with particular interest in the phenomenon of
error thresholds. The mutation model considered is the Kimura 3ST mutation
scheme, fitness functions, which determine the selection process, come from the
permutation-invariant class. Error thresholds can be found for various fitness
functions, the phase diagrams are more interesting than for equivalent
two-state models. Results for (small) finite sequence lengths are compared with
those for infinite sequence length, obtained via a maximum principle that is
equivalent to the principle of minimal free energy in physics.
