Observations and theory suggest that line driven winds from hot stars and
luminous accretion disks adopt a unique, critical solution which corresponds to
maximum mass loss rate. We analyze the numerical stability of the infinite
family of shallow wind solutions, which resemble solar wind breezes, and their
transition to the critical wind. Shallow solutions are sub-critical with
respect to radiative (or Abbott) waves. These waves can propagate upstream
through shallow winds at high speeds. If the waves are not accounted for in the
Courant time step, numerical runaway results. The outer boundary condition is
equally important for wind stability. Assuming pure outflow conditions, as is
done in the literature, triggers runaway of shallow winds to the critical
solution or to accretion flow.
