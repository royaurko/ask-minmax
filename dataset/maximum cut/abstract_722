We present a method for generating higher-order finite volume discretizations
for Poisson's equation on Cartesian cut cell grids in two and three dimensions.
The discretization is in flux-divergence form, and stencils for the flux are
computed by solving small weighted least-squares linear systems. Weights are
the key in generating a stable discretization. We apply the method to solve
Poisson's equation on a variety of geometries, and we demonstrate that the
method can achieve second and fourth order accuracy in both truncation and
solution error for these examples. We also show that the Laplacian operator has
only stable eigenvalues for each of these examples.
