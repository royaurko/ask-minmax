In this paper Multidimensional Laplace approximation with the estimated rate
of convergence is developed. We consider two cases of maximum, in the interior
of the domain and on the boundary. Additionally, the function in the exponent
and its maximum point is dependent on the integral 'large' parameter. The
probabilistic application is included and it is in the form of two limit
theorems for the random vector whose values are defined as the coordinates of
points within the domain of Laplace integral. The pdf is constructed by
considering Laplace integral with domain of integration being the event set and
normalizing with integral over whole domain. The first probabilistic result is
Law of Large Numbers and the second is Central Limit Theorem. The second result
is different for two cases of maximum of function in Laplace integral. When it
is in the interior of the domain we obtain Gaussian distribution. For the
boundary maximum we obtain exponential in one direction and Gaussian in other
directions. The proofs are based on the developed in the paper Laplace
approximation and additional, rather standard estimated were necessary.
