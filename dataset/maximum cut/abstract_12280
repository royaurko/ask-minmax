In a previous work (Mbelek 2001), we modelled the rotation curves (RC) of
spiral galaxies by including in the equation of motion of the stars the
dynamical terms from an external real self-interacting scalar field, $\psi$,
minimally coupled to gravity and which respects the equivalence principle in
the weak fields and low velocity approximation. This model appeared to have
three free parameters : the turnover radius, $r_{0}$, the maximum tangential
velocity, $v_{\theta max} = v_{\theta}(r_{0})$, plus a strictly positive
integer, $n$. Here, we propose a new improved version where the coupling of the
$\psi$-field to dark matter is emphasized at the expense of its
self-interaction. This reformulation presents the very advantageous possibility
that the same potential is used for all galaxies. Using at the same time a
quasi-isothermal dark matter density and the scalar field helps to better fit
the RC of spiral galaxies. In addition, new correlations are established.
