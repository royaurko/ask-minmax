Jeong and Steinhardt (JS) implement local rules by selecting the sub-ensemble
of tilings which have the maximum occurrences of a chosen pattern (``cluster'')
C It is unknown how to prove that a given C implies a given sub-ensemble;
counterexamples given here demonstrate this problem is nonlocal, and show the
JS results depend on periodic boundary conditions. Sub-ensembles which are
tilings of supertiles are at least as interesting, mathematically and
physically, as the ideal cases emphasized by JS; the case C = star-decagon is
explored here. Finally, I suggest minimizing the frequency of chosen intersite
distances as a more physical alternative to the cluster approach.
