I review quark momentum distributions in the nucleon at large momentum
fractions x. Particular attention is paid to the impact of nuclear effects in
deuterium on the d/u quark distribution ratio as x -> 1. A new global study of
parton distributions, using less restrictive kinematic cuts in Q^2 and W^2,
finds strong suppression of the d quark distribution once nuclear corrections
are accounted for.
