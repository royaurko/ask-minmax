A method for solving model nonlinear equations describing plasma oscillations
in the presence of viscosity and resistivity is given. By first going to the
Lagrangian variables and then transforming the space variable conveniently, the
solution in parametric form is obtained. It involves simple elementary
functions. Our solution includes all known exact solutions for an ideal cold
plasma and a large class of new ones for a more realistic plasma. A new
nonlinear effect is found of splitting of the largest density maximum, with a
saddle point between the peaks so obtained. The method may sometimes be useful
where Inverse Scattering fails.
