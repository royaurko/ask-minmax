This paper introduces a Bayesian framework to detect multiple signals
embedded in noisy observations from a sensor array. For various states of
knowledge on the communication channel and the noise at the receiving sensors,
a marginalization procedure based on recent tools of finite random matrix
theory, in conjunction with the maximum entropy principle, is used to compute
the hypothesis selection criterion. Quite remarkably, explicit expressions for
the Bayesian detector are derived which enable to decide on the presence of
signal sources in a noisy wireless environment. The proposed Bayesian detector
is shown to outperform the classical power detector when the noise power is
known and provides very good performance for limited knowledge on the noise
power. Simulations corroborate the theoretical results and quantify the gain
achieved using the proposed Bayesian framework.
