We report on the detection of pulsations in the far ultraviolet (hereafter
FUV) light curves of PG1219+534, PG1605+072, and PG1613+426 obtained with the
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) in time-tagged mode (TTAG).
Exposures of the order of a few Ksecs were sufficient to observe the main
frequencies of PG1219+534 and PG1605+072 and confirm the detection of a
pulsation mode at the surface of PG1613+426 as reported from ground. For the
first time we derive time-resolved spectroscopic FUSE data of a sdB pulsator
(PG1605+072) and comment its line profile variation diagram (hereafter lpv
diagram). We observe the phase shift between the maximum luminosity and the
maximum radius to be consistent with the model of an adiabatic pulsator. We
also present evidence that the line broadening previously reported is not
caused by rotation but is rather an observational bias due to the rapid Doppler
shift of the lines with 17 km.s-1 amplitude. Thus our observations do not
support the previous claim that PG1605+072 is (or will evolve into) an
unusually fast rotating degenerate dwarf. These results demonstrate the
asteroseismological potential of the FUSE satellite which should be viewed as
another powerful means of investigation of stellar pulsations along with the
MOST and COROT missions.
