We have used observations made with the helioseismic instrument LOWL
collected over $\sim$ 6 years to carry out an independent study of the
variations of the p-mode damping and excitation rates with solar activity. We
observe significant variations in the mode height, mode width and mode velocity
power over a wide range of angular degree values. Their sensitivities to solar
activity show clear evidence of frequency dependence, the modes in the
frequency range from 2700 and 3300 $\mu$Hz showing the largest variations and
exhibiting a maximum change centered around 3100 $\mu$Hz. As for the mode
energy supply rate, it is consistent, at the level of precision of the
observations, with a zero change along the solar cycle and over the range of
studied frequencies. Moreover, the variations with solar activity of each of
these parameters are observed to be more or less $\ell$-independent over the
range of studied angular degrees. Our results provide the first in-depth
confirmation of the findings obtained from GONG measurements for intermediate
angular degrees.
