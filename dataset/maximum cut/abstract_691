The trajectories of S-matrix poles are calculated in the finite-range
phenomenological potential introduced recently by P. Salamon and T. Vertse
(SV). The trajectories of the resonance poles in this SV potential are compared
to the corresponding trajectories in a cut-off Woods-Saxon (WS) potential for
l>0. The dependence on the cut-off radius is demonstrated. The starting points
of the trajectories turn out to be related to the average ranges of the two
terms in the SV potential.
