We investigate the analytic structure of the $2\to5$ scattering amplitude in
the planar limit of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM in multi-Regge kinematics in all
physical regions. We demonstrate the close connection between Regge pole and
Regge cut contributions: in a selected class of kinematic regions (Mandelstam
regions) the usual factorizing Regge pole formula develops unphysical
singularities which have to be absorbed and compensated by Regge cut
contributions. This leads, in the corrections to the BDS formula, to conformal
invariant 'renormalized' Regge pole expressions in the remainder function. We
compute these renormalized Regge poles for the $2\to5$ scattering amplitude.
