The probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral pions to all
pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic regions, has been
suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate (D$\chi$C). Here we
note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts in the
data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$ pions
with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R >$ can be
substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\chi$C domain
without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5 given the
pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with lowest
$p_T$ are both neutral, etc.. The effects of multi-domain D$\chi$C formation
and noise due to incoherent pion emission can be systematically incorporated.
Potential applications to experiments and their limitations are briefly
discussed.
