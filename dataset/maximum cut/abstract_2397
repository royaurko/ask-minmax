Using Langer's $Im F$ method, we discuss the temperature dependence of
nuclear fission width in the presence of dissipative environments. We introduce
a low cut-off frequency to the spectral density of the environmental
oscillators in order to mimic the pairing gap. It is shown that the decay width
rapidly decreases at the critical temperature, where the phase transition from
super to normal fluids takes place. Relation to the recently observed threshold
for the dissipative fission is discussed.
