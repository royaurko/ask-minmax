DEMs have been used to experimental studying the temporal evolution of the
March maximum of fluxes of near-Earth daemons. It is shown that part of objects
from near-Earth almost circular heliocentric orbits (NEACHOs), from which a
rather intense flux proceeds during only about four weeks, forms in the second
half of March the population in geocentric Earth-surface-crossing orbits
(GESCOs). The resistance of the Earth's matter results in that GESCO objects
sink into the Earth's interior, so that the GESCO population nearly disappears
by the end of April.
