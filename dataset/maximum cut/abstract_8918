The maximum rates for reliably transmitting classical information over
Bosonic multiple-access channels (MACs) are derived when the transmitters are
restricted to coherent-state encodings. Inner and outer bounds for the ultimate
capacity region of the Bosonic MAC are also presented. It is shown that the
sum-rate upper bound is achievable with a coherent-state encoding and that the
entire region is asymptotically achievable in the limit of large mean input
photon numbers.
