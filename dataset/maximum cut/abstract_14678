A self-iterating soft equalizer (SISE) consisting of a few relatively weak
constituent equalizers is shown to provide robust performance even in severe
intersymbol interference (ISI) channels that exhibit deep nulls and valleys
within the signal band. Constituent equalizers are allowed to exchange soft
information in the absence of interleavers based on the method that are
designed to suppress significant correlation among their soft outputs. The
resulting SISE works well as a stand-alone equalizer or as the equalizer
component of a turbo equalization system. The performance advantages over
existing methods are validated with bit-error-rate (BER) simulations and
extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis. It is shown that in turbo
equalizer setting the SISE achieves performance closer to the maximum a
posteriori probability equalizer than any other known schemes in very severe
ISI channels.
