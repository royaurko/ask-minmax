We introduce a new family of binary linear codes suitable for steganographic
matrix embedding. The main characteristic of the codes is the staircase random
block structure of the generator matrix. We propose an efficient list decoding
algorithm for the codes that finds a close codeword to a given random word. We
provide both theoretical analysis of the performance and stability of the
decoding algorithm, as well as practical results. Used for matrix embedding,
these codes achieve almost the upper theoretical bound of the embedding
efficiency for covers in the range of 1000 - 1500 bits, which is at least an
order of magnitude smaller than the values reported in related works.
