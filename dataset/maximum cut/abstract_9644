We present of measurements of radio emission from EAS at the frequency 32 MHz
performed in 2008-2012. Showers were selected by zenith and azimuth directions,
sampled by energy. A mean lateral distribution function was fitted to the data
each interval. The paper presents unied approximation formula for all three
energy intervals of lateral distribution, using connection between equation (1)
and (2) coefficients with energy and geomagnetic angle. Here we analyze the
connection between the shape of lateral distribution and the depth of the
maximum shower development Xmax too.
