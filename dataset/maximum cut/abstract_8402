The 1D Ising model is analytically studied in a spatially periodic and
oscillatory external magnetic field using the transfer-matrix method. For low
enough magnetic field intensities the correlation between the external magnetic
field and the response in magnetization presents a maximum for a given
temperature. The phenomenon can be interpreted as a resonance phenomenon
induced by the stochastic heatbath. This novel "spatial stochastic resonance"
has a different origin from the classical stochastic resonance phenomenon.
