The Prominence-Corona Transition Region (PCTR) plays a key role in the
thermal and pressure equilibrium of solar prominences. Our knowledge of this
interface is limited and several major issues remain open, including the
thermal structure and, in particular, the maximum temperature of the detectable
plasma. The high signal-to-noise ratio of images obtained by the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) on NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory clearly show that
prominences are often seen in emission in the 171 and 131 bands. We investigate
the temperature sensitivity of these AIA bands for prominence observation, in
order to infer the temperature content in an effort to explain the emission.
  Using the CHIANTI atomic database and previously determined prominence
differential emission measure distributions, we build synthetic spectra to
establish the main emission-line contributors in the AIA bands. We find that
the Fe IX line always dominates the 171 band, even in the absence of plasma at
> 10^6 K temperatures, while the 131 band is dominated by Fe VIII. We conclude
that the PCTR has sufficient plasma emitting at > 4 10^5 K to be detected by
AIA.
