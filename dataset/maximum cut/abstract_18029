In the present study, we try to understand the inconsistency about the degree
of geometrical frustration in AV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (A $\equiv$ Zn, Cd and Mg)
compounds that arises from the two experimental results: (i) frustration
indices and (ii) magnetic moments by using {\it ab initio} electronic structure
calculations. The orbital degrees of freedom are found to play an important
role in understanding the geometrically frustrated magnetic behaviour of these
compounds. The magnitude of the maximum calculated values of orbital magnetic
moment per formula unit for ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and
CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ compounds are found to be $\sim$1.54 $\mu$$_{B}$, $\sim$0.92
$\mu$$_{B}$ and $\sim$1.74 $\mu$$_{B}$, respectively. The inclusion of the
orbital and spin angular momenta for calculating the frustration indices
improves the understanding about the degree of geometrical frustration in these
compounds. The revised values of the frustration indices ($f$$_{\rm
{revised}}$) are largest for MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and smallest for CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$
for 3.3$\leq$ $U \leq$5.3 eV. In this range of $U$, the consistency about the
degree of geometrical frustration, which arises from the $f$$_{\rm {revised}}$
as well as from the experimentally observed magnetic moment is achieved. This
work is expected to provide a valuable input in understanding the geometrically
frustrated magnetic behaviour for those systems for which the orbital part of
the angular momenta are not quenched.
