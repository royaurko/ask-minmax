We analyze numerically the optical response and effective macroscopic
parameters of fishnet metamaterials infiltrated with a nematic liquid crystal.
We show that even a small amount of liquid crystal can provide tuning of the
structures due to reorientation of the liquid crystal director. This enables
switchable optical metamaterials, where the refractive index can be switched
from positive to negative by an external field. This tuning is primarily
determined by the shift of the cut-off wavelength of the holes, with only a
small influence due to the change in plasmon dispersion
