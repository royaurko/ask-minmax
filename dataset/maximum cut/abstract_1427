We report results of a new global next-to-leading order fit of parton
distribution functions in which cuts on W and Q are relaxed, thereby including
more data at high values of x. Effects of target mass corrections (TMCs),
higher twist contributions, and nuclear corrections for deuterium data are
significant in the large-x region. The leading twist parton distributions are
found to be stable to TMC model variations as long as higher twist
contributions are also included. The behavior of the d quark as x-->1 is
particularly sensitive to the deuterium corrections, and using realistic
nuclear smearing models the d-quark distribution at large x is found to be
softer than in previous fits performed with more restrictive cuts.
