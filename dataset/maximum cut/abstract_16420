The general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect can be detected by means of a
suitable combination of orbital residuals of the laser-ranged LAGEOS and LAGEOS
II satellites. While this observable is not affected by the orbital
perturbation induced by the zonal Earth solid and ocean tides, it is sensitive
to those generated by the tesseral and sectorial tides. The assessment of their
influence on the measurement of the parameter mu, with which the
gravitomagnetic effect is accounted for, is the goal of this paper. After
simulating the combined residual curve by calculating accurately the
mismodeling of the more effective tidal perturbations, it has been found that,
while the solid tides affect the recovery of mu at a level always well below
1%, for the ocean tides and the other long-period signals Delta mu depends
strongly on the observational period and the noise level: Delta mu(tides)
amounts to almost 2% after 7 years. The aliasing effect of K1 l=3 p=1 tide and
SRP(4241) solar radiation pressure harmonic, with periods longer than 4 years,
on the perigee of LAGEOS II yield to a maximum systematic uncertainty on
$\m_{LT}$ of less than 4% over different observational periods. The zonal
18.6-year tide does not affect the combined residuals.
