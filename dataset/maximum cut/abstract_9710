Large magnetocaloric effect (MCE) and magnetoresistance (MR) together with
negligible hysteresis loss has been observed in ErNiSi compound, which
undergoes metamagnetic transition at low temperatures. Magnetization, heat
capacity and resistivity measurements confirm the metamagnetic transition. The
maximum value of isothermal entropy change and MR for a field change of 50 kOe
are found to be 19.1 J/kg K and -34 %. Large MCE with negligible magnetic
hysteresis loss could make this material promising for low temperature magnetic
refrigeration.
