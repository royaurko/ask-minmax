Stochastic bistable systems whose stationary distributions belong to the
q-exponential family are investigated using two approaches: (i) the Langevin
model subjected to additive and quadratic multiplicative noise, and (ii) the
superstatistical model. Previously, the bistable Langevin model has been
analyzed under linear multiplicative noise, whereas this paper reports on
quadratic multiplicative noise, which is more physically meaningful. The
stationary distribution of the Langevin model under quadratic multiplicative
noise, which agrees with that derived by the maximum Tsallis entropy method, is
found to be qualitatively different from its counterpart under linear
multiplicative noise. We also show that the stationary distribution of the
superstatistical model is the same as that of the Langevin model, whereas their
transient properties, described in terms of mean first passage times (MFPTs),
are qualitatively different.
