We have analyzed pion-nucleon scattering using the manifestly relativistic
covariant frameworks of Infrared Regularization (IR) and Extended-On-Mass-Shell
(EOMS) up to O(q^3) in the chiral expansion, where q is a generic small
momentum. We describe the low-energy phase shifts with a similar quality as
previously achieved with Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory, being the
EOMS description better than the IR one. The Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy is
extracted from data of partial wave analyses using both schemes, obtaining an
unacceptable large value for the case of IR due to the loop contribution. On
the other hand, EOMS gives small values compatible with other phenomenological
approaches. Finally, we have unitarized the amplitudes provided by both schemes
to extend the range of our description obtaining a good agreement with the data
up to energies of \sqrt{s}\approx 1.3 GeV for the EOMS scheme while IR can not
go beyond energies of \sqrt{s}\approx 1.25 GeV due to the unphysical cut that
this scheme introduces.
