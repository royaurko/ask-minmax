The NN results are presented from the extended-soft-core (ESC) interactions.
They cosist of local- and non-local-potentials due to (i) one-boson-exchange
(OBE), pseudo-scalar-, vector-, scalar-, and axial-vector-nonets, (ii)
diffractive exchanges, (iii) two-pseudoscalar-exchange, and (iv)
meson-pair-exchange (MPE). Fits to the pp- and np-data for 0 < T(lab) < 350 MeV
have typical \chi^2/Ndata= 1.15. Used are less than 20 parameters, which are
coupling constants and cut-off masses. The couplings follow rather closely the
pattern predicted by the quark-pair-creation model. As a result the 11
OBE-couplings are rather constrained, i.e. quasi-free. The deuteron binding
energy and several NN scattering lengths are fitted at the same time.
