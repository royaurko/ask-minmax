A new multichannel spectrometer, Phoenix-3, is in operation having
capabilities to observe solar flare radio emissions in the 0.1 - 5 GHz range at
an unprecedented spectral resolution of 61.0 kHz with high sensitivity. The
present setup for routine observations allows measuring circular polarization,
but requires a data compression to 4096 frequency channels in the 1 - 5 GHz
range and to a temporal resolution of 200 ms. First results are presented by
means of a well observed event that included narrowband spikes at 350 - 850
MHz. Spike bandwidths are found to have a power-law distribution, dropping off
below a value of 2 MHz for full width at half maximum (FWHM). The narrowest
spikes have a FWHM bandwidth less than 0.3 MHz or 0.04% of the central
frequency. The smallest half-power increase occurs within 0.104 MHz at 443.5
MHz, which is close to the predicted natural width of maser emission. The
spectrum of spikes is found to be asymmetric, having an enhanced low-frequency
tail. The distribution of the total spike flux is approximately an exponential.
