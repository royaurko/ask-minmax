Statistical analysis of financial data most focused on testing the validity
of Brownian motion (Bm). Analysis performed on several time series have shown
deviation from the Bm hypothesis, that is at the base of the evaluation of many
financial derivatives. We inquiry in the behavior of measures of performance
based on maximum drawdown movements (MDD), testing their stability when the
underlying process deviates from the Bm hypothesis. In particular we consider
the fractional Brownian motion (fBm), and fluctuations estimated empirically on
raw market data. The case study of the rising part of speculative bubbles is
reported.
