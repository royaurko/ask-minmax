We describe an expert system, MAIES, developed for analysing forensic
identification problems involving DNA mixture traces using quantitative peak
area information. Peak area information is represented by conditional Gaussian
distributions, and inference based on exact junction tree propagation
ascertains whether individuals, whose profiles have been measured, have
contributed to the mixture. The system can also be used to predict DNA profiles
of unknown contributors by separating the mixture into its individual
components. The use of the system is illustrated with an application to a real
world example. The system implements a novel MAP (maximum a posteriori) search
algorithm that is described in an appendix.
