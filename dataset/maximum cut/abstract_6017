In this paper, we study the Hessian equation with infinite Dirichlet
(blow-up) boundary value conditions. Using radial functions and techniques of
ordinary differential inequality, we construct various barrier functions
(super-solution and sub-solution). Existence and non-existence theorems are
proved by those barriers, maximum principle and theory of viscous solutions.
Furthermore, generic boundary blow-up rates for the solutions are derived.
