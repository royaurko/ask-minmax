The object of the present paper is to find new sufficient conditions for the
existence of unique strong solutions to a class of (time-inhomogeneous)
stochastic differential equations with random, non-Lipschitzian coefficients.
We give an example to show that our conditions are indeed weaker than those
relevant conditions existing in the literature. We also derive moment
estimations for the maximum process of the solution. Finally, we present a
sufficient condition to ensure the non confluence property of the solution of
time-homogeneous SDE which, in one dimension, is nothing but stochastic
monotone property of the solution.
