We have investigated the impact of covalent hybridization on martensitic
structure and magnetic properties of Ni50Mn5+xGa35-xCu10 shape memory alloys.
We found that the lattice distortion ((c-a)/a) of L10 martensite monotonously
changes with the substitution of Mn for Ga atoms and shows a kink behavior at
Ga(at.%)= 25 due to the weakened covalent effect between main-group and
transition-metal atoms. Moreover, owing to the competition between covalence
hybridization and magnetic ordering of introduced Mn atoms, the molecular
magnetic moment and Curie temperature coincidently show maximums at Ga(at.%)=25
as well. These behaviors are closely associated with corresponding changes of
the strength of covalent hybridization. The results therefore suggest that
careful control of the concentration of main-group atoms in Heusler alloys can
serve as an additional general tuning parameter for searching new
multifunctional materials.
