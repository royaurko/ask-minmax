In the course of a long-term project investigating classical novae with large
outburst amplitudes, we have performed optical spectroscopy of several old-nova
candidates. We here present the spectra of the candidates V630 Sgr, XX Tau, CQ
Vel, V842 Cen, and V529 Ori, that hitherto lacked such classification. While
the first four show typical spectra for cataclysmic variables, and can thus be
identified as such, V529 Ori is probably misclassified.
  Of special interest are the two systems XX Tau and V842 Cen, which show all
signs for being low mass transfer systems. As such they can be used to judge
the evolution scenarios for novae. In particular, given the rather young age of
their outburst, it appears more likely that these systems are not on their way
into hibernation, (i.e., cutting off mass transfer for a longer period of
time), but are simply settling down towards their original configuration of
comparatively low, but steady, mass transfer, such as for dwarf novae.
