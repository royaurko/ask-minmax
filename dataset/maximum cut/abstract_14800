A new fast algebraic method for obtaining an $\mathcal{H}^2$-approximation of
a matrix from its entries is presented. The main idea behind the method is
based on the nested representation and the maximum-volume principle to select
submatrices in low-rank matrices. A special iterative approach for the
computation of so-called representor sets is established. The main advantage of
the method is that it uses only the hierarchical partitioning of the matrix and
does not require special "proxy surfaces" to be selected in advance.
  The numerical experiments for the N-body problem and for the boundary
integral operator confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the approach. The
complexity is linear in the matrix size and polynomial in the ranks. The
algorithm is implemented as an open-source Python package that is available
online.
