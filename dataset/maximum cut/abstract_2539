Recently a new caculational scheme for effective actions in radial background
fields was developed. The effective action is expressed as an infinite sum of
partial-wave contributions, using the rotational symmetry of the system. The
sum becomes convergent after proper regularization and renormalization, but the
rate of convergence is rather slow. We introduce a systematic way of
accelerating the rate of convergence. This method is based on a radial WKB
series in the angular momentum cut-off. We demonstrate the power of this scheme
by applying it to the calculation of instanton determinant in QCD.
