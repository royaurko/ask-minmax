We present a simple kinematic model for the narrow-line region (NLR) of the
Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151, based on our previous observations of extended [O
III] emission with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The model
is similar to a biconical radial outflow model developed for the Seyfert 2
galaxy NGC 1068, except that the bicone axis is tilted much more into our line
of sight (40 degrees out of the plane of the sky instead of 5 degrees), and the
maximum space velocities are lower (750 km/s instead of 1300 km/s. We find
evidence for radial acceleration of the emission-line knots to a distance of
160 pc, followed by deceleration that approaches the systemic velocity at a
distance of 290 pc (for a distance to NGC 4151 of 13.3 Mpc). Other similarities
to the kinematics of NGC 1068 are: 1) there are a number of high-velocity
clouds that are not decelerated, suggesting that the medium responsible for the
deceleration is patchy, and 2) the bicone in NGC 4151 is at least partially
evacuated along its axis. Together, these two Seyfert galaxies provide strong
evidence for radial outflow (e.g., due to radiation and/or wind pressure) and
against gravitational motion or expansion away from the radio jets as the
principal kinematic component in the NLR.
