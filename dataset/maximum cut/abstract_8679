Assuming the canonical seesaw mechanism together with an SO(3) family
symmetry for leptons, broken only by the charged-lepton masses, I show that the
three neutrinos of Majorana mass $m_0$ are split radiatively in two loops by a
maximum finite calculable amount of order $10^{-9} m_0$. This is very suitable
for dark matter and vacuum solar neutrino oscillations. I also discuss how
atmospheric neutrino oscillations can be incorporated.
