A certain inequality is shown to hold for the values of the Mobius function
of the poset obtained by attaching a maximum element to a lower Eulerian
Cohen-Macaulay poset. In two important special cases, this inequality provides
partial results supporting Stanley's nonnegativity conjecture for the toric
h-vector of a lower Eulerian Cohen-Macaulay meet-semilattice and Adin's
nonnegativity conjecture for the cubical h-vector of a Cohen-Macaulay cubical
complex.
