Cluster dynamical mean field and maximum entropy analytical continuation
methods are used to obtain theoretical estimates for the many-body density of
states, electron self-energy, in-plane and c-axis optical conductivity and the
$B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ Raman scattering spectra of the two dimensional square
lattice Hubbard model at intermediate interaction strengths and carrier
concentrations near half filling. The calculations are based on an 8-site
cluster approximation which gives access to both the zone-diagonal and
zone-face portions of the Fermi surface. At low dopings the zone-face regions
exhibit a 'pseudogap', a suppression of the many-body density of states for
energies near the Fermi surface. The pseudogap magnitude is largest near half
filling and decreases smoothly with doping, but as temperature is increased the
gap fills in rather than closes. The calculated response functions bear a
strong qualitative resemblance to data taken in the pseudogap regime of
high-$T_c$ cuprates, strongly suggesting that the intermediate coupling Hubbard
model accounts for much of the exotic behavior observed in high-$T_c$
materials.
