We study the Josephson effect in ballistic double-barrier SIFIS planar
junctions, consisting of bulk superconductors (S), a clean metallic ferromagnet
(F), and insulating interfaces (I). We solve the scattering problem based on
the Bogoliubov--de Gennes equations and derive a general expression for the dc
Josephson current, valid for arbitrary interfacial transparency and Fermi wave
vectors mismatch (FWVM). We consider the coherent regime in which quasiparticle
transmission resonances contribute significantly to the Andreev process. The
Josephson current is calculated for various parameters of the junction, and the
influence of both interfacial transparency and FWVM is analyzed. For thin
layers of strong ferromagnet and finite interfacial transparency, we find that
coherent (geometrical) oscillations of the maximum Josephson current are
superimposed on the oscillations related to the crossover between 0 and $\pi$
states. For the same case we find that the temperature-induced $0-\pi$
transition occurs if the junction is very close to the crossovers at zero
temperature.
