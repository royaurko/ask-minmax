We consider the stimulated emission of gravitons from an initial state of
thermal equilibrium, under the action of the cosmic gravitational background
field. We find that the low-energy graviton spectrum is enhanced if compared
with spontaneous creation from the vacuum; as a consequence, the scale of
inflation must be lowered, in order not to exceed the observed CMB quadrupole
anisotropy. This effect is particularly important for models based on a
symmetry-breaking transition which require, as initial condition, a state of
thermal equilibrium at temperatures of the order of the inflation scale.
