Specific to Math Information Retrieval is combining text with mathematical
formulae both in documents and in queries. Rigorous evaluation of query
expansion and merging strategies combining math and standard textual keyword
terms in a query are given. It is shown that techniques similar to those known
from textual query processing may be applied in math information retrieval as
well, and lead to a cutting edge performance. Striping and merging partial
results from subqueries is one technique that improves results measured by
information retrieval evaluation metrics like Bpref.
