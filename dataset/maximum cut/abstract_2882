Recent experiments suggest that the Ising pyrochlore magnets ${\rm
Ho_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$ and ${\rm Dy_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$ display qualitative
properties of the ferromagnetic nearest neighbor spin ice model proposed by
Harris {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 79}, 2554 (1997). The manifestation
of spin ice behavior in these systems {\it despite} the energetic constraints
introduced by the strength and the long range nature of dipole-dipole
interactions, remains difficult to understand. We report here results from a
mean field analysis that shed some light on the origin of spin ice behavior in
(111) Ising pyrochlores. Specifically, we find that there exist a large
frustrating effect of the dipolar interactions beyond the nearest neighbor, and
that the degeneracy established by effective ferromagnetic nearest neighbor
interactions is only very weakly lifted by the long range interactions. Such
behavior only appears beyond a cut-off distance corresponding to $O(10^2)$
nearest neighbor. Our mean field analysis shows that truncation of dipolar
interactions leads to spurious ordering phenomena that change with the
truncation cut-off distance.
