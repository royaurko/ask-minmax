Image thresholding has played an important role in image segmentation. This
paper presents a hybrid approach for image segmentation based on the
thresholding by fuzzy c-means (THFCM) algorithm for image segmentation. The
goal of the proposed approach is to find a discerner cluster able to find an
automatic threshold. The algorithm is formulated by applying the standard FCM
clustering algorithm to the frequencies (y-values) on the smoothed histogram.
Hence, the frequencies of an image can be used instead of the conventional
whole data of image. The cluster that has the highest peak which represents the
maximum frequency in the image histogram will play as an excellent role in
determining a discerner cluster to the grey level image. Then, the pixels
belong to the discerner cluster represent an object in the gray level histogram
while the other clusters represent a background. Experimental results with
standard test images have been obtained through the proposed approach (THFCM).
