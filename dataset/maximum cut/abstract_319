We find a permutation relation among Yangian Invariants -- two Yangian
Invariants with adjacent external lines exchanged are related by a simple
kinematic factor. This relation is shown to be equivalent to U(1) decoupling
and Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) relation at the level of maximal helicity
violating (MHV) amplitudes. Together with the newly found permutation relation
and using unitarity cuts to remove ambiguity in the definition of loop momenta
of cut amplitudes due to the nonplanar legs, we propose a systematic way of
reconstructing the the integrands of nonplanar MHV amplitudes up to a rational
function which vanishes under all possible unitarity cuts. This method when
applied to planar diagrams reproduces results from the single cut method. As
explicit examples the construction of one-loop double-trace MHV amplitudes of
4- and 5-point interactions are presented using on-shell diagrams. The
kinematic factors and the resultant planar diagrams are carefully dealt with
using the unitarity cut condition. The first next-to-MHV amplitudes are
addressed using generalized unitarity cuts. Their leading singularities can be
identified as residues of the Grassmanian integral. This example also serve to
demonstrate the power of the newly found relation of Yangian Invariants.
