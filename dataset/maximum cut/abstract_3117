In this communication we analyze the behavior of excited drops contained in
spherical volumes. We study different properties of the dynamical systems i.e.
the maximum Lyapunov exponent MLE, the asymptotic distance in momentum space
$d_{\infty}$ andthe normalized variance of the maximum fragment NVM. It is
shown that the constrained systems behaves as undergoing a first order phase
transition at low densities while as a second order one at high densities. The
transition from liquid-like to vapor-like behavior is signaled both by the
caloric curves, thermal response functions and the MLE. The relationship
between $MLE,d_{\infty}$, and the CC is explored.
