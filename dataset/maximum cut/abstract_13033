Recently Tsurutani et al., (2008) (Paper 1) analyzed the complex
interplanetary structures during 7 to 8 November, 2004 to identify their
properties as well as resultant geomagnetic effects and the solar origins.
Besides mentioned paper by Gopalswamy et al., (2006) the solar and
interplanetary sources of geomagnetic storm on 7-10 November, 2004 have also
been discussed in details in series of other papers. Some conclusions of these
works essentially differ from conclusions of the Paper 1 but have not been
discussed by contributors of Paper 1. In this comment we would like to discuss some
of these distinctions.
