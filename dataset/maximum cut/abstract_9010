Untangling is a process in which some vertices of a planar graph are moved to
obtain a straight-line plane drawing. The aim is to move as few vertices as
possible. We present an algorithm that untangles the cycle graph C_n while
keeping at least \Omega(n^{2/3}) vertices fixed. For any graph G, we also
present an upper bound on the number of fixed vertices in the worst case. The
bound is a function of the number of vertices, maximum degree and diameter of
G. One of its consequences is the upper bound O((n log n)^{2/3}) for all
3-vertex-connected planar graphs.
