From the principle of maximum entropy for a closed system in thermal
equilibrium, for the first instance a clear relation is shown to exist between
total entropy S (in terms of arrangements of particles) and the classical
expression for the force acting on a particle in a rotating frame. We determine
relationships between arrangement of particles and force in the case of the
gravitational and elastic forces.
