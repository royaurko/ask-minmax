This paper considers shifted inverse determinant sums arising from the union
bound of the pairwise error probability for space-time codes in
multiple-antenna fading channels. Previous work by Vehkalahti et al. focused on
the approximation of these sums for low multiplexing gains, providing a
complete classification of the inverse determinant sums as a function of
constellation size for the most well-known algebraic space-time codes. This
work aims at building a general framework for the study of the shifted sums for
all multiplexing gains. New bounds obtained using dyadic summing techniques
suggest that the behavior of the shifted sums does characterize many properties
of a lattice code such as the diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off, both under
maximum-likelihood decoding and infinite lattice naive decoding. Moreover,
these bounds allow to characterize the signal-to-noise ratio thresholds
corresponding to different diversity gains.
