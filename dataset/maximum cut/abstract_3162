Support vector machines represent a promising development in machine learning
research that is not widely used within the remote sensing community. This
paper reports the results of Multispectral(Landsat-7 ETM+) and Hyperspectral
DAIS)data in which multi-class SVMs are compared with maximum likelihood and
artificial neural network methods in terms of classification accuracy. Our
results show that the SVM achieves a higher level of classification accuracy
than either the maximum likelihood or the neural classifier, and that the
support vector machine can be used with small training datasets and
high-dimensional data.
