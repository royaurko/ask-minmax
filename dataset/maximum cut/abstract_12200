The high-pressure structural behavior of lanthanum monochalcogenides is
investigated by theory and experiment. Theory comprises density functional
calculations of LaS, LaSe and LaTe with the general gradient approximation for
exchange and correlation effects, as implemented within the full-potential
linear muffin-tin orbital method. The experimental studies consist of
high-pressure angle dispersive x-ray diffraction investigations of LaS and LaSe
up to a maximum pressure of 41 GPa. A structural phase transition from the NaCl
type to CsCl type crystal structure is found to occur in all cases. The
experimental transition pressures are 27-28 GPa and 19 GPa, for LaS and LaSe,
respectively, while the calculated transition pressures are 29 GPa, 21 GPa and
10 GPa for LaS, LaSe and LaTe, respectively. The calculated ground state
properties such as equilibrium lattice constant, bulk modulus and its pressure
derivative, and Debye temperatures are in good agreement with experimental
results. Elastic constants are predicted from the calculations.
