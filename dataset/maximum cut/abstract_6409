We generalize the static model by assigning a q-component weight on each
vertex. We first choose a component $(\mu)$ among the q components at random
and a pair of vertices is linked with a color $\mu$ according to their weights
of the component $(\mu)$ as in the static model. A (1-f) fraction of the entire
edges is connected following this way. The remaining fraction f is added with
(q+1)-th color as in the static model but using the maximum weights among the q
components each individual has. This model is motivated by social networks. It
exhibits similar topological features to real social networks in that: (i) the
degree distribution has a highly skewed form, (ii) the diameter is as small as
and (iii) the assortativity coefficient r is as positive and large as those in
real social networks with r reaching a maximum around $f \approx 0.2$.
