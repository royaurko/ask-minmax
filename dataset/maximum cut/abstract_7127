The conditional maximum-entropy method (abbreviated here as C-MaxEnt) is
formulated for selecting prior probability distributions in Bayesian statistics
for parameter estimation. This method is inspired by a statistical-mechanical
approach to systems governed by dynamics with largely-separated time scales and
is based on three key concepts: conjugate pairs of variables, dimensionless
integration measures with coarse-graining factors and partial maximization of
the joint entropy. The method enables one to calculate a prior purely from a
likelihood in a simple way. It is shown in particular how it not only yields
Jeffreys's rules but also reveals new structures hidden behind them.
