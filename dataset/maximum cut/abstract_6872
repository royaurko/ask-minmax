We present the spin wave theory of XY model with anisotropic nearest
neighbour (NN) interactions $J(J^{\prime})$ along the $x(y)$ directions, next
nearest (NNN) neighbour interaction $J_D$ and the ring exchange interaction $K$
on the square lattice. We calculate the thermodynamic quantities: Zero
temperature spin stiffness, internal energy, specific heat and the
magnetization. Using the diagonalized Hamiltonian, we show that no soft modes
develop when $\eta + \lambda >0 $, where $\eta = J^{\prime}/J$ and $\lambda =
K/J$. We further show that anisotropy ($\eta =2$) decreases the spin stiffness
by 5.7% of its isotropic ($\eta =1$) maximum value for some values of $\lambda$
and $\delta = J_D/J$. A similar reduction shows up in the magnetization. The
plot of the stiffness against $\eta (\lambda)$ reaches a maximum at
$\eta=0(\lambda =0)$ for specific values of $\delta$ and decreases rapidly as
it approaches $\eta + \lambda + 1=0$. In general, the supersolid phase
transition suggested earlier\cite{H} will occur in the regime $\eta + \lambda
+1 <0$.
