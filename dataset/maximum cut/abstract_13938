Electron-electron scattering usually dominates the transport in strongly
correlated materials. It typically leads to pronounced resistivity maxima in
the incoherent regime around the coherence temperature $T^{*}$, reflecting the
tendency of carriers to undergo Mott localization following the demise of the
Fermi liquid. This behavior is best pronounced in the vicinity of
interaction-driven (Mott-like) metal-insulator transitions, where the $T^{*}$
decreases, while the resistivity maximum $\rho_{max}$ increases. Here we show
that, in this regime, the entire family of resistivity curves displays a
characteristic scaling behavior $\rho(T)/\rho_{max}\approx F(T/T_{max}),$ while
the $\rho_{max}$ and $T_{max}\sim T^{*}$ assume a powerlaw dependence on the
quasi-particle effective mass $m^{*}$. Remarkably, precisely such trends are
found from an appropriate scaling analysis of experimental data obtained from
diluted two-dimensional electron gases in zero magnetic fields. Our analysis
provides strong evidence that inelastic electron-electron scattering -- and not
disorder effects -- dominates finite temperature transport in these systems,
validating the Wigner-Mott picture of the two-dimensional metal-insulator
transition.
