The central solar temperature T and its uncertainties are calculated in
helioseismologically-constrained solar models. From the best fit to the
convective radius, density at the convective radius and seismically determined
helium abundance the central temperature is found to be T=1.58x10^7 K, in
excellent agreement with Standard Solar Models. Conservatively, we estimate
that the accuracy of this determination is Delta T/T=1.4 %, better than that in
SSM. Neutrino fluxes are calculated. The lower limit to the boron neutrino
flux, obtained with maximum reduction factors from all sources of
uncertainties, is 2 sigma higher than the flux measured recently by
SuperKamiokande.
