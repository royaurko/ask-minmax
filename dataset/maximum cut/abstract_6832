A pure nucleonic equation of state (EoS) for beta equilibrated charge neutral
neutron star (NS) matter is determined using density dependent effective NN
interaction. This EoS is found to satisfy both the constraints from the
observed mass-radius of neutron stars and flow data from heavy-ion collisions.
Recent observations of the binary millisecond pulsar J1614-2230 by P. B.
Demorest et al. [1] suggest that the masses lie within (1.97\pm 0.04) M_\odot
(M_\odot, solar mass). Most EoS involving exotic matter, such as kaon
condensates or hyperons, tend to predict maximum masses well below 2.0M_\odot
and are therefore ruled out. We are able to reproduce the measured mass-radius
relationship for rotating and static NS. We ensure that the star rotating not
faster than the frequency limited by r-mode instability gives the maximum mass
about 1.95M_\odot with radius about 10 kilometer.
