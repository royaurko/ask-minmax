The nearby BL Lacertae (BL Lac) object Markarian~421 (Mkn~421) at a red shift
z=0.031 was observed to undergo strong TeV Gamma-ray outbursts in the
observational periods from December 1999 until May 2001. The time averaged
energy spectrum is well described by a power law with an exponential cut-off
energy at 3.6(+0.4-0.3)_{stat}(+0.9-0.8)_{sys} TeV.
  The energy spectra derived for different average flux levels ranging from 0.5
to 10 * 10^{-11}ph/cm**2/s follow a clear correlation of photon index and flux
level.
  Generally, the energy spectra are harder for high flux levels. From January
to April 2001 Mkn~421 showed rapid variability (doubling time as short as 20
minutes), accompanied with a spectral hardening with increasing flux level
within individual nights.
  For two successive nights (MJD 51989-51991, March 21-23,2001), this
correlation of spectral hardness and change in flux has been observed within a
few hours. The cut-off energy for the Mkn~421 TeV spectrum remains within the
errors constant for the different flux levels and differs by
2.6+/-0.6_stat+/-0.6_sys TeV from the value determined for Mkn~501. This
indicates that the observed exponential cut-off in the energy spectrum of
Mkn~421 is not solely caused by absorption of multi-TeV photons by
pair-production processes with photons of the extragalactic near/mid infrared
background radiation.
