Transverse momentum spectra of protons and anti-protons measured in the
rapidity range 0<y<3.1 from 0-10% central Au+Au collisions at sqrt{s_{NN}}=62.4
GeV are presented. The rapidity densities, dN/dy, of protons, anti-protons and
net-protons N()p-N(pbar) have been deduced from the spectra over a rapidity
range wide enough to observe the expected maximum net-baryon density. From
mid-rapidity to y=1 the net-proton yield is roughly constant (dN/dy ~ 10),but
rises to dN/dy ~25 at 2.3<y<3.1. The mean rapidity loss is 2.01 +-0.16 units
from beam rapidity. The measured rapidity distributions are compared to model
predictions. Systematics of net-baryon distributions and rapidity loss vs.
collision energy are discussed.
