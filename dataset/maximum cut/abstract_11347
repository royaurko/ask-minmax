Using eigenmode expansion of the Mark-3 and SFI surveys of cosmological
radial velocities a goodness-of-fit analysis is applied on a mode-by-mode
basis. This differential analysis complements theBayesian maximum likelihood
analysis that finds the most probable model given the data. Analyzing the
surveys with their corresponding most likely models from the CMB-like family of
models, as well as with the currently popular Lambda-CDM model, reveals a
systematic inconsistency of the data with these `best' models. There is a
systematic trend of the cumulative chi^2 to increase with the mode number
(where the modes are sorted by decreasing order of the eigenvalues). This
corresponds to a decrease of the chi^2 with the variance associated with a
mode, and hence with its effective scale. It follows that the differential
analysis finds that on small (large) scales the global analysis of all the
modes `puts' less (more) power than actually required by the data. This
observed trend might indicate one of the followings: a. The theoretical model
(i.e. power spectrum) or the error model (or both) have an excess of power on
large scales; b. Velocity bias; c. The velocity data suffers from still
uncorrected systematic errors.
