A toy model based upon the $q$-deformation description for studying the
radiation spectrum of black hole is proposed. The starting point is to make an
attempt to consider the spacetime noncommutativity in the vicinity of black
hole horizon. We use a trick that all the spacetime noncommutative effects are
ascribed to the modification of the behavior of the radiation field of black
hole and a kind of q-deformed degrees of freedom are postulated to mimic the
radiation particles that live on the noncommutative spacetime, meanwhile the
background metric is preserved as usual. We calculate the radiation spectrum of
Schwarzschild black hole in this framework. The new distribution deviates from
the standard thermal spectrum evidently. The result indicates that some
correlation effect will be introduced to the system if the noncommutativity is
taken into account. In addition, an infrared cut-off of the spectrum is the
prediction of the model.
