We are reporting the dielectric response of La1.5Sr0.5NiO4, a system that
presents a charge-ordered state above room temperature and a rearrangement of
its charge-order pattern in the temperature region 160-200 K. A careful
analysis of the role of the electric contacts used, sample thickness and grain
size on the experimental data allows us to determine that this material
exhibits high values of intrinsic dielectric constant. The variation of the
dielectric constant with temperature shows a maximum in the region of the
rearrangement of the charge-order pattern, which constitutes an evidence of the
link between both phenomena.
