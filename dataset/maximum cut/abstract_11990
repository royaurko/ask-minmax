In nonextensive statistical mechanics, two kinds of definitions have been
considered for expectation valu of a physical quantity: one is the ordinary
definition and the other is the normalized q-expectation value employing the
escort distribution. Since both of them lead to the maximum-Tsallis-entropy
distributions of a similar type, it is of crucial importance to determine which
the correct physical one is. A point is that the definition of expectation
value is indivisibly connected to the form of generalized relative entropy.
Studying the properties of the relative entropies associated with these two
definitions, it is shown how the use of the escort distribution is essential.
In particular, the axiomatic framework proposed by Shore and Johnson is found
to support the formalism with the normalized q-expectation value and to exclude
the ordinary expectation value in nonextensive statistical mechanics.
