Criterion for contacting is critically important for the Generalized
Interpolation Material Point(GIMP) method. We present an improved criterion by
adding a switching function. With the method dynamical response of high melting
explosive(HMX) with cavities under shock is investigated. The physical model
used in the present work is an elastic-to-plastic and thermal-dynamical model
with Mie-Gr\"uneissen equation of state. We mainly concern the influence of
various parameters, including the impacting velocity $v$, cavity size $R$, etc,
to the dynamical and thermodynamical behaviors of the material. For the
colliding of two bodies with a cavity in each, a secondary impacting is
observed. Correspondingly, the separation distance $D$ of the two bodies has a
maximum value $D_{\max}$ in between the initial and second impacts. When the
initial impacting velocity $v$ is not large enough, the cavity collapses in a
nearly symmetric fashion, the maximum separation distance $D_{\max}$ increases
with $v$. When the initial shock wave is strong enough to collapse the cavity
asymmetrically along the shock direction, the variation of $D_{\max}$ with $v$
does not show monotonic behavior. Our numerical results show clear indication
that the existence of cavities in explosive helps the creation of ``hot
spots''.
