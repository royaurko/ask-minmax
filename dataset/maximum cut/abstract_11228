We report on hard X-ray observations of X-ray Nova Velorum 1993 (GRS 1009-45)
performed with the SIGMA coded mask X-ray telescope in January 1994. The source
was clearly detected with a flux of about 60 mCrab in the 40-150 keV energy
band during the two observations with a hard spectrum (alpha ~ - 1.9) extending
up to ~ 150 keV. These observations confirm the duration of the activity of the
source in hard X-rays over 100 days after the first maximum and suggest a
spectral hardening which has already been observed in Nova Muscae. These and
other characteristics found in these observations strengthen the case for this
Nova to be a black hole candidate similar to Nova Muscae.
