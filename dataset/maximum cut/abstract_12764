When Fischler and Susskind proposed a holographic prescription based on the
Particle Horizon, they found that spatially closed cosmological models do not
verify it due to the apparently unavoidable recontraction of the Particle
Horizon area. In this article, after a short review of their original work, we
expose graphically and analytically that spatially closed cosmological models
can avoid this problem if they expand fast enough. It has been also shown that
the Holographic Principle is saturated for a codimension one brane dominated
Universe. The Fischler-Susskind prescription is used to obtain the maximum
number of degrees of freedom per Planck volume at the Planck era compatible
with the Holographic Principle.
