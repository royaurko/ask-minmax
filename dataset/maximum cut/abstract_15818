Magnetic connections to the plunging region can exert stresses on the inner
edge of an accretion disk around a black hole. We recompute the relativistic
corrections to the thin-disk dynamics equations when these stresses take the
form of a time-steady torque on the inner edge of the disk. The additional
dissipation associated with these stresses is concentrated relatively close
outside the marginally stable orbit, scaling as r to the -7/2 at large radius.
As a result of these additional stresses: spin-up of the central black hole is
retarded; the maximum spin-equilibrium accretion efficiency is 36%, and occurs
at a/M=0.94; the disk spectrum is extended toward higher frequencies; line
profiles (such as Fe K-alpha) are broadened if the line emissivity scales with
local flux; limb-brightening, especially at the higher frequencies, is
enhanced; and the returning radiation fraction is substantially increased, up
to 58%. This last effect creates possible explanations for both synchronized
continuum fluctuations in AGN, and polarization rises shortward of the Lyman
edge in quasars. We show that no matter what additional stresses occur, when
a/M < 0.36, the second law of black hole dynamics sets an absolute upper bound
on the accretion efficiency.
