We present a catalog of 93 very-well-observed nova light curves. The light
curves were constructed from 229,796 individual measured magnitudes, with the
median coverage extending to 8.0 mag below peak and 26% of the light curves
following the eruption all the way to quiescence. Our time-binned light curves
are presented in figures and as complete tabulations. We also calculate and
tabulate many properties about the light curves, including peak magnitudes and
dates, times to decline by 2, 3, 6, and 9 magnitudes from maximum, the time
until the brightness returns to quiescence, the quiescent magnitude, power law
indices of the decline rates throughout the eruption, the break times in this
decline, plus many more properties specific to each nova class. We present a
classification system for nova light curves based on the shape and the time to
decline by 3 magnitudes from peak (t3). The designations are S for smooth light
curves (38% of the novae), P for plateaus (21%), D for dust dips (18%), C for
cusp-shaped secondary maxima (1%), O for quasi-sinusoidal oscillations
superposed on an otherwise smooth decline (4%), F for flat-topped light curves
(2%), and J for jitters or flares superposed on the decline (16%). Our
classification consists of this single letter followed by the t3 value in
parentheses; so for example V1500 Cyg is S(4), GK Per is O(13), DQ Her is
D(100), and U Sco is P(3).
