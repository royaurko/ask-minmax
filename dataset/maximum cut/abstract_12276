In this paper, the real scalar field equation in Schwarzschild-de Sitter
spacetime is solved numerically with high precision. A method called polynomial
approximation is introduced to derive the relation between the tortoise
coordinate x and the radius r. This method is di&#64256;erent from the tangent
approximation [1] and leads to more accurate result. The Nariai black hole is
then discussed in details. We find that the wave function is harmonic only near
the horizons as I. Brevik and B. Simonsen [1] found. Howerver the wave function
is not harmonic in the region of the potential peak, with amplitude increasing
instead. Furthermore, we also find that, when cosmological constant decreases,
the potential peak increases, and the maximum wave amplitude increases.
