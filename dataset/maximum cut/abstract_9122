We characterize the optimal correlative capacity of entangled, separable, and
classically correlated states. Introducing the notions of the infimum and
supremum within majorization theory, we construct the least disordered
separable state compatible with a set of marginals. The maximum separable
correlation information supportable by the marginals of a multi-qubit pure
state is shown to be an LOCC monotone. The least disordered composite of a pair
of qubits is found for the above classes, with classically correlated states
defined as diagonal in the product of marginal bases.
