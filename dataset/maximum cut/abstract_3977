Radio surveys at frequencies of about 1 GHz allow to map the synchrotron
emission in a frequency range where (except for very low Galactic latitudes or
towards localized regions) it dominates over the other radio components. New
all sky total intensity and polarization data at 1.4 GHz have been recently
collected. We focus on the Galactic radio emission correlation properties
described in terms of angular power spectrum (APS). We present for the first
time the APS, in both total intensity and polarization modes, for some
representative Galactic cuts and suitable APS power law parametrizations.
