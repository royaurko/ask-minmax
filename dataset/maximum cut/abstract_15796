We report on the mass-to-light ratio determination based on a newly selected
binary galaxy sample, which includes a large number of pairs whose separations
exceed a few hundred kpc. The probability distributions of the projected
separation and the velocity difference have been calculated considering the
contamination of optical pairs, and the mass-to-light ratio has been determined
based on the maximum likelihood method. The best estimate of $M/L$ in the B
band for 57 pairs is found to be 28 $\sim$ 36 depending on the orbital
parameters and the distribution of optical pairs (solar unit, $H_0=50$ km
s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$). The best estimate of $M/L$ for 30 pure spiral pairs is
found to be 12 $\sim$ 16. These results are relatively smaller than those
obtained in previous studies, but consistent with each other within the errors.
Although the number of pairs with large separation is significantly increased
compared to previous samples, $M/L$ does not show any tendency of increase, but
found to be almost independent of the separation of pairs beyond 100 kpc. The
constancy of $M/L$ beyond 100 kpc may indicate that the typical halo size of
spiral galaxies is less than $\sim 100$ kpc.
