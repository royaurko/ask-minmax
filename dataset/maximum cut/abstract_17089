This paper presents new CCD BVRI light curves of the newly discovered RS CVn
eclipsing binary V1034 Her in 2009 and 2010, which shapes are different from
the previous published results. They show asymmetric outside eclipse and we try
to use a spot model to explain the phenomena. Using the Wilson-Devinney program
with one-spot or two-spots model, photometric solutions of the system and
starspot parameters were derived. Comparing the two results, it shows that the
case of two spots is better successful in reproducing the light-curve
distortions. For all the spot longitudes, it suggests that the trend towards
active longitude belts and each active longitude belts might be switch.
Comparing the light curves of 2009 and 2010, it indicates that the light curve
changes on a long time scale of one year, especially in phase 0.25. In
addition, we also collected the values of the maximum amplitudes of photometric
distortion of the short-period RS CVn binary. We found for the first time that
there is a trend of increasing activity with decreasing the orbital period.
Finally, fitting all available light minimum times including our newly obtained
ones with polynomial function confirmed that the orbital period of V1034
underwent up increase.
