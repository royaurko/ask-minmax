Low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the local density of
states of the organic superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br,
that was cut in-situ in ultra-high vacuum perpendicular to the superconducting
BEDT-TTF layers. The spectra confirm that superconductivity is confined to the
conducting BEDT-TTF layers, while the Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br anion layers are
insulating. The density of states comprises a twofold superconducting gap,
which is attributed to the two separated bands crossing the Fermi surface.
