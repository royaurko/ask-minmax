The two- and three-nucleon interaction derived in chiral effective field
theory at next-to-next-to-leading order is used to obtain the binding energy of
nuclear matter. Saturation is found at a binding energy per particle E/A =
-16.2 \pm 0.3 MeV and a Fermi momentum k_F = 1.30 \pm 0.03 fm^{-1}, where the
uncertainty is due to the cut-off dependence of the two-nucleon interaction.
The sensitivity of these values to the three-nucleon force is also studied.
