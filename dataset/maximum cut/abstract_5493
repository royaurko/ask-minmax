The one-loop self-energy of the $D$ and $D^*$ mesons in a hot hadronic medium
is evaluated using the real time formalism of thermal field theory. The
interaction of the heavy open-charm mesons with the thermalized constituents
$(\pi,K,\eta)$ of the hadronic matter is treated in the covariant formalism of
heavy meson chiral perturbation theory. The imaginary parts are extracted from
the discontinuities of the self-energy function across the unitary and the
Landau cuts. The non-zero contribution from the latter to the spectral density
of $D$ and $D^*$ mesons opens a number of subthreshold decay channels of the
$J/\psi$ leading to a significant increase in the dissociation width in
hadronic matter.
