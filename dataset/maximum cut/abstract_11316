We introduce a multipolar scheme for describing the structure of stationary,
axisymmetric, force-free black-hole magnetospheres in the ``3+1'' formalism. We
focus here on Schwarzschild spacetime, giving a complete classification of the
separable solutions of the stream equation. We show a transparent term-by-term
analogy of our solutions with the familiar multipoles of flat-space
electrodynamics. We discuss electrodynamic processes around disk-fed black
holes in which our solutions find natural applications: (a) ``interior''
solutions in studies of the Blandford-Znajek process of extracting the hole's
rotational energy, and of the formation of relativistic jets in active galactic
nuclei and ``microquasars'', and, (b) ``exterior'' solutions in studies of
accretion disk dynamos, disk-driven winds and jets. On the strength of existing
numerical studies, we argue that the poloidal field structures found here are
also expected to hold with good accuracy for rotating black holes, except for
maximum possible rotation rates. We show that the closed-loop exterior
solutions found here are not in contradiction with the Macdonald-Thorne
theorem, since these solutions, which diverge logarithmically on the hole's
horizon $\cal H$, apply only to those regions which exclude $\cal H$.
