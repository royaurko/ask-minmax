Effect of He ion irradiation on three model Fe(100-x)Cr(x) alloys (x =5.8,
10.75 and 15.15) was investigated with the conversion electron M\"ossbauer
spectroscopy. The study of the alloys irradiated with 25 keV ions revealed that
the strongest effect occured in the Fe(84.85)Cr(15.15) sample where an
inversion of a short-range-order (SRO) parameter was found. Consequently, the
investigation of the influence of the irradiation dose, D, was carried out on
the chromium-most concentrated sample showing that the average hyperfine field,
<B>, the average angle between the normal to the sample's surface and the
magnetization vector, <theta>, as well as the actual distribution of Fe/Cr
atoms, as expressed by SRO parameters, strongly depend on D. In particular: (a)
<B> increases with D, and its maximum increase corresponds to a decrease of Cr
content within the two-shell volume around the probe 57Fe nuclei by ~2.3 at%,
<theta> decreases by ~13 degree at maximum, (c) SRO-parameter averaged over the
two-shell volume increases with D from weakly negative value (indicative of Cr
atoms clustering) to weakly positive value (indicative of Cr atoms ordering).
The inversion takes place at D ca. 7 dpa.
