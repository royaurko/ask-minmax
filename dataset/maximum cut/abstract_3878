We have derived accurate and homogeneous Lithium abundances in 49 main
sequence binary systems belonging to the Hyades Open Cluster by using a
deconvolution method to determine individual magnitudes and colors for the
primary and secondary components of the binary. The input parameters of the
model are the observed Li equivalent width, the actual distance to the binary,
the integrated apparent magnitude and the integrated colors of the binaries
-BV(RI)_K. We show that the general behavior is the same in binaries and in
single stars (Li is depleted faster in K stars than in G stars and there is a
deep dip for mid-F stars). However, there is a larger scatter in the abundances
of binary systems than in single stars. Moreover, in general, binary systems
have an overabundance, which is more conspicuous in close binaries. In fact,
there is a cut-off period, which can be estimated as P(orb)~9 d. This value is
in excellent agreement with the theoretical predition of Zahn (1994).
