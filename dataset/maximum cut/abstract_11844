The current work reports on the elastic shear moduli, internal friction, and
the specific heat of the B2 cubic ordered alloy AuZn as a function of
temperature. Measurements were made on single-crystal and polycrystalline
samples using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS), semi-adiabatic
calorimetry and stress-strain measurements. Our results confirm that this alloy
exhibits the shape-memory effect and a phase transition at 64.75 K that appears
to be continuous (second-order) from the specific heat data. It is argued that
the combination of equiatomic composition and a low transformation temperature
constrain the chemical potential and its derivatives to exhibit behavior that
lies at the borderline between that of a first-order (discontinuous) and a
continuous phase transition. The acoustic dissipation does not peak at the
transtion temperature as expected, but shows a maximum well into the
low-temperature phase. The Debye temeprature value of 219 K, obtained from the
low-temperature specific heat data is in favorable agreement with that
determined from the acoustic data (207 K) above the transition.
