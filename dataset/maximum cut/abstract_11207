We have studied the effect of gravitational lensing on the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) anisotropy in flat and open universes. We develop a formalism
to calculate the changes on the radiation power spectrum induced by lensing in
the Newtonian and synchronous-comoving gauges. The previously considered
negligible contribution to the CMB radiation power spectrum of the anisotropic
term of the lensing correlation is shown to be appreciable. However,
considering the nonlinear evolution of the matter power spectrum produces only
slight differences on the results based on linear evolution. The general
conclusion for flat as well as open universes is that lensing slightly smoothes
the radiation power spectrum. For a given range of multipoles the effect of
lensing increases with Omega but for the same acoustic peak it decreases with
$\Omega$. The maximum contribution of lensing to the radiation power spectrum
for $l\leq 2000$ is $\sim$ 5% for $\Omega$ values in the range 0.1-1.
