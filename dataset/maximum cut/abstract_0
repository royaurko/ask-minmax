We prove that there is a constant $c >0$, such that whenever $p \ge n^{-c}$,
with probability tending to 1 when $n$ goes to infinity, every maximum
triangle-free subgraph of the random graph $G_{n,p}$ is bipartite. This answers
a question of Babai, Simonovits and Spencer (Journal of Graph Theory, 1990).
  The proof is based on a tool of independent interest: we show, for instance,
that the maximum cut of almost all graphs with $M$ edges, where $M >> n$, is
``nearly unique''. More precisely, given a maximum cut $C$ of $G_{n,M}$, we can
obtain all maximum cuts by moving at most $O(\sqrt{n^3/M})$ vertices between
the parts of $C$.
