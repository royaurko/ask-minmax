A fission decay of highly excited periodically driven compound nuclei is
considered in the framework of Langevin approach. We have used residual-time
distribution (RTD) as the tool for studying of dynamic features in a presence
of periodic perturbation. The structure of RTD essentially depends on the
relation between Kramers decay rate and the frequency of the periodic
perturbation. In particular, intensity of the first peak in RTD has a sharp
maximum at certain nuclear temperature depending on the frequency of the
periodic perturbation. This maximum should be considered as first-hand
manifestation of stochastic resonance in nuclear dynamics.
