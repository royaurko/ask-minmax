Boolean networks with canalizing functions are used to model gene regulatory
networks. In order to learn how such networks may behave under evolutionary
forces, we simulate the evolution of a single Boolean network by means of an
adaptive walk, which allows us to explore the fitness landscape. Mutations
change the connections and the functions of the nodes. Our fitness criterion is
the robustness of the dynamical attractors against small perturbations. We find
that with this fitness criterion the global maximum is always reached and that
there is a huge neutral space of 100% fitness. Furthermore, in spite of having
such a high degree of robustness, the evolved networks still share many
features with "chaotic" networks.
