A concrete model which can suppress FCNCs and CP violating phenomena is
suggested. It is an $S_3$ symmetric extension of the MSSM in extra dimensions,
where only SU(2) and SU(3) gauge multiplets are assumed to propagate in the
bulk. They are suppressed due to $S_3$ flavor symmetry at $M_{SUSY}$, and the
infrared attractive force of gauge interactions in extra dimensions are used to
suppress them at the compactification scale. We find that O(1) disorders of the
soft parameters are allowed at the cut-off scale to suppress sufficiently FCNCs
and CP violating phenomena.
