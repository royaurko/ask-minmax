A graph is pseudo-outerplanar if each of its blocks has an embedding in the
plane so that the vertices lie on a fixed circle and the edges lie inside the
disk of this circle with each of them crossing at most one another. In this
paper, the total coloring conjecture is completely confirmed for
pseudo-outerplanar graphs. In particular, it is proved that the total chromatic
number of every pseudo-outerplanar graph with maximum degree $\Delta\geq 5$ is
$\Delta+1$.
