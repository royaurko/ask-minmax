The control of the optical quality of a laser beam requires a complex
amplitude measurement able to deal with strong modulus variations and
potentially highly perturbed wavefronts. The method proposed here consists in
an extension of phase diversity to complex amplitude measurements that is
effective for highly perturbed beams. Named CAMELOT for Complex Amplitude
MEasurement by a Likelihood Optimization Tool, it relies on the acquisition and
processing of few images of the beam section taken along the optical path. The
complex amplitude of the beam is retrieved from the images by the minimization
of a Maximum a Posteriori error metric between the images and a model of the
beam propagation. The analytical formalism of the method and its experimental
validation are presented. The modulus of the beam is compared to a measurement
of the beam profile, the phase of the beam is compared to a conventional phase
diversity estimate. The precision of the experimental measurements is
investigated by numerical simulations.
