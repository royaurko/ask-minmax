A new method is presented to obtain a non-parametric maximum likelihood
estimate of the luminosity function and the selection function of a flux
limited redshift survey. The method parameterizes the selection function as a
series of step-wise power laws and allows possible evolution of the luminosity
function. We also propose a new technique to estimate the rate of evolution of
the luminosity function. This is based on a minimization of the observed
large-scale power with respect to the evolutionary model. We use an ensemble of
mock surveys extracted from a N-body simulation to verify the power of this
method.
  We apply our estimators to the 1.2-Jy survey of IRAS galaxies. We find a
far-infrared luminosity function in good agreement with previously published
results and evidence for rather strong evolution. If the comoving number
density of IRAS galaxies is assumed to scale proportional to (1+z)^P, we
estimate P=4.3 +/- 1.4 +/-1.
