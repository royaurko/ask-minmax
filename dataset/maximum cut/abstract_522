We study the ABDK relation using maximal cuts of one- and two-loop integrals
with up to five external legs. We show how to find a special combination of
integrals that allows the relation to exist, and how to reconstruct the terms
with one-loop integrals squared. The reconstruction relies on the observation
that integrals across different loop orders can have support on the same
generalized unitarity cuts and can share global poles. We discuss the
appearance of nonhomologous integration contours in multivariate residues.
Their origin can be understood in simple terms, and their existence enables us
to distinguish contributions from different integrals. Our analysis suggests
that maximal and near-maximal cuts can be used to infer the existence of
integral identities more generally.
