The parton model for semileptonic B meson decays is studied with special
attention to the decay distributions. We find that the spectra show dramatic
variations when we introduce cuts on the hadronic energy or invariant mass of
hadrons. Results for both $b\rightarrow u$ and $b\rightarrow c$ decays are
presented. The detailed spectra may help to separate the two types of decays.
