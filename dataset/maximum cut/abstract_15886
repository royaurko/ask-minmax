We report the results of spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of 8 different
ASCA pointings distributed symmetrically around the center of the Perseus
cluster. The outer region of the intracluster gas is roughly isothermal, with
temperature ~6-7 keV, and metal abundance ~ 0.3 Solar. Spectral analysis of the
central pointing is consistent with the presence of a cooling flow and a
central metal abundance gradient.
  A significant velocity gradient is found along an axis highly discrepant with
the major axis of the X-ray elongation. The radial velocity difference is found
to be greater than 1000 km/sMpc at the 90% confidence level. Simultaneous
fittings of GIS 2 & 3 indicate that two symmetrically opposed regions have
different radial velocities at the 95% confidence level and the F-test rules
out constant velocities for these regions at the 99% level. Intrinsic short and
long term variations of gain are unlikely (P < 0.03) to explain the velocity
discrepancies. We also report the preliminary results of a similar analysis
carried out for the Centaurus cluster, where long-exposure SIS data is
available. We also find a significant velocity gradient near the central
regions (3'-8') of Centaurus. If attributed to bulk rotation the correspondent
circular velocity is ~1500+-150km/s (at 90% confidence). The line of maximum
velocity gradient in Centaurus is near-perpendicular to the infalling galaxy
group associated with NGC 4709.
