Precise measurements of the radio emission by cosmic ray air showers require
an adequate treatment of noise. Unlike to usual experiments in particle
physics, where noise always adds to the signal, radio noise can in principle
decrease or increase the signal if it interferes by chance destructively or
constructively. Consequently, noise cannot simply be subtracted from the
signal, and its influence on amplitude and time measurement of radio pulses
must be studied with care. First, noise has to be determined consistently with
the definition of the radio signal which typically is the maximum field
strength of the radio pulse. Second, the average impact of noise on radio pulse
measurements at individual antennas is studied for LOPES. It is shown that a
correct treatment of noise is especially important at low signal-to-noise
ratios: noise can be the dominant source of uncertainty for pulse height and
time measurements, and it can systematically flatten the slope of lateral
distributions. The presented method can also be transfered to other experiments
in radio and acoustic detection of cosmic rays and neutrinos.
