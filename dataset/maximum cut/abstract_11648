The successful detection is reported of radial-velocity variations due to
orbital motion of the substellar companion of the star tau Bootis, from data
obtained with a small aperture (0.4m) telescope and a fibre-fed high-resolution
spectrograph. Radial-velocity observations from observing runs in 2000 and 2004
reveal a periodic variation of 3.30 +/-0.02d, which is consistent with the
previously determined value of 3.3125 +/-0.0002d. We fit our data to a circular
orbit with the known period, and derive a velocity amplitude of 471 +/-10m s-1
(in agreement with the previously published value of 469 +/-5m s-1), and
determine a time of maximum velocity (Tmax) of HJD 2453113.95 +/-0.01. These
observations explore the minimum system requirements for precise
radial-velocity measurements.
