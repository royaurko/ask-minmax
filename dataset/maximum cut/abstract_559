Recently Javanainen and Wilkens [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 4675 (1997)] have
analysed an experiment in which an interacting Bose condensate, after being
allowed to form in a single potential well, is "cut" by splitting the well
adiabatically with a very high potential barrier, and estimate the rate at
which, following the cut, the two halves of the condensate lose the "memory" of
their relative phase. We argue that, by neglecting the effect of interactions
in the initial state before the separation, they have overestimated the rate of
phase randomization by a numerical factor which grows with the interaction
strength and with the slowness of the separation process.
