X-ray resonant scattering has been used to measure the magnetic order of the
Dy ions below 40K in multiferroic DyMn$_{2}$O$_{5}$. The magnetic order has a
complex behaviour. There are several different ordering wavevectors, both
incommensurate and commensurate, as the temperature is varied. In addition a
non-magnetic signal at twice the wavevector of one of the commensurate signals
is observed, the maximum intensity of which occurs at the same temperature as a
local maximum in the ferroelectric polarisation. Some of the results, which
bear resemblence to the behaviour of other members of the RMn$_{2}$O$_{5}$
family of multiferroic materials, may be explained by a theory based on
so-called acentric spin-density waves.
