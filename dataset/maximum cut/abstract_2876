We consider the spectrum of the evolution operator for bound chaotic systems
by evaluating its trace. This trace is known to approach unity as $t
\rightarrow \infty$ for bound systems. It is written as the Fourier transform
of the logaritmic derivative of a zeta function whose zeros are identified with
the eigenvalues of the operator. Zeta functions are expected to be entire only
for very specific systems, like Axiom-A systems. For bound chaotic systems
complications arise due to e.g. intermittency and non completeness of the
symbolic dynamics. For bound intermittent system an approximation of the zeta
function is derived. It is argued that bound systems with {\em long time tails}
have branch cuts in the zeta function and traces approaching unity as a
powerlaw. Another feature of bound chaotic systems, relevant for the
asymptotics of the trace, is that the dominant time scale can be much longer
than the period of the shortest periodic orbit. This the case for e.g. the
hyperbola billiard. Isolated zeros of the zeta function for the hyperbola
billiard are evaluated by means of a cycle expansion. Crucial for the success
of this approach is the identification of a sequence of periodic orbit
responsible for a logarithmic branch cut in the zeta function. Semiclassical
implications are discussed at the end.
