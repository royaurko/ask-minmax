In this paper the impact of the strength of hyperon-nucleon and
hyperon-hyperon on the maximum neutron star mass is shown. The strong
hyperon-hyperon coupling constant together with the additional nonlinear meson
interaction terms lead to the essential softening of the equation of state and
to the existence of another more compact branch of stable neutron star
configurations. The analysis of the mass-radius relations leads to the
conclusion that the additional stable configurations of hyperon-rich neutron
stars are characterized by the reduced value of radii.
