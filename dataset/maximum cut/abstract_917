In this paper the maximum likelihood equations for the parameters of the
Weight Lindley distribution are studied considering different types of
censoring, such as, type I, type II and random censoring mechanism. A numerical
simulation study is perform to evaluate the maximum likelihood estimates. The
proposed methodology is illustrated in a real data set.
