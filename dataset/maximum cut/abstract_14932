A major practical impediment when implementing adaptive dose-finding designs
is that the toxicity outcome used by the decision rules may not be observed
shortly after the initiation of the treatment. To address this issue, we
propose the data augmentation continual reassessment method (DA-CRM) for dose
finding. By naturally treating the unobserved toxicities as missing data, we
show that such missing data are nonignorable in the sense that the missingness
depends on the unobserved outcomes. The Bayesian data augmentation approach is
used to sample both the missing data and model parameters from their posterior
full conditional distributions. We evaluate the performance of the DA-CRM
through extensive simulation studies and also compare it with other existing
methods. The results show that the proposed design satisfactorily resolves the
issues related to late-onset toxicities and possesses desirable operating
characteristics: treating patients more safely and also selecting the maximum
tolerated dose with a higher probability. The new DA-CRM is illustrated with
two phase I cancer clinical trials.
