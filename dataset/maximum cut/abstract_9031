We compute the entropy reduction in feedback controlled systems due to the
repeated operation of the controller. This was the lacking ingredient to
establish the thermodynamics of these systems, and in particular of Maxwell's
demons. We illustrate some of the consequences of our general results by
deriving the maximum work that can be extracted from isothermal feedback
controlled systems. As a case example, we finally study a simple system that
performs an isothermal information-fueled particle pumping.
