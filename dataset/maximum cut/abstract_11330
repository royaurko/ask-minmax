We present new radio observations of the supernova SN 1979C made with the VLA
at 20, 6, 3.6, and 2 cm from 1991 July to 1998 October, which extend our
previously published observations (Weiler et al.1986, 1991), beginning 8 days
after optical maximum in 1979 April and continuing through 1990 December. We
find that the radio emission from SN 1979C has stopped declining in flux
density in the manner described by Weiler et al. (1992), and has apparently
entered a new stage of evolution. The observed ``flattening,'' or possible
brightening, of the radio light curves for SN 1979C is interpreted as due to
the SN shock wave entering a denser region of material near the progenitor star
and may be indicative of complex structure in the circumstellar medium
established by the stellar wind from the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor.
