The connection between SNe and GRBs, launched by SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 and
clinched by SN 2003dh/GRB 030329 -- with the two GRBs differing by a factor of
approximately 50000 in luminosity -- so far suggests a rough upper limit of ~
1-2 days for the delay between SN and GRB. Only four SNe have had nonnegligible
coverage in close coincidence with the initial explosion, near the UV shock
breakout: two Type II, and two Type Ic, SN 1999ex and SN 1998bw. For the
latter, only a hint of the minimum between the UV maximum and the radioactivity
bump served to help constrain the interval between SN and GRB. Swift GRB alerts
may provide the opportunity to study many SNe through the UV breakout phase:
GRB 980425 "look alikes" -- apparently nearby, low-luminosity, soft-spectrum,
long-lag GRBs -- accounted for half of BATSE bursts near threshold, and may
dominate the Swift yield near threshold, since it has sensitivity to lower
energies than did BATSE. The SN to GRB delay timescale should be better
constrained by prompt UV/optical observations alerted by these bursts.
Definitive delay measurements may be obtained if long-lag bursters are truly
nearby: The SNe/GRBs could emit gravitational radiation detectable by LIGO-II
if robust non-axisymmetric bar instabilities develop during core collapse,
and/or neutrino emission may be detectable as suggested by Meszaros et al.
