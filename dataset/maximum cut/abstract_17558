We investigate the Bose-Einstein condensation of fermionic pairs in three
different superfluid systems: ultracold and dilute atomic gases, bulk neutron
matter, and neutron stars. In the case of dilute gases made of fermionic atoms
the average distance between atoms is much larger than the effective radius of
the inter-atomic potential. Here the condensation of fermionic pairs is
analyzed as a function of the s-wave scattering length, which can be tuned in
experiments by using the technique of Feshbach resonances from a small and
negative value (corresponding to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) regime of
Cooper Fermi pairs) to a small and positive value (corresponding to the regime
of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of molecular dimers), crossing the
unitarity regime where the scattering length diverges. In the case of bulk
neutron matter the s-wave scattering length of neutron-neutron potential is
negative but fixed, and the condensate fraction of neutron-neutron pairs is
studied as a function of the total neutron density. Our results clearly show a
BCS-quasiunitary-BCS crossover by increasing the neutron density. Finally, in
the case of neutron stars, where again the neutron-neutron scattering length is
negative and fixed, we determine the condensate fraction as a function of the
distance from the center of the neutron star, finding that the maximum
condensate fraction appears in the crust of the neutron star.
