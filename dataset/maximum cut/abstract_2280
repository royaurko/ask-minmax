Single and double inclusive cross-sections for gluon jet production from
within the triple pomeron vertex are studied in the reggeized gluon technique.
It is shown that to satisfy the AGK rules the vertex has to be fully symmetric
in all four reggeized gluons which form the two final pomerons. The single
inclusive cross-sections are found for different cuttings of the triple pomeron
vertex. They sum into the expression obtained by Yu.Kovchegov and K.Tuchin in
the colour dipole picture. The found double inclusive cross-sections satisfy
the AGK rules.
