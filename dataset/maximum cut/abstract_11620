We present the latest determination of the X-ray (2-10 keV) AGN luminosity
function accounting for the selection effect due to X-ray absorption. The main
results are: 1) the inclusion of obscured AGN confirms the AGN differential
luminosity evolution, but makes it less extreme than what is found selecting
unobscured AGN in soft X-rays, and more similar to a pure luminosity evolution;
2) significant correlations are found between the fraction of obscured sources,
the luminosity and the redshift, this fraction increasing toward both low AGN
luminosities and high redshifts. We discuss our findings in a scenario for the
formation and evolution of the structure in the Universe where the bulk of
nuclear activity is produced at z=1-2. At the same redshifts also the
star-formation rate reaches a maximum, and this age can therefore be regarded
as the "golden age" for nuclear and galaxy activity. We discuss the current
observational limits of this program and the improvements needed to obtain an
unbiased census of the AGN and super-massive black hole (SMBH) population.
