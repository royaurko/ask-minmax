We report on an undergraduate student project initiated in the summer
semester of 2004 with the aim to establish equations of state for white dwarfs
and neutron stars for computing mass-radius relations as well as corresponding
maximum masses. First, white dwarfs are described by a Fermi gas model of
degenerate electrons and neutrons and effects from general relativity are
examined. For neutron star matter, the influence of a finite fraction of
protons and electrons and of strong nucleon-nucleon interactions are studied.
The nucleon--nucleon interactions are introduced within a Hartree-Fock scheme
using a Skyrme-type interaction. Finally, masses and radii of neutron stars are
computed for given central pressure.
