Unique data on $BVRI$ light curves of the optical transient (OT) of GRB
970508 obtained with the 6-m telescope have been interpreted in the framework
of the idea of a straightforward link between supernovae (SNe) and long
duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The effect must be maximum in the $I_{c}$
band as for OT GRB 970228. The peak absolute ($M_{B}$) magnitude of the
suggested SN must be around -19.5 for the OT of GRB 970508. So, in addition to
the characteristic "shoulders" on the light curves of the OTs of GRB 970228,
GRB 980326, 990712, 991208, more evidence of the link between GRBs and Type
Ib/c SNe (or core-collapse SNe) was found, which could be an argument in favor
of the idea of massive stars as progenitors of long duration GRBs. If all or
the main part of long duration GRBs are associated with the SNe, GRB host
galaxies (for ground-based observations, at least) must be dimmer than the peak
magnitude of a SN. If some GRB/SN relation really exists, and if all or at
least the main part of long duration GRBs are associated with SNe, then as a
consequence we have a very strong $\gamma$-ray beaming with a solid angle of up
to $\Omega_{beam} \sim (10^{-5} - 10^{-6})\cdot 4\pi$. Besides, the
observations of K$_{\alpha}$ lines of iron in the X-ray afterglow spectra of
GRBs (970508, 970828, 991216, 000214) and the observation of redshifted
absorption feature of neutral iron (7.1 keV) simultaneously with GRB 990705 are
also evidence in favor of massive stars -- progenitors of GRBs.
