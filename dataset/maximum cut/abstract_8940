This paper considers the issue of modeling fractional data observed in the
interval [0,1), (0,1] or [0,1]. Mixed continuous-discrete distributions are
proposed. The beta distribution is used to describe the continuous component of
the model since its density can have quite diferent shapes depending on the
values of the two parameters that index the distribution. Properties of the
proposed distributions are examined. Also, maximum likelihood and method of
moments estimation is discussed. Finally, practical applications that employ
real data are presented.
