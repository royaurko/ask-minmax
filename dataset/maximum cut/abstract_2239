Through two loop effective potential we demonstrate that the $\bar{MS}$
scheme of dimensional regularization and Jackiw's prescription in cut-off
regularization allow for the dynamical breaking solution in massless
$\lambda\phi^4$ theory, while the Coleman-Weinberg prescription does not. The
beta function of the broken phase is negative, like in the one loop effective
potential, but the UV fixed point is not zero, i.e., not an asymptotic freedom
solution, unlike the one loop case. Some related issues were briefly discussed.
