We establish some characterizations of elliptic hyperboloids (resp.,
ellipsoids) in the $(n+1)$-dimensional Euclidean space
  ${\Bbb E}^{n+1}$, using the $n$-dimensional area of the sections cut off by
hyperplanes and the $(n+1)$-dimensional volume of regions between parallel
hyperplanes. We also give a few characterizations of elliptic paraboloids in
the $(n+1)$-dimensional Euclidean space
  ${\Bbb E}^{n+1}$.
