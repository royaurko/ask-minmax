The complex shear modulus of solid $^4$He exhibits an anomaly in the same
temperature region where torsion oscillators show a change in period. We
propose that the observed stiffening of the shear modulus with decreasing
temperature can be well described by a viscoelastic component that possesses an
increasing relaxation time as temperature decreases. Since a glass is a
viscoelastic material, the response functions derived for a viscoelastic
material are identical to those obtained for a glassy component due to a time
delayed restoring back-action. By generalizing the viscoelastic equations for
stress and strain to a multiphase system of constituents, composed of patches
with different damping and relaxation properties, we predict that the maximum
change of the magnitude of the shear modulus and the maximum height of the
dissipation peak are independent of an applied external frequency. The same
response expressions allow us to calculate the temperature dependence of the
shear modulus' amplitude and dissipation. Finally, we demonstrate that a
Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relaxation time is in agreement with available
experimental data.
