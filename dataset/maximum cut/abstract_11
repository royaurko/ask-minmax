I show that the maximum entropy principle can be replaced by a more natural
assumption, that there exists a phenomenological function of entropy consistent
with the microscopic model. The requirement of existence provides then a unique
construction of the related probability density. I conclude the letter with an
axiomatic formulation of the notion of entropy, which is suitable for
exploration of the non-equilibrium phenomena.
