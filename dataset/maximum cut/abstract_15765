We test the hypothesis of Berthet (1992) which foresees that Am stars become
giant metallic A and F stars (defined by an enhanced value of the blanketing
parameter Delta_m_2 of the Geneva photometry) when they evolve.
  If this hypothesis is right, Am and metallic A-FIII stars need to have the
same rate of binaries and a similar distribution of vsini. From our new
spectroscopic data and from vsini and radial velocities in the literature, we
show that it is not the case. The metallic giant stars are often fast rotators
with vsini larger than 100 km/s, while the maximum rotational velocity for Am
stars is about 100 km/s. The rate of tight binaries with periods less than 1000
days is less than 30 percent among metallic giants, which is incompatible with
the value of 75 percent for Am stars (Abt & Levy 1985). Therefore, the simplest
way to explain the existence of giant metallic F stars is to suggest that all
normal A and early F stars might go through a short "metallic" phase when they
are finishing their life on the main sequence.
  Besides, it is shown that only giant stars with spectral type comprised
between F0 and F6 may have a really enhanced Delta_m_2 value, while all A-type
giants seem to be normal.
