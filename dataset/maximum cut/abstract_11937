The phase diagram of a spin-1/2 $J-J'-J_2$ model is investigated by means of
exact diagonalizations on finite samples. This model is a generalization of the
$J_1-J_2$ model on the square lattice with two different nearest-neighbor
couplings $J,J'$ and may be also viewed as an array of coupled Heisenberg
chains. The results suggest that the resonnating valence bond state predicted
by Nersesyan and Tsvelik [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 67}, 024422 (2003)] for $J_2=0.5J'
\ll J$ is realized and extends beyond the limit of small interchain coupling
along a curve nearly coincident with the line where the energy per spin is
maximum. This line is likely bordered on both side by a columnar dimer long
range order. This columnar order could extends for $J'\to J$ which correspond
to the $J_1-J_2$ model.
