Polarization measurements are presented for 52 radio-loud QSOs and BL Lac
objects. For 9 highly polarized (p >3%) AGN, these are the first published
polarization measurements. Of these 9, 7 are highly-polarized QSOs (HPQs), one
is a BL Lac object and another is a likely BL Lac object. Polarization
variability is confirmed for some of these new and previously known
highly-polarized AGN. While 6 of the HPQs have flat radio spectra are almost
certainly blazars, PKS 1452-217 is probably a new member of the rare class of
radio-loud QSOs that show high polarization by scattering, and is therefore
important for testing orientation Unified Schemes. In competition for the
highest redshift HPQ are the well-observed QSO PKS 0438-43 at z = 2.85, with
maximum p = 4.7%, and PKS 0046-315 at z = 2.72, for which we find p = 13%.
