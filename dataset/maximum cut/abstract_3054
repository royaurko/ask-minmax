We determine the quantitative effect, in the maximum number of particles and
other static observables, due to small anharmonic terms added to the confining
potential of an atomic condensed system with negative two-body interaction. As
an example of how a cubic or quartic anharmonic term can affect the maximum
number of particles, we consider the trap parameters and the results given by
Roberts et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 4211 (2001)]. However, this study can be
easily transferred to other trap geometries to estimate anharmonic effects.
