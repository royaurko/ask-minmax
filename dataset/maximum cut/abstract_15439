Pulsars apparently missing from the galactic center could have been destroyed
by asymmetric fermionic dark matter ($m_X = 1-100$ GeV) coupled to a light
scalar ($m_{\phi}= 5-20$ MeV), which mixes with the Higgs boson. We point out
that this pulsar-collapsing dark sector can resolve the core-cusp problem and
will either be excluded or discovered by upcoming direct detection experiments.
Another implication is a maximum pulsar age curve that increases with distance
from the galactic center, with a normalization that depends on the couplings
and masses of dark sector particles. In addition, we use old pulsars outside
the galactic center to place bounds on asymmetric Higgs portal models.
