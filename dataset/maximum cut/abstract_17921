We develop a theory for the maximum achievable mobility in modulation-doped
2D GaAs-AlGaAs semiconductor structures by considering the momentum scattering
of the 2D carriers by the remote ionized dopants which must invariably be
present in order to create the 2D electron gas at the GaAs-AlGaAs interface.
The minimal model, assuming first order Born scattering by random quenched
remote dopant ions as the only scattering mechanism, gives a mobility much
lower (by a factor of 3 or more) than that observed experimentally in many
ultra high-mobility modulation-doped 2D systems, establishing convincingly that
the model of uncorrelated scattering by independent random remote quenched
dopant ions is often unable to describe the physical system quantitively. We
theoretically establish that the consideration of spatial correlations in the
remote dopant distribution can enhance the mobility by (up to) several orders
of magnitudes in experimental samples. The precise calculation of the carrier
mobility in ultra-pure modulation-doped 2D semiconductor structures thus
depends crucially on the unknown spatial correlations among the dopant ions in
the doping layer which may manifest sample to sample variations even for
nominally identical sample parameters (i.e., density, well width, etc.),
depending on the details of the modulation-doping growth conditions.
