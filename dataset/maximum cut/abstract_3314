In this paper, we study the semi-discrete Galerkin finite element method for
parabolic equations with Lipschitz continuous coefficients. We prove the
maximum-norm stability of the semigroup generated by the corresponding elliptic
finite element operator, and prove the space-time stability of the parabolic
projection onto the finite element space in $L^\infty(\Omega_T)$ and
$L^p((0,T);L^q(\Omega))$, $1<p,q<\infty$. The maximal $L^p$ regularity of the
parabolic finite element equation is also established.
