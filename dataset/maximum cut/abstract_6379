A very recent observation on the membrane mediated attraction and ordered
aggregation of colloidal particles bound to giant phospholipid vesicles (I.
Koltover, J. O. R\"{a}dler, C. R. Safinya, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 82},
1991(1999)) is investigated theoretically within the frame of Helfrich
curvature elasticity theory of lipid bilayer fluid membrane. Since the concave
or waist regions of the vesicle possess the highest local bending energy
density, the aggregation of colloidal beads on these places can reduce the
elastic energy in maximum. Our calculation shows that a bead in the concave
region lowers its energy $\sim 20 k_B T$. For an axisymmetrical dumbbell
vesicle, the local curvature energy density along the waist is equally of
maximum, the beads can thus be distributed freely with varying separation
distance.
