Stochastic thermodynamics of chemical reaction systems has recently gained
much attention. In the present paper, we consider such an issue for a system
with both oscillatory and excitable dynamics, using catalytic oxidation of
carbon monoxide on the surface of platinum crystal as an example. Starting from
the chemical Langevin equations, we are able to calculate the stochastic
entropy production P along a random trajectory in the concentration state
space. Particular attention is paid to the dependence of the time averaged
entropy productionP on the system sizeN in a parameter region close to the
deterministic Hopf bifurcation.In the large system size (weak noise) limit, we
find that P N^{\beta} with {\beta}=0 or 1 when the system is below or abovethe
Hopf bifurcation, respectively. In the small system size (strong noise) limit,
P always increases linearly with N regardless of the bifurcation parameter.
More interestingly,P could even reach a maximum for some intermediate system
size in a parameter region where the corresponding deterministic system shows
steady state or small amplitude oscillation. The maximum value of P decreases
as the system parameter approaches the so-called CANARD point where the maximum
disappears.This phenomenon could be qualitativelyunderstood by partitioning the
total entropy production into the contributions of spikes and of small
amplitude oscillations.
