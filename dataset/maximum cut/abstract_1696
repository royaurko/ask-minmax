We show that algebraic varieties with maximum likelihood degree one are
exactly the images of reduced A-discriminantal varieties under monomial maps
with finite fibers. The maximum likelihood estimator corresponding to such a
variety is Kapranov's Horn uniformization. This extends Kapranov's
characterization of A-discriminantal hypersurfaces to varieties of arbitrary
codimension.
