We expect that some observers in perceptual signal detection experiments,
such as radiologists, will make rational decisions, and therefore ratings from
those observers are expected to form a convex ROC curve. However, measured and
published curves are often not convex. This article examines the
convexity-constrained nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the ROC
curve given by Lloyd (2002). Like Lloyd we use the Pool Adjacent Violator
Algorithm (PAVA) to construct the estimate of the convex curve. We present a
direct proof that this estimate is a convex hull of the empirical ROC curve.
The estimate is simple to construct by hand, and follows the suggestions by
Pesce, et~al.~(2010).
  We examine the properties of this constrained nonparametric maximum
likelihood estimator (NPMLE) under a large number of experimental conditions.
In particular we examine the behavior of the area under the curve which is
often used as summary metric of diagnostic performance. This constrained ROC
estimator gives an area under the curve (AUC) estimate that is biased high with
respect to the usual empirical AUC estimate, but may be less biased with
respect to the underlying continuous true AUC value. The constrained ROC
estimator has lower variance than the usual empirical one. Unlike previous
contributors who used complex bootstrapping to estimate the variance of the
constrained NPMLE we demonstrate that standard unbiased estimators of variance
work well to estimate the variance of the NPMLE AUC.
