We demonstrate an alternative (with respect to the ones existing in
literature) and more habitual for physicists derivation of exact solution of
the Einstein-Maxwell equations for the motion of a charged spherical membrane
with tangential tension. We stress that the physically acceptable range of
parameters for which the static and stable state of the membrane producing the
Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) repulsive gravity effect exists. The concrete
realization of such state for the Nambu-Goto membrane is described. The point
is that membrane are able to cut out the central naked singularity region and
at the same time to join in appropriate way the RN repulsive region.
  As result we have a model of an everywhere-regular material source exhibiting
a repulsive gravitational force in the vicinity of its surface: this
construction gives a more sensible physical status to the RN solution in the
naked singularity case.
