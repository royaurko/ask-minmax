We study ring shaped (Corbino) devices made of bilayer two-dimensional
electron gases in the total filling factor one quantized Hall phase which is
considered to be a coherent BCS-like state of interlayer excitons. Identical
Josephson currents are observed at the two edges while only a negligible
conductance between them is found. The maximum Josephson current observed at
either edge can be controlled by passing a second interlayer Josephson current
at the other edge. Due to the large electric resistance between the two edges,
the interaction between them can only be mediated by the neutral interlayer
excitonic groundstate.
