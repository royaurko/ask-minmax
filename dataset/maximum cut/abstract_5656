We present a UV completion of the twin Higgs idea in the framework of
holographic composite Higgs. The SM contribution to the Higgs potential is
effectively cut off by the SM-singlet mirror partners at the sigma-model scale
f, naturally allowing for m_{KK} beyond the LHC reach. The bulk symmetry is
SU(7) X SO(8), broken on the IR brane into SU(7) X SO(7) and on the UV brane
into (SU(3) X SU(2) X U(1))^{SM} X (SU(3) X SU(2) X U(1))^{mirror} X Z2. The
field content on the UV brane is the SM, extended by a sector transforming
under the mirror gauge group, with the Z2 exchanging the two sectors. An
additional Z2 breaking term is holographically generated to reproduce the Higgs
mass and VEV, with a mild O(10%) tuning. This model has no trace at the LHC,
but can by probed by precision Higgs measurements at future lepton colliders,
and by direct searches for KK excitations at a 100 TeV collider.
