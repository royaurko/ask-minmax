By means of polarized neutron diffraction in a magnetic field of 7.0 T at 1.6
K an anomalously large magnetization density is observed on the in-plane oxygen
in Ca$_{1.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$RuO$_4$. Field-induced moments of different ions are
determined by refinement on the flipping ratios, yielding $\mu$$_{Ru}$ =
0.346(11) $\mu$$_B$, $\mu_{O1}$ = 0.076(6) $\mu$$_B$ and $\mu_{O2}$ = 0.009(6)
$\mu$$_B$. The moment on the oxygen arises from the strong hybridization
between the Ru-4d and O-2p orbitals. %The maximum entropy method is used for
the %reconstruction of the magnetization density and reveals a strongly
anisotropic The maximum entropy magnetization density reconstruction reveals a
strongly anisotropic density at the Ru site, consistent with the distribution
of the {\it xy} ($t_{2g}$ band) {\it d}-orbitals.
