We calculate the total cross section for single charged slepton production in
association with a top quark at hadron colliders in the baryon triality (B$_3$)
supersymmetric model. We compute event rates for the Tevatron and LHC. We study
the signatures for different supersymmetric scenarios including neutralino and
stau LSPs. We perform a detailed analysis with basic cuts for the B$_3$
operator $\lam^\prime_{231}$ using Monte Carlo simulations to show that the
signal can be distinguished from the background at the LHC. In particular we
employ the resulting lepton charge asymmetry.
