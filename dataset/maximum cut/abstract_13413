The effect of pressure on the magnetic and the magnetocaloric properties
around the martensitic transformation temperature in NiCoMnSb Heusler alloy has
been studied. The martensitic transition temperature has significantly shifted
to higher temperatures with pressure, whereas the trend is opposite with the
application of applied magnetic field. The maximum magnetic entropy change
around the martensitic transition temperature for Ni45Co5Mn38Sb12 is 41.4 J/kg
K at the ambient pressure, whereas it is 33 J/kg K at 8.5 kbar. We find that by
adjusting the Co concentration and applying suitable pressure, NiCoMnSb system
can be tuned to achieve giant magnetocaloric effect spread over a large
temperature span around the room temperature, thereby making it a potential
magnetic refrigerant material for applications.
