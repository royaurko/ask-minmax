Markov width of a graph is a graph invariant defined as the maximum degree of
a Markov basis element for the corresponding graph model for binary contingency
tables. We show that a graph has Markov width at most four if and only if it
contains no $K_4$ as a minor, answering a question of Develin and Sullivant. We
also present a lower bound of order $\Omega(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ on the Markov
width of $K_n$.
