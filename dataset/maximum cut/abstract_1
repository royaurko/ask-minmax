The spectral shape of radiation due to Inverse Compton Scattering is
analyzed, in the Thomson and the Klein-Nishina regime, for electron
distributions with exponential cut-off. We derive analytical, asymptotic
expressions for the spectrum close to the maximum cut-off region. We consider
monoenergetic, Planckian and Synchrotron photons as target photon fields. These
approximations provide a direct link between the distribution of parent
electrons and the up-scattered spectrum at the cut-off region.
