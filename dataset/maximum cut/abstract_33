In this paper we give a generalization of the well known split cuts of Cook,
Kannan and Schrijver to cuts which are based on multi-term disjunctions. They
will be called k-disjunctive cuts. The starting point is the question what kind
of cuts is needed for a finite cutting plane algorithm for general mixed
integer programs. We will deal with this question in detail and derive cutting
planes based on k-disjunctions related to a given cut vector. Finally we will
show how a finite cutting plane algorithm can be established using these cuts
in combination with Gomory mixed integer cuts.
