Taking into account results obtained from light-curve analysis and
out-of-eclipse analyses, we discuss the nature of GSC 02038-00293 and also its
magnetic activity behaviour. We obtained light curves of the system during
observing seasons 2007, 2008 and 2011. We obtained its secondary minimum
clearly in I-band observations in 2008 for the first time. Analysing this light
curve, we found the physical parameters of the components. The light-curve
analysis indicates that the possible mass ratio of the system is 0.35. We
obtained the remaining V-band light curves, extracting the eclipses. We
modelled these remaining curves using the spotmodel program and found possible
spot configurations of the magnetically active component for each observing
season. The models demonstrated that there are two active longitudes for the
active component. The models reveal that both active longitudes migrate in the
direction of decreasing longitude. We also examined the light curves in
out-of-eclipse phases with respect to minimum and maximum brightness,
amplitude, etc. The amplitude of the curves during out-of-eclipse phases varies
in a sinusoidal way with a period of ~8.9yr the mean brightness of the system
is dramatically decreasing. The phases of the deeper minimum during
out-of-eclipse periods exhibit a migration toward decreasing phase.
