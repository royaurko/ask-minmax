We measured the single-photon detection efficiency of NbN superconducting
single photon detectors as a function of the polarization state of the incident
light for different wavelengths in the range from 488 nm to 1550 nm. The
polarization contrast varies from ~5% at 488 nm to ~30% at 1550 nm, in good
agreement with numerical calculations. We use an optical-impedance model to
describe the absorption for polarization parallel to the wires of the detector.
For lossy NbN films, the absorption can be kept constant by keeping the product
of layer thickness and filling factor constant. As a consequence, we find that
the maximum possible absorption is independent of filling factor. By
illuminating the detector through the substrate, an absorption efficiency of
~70% can be reached for a detector on Si or GaAs, without the need for an
optical cavity.
