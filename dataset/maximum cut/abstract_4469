Within D=5 N=2 gauged supergravity coupled to hypermultiplets we derive
consistency conditions for BPS domain walls with constant negative curvature on
the wall. For such wall solutions to exist, the covariant derivative of the
projector, governing the constraint on the Killing spinor, has to be non-zero
and proportional to the cosmological constant on the domain walls. We also
prove that in this case solutions of the Killing spinor equations are solutions
of the equations of motion. We present explicit, analytically solved examples
of such domain walls, employing the universal hypermultiplet fields. These
examples involve the running of two scalar fields and the space-time in the
transverse direction that is cut off at a critical distance, governed by the
magnitude of the negative cosmological constant on the wall.
