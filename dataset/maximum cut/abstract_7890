Context. In order to study the association of the origin of ultra high energy
cosmic rays (UHECR) with active galactic nuclei (AGN) at all levels of their
activity we require an unbiased sample of black holes. Aims. Here we describe
such a sample, of about 6 000 black holes, within the local Universe, inside
the GZK (Greisen Zatsepin Kuzmin) limit, around 100 Mpc. Methods. The starting
point is the 2 micron all sky survey, with the next steps as: test its com-
pleteness down to low flux densities, confine it to redshifts z < 0.025, limit
it to early Hubble type galaxies, test with B-V colors and with the FIR/Radio
ratio the possible separation in classes of sources for the ultra high energy
cosmic rays, use the spheroidal stellar component - black hole mass
relationship to derive black hole masses, and test them with known black hole
masses. Results. The statistics are consistent with the mass function of black
hole masses, with a rel- atively flat distribution to about 10^8 Msol, and
thereafter a very steep spectrum. Our sample cuts off just below 10^7 Msol,
indicating a gap for lower masses, below somewhere near 10^6 Msol. We construct
the sky distribution for all black holes above 10^7 Msol, 10^8 Msol, and 3 x
10^8 Msol, and also show the sky distribution for the five redshift ranges 0.0
- 0.005, 0.005 - 0.0010, 0.010 - 0.015, 0.015 - 0.020, and 0.020 to 0.025.
