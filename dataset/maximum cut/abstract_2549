We study simple type theory with primitive equality (STT) and its first-order
fragment EFO, which restricts equality and quantification to base types but
retains lambda abstraction and higher-order variables. As deductive system we
employ a cut-free tableau calculus. We consider completeness, compactness, and
existence of countable models. We prove these properties for STT with respect
to Henkin models and for EFO with respect to standard models. We also show that
the tableau system yields a decision procedure for three EFO fragments.
