We respond to the comment by Crutchfield, Feldman and Shalizi and that by
Binder and Perry, pointing out that there may be many maximum entropies, and
therefore ``disorders'' and ``simple complexities''. Which ones are appropriate
depend on the questions being addressed. ``Disorder'' is not restricted to be
the ratio of a nonequilibrium entropy to the corresponding equilibrium entropy;
therefore, ``simple complexity'' need not vanish for all equiibrium systems,
nor must it be nonvanishing for a nonequilibrium system.
