We compute the even part of the two-loop seven-point planar MHV amplitude in
N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We find that the even part is expressed
in terms of conformal integrals with simple rational coefficients. We also
compute the even part of two all-n cuts. An important feature of the result is
that no hexagon (or higher polygon) loops appear among the integrals detected
by the cuts we computed. We also present a "leg addition rule," which allows us
to express some integral coefficients in the n+1-point MHV amplitude in terms
of the integral coefficients of the n-point MHV amplitude.
