Networks may, or may not, be wired to have a core that is both itself densely
connected and central in terms of graph distance. In this study we propose a
coefficient to measure if the network has such a clear-cut core-periphery
dichotomy. We measure this coefficient for a number of real-world and model
networks and find that different classes of networks have their characteristic
values. For example do geographical networks have a strong core-periphery
structure, while the core-periphery structure of social networks (despite their
positive degree-degree correlations) is rather weak. We proceed to study radial
statistics of the core, i.e. properties of the n-neighborhoods of the core
vertices for increasing n. We find that almost all networks have unexpectedly
many edges within n-neighborhoods at a certain distance from the core
suggesting an effective radius for non-trivial network processes.
