We study the random acceleration model, which is perhaps one of the simplest,
yet nontrivial, non-Markov stochastic processes, and is key to many
applications. For this non-Markov process, we present exact analytical results
for the probability density $p(t_m|T)$ of the time $t_m$ at which the process
reaches its maximum, within a fixed time interval $[0,T]$. We study two
different boundary conditions, which correspond to the process representing
respectively (i) the integral of a Brownian bridge and (ii) the integral of a
free Brownian motion. Our analytical results are also verified by numerical
simulations.
