In Part I we have developed a theory for fitting p-mode Fourier spectra
assuming that these spectra have a multi-normal distribution. We showed, using
Monte-Carlo simulations, how one can obtain p-mode parameters using 'Maximum
Likelihood Estimators'. In this article, hereafter Part II, we show how to use
the theory developed in Part I for fitting real data. We introduce 4 new
diagnostics in helioseismology: the $(m,\nu)$ echelle diagramme, the cross
echelle diagramme, the inter echelle diagramme, and the ratio cross spectrum.
These diagnostics are extremely powerful to visualize and understand the
covariance matrices of the Fourier spectra, and also to find bugs in the data
analysis code. These diagrammes can also be used to derive quantitative
information on the mode leakage and noise covariance matrices. Numerous
examples using the LOI/SOHO and GONG data are given.
