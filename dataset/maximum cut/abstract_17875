We present the results of large scale, three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamics simulations of disc-winds for different initial magnetic
field configurations. The jets are followed from the source to 90 AU scale,
which covers several pixels of HST images of nearby protostellar jets. Our
simulations show that jets are heated along their length by many shocks. We
compute the emission lines that are produced, and find excellent agreement with
observations. The jet width is found to be between 20 and 30 AU while the
maximum velocities perpendicular to the jet is found to be up to above 100
km/s. The initially less open magnetic field configuration simulations results
in a wider, two-component jet; a cylindrically shaped outer jet surrounding a
narrow and much faster, inner jet. These simulations preserve the underlying
Keplerian rotation profile of the inner jet to large distances from the source.
However, for the initially most open magnetic field configuration the kink mode
creates a narrow corkscrew-like jet without a clear Keplerian rotation profile
and even regions where we observe rotation opposite to the disc
(counter-rotating). The RW Aur jet is narrow, indicating that the disc field in
that case is very open meaning the jet can contain a counter-rotating component
that we suggests explains why observations of rotation in this jet has given
confusing results. Thus magnetized disc winds from underlying Keplerian discs
can develop rotation profiles far down the jet that are not Keplerian.
