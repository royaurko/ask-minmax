By adapting methods of \cite{AC} we prove a sharp estimate on the expansion
modulus of the gradient of the log of the parabolic kernel to the Sch\"ordinger
operator with convex potential, which improves an earlier work of
Brascamp-Lieb. We also include alternate proofs to the improved log-concavity
estimate, and to the fundamental gap theorem of Andrews-Clutterbuck via the
elliptic maximum principle. Some applications of the estimates are also
obtained, including a sharp lower bound on the first eigenvalue.
