This paper proposes an extension to the classical 3D variational data
assimilation approach by explicitly incorporating as a prior information, the
transform-domain sparsity observed in a large class of geophysical signals. In
particular, the proposed framework extends the maximum likelihood estimation of
the analysis state to the maximum a posteriori estimator, from a Bayesian
perspective. The promise of the methodology is demonstrated via application to
a 1D synthetic example.
