The strange-quark vector current $\rho$-to-$\pi$ meson transition form factor
is computed at one-loop order using strange meson intermediate states. A
comparison is made with a $\phi$-meson dominance model estimate. We find that
one-loop contributions are comparable in magnitude to those predicted by
$\phi$-meson dominance. It is possible that the one-loop contribution can make
the matrix element as large as those of the electromagnetic current mediating
vector meson radiative decays. However, due to the quadratic dependence of the
one-loop results on the hadronic form factor cut-off mass, a large uncertainty
in the estimate of the loops is unavoidable. These results indicate that
non-nucleonic strange quarks could contribute appreciably in moderate-$|Q^2|$
parity-violating electron-nucleus scattering measurements aimed at probing the
strange-quark content of the nucleon.
