We investigate the scalar K pi form factor at low energies by the method of
unitarity bounds adapted so as to include information on the phase and modulus
along the elastic region of the unitarity cut. Using at input the values of the
form factor at t=0 and the Callan-Treiman point, we obtain stringent
constraints on the slope and curvature parameters of the Taylor expansion at
the origin. Also, we predict a quite narrow range for the higher order ChPT
corrections at the second Callan-Treiman point.
