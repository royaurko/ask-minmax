We present the results of a study of solar wind velocity and magnetic field
correlation lengths over the last 35 years. The correlation length of the
magnetic field magnitude lambda(|B|) increases on average by a factor of two at
solar maxima compared to solar minima. The correlation lengths of the
components of the magnetic field lambda(Bxyz) and of the velocity lambda(Vyz)
do not show this change and have similar values, indicating a continual
turbulent correlation length of around 1.4 x 10^6 km. We conclude that a linear
relation between lambda(|B|), VB^2 and Kp suggests that the former is related
to the total magnetic energy in the solar wind and an estimate of the average
size of geo-effective structures which is in turn proportional to VB^2. By
looking at the distribution of daily correlation lengths we show that the solar
minimum values of lambda(|B|) correspond to the turbulent outer scale. A tail
of larger lambda(|B|) values is present at solar maximum, causing the increase
in mean value.
