The modal cut-off is investigated experimentally in a series of high quality
non-linear photonic crystal fibers. We demonstrate a suitable measurement
technique to determine the cut-off wavelength and verify it by inspecting the
near field of the modes that may be excited below and above the cut-off. We
observe a double peak structure in the cut-off spectra, which is attributed to
a splitting of the higher order modes. The cut-off is measured for seven
different fiber geometries with different pitches and relative hole size, and a
very good agreement with recent theoretical work is found.
