We extend a coherent network data-analysis strategy developed earlier for
detecting Newtonian waveforms to the case of post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms.
Since the PN waveform depends on the individual masses of the inspiraling
binary, the parameter-space dimension increases by one from that of the
Newtonian case. We obtain the number of templates and estimate the
computational costs for PN waveforms: For a lower mass limit of a solar mass,
for LIGO-I noise, and with 3% maximum mismatch, the online computational speed
requirement for single detector is a few Gflops; for a two-detector network it
is hundreds of Gflops and for a three-detector network it is tens of Tflops.
Apart from idealistic networks, we obtain results for realistic networks
comprising of LIGO and VIRGO. Finally, we compare costs incurred in a
coincidence detection strategy with those incurred in the coherent strategy
detailed above.
