This paper reviews the results obtained so far with the newly developed
tomographic technique, which probes the velocity field across the atmosphere of
long-period variable (LPV) stars. The method cross-correlates the optical
spectrum with numerical masks constructed from synthetic spectra and probing
layers of increasing depths. This technique reveals that the line doubling
often observed in LPV stars around maximum light is the signature of the shock
wave propagating in the atmosphere of these pulsating stars. Applications to
the Mira variables RT Cyg and RY Cep are presented, revealing the outward
propagation of the shock.
