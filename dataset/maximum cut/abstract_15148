We study the phenomenology of maximum-entropy meso-reservoirs, where we
assume that their local thermal equilibrium state changes consistently with the
heat transferred between the meso-reservoirs. Depending on heat and matter
carrying capacities, the chemical potentials and temperatures are allowed to
vary in time, and using global conservation relations we solve their evolution
equations. We compare two-terminal transport between bosonic and fermionic
meso-reservoirs via systems that tightly couple energy and matter currents and
systems that do not. For bosonic reservoirs we observe the temporary formation
of a Bose-Einstein condensate in one of the meso-reservoirs from an initial
nonequilibrium setup.
