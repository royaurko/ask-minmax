Within the framework of proton model with taking into account the
piezoelectric interaction with the shear strain $\varepsilon_4$, a dynamic
dielectric response of KH$_2$PO$_4$ family crystals to the electric field
perpendicular to the axis of spontaneous polarizaiton is considered.
Piezoelectric resonance frequencies of rectangular thin plates of the crystals
cut in the (100) plane (0$^\circ$ X-cut) are calculated.
