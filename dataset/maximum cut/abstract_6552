In connection with the claim made at the Quark Matter 2005 Conference that
the Brown-Rho scaling is ruled out by NA60 data we consider dimuon production
from semi-central In+In collisions in a full dynamical model. It is shown that
if only a modification of the density-dependent $\rho$-mass is allowed, the
maximum of dimuon invariant mass spectra is only slightly below experimental
one. The additional inclusion of the temperature-dependent modification factor
shifts the spectrum maximum toward lower invariant masses making calculation
results incompatible with data. A further study is needed to disentangle the BR
dropping $\rho$ mass scaling and strong broadening.
