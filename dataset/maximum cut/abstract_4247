We present a study of single-W production ($e^+e^-\to e^-\bar{\nu}_e W^+$) as
a new probe of the anomalous couplings at the LEP energy region. We introduce
simple cuts to separate the single-W process from W-pair production and have
performed cross-section calculations using 4-fermion generator ``grc4f''. The
cross-section of the single-W process is found to be large enough to detect at
LEP experiments in the near future. In addition, a high sensitivity to the
anomalous coupling of the $WW\gamma$ vertex is expected since the amplitude of
the $WW\gamma$ diagram makes a dominant contribution in this process. We have
found that the cross-section measurement of the single-W process in the LEP2
energy region can give complementary bounds on the anomalous couplings to those
obtained from W-pair analysis.
