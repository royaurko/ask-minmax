We present results for the ground state and first excited state static
potentials in the confinement "phase" of the SU(2) Higgs model. String breaking
and the crossing of the energy levels are clearly visible. We address the
question of the cut-off effects in our results and observe a remarkable scaling
of the static potentials.
