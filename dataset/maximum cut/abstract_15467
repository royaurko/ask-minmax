We model the multi-wavelength emission in the southern hotspot of the radio
quasar 4C74.26. The synchrotron radio emission is resolved near the shock with
the MERLIN radio-interferometer, and the rapid decay of this emission behind
the shock is interpreted as the decay of the amplified downstream magnetic
field as expected for small scale turbulence. Electrons are accelerated to only
0.3 TeV, consistent with a diffusion coefficient many orders of magnitude
greater than in the Bohm regime. If the same diffusion coefficient applies to
the protons, their maximum energy is only ~100 TeV.
