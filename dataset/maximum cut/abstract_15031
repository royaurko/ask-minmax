The extended high-energy gamma-ray (>100 MeV) emission which occurs well
after the prompt gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is usually explained as the afterglow
synchrotron radiation. Here we report the analysis of the Fermi Large Area
Telescope observations of GRB 130907A. A 55 GeV photon compatible with the
position of the burst was found at about 5 hours after the prompt phase. The
probability that this photon is associated with GRB 130907A is higher than
99.96%. The energy of this photon exceeds the maximum synchrotron photon energy
at this time and its occurrence thus challenges the synchrotron mechanism as
the origin for the extended high-energy >10 GeV emission. Modeling of the
broad-band spectral energy distribution suggests that such high energy photons
can be produced by the synchrotron self-Compton emission of the afterglow.
