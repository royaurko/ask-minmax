We have studied transportation network, namely a road network of the Moscow
region and airline network of the Russian Federation. We have constructed
corresponding networks and studied degree distribution and length distribution
for these networks, as well as the dependences on the average clustering
coefficients and the nearest neighbours average degree as a function of the
vertex degree. In conclusion we discuss degree and length distributions in the
framework of the nonextensive statistics, using the maximum entropy approach
and the model with additive and multiplicative noise. We present a procedure of
fitting the results of the data processing to the q-type distribution which
allows the fractal dimension definition of the networks under study.
