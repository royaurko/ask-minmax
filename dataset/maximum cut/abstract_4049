The influence of disorder and interaction on the ground state polarization of
the two-dimensional (2D) correlated electron gas is studied by numerical
investigations of unrestricted Hartree-Fock equations. The ferromagnetic ground
state is found to be plausible when the electron number is lowered and the
interaction and disorder parameters are suitably chosen. For a finite system at
constant electronic density the disorder induced spin polarization is cut off
when the electron orbitals become strongly localized to the individual network
sites. The fluctuations of the interaction matrix elements are calculated and
brought out as favoring the ferromagnetic instability in the extended and weak
localization regime. The localization effect of the Hubbard interaction term is
discussed.
