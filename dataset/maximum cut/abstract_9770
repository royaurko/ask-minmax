Content filtering in web browsers is a tedious process for most of the
people, because of several reasons. By blocking JavaScript, Cookies and Popups,
end users can ensure maximum protection from browser based attacks and
vulnerabilities. In order to accomplish this, we build an extension for Google
Chrome which allows users to have easy control over what they wish to recievce
from a web page. We also build this extension in such a way that it remembers
the choice of options made by the user for every URLs, thereby letting users
create rules for websites they visit.
