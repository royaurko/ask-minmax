If the observed millisecond variability in the X-ray flux of several
neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) is interpreted within a
general-relativistic framework (Kluzniak, Michelson \& Wagoner 1990) extant at
the time of discovery, severe constraints can be placed on the equation of
state (e.o.s.) of matter at supranuclear densities. The reported maximum
frequency (1.14 +- 0.01 kHz) of quasiperiodic oscillations observed in sources
as diverse as Sco X-1 and 4U 1728-34 would imply that the neutron star masses
in these LMXBs are M > 1.9 M_solar, and hence many equations of state would be
excluded. Among the very few still viable equations of state are the e.o.s. of
Phandaripande and Smith (1975), and e.o.s. AV14 + UVII of Wiringa, Fiks \&
Fabrocini (1988).
