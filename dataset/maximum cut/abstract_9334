In diffusion-based molecular communications, messages can be conveyed via the
variation in the concentration of molecules in the medium. In this paper, we
intend to analyze the achievable capacity in transmission of information from
one node to another in a diffusion channel. We observe that because of the
molecular diffusion in the medium, the channel possesses memory. We then model
the memory of the channel by a two-step Markov chain and obtain the equations
describing the capacity of the diffusion channel. By performing a numerical
analysis, we obtain the maximum achievable rate for different levels of the
transmitter power, i.e., the molecule production rate.
