We present closed analytic expressions of the electromagnetic vertex form
factors for heavy quarks at the two-loop level in QCD for arbitrary momentum
transfer. The calculation is carried out in dimensional regularization. The
electric and magnetic form factors are expressed in terms of 1-dimensional
harmonic polylogarithms of maximum weight 4.
