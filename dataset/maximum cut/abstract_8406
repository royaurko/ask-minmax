Vortex dynamics in inhomogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates are studied
numerically in two and three dimensions. We simulate the precession of a single
vortex around the center of a trapped condensate, and use the Magnus force to
estimate the precession frequency. Vortex ring dynamics in a spherical trap are
also simulated, and we discover that a ring undergoes oscillatory motion around
a circle of maximum energy. The position of this locus is calculated as a
function of the number of condensed atoms. In the presence of dissipation, the
amplitude of the oscillation will increase, eventually resulting in
self-annihilation of the ring.
