We have obtained photometry and spectra of SN~1991T which extend more than
1000 days past maximum light, by far the longest a SN~Ia has been followed.
Although SN~1991T exhibited nearly normal photometric behavior in the first 400
days following maximum, by 600 days its decline had slowed, and by 950~days the
supernova brightness was consistent with a constant apparent magnitude of
$m_B=21.30$. Spectra near maximum showed minor variations on the SN~Ia theme
which grew less conspicuous during the exponential decline. At 270 days the
nebular spectrum was composed of Fe and Co lines common to SNe~Ia. However, by
750 days past maximum light, these lines had shifted in wavelength, and were
superimposed on a strong blue continuum. The luminosity of SN~1991T at 950 days
is more than $9.0\times10^{38}(D/13~{\rm Mpc})^2$~ergs~s$^{-1}$ with a rate of
decline of less than $0.04$ mags/100~days. We show that this emission is likely
to be light that was emitted by SN~1991T near maximum light which has reflected
from foreground dust, much like the light echos observed around SN~1987A.
