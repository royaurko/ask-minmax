We use spiral galaxy evolution models to argue that there are substantial
variations in stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) within and among galaxies. Our
models show a strong correlation between stellar M/L and galaxy color. We
compare the colors and maximum-disk M/L values of a sample of galaxies to the
model color-M/L relation, finding that a Salpeter IMF is too massive but that
an IMF with fewer low mass stars fits the observations well. Applying our
color-M/L relation to the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation, we find a stellar mass
TF-relation that is independent of originating passband. Adding the HI gas
mass, we find that the maximum slope of the baryonic TF-relation is 3.5.
