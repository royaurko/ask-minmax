We consider maximum solution $g(t)$, $t\in [0, +\infty)$, to the normalized
Ricci flow. Among other things, we prove that, if $(M, \omega) $ is a smooth
compact symplectic 4-manifold such that $b_2^+(M)>1$ and let
$g(t),t\in[0,\infty)$, be a solution to (1.3) on $M$ whose Ricci curvature
satisfies that $|\text{Ric}(g(t))|\leq 3$ and additionally $\chi(M)=3 \tau
(M)>0$, then there exists an $m\in \mathbb{N}$, and a sequence of points
$\{x_{j,k}\in M\}$, $j=1, ..., m$, satisfying that, by passing to a
subsequence, $$(M, g(t_{k}+t), x_{1,k},..., x_{m,k})
\stackrel{d_{GH}}\longrightarrow (\coprod_{j=1}^m N_j, g_{\infty},
x_{1,\infty}, ...,, x_{m,\infty}),$$ $t\in [0, \infty)$, in the $m$-pointed
Gromov-Hausdorff sense for any sequence $t_{k}\longrightarrow \infty$, where
$(N_{j}, g_{\infty})$, $j=1,..., m$, are complete complex hyperbolic orbifolds
of complex dimension 2 with at most finitely many isolated orbifold points.
Moreover, the convergence is $C^{\infty}$ in the non-singular part of
$\coprod_1^m N_{j}$ and
$\text{Vol}_{g_{0}}(M)=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\text{Vol}_{g_{\infty}}(N_{j})$, where
$\chi(M)$ (resp. $\tau(M)$) is the Euler characteristic (resp. signature) of
$M$.
