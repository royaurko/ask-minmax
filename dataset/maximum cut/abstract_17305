In this paper, we present a novel, learning-based, two-step super-resolution
(SR) algorithm well suited to solve the specially demanding problem of
obtaining SR estimates from short image sequences. The first step, devoted to
increase the sampling rate of the incoming images, is performed by fitting
linear combinations of functions generated from principal components (PC) to
reproduce locally the sparse projected image data, and using these models to
estimate image values at nodes of the high-resolution grid. PCs were obtained
from local image patches sampled at sub-pixel level, which were generated in
turn from a database of high-resolution images by application of a physically
realistic observation model. Continuity between local image models is enforced
by minimizing an adequate functional in the space of model coefficients. The
second step, dealing with restoration, is performed by a linear filter with
coefficients learned to restore residual interpolation artifacts in addition to
low-resolution blurring, providing an effective coupling between both steps of
the method. Results on a demanding five-image scanned sequence of graphics and
text are presented, showing the excellent performance of the proposed method
compared to several state-of-the-art two-step and Bayesian Maximum a Posteriori
SR algorithms.
