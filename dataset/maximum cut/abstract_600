We show within a geometrical model developed in earlier papers that
multiplicity distributions are cut off at large multiplicities. The position
and motion of the cut-off point is related to geometrical- and KNO scaling and
their violation, in particular by the rise of the ratio
$\sigma_{el}/\sigma_{t}.$ At the LHC energies a change of the regime, connected
with the transition from shadowing to antishadowing is expected.
