The ESC-RTN optical spectroscopy data-set for SN 2005cf is presented and
analyzed. The observations range from -11.6 and +77.3 days with respect to
B-band maximum light. The evolution of the spectral energy distribution of SN
2005cf is characterized by the presence of high velocity SiII and CaII
features. SYNOW synthetic spectra are used to investigate the ejecta geometry
of silicon. Based on the synthetic spectra the SiII high velocity feature
appears detached at 19500 km/s. We also securely establish the presence of such
feature in SN 1990N, SN 1994D, SN 2002er and SN 2003du. On a morphological
study both the CaII IR Triplet and H&K absorption lines of SN 2005cf show high
velocity features centered around 24000 km/s. When compared with other Type Ia
SNe based on the scheme presented in Benetti et al. 2005 SN 2005cf definitely
belongs to the LVG group.
