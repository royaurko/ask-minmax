In the last decade, there has been a growing interest to use Wishart
processes for modelling, especially for financial applications. However, there
are still few studies on the estimation of its parameters. Here, we study the
Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) in order to estimate the drift parameters of
a Wishart process. It turns out that this estimator is only well defined when
the matrix parameter in the drift is symmetric. We obtain precise convergence
rates and limits for this estimator in the ergodic case and in some nonergodic
cases, that are different in each studied case. We also check that it achieves
the optimal convergence rate. Motivated by this study, we also present new
results on the Laplace transform that extend the recent findings of Gnoatto and
Grasselli and are of independent interest.
