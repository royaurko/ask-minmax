The energy spectrum of cosmic-ray antiprotons has been measured in the range
0.18 to 3.56 GeV, based on 458 antiprotons collected by BESS in recent
solar-minimum period. We have detected for the first time a distinctive peak at
2 GeV of antiprotons originating from cosmic-ray interactions with the
interstellar gas. The peak spectrum is reproduced by theoretical calculations,
implying that the propagation models are basically correct and that different
cosmic-ray species undergo a universal propagation. Future BESS flights toward
the solar maximum will help us to study the solar modulation and the
propagation in detail and to search for primary antiproton components.
