Beam premodulation on free electron laser (FEL) offers considerable
enhancement in gain and efficiency when the phase of the premodulated beam is
-pi/2 and the beam is highly modulated implying the maximum beam oscillatory
velocity due to wiggler. The growth rate of the FEL instability increases with
the modulation index and reaches maximum when the modulation index $\Delta \sim
1.0$.
