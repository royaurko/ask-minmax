A maximum value for the magnetic field is determined, which provides the full
compensation of the positronium rest mass by the binding energy in the maximum
symmetry state and disappearance of the energy gap separating the
electron-positron system from the vacuum. The compensation becomes possible
owing to the falling to the center phenomenon. The maximum magnetic field may
be related to the vacuum and describe its structure.
