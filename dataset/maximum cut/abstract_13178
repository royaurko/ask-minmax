An anisotropy signal for the arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic
rays (UHECR) of more than 99% confidence level was established using data
collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. Cosmic rays with energy above $\sim
6 \times 10^{19}$ eV show a correlation with the positions of extragalactic
nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), being maximum for sources at less than
$\sim$100 Mpc and angular separation of a few degrees. The evolution of the
correlation signal with the energy shows that the departure from anisotropy
coincides with the flux suppression observed in the spectrum, being therefore
consistent with the hypothesis that the correlated events have their origin in
extragalactic sources close enough to avoid significant interaction with the
cosmic microwave background (the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min effect). Even though
the observed signal cannot unambiguously identify AGNs as the production sites
of UHECRs, the potential sources have to be distributed in a similar way. A
number of additional statistical tests were performed in order to further
understand the nature of the correlation signal.
