We study the LHC signatures of TeV scale vectorlike quarks $b'$, $t'$ and
$\chi$ with electromagnetic charges -1/3, 2/3 and 5/3 that appear in many
beyond the standard model (BSM) extensions. We consider warped
extra-dimensional models and analyze the phenomenology of such vectorlike
quarks that are the custodial partners of third generation quarks. In addition
to the usually studied pair-production channels which depend on the strong
coupling, we put equal emphasis on single production channels that depend on
electroweak couplings and on electroweak symmetry breaking induced mixing
effects between the heavy vectorlike quarks and standard model quarks. We
identify new promising $gg$-initiated pair and single production channels and
find the luminosity required for discovering these states at the LHC. For these
channels, we propose a cut that allows one to extract the relevant electroweak
couplings. Although the motivation is from warped models, we present many of
our results model-independently.
