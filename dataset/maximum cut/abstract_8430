We propose a relevant modification of the Nishimori-Ouchi model [{\em Phys.
Rev. Lett.} {\bf 71}, 197 (1993)] for granular landscape erosion. We explicitly
introduce a new parameter: the angle of repose $\theta_r$, and a new process:
avalanches. We show that the $\theta_r$ parameter leads to an asymmetry of the
ripples, as observed in natural patterns. The temporal evolution of the maximum
ripple height $h_{max}$ is limited and not linear, according to recent
observations. The ripple symmetry and the kink dynamics are studied and
discussed.
