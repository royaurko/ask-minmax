In this paper a fast and novel method is proposed for multi-font multi-size
Kannada numeral recognition which is thinning free and without size
normalization approach. The different structural feature are used for numeral
recognition namely, directional density of pixels in four directions, water
reservoirs, maximum profile distances, and fill hole density are used for the
recognition of Kannada numerals. A Euclidian minimum distance criterion is used
to find minimum distances and K-nearest neighbor classifier is used to classify
the Kannada numerals by varying the size of numeral image from 16 to 50 font
sizes for the 20 different font styles from NUDI and BARAHA popular word
processing Kannada software. The total 1150 numeral images are tested and the
overall accuracy of classification is found to be 100%. The average time taken
by this method is 0.1476 seconds.
