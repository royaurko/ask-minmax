Recent thermodynamic measurements on two-dimensional (2D) electron systems
have found diverging behavior in the magnetic susceptibility and appearance of
ferromagnetism with decreasing electron density. The critical densities for
these phenomena coincide with the metal-insulator transition recorded in
transport measurements. Based on density functional calculations within the
local spin-density approximation, we have investigated the compressibility and
magnetic susceptibility of a 2D electron gas in the presence of remote
impurities. A correlation between the minimum in the inverse capacitance
($\partial\mu /\partial n$) and the maximum of magnetization and magnetic
susceptibility is found. Based on values we obtain for the inverse
participation ratio, this seems to be also the MIT point.
