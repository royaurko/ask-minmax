The article presents a mapping of the residual strain along the axis of
InAs/InSb heterostructured nanowires. Using confocal Raman measurements, we
observe a gradual shift in the TO phonon mode along the axis of these
nanowires. We attribute the observed TO phonon shift to a residual strain
arising from the InAs/InSb lattice mismatch. We find that the strain is maximum
at the interface and then monotonically relaxes towards the tip of the
nanowires. We also analyze the crystal structure of the InSb segment through
selected area electron diffraction measurements and electron diffraction
tomography on individual nanowires.
