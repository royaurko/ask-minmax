We study static neutron stars with poloidal magnetic fields and a simple
class of electric current distributions consistent with the requirement of
stationarity. For this class of electric current distributions, we find that
magnetic fields are too large for static configurations to exist when the
magnetic force pushes a sufficient amount of mass off-center that the
gravitational force points outward near the origin in the equatorial plane. (In
our coordinates an outward gravitational force corresponds to $\partial\ln
g_{tt}/\partial r>0$, where $t$ and $r$ are respectively time and radial
coordinates and $g_{tt}$ is coefficient of $dt^2$ in the line element.) For the
equations of state (EOSs) employed in previous work, we obtain configurations
of higher mass than had been reported; we also present results with more recent
EOSs. For all EOSs studied, we find that the maximum mass among these static
configurations with magnetic fields is noticeably larger than the maximum mass
attainable by uniform rotation, and that for fixed values of baryon number the
maximum mass configurations are all characterized by an off-center density
maximum.
