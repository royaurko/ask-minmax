A semigroup generated by two dimensional $C^{1+\alpha}$ contracting maps is
considered. We call a such semigroup regular if the maximum $K$ of the
conformal dilatations of generators, the maximum $l$ of the norms of the
derivatives of generators and the smoothness $\alpha$ of the generators
satisfy a compatibility condition $K< 1/l^{\alpha}$. We prove that the shape
of the image of the core of a ball under any element of a regular semigroup is
good (bounded geometric distortion like the Koebe $1/4$-lemma \cite{a}). And
we use it to show a lower and a upper bounds of the Hausdorff dimension of the
limit set of a regular semigroup. We also consider a semigroup generated by
higher dimensional maps.
