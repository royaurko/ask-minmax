We report the detailed study of the influence of the spin and valley
splittings on such physical observables of the two-dimensional disordered
electron liquid as resistivity, spin and valley susceptibilities. We explain
qualitatively the nonmonotonic dependence of the resistivity with temperature
in the presence of a parallel magnetic field. In the presence of either the
spin splitting or the valley splitting we predict novel, with two maximum
points, temperature dependence of the resistivity.
