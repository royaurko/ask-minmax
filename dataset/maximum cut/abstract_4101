Full first order linear logic can be presented as an abstract logic
programming language in Miller's system Forum, which yields a sensible
operational interpretation in the 'proof search as computation' paradigm.
However, Forum still has to deal with syntactic details that would normally be
ignored by a reasonable operational semantics. In this respect, Forum improves
on Gentzen systems for linear logic by restricting the language and the form of
inference rules. We further improve on Forum by restricting the class of
formulae allowed, in a system we call G-Forum, which is still equivalent to
full first order linear logic. The only formulae allowed in G-Forum have the
same shape as Forum sequents: the restriction does not diminish expressiveness
and makes G-Forum amenable to proof theoretic analysis. G-Forum consists of two
(big) inference rules, for which we show a cut elimination procedure. This does
not need to appeal to finer detail in formulae and sequents than is provided by
G-Forum, thus successfully testing the internal symmetries of our system.
