Termination is an important and well-studied property for logic programs.
However, almost all approaches for automated termination analysis focus on
definite logic programs, whereas real-world Prolog programs typically use the
cut operator. We introduce a novel pre-processing method which automatically
transforms Prolog programs into logic programs without cuts, where termination
of the cut-free program implies termination of the original program. Hence
after this pre-processing, any technique for proving termination of definite
logic programs can be applied. We implemented this pre-processing in our
termination prover AProVE and evaluated it successfully with extensive
experiments.
