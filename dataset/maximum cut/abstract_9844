For affine stochastic differential equation with uniformly distributed time
delay the local asymptotic properties of the likelihood function are studied.
Local asymptotic normality, local asymptotic mixed normality, periodic local
asymptotic mixed normality or local asymptotic quadraticity is proved for
different values of the parameter. Applications to the asymptotic behaviour of
the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter based on continuous sample
are given.
