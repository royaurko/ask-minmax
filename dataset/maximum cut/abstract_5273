"Theorems for Free!" (Wadler, FPCA 1989) is a slogan for a technique that
allows to derive statements about functions just from their types. So far, the
statements considered have always had a purely extensional flavor: statements
relating the value semantics of program expressions, but not statements
relating their runtime (or other) cost. Here we study an extension of the
technique that allows precisely statements of the latter flavor, by deriving
quantitative theorems for free. After developing the theory, we walk through a
number of example derivations. Probably none of the statements derived in those
simple examples will be particularly surprising to most readers, but what is
maybe surprising, and at the very least novel, is that there is a general
technique for obtaining such results on a quantitative level in a principled
way. Moreover, there is good potential to bring that technique to bear on more
complex examples as well. We turn our attention to short-cut fusion (Gill et
al., FPCA 1993) in particular.
