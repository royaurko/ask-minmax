We report on measurements of the superconducting properties of FeSe05Te05
thin films grown on lanthanum aluminate. The films have high transition
temperatures (above 19 K) and sharp resistive transitions in fields up to 15 T.
The temperature dependence of the upper critical field and the irreversibility
lines are steep and anisotropic, as recently reported for single crystals. The
critical current densities, assessed by magnetization measurements in a vector
VSM, were found to be well above 10^9 Am-2 at low temperatures. In all samples,
the critical current as a function of field orientation has a maximum, when the
field is oriented parallel to the film surface. The maximum indicates the
presence of correlated pinning centers. A minimum occurs in three films, when
the field is applied perpendicular to the film plane. In the forth film,
instead, a local maximum caused by c-axis correlated pinning centers was found
at this orientation. The irradiation of two films with fast neutrons did not
change the properties drastically, where a maximum enhancement of the critical
current by a factor of two was found.
