The X-ray pulsar Her X-1 was observed for more than two orbital cycles near
the maximum of the 35 day X-ray intensity cycle by the Narrow Field Instruments
on-board the BeppoSAX satellite. We present the first simultaneous measurement
of the 0.1-200 keV spectrum. Three distinct continuum components are evident in
the phase averaged spectrum: a low energy excess, modeled as a 0.1 keV
blackbody; a power-law and a high energy cut-off. Superposed on this continuum
are Fe L and K emission features at 1.0 and 6.5 keV, respectively, and a ~40
keV cyclotron absorption feature. The cyclotron feature can be clearly seen in
raw count spectra. We present the properties of the cyclotron feature with
unprecedented precision and discuss the indications given by this measurement
on the physical properties of the emitting region.
