In this paper we show that the intuitionistic theory for finitely many
iterations of strictly positive operators is a conservative extension of the
Heyting arithmetic. The proof is inspired by the quick cut-elimination due to
G. Mints. This technique is also applied to fragments of Heyting arithmetic.
