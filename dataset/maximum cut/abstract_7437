A Fibonacci-like terrace structure along a 5fold axis of i-Al(68)Pd(23)Mn(9)
monograins has been observed by T.M. Schaub et al. with scanning tunnelling
microscopy (STM). In the planes of the terraces they see patterns of dark
pentagonal holes. These holes are well oriented both within and among terraces.
In one of 11 planes Schaub et al. obtain the autocorrelation function of the
hole pattern. We interpret these experimental findings in terms of the
Katz-Gratias-de Boisseu-Elser model. Following the suggestion of Elser that the
Bergman clusters are the dominant motive of this model, we decorate the tiling
T*(2F) by the Bergman polytopes only. The tiling T*(2F) allows us to use the
powerful tools of the projection techniques. The Bergman polytopes can be
easily replaced by the Mackay polytopes as the decoration objects. We derive a
picture of ``geared'' layers of Bergman polytopes from the projection
techniques as well as from a huge patch. Under the assumption that no surface
reconstruction takes place, this picture explains the Fibonacci-sequence of the
step heights as well as the related structure in the terraces qualitatively and
to certain extent even quantitatively. Furthermore, this layer-picture requires
that the polytopes are cut in order to allow for the observed step heights. We
conclude that Bergman or Mackay clusters have to be considered as geometric
building blocks of the i-AlPdMn structure rather than as energetically stable
entities.
