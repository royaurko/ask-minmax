Euclidean norm calculations arise frequently in scientific and engineering
applications. Several approximations for this norm with differing complexity
and accuracy have been proposed in the literature. Earlier approaches were
based on minimizing the maximum error. Recently, Seol and Cheun proposed an
approximation based on minimizing the average error. In this paper, we first
examine these approximations in detail, show that they fit into a single
mathematical formulation, and compare their average and maximum errors. We then
show that the maximum errors given by Seol and Cheun are significantly
optimistic.
