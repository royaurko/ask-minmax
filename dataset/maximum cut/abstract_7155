We reveal the relations between the conditional normalized maximum likelihood
(CNML) distributions and Bayesian predictive densities based on the latent
information priors (LIPs). In particular, CNML3, which is one type of CNML
distributions, is investigated. The Bayes projection of a predictive density,
which is an information projection of the predictive density on a set of
Bayesian predictive densities, is considered. We prove that the sum of the
Bayes projection divergence of CNML3 and the conditional mutual information is
asymptotically constant. This result implies that the Bayes projection of CNML3
(BPCNML3) is asymptotically identical to the Bayesian predictive density based
on LIP. In addition, under some stronger assumptions, we show that BPCNML3
exactly coincides with the Bayesian predictive density based on LIP.
