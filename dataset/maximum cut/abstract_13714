We develop a new comagnetometer using $^{21}$Ne atoms with nuclear spin
$I=3/2$ and Rb atoms polarized by spin-exchange with K atoms to search for
tensor interactions that violate local Lorentz invariance. We frequently
reverse orientation of the experiment and search for signals at the first and
second harmonics of the sidereal frequency. We constrain 4 of the 5 spatial
Lorentz-violating coefficients $c^n_{jk}$ that parameterize anisotropy of the
maximum attainable velocity of a neutron at a level of $10^{-29}$, improving
previous limits by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude and placing the most stringent
constrain on deviations from local Lorentz invariance.
