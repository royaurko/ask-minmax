In this paper we have analysed in detail two different purification
protocols. The first one, proposed by Sudarshan, is based on the preservation
of probabilities.We have constructed a second protocol here based on
optimisation of fidelities. We have considered both complete and partial
measurements and have established bounds and inequalities for various
fidelities. For every type of measurement, we have analysed post-measurement
states based on the Maximum entropy principle as well as what we have proposed
as unbiased states. We show that our purification protocol always leads to
better state reconstruction. These schemes can be thought of as operations in
the sense of Kraus and we have explicitly constructed the Kraus operators for
these. We have also shown that the entropy either increases or remains the same
depending on the choice of the purification basis.
