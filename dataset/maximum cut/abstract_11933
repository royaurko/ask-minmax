The La2-xPrxCayBa2Cu4+yOz (LaPrCaBCO) mixed oxides have been studied for
their structural and superconducting properties using X-ray diffraction (XRD),
d. c. resistivity, d. c. susceptibility and iodometric double titration. All
the LaPrCaBCO samples for x = 0.1 - 0.5, exhibit tetragonal crystalline
structure with P 4/mmm space group as determined by Rietveld analysis of the
X-ray diffraction data. With increasing x, enhancement in Tc is observed, which
is quite interesting for Pr substituted high Tc oxides. Maximum Tc ~ 58 K has
been observed for x = 0.5(La-2125 stoichiometry). The results of structural
studies and superconducting property measurements are presented in light of
increase in Tc in LaPrCaBCO system with increasing Pr concentration.
