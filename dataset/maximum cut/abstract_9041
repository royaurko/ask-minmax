The dynamics of a simple spin chain (2 spins) coupled to bosonic baths at
different temperatures is studied. The analytical solution for the reduced
density matrix of the system is found. The dynamics and temperature dependence
of spin-spin entanglement is analyzed. It is shown that the system converges to
a steady-state. If the energy levels of the two spins are different, the
steady-state concurrence assumes its maximum at unequal bath temperatures. It
is found that a difference in local energy levels can make the steady-state
entanglement more stable against high temperatures.
