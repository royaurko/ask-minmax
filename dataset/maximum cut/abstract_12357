The standard formula for mass oscillations is often based upon the
approximation $t \approx L$ and the hypotheses that neutrinos have been
produced with a definite momentum $p$ or, alternatively, with definite energy
$E$. This represents an inconsistent scenario and gives an unjustified
reduction by a factor of two in the mass oscillation formulas. Such an
ambiguity has been a matter of speculations and mistakes in discussing flavour
oscillations. We present a series of results and show how the problem of the
factor two in the oscillation length is not a consequence of gedanken
experiments, i.e. oscillations in time. The common velocity scenario yields the
maximum simplicity.
