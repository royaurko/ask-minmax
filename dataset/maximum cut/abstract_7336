We propose a new way of quick and very efficient acceleration of protons
and/or electrons in relativistic bulk flows. The new mechanism takes advantage
of conversion of particles from the charged state (protons or
electrons/positrons) into neutral state (neutrons or photons) and back. In most
cases, the conversion is photon-induced and requires presence of intense
radiation fields, but the converter acceleration mechanism may also operate via
inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions.
  Like in the traditional model -- ``stochastic'' (or diffusive) acceleration,
-- the acceleration cycle in our scenario consists of escape of particles from
the relativistic flow followed by their return back after deflection from the
ambient magnetic field. The difference is that the charge-changing reactions,
which occur during the cycle, allow accelerated particles to increase their
energies in each cycle by a factor roughly equal to the bulk Lorentz factor
squared.
  The emerging spectra of accelerated particles can be very hard and their
cut-off energy in some cases is larger than in the standard mechanism. This
drastically reduces the required energy budget of the sources of the
highest-energy particles observed in cosmic rays. Also, the proposed
acceleration mechanism may serve as an efficient means of transferring the
energy of bulk motion to gamma-radiation and, if the accelerated particles are
nucleons, routinely produces high-energy neutrinos at $\sim 50 %$ relative
efficiency.
