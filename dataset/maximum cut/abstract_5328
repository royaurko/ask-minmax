We study the polarisation of gauge bosons produced at the LHC. Polarisation
effects for W bosons manifest themselves in the angular distributions of the
lepton and in the distributions of lepton transverse momentum and missing
transverse energy. The distributions also depend on the selection cuts, with
kinematic effects competing with polarisation effects. The polarisation is
discussed for a range of different processes producing W bosons: W+jets, W from
top (single and pair) production, W pair production and W production in
association with a Z or Higgs boson. The relative contributions of the
different polarisation states varies from process to process, reflecting the
dynamics of the underlying hard-scattering process. We also present results for
the polarisation of the Z boson produced in association with QCD jets at the
LHC, and comment on the differences between W and Z production.
