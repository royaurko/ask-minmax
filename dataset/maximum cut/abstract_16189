We detect HCN J=5-4 emission from the ultraluminous quasar APM08279+5255 at
z=3.911 using the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer. This object is strongly
gravitationally lensed, yet still thought to be one of the most intrinsically
luminous objects in the Universe. The new data imply a line luminosity
L'_HCN(J=5-4) = 4.0+/-0.5 x 10^(10) K km/s pc^2. The ~440 km/s full width half
maximum of the HCN J=5-4 line matches that of the previously observed high-J CO
lines in this object and suggests that the emission from both species emerges
from the same region: a warm, dense circumnuclear disk. Simple radiative
transfer models suggest an enhanced abundance of HCN relative to CO in the
nuclear region of APM08279+5255, perhaps due to increased ionization, or
possibly the selective depletion of oxygen. The ratio of far-infrared
luminosity to HCN luminosity is at the high end of the range found for nearby
star forming galaxies, but comparable to that observed in the few high redshift
objects detected in the HCN J=1-0 line. This is the first clear detection of
high-J HCN emission redshifted into the 3-millimeter atmospheric window.
