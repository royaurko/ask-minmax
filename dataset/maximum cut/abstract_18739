The Y. T. Lee Array for Microwave Background (AMiBA) has reported the first
science results on the detection of galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev Zel'dovich
effect. The science objectives required small reflectors in order to sample
large scale structures (20') while interferometry provided modest resolutions
(2'). With these constraints, we designed for the best sensitivity by utilizing
the maximum possible continuum bandwidth matched to the atmospheric window at
86-102GHz, with dual polarizations. A novel wide-band analog correlator was
designed that is easily expandable for more interferometer elements. MMIC
technology was used throughout as much as possible in order to miniaturize the
components and to enhance mass production. These designs will find application
in other upcoming astronomy projects. AMiBA is now in operations since 2006,
and we are in the process to expand the array from 7 to 13 elements.
