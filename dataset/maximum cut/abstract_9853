Direction-dependent anisotropic exchange is a common feature of magnetic
systems with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here we study the effect of such
exchange upon macroscopic magnetic anisotropy for a face-centered-cubic model.
By several theoretical techniques, we show that, both in the paramagnetic and
ordered phases, the magnetic anisotropy is induced by fluctuations. Moreover,
the magnetic anisotropy differs in the paramagnetic and ordered phases: in the
paramagnetic phase the susceptibility is maximum along the $\langle111\rangle$
directions, while the magnetic moments orient along $\langle110\rangle$ or
$\langle100\rangle$ in the ordered phase. We suggest that such "anisotropy
switching" can be a common feature of strongly spin-orbit coupled magnets.
