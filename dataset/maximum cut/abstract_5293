A simple characterization is given of open subsets of a complex surface that
smoothly perturb to Stein open subsets. As applications, complex 2-space C^2
contains domains of holomorphy (Stein open subsets) that are exotic R^4's, and
others homotopy equivalent to the 2-sphere but cut out by smooth, compact
3-manifolds. Pseudoconvex embeddings of Brieskorn spheres and other 3-manifolds
into complex surfaces are constructed, as are pseudoconcave holomorphic
fillings (with disagreeing contact and boundary orientations). Pseudoconcave
complex structures on Milnor fibers are found. A byproduct of this construction
is a simple polynomial expression for the signature of the (p,q,npq-1) Milnor
fiber. Akbulut corks in complex surfaces can always be chosen to be
pseudoconvex or pseudoconcave submanifods. The main theorem is expressed via
Stein handlebodies (possibly infinite), which are defined holomorphically in
all dimensions by extending Stein theory to manifolds with noncompact boundary.
