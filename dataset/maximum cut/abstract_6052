The Universe owns the electronic radiation of blackbody at temperature 2.725
K, which we call the cosmic electron background. We calculate its radiation
spectrum. The energy distribution of number density of electrons in the cosmic
electron background becomes zero as energy goes to both zero and infinity. It
has one maximum peak near the energy level of 10**(-23) J.
