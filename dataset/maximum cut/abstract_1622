We compute the integrand of the full-colour, two-loop, five-gluon scattering
amplitude in pure Yang-Mills theory with all helicities positive, using
generalized unitarity cuts. Tree-level BCJ relations, satisfied by amplitudes
appearing in the cuts, allow us to deduce all the necessary non-planar
information for the full-colour amplitude from known planar data. We present
our result in terms of irreducible numerators, with colour factors derived from
the multi-peripheral colour decomposition. Finally, the leading soft
divergences are checked to reproduce the expected infrared behaviour.
