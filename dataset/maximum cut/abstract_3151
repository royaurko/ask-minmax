In this paper, for the decoy state method using a finite number of decoy
light intensities, we present an improved upper and lower bounds for the
asymptotic yield y_n for n-photon states. In particular if all the light
intensities are less than or equal to one, they are not only a lower or upper
bound, but in fact are the exact minimum or maximum.
