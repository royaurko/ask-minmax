We study numerically and experimentally magnetic metamaterials based on
cut-wire pairs instead of split-ring resonators. The cut-wire pair planar
structure is extended in order to create a truly two-dimensional metamaterial
suitable for scaling to optical frequencies. We fabricate the cut-wire
metamaterial operating at microwave frequencies with lattice spacing around 10%
of the free-space wavelength, and find good agreement with direct numerical
simulations. Unlike the structures based on split-ring resonators, the
nearest-neighbor coupling in cut-wire pairs can result in a magnetic stop-band
with propagation in the transverse direction.
