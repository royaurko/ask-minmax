The aim of this work is to demonstrate the properties of the magnetospheric
model around Kerr blackholes (BHs), so-called the fly-wheel (rotation driven)
model. The fly-wheel engine of the BH-accretion disk system is applied to the
statistics of QSOs/AGNs. In the model, the central BH is assumed to be formed
at $z \sim 10^2$ and obtains nearly maximum but finite rotation energy ($\sim$
extreme Kerr BH) at the formation stage. The inherently obtained rotation
energy of the Kerr BH is released through an magnetohydrodynamic process. This
model naturally leads finite lifetime of AGN activity.
  Nitta et al. (1991) clarified individual evolution of Kerr BH fly-wheel
engine which is parametrized by BH mass, initial Kerr parameter, magnetic field
near the horizon and a dimension-less small parameter. We impose a statistical
model for the initial mass function (IMF) of ensemble of BHs by the
Press-Schechter formalism. By the help of additional assumptions, we can
discuss the evolution of the luminosity function and the spatial number density
of QSOs/AGNs.
