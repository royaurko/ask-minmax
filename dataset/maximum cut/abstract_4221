The Lorentz structure of the tau lepton's charged-current can almost be
completely determined by use of stage-two spin-correlation functions for the
$\{\rho ^{-},\rho ^{+}\}$and $\{a_1^{-},a_1^{+}\}$ decay modes. It is possible
to test for a ``$(V-A)$ $ + $ something'' structure in the
${J^{Charged}}_{Lepton}$ current, so as to bound the scales $\Lambda$ for ``new
physics" such as arising from tau weak magnetism, weak electricity, and/or
2nd-class currents. In practice, only limited information can be obtained from
the $\tau \rightarrow \pi \nu$ modes.
