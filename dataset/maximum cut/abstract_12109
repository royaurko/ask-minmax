We discuss the Luttinger Liquid behaviour of a semiconducting Quantum Wire.
We show that the measured value of the bulk critical exponent, $\alpha_{bulk}$,
for the tunneling density of states can be easily calculated.
  Then, the problem of the transport through a Quantum Dot formed by two
Quantum Point Contacts along the Quantum Wire, weakly coupled to spinless
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids is studied, including the action of a strong
transverse magnetic field $B$.
 The known magnetic dependent peaks of the conductance, $G(B)$, in the
ballistic regime at a very low temperature, $T$, have to be reflected also in
the transport at higher $T$ and in different regimes. The temperature
dependence of the maximum $G_{max}$ of the conductance peak, according to the
Correlated Sequential Tunneling theory, yields the power law $G_{max}\propto
T^{2\alpha_{end}-1}$, with the critical exponent, $\alpha_{end}$, strongly
reduced by $B$.
  This behaviour suggests the use of a similar device as a magnetic field
modulated transistor.
