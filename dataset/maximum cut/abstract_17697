We trace the full evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars ($1 M_{\odot}
\leq M \leq 8M_{\odot}$) during the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase in the
{\it Spitzer} two-color and color-magnitude diagrams. We follow the formation
and growth of dust particles in the circumstellar envelope with an
isotropically expanding wind, in which gas molecules impinge upon pre--existing
seed nuclei, favour their growth. These models are the first able to identify
the main regions in the {\it Spitzer} data occupied by AGB stars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The main diagonal sequence traced by LMC extreme stars
in the [3.6]-[4.5] vs. [5.8]-[8.0] and [3.6]-[8.0] vs. [8.0] planes are nicely
fit by carbon stars models; it results to be an evolutionary sequence with the
reddest objects being at the final stages of their AGB evolution. The most
extreme stars, with [3.6]-[4.5] $>$ 1.5 and [3.6]-[8.0] $>$ 3, are 2.5-3
$M_{\odot}$ stars surrounded by solid carbon grains. In higher mass ($>3
M_{\odot}$) models dust formation is driven by the extent of Hot Bottom Burning
(HBB) - most of the dust formed is in the form of silicates and the maximum
obscuration phase by dust particles occurs when the HBB experienced is
strongest, before the mass of the envelope is considerably reduced.
