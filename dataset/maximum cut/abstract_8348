We use Renormalization Group ideas to study stability of moving fronts in the
Ginzburg-Landau equation in one spatial dimension. In particular, we prove
stability of the real fronts under complex perturbations. This extends the
results of Aronson and Weinberger to situations where the maximum principle is
inapplicable and constitutes a step in proving the general marginal stability
hypothesis for the Ginzburg-Landau equation.
