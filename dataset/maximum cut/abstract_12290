We investigate the behavior of a noncommutative radiating Schwarzschild black
hole. It is shown that coordinate noncommutativity cures usual problems
encountered in the description of the terminal phase of black hole evaporation.
More in detail, we find that: the evaporation end-point is a zero temperature
extremal black hole even in the case of electrically neutral, non-rotating,
objects; there exists a finite maximum temperature that the black hole can
reach before cooling down to absolute zero; there is no curvature singularity
at the origin, rather we obtain a regular DeSitter core at short distance.
