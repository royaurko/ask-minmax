The effect of slope for the rack gear in the massless scalar field model is
considered. It appears, that the slope of profile surfaces can essentially
change the value of normal Casimir force, whereas average value of tangential
force remains almost unchanged. At the same time we observe essential shift of
maximum and minimum tangential force positions.
