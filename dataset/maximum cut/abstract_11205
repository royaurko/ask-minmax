We present the results for the galaxy luminosity function as estimated from
the Durham/UKST Galaxy Redshift Survey. This survey is magnitude limited to bj
= 17, contains 2500 galaxies sampled at a rate of one in three and surveys a 4
x 10^6 Mpc^3 volume of space. The maximum likelihood parameters for a standard
Schechter luminosity function are estimated to be M*bj = -19.72+-0.09, alpha =
-1.14+-0.08 and phi* = (1.2 +- 0.2) x 10^-2 ( h^3Mpc^-3). A comparison with
galaxy luminosity functions from other redshift surveys shows good agreement
and the shape of the luminosity function now appears well-defined down to Mbj =
-17. There are some discrepancies between the different surveys for galaxies
fainter than this absolute magnitude. However, our estimate agrees well with
that from the APM-Stromlo Galaxy Redshift Survey and we measure a fairly flat
faint end slope.
