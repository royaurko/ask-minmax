In this paper, we prove a `cut-by-curves criterion' for an overconvergent
isocrystal on a smooth variety over a field of characteristic $p>0$ to extend
logarithmically to its smooth compactification whose complement is a strict
normal crossing divisor, under certain assumption. This is a $p$-adic analogue
of a version of cut-by-curves criterion for regular singuarity of an integrable
connection on a smooth variety over a field of characteristic 0. In the course
of the proof, we also prove a kind of cut-by-curves criteria on solvability,
highest ramification break and exponent of $\nabla$-modules.
