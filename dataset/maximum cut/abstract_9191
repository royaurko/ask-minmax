Using three different notions of generalized principal eigenvalue of linear
second order elliptic operators in unbounded domains, we derive necessary and
sufficient conditions for the validity of the maximum principle, as well as for
the existence of positive eigenfunctions satisfying Dirichlet boundary
conditions. Relations between these principal eigenvalues, their simplicity and
several other properties are further discussed.
