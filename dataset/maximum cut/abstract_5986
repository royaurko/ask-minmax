We consider how to accelerate fermionic molecular dynamics algorithms by
introducing n pseudofermion fields coupled with the nth root of the fermionic
kernel. This reduces the maximum pseudofermionic force, and thus allows a
larger molecular dynamics integration step size without hitting an instability
in the integrator.
