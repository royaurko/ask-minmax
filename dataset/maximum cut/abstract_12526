We are interested in the maximum possible number of facets that Dirichlet
stereohedra for three-dimensional crystallographic groups can have. The problem
for non-cubic groups was studied in previous papers by D. Bochis and the second
contributor (Discrete Comput. Geom. 25:3 (2001), 419-444, and Beitr. Algebra Geom.,
47:1 (2006), 89-120). This paper deals with ''full'' cubic groups, while
''quarter'' cubic groups are left for a subsequent paper. Here, ''full'' and
''quarter'' refers to the recent classification of three-dimensional
crystallographic groups by Conway, Delgado-Friedrichs, Huson and Thurston
(math.MG/9911185, Beitr. Algebra Geom. 42.2 (2001), 475-507).
  Our main result in this paper is that Dirichlet stereohedra for any of the 27
full groups cannot have more than 25 facets. We also find stereohedra with 17
facets for one of these groups.
