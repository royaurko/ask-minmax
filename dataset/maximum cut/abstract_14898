While insensitive to weak non magnetic disorder, an s-wave superconductor can
be driven insulating by strong disorder. Using a scheme that captures the
correct ground state, and fully retains thermal amplitude and phase
fluctuations, we describe the disorder driven superconductor-insulator
transition at finite temperature. Our results on the resistivity suggest that
beyond moderate disorder the low temperature superconducting state can arise
out of an insulating normal state. We also find that the low frequency weight
in the density of states and optical conductivity are non monotonic in
disorder, with a maximum near critical disorder, and their high temperature
value correlate with the superconducting fraction in the disordered ground
state.
