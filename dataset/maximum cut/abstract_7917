To understand the direct $J/\psi+X_{\mathrm{non-c\bar{c}}}$ production
mechanism in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation, in this work, we propose to measure the
inclusive $J/\psi$ plus light hadrons (LH) production at B-factories and
present a detailed study on its QED production due to $\psi(2S)$ feed-down,
where the $\psi(2S)$ are produced in $e^{+}e^{-}\to \psi(2S)+\gamma$ and
$e^{+}e^{-}\to \psi(2S)+f\bar{f}, f=lepton,light quark$, and QED contribution
to direct $J/\psi+q\bar{q}$ production with $q=u,d,s$ quark. We find that the
QED contribution is huge in the whole phase space region, but can be reduced
largely and is in the same order as the QCD contribution when a suitable cut on
the angel $\theta_{J/\psi}$ between $J/\psi$ and the $e^{+}e^{-}$ beam is made.
In this way, the cross section of $J/\psi+LH$ QCD production %which was
predicted theoretical at next-to-leading order QCD together with relativistic
correction, can be obtained by subtracting the QED contribution from the
experimental measurement on inclusive $J/\psi$ plus light hadrons. To help to
remove the QED background, we also calculate the angular and momentum
distribution of $J/\psi$ in the QED contribution.
