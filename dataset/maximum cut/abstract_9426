This paper describes an application of Bayesian programming to the control of
an autonomous avatar in a multiplayer role-playing game (the example is based
on World of Warcraft). We model a particular task, which consists of choosing
what to do and to select which target in a situation where allies and foes are
present. We explain the model in Bayesian programming and show how we could
learn the conditional probabilities from data gathered during human-played
sessions.
