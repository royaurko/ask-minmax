We derive the moments of the first passage time for Brownian motion
conditioned by either the maximum value or the area swept out by the motion.
These quantities are the natural counterparts to the moments of the maximum
value and area of Brownian excursions of fixed duration, which we also derive
for completeness within the same mathematical framework. Various applications
are indicated.
