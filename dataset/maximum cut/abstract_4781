The eigenvalue statistics of a pair $(M_1,M_2)$ of $n\times n$ Hermitian
matrices taken random with respect to the measure
  $$\frac{1}{Z_n}\exp\big(-n\Tr (V(M_1)+W(M_2)-\tau M_1M_2)\big) {\rm d}M_1
{\rm d} M_2 $$ can be described in terms of two families of biorthogonal
polynomials. In this paper we give a steepest descent analysis of a $4 \times
4$ matrix-valued Riemann-Hilbert problem characterizing one of the families of
biorthogonal polynomials in the special case $W(y)=y^4/4$ and $V$ an even
polynomial. As a result we obtain the limiting behavior of the correlation
kernel associated to the eigenvalues of $M_1$ (when averaged over $M_2$) in the
global and local regime as $n\to \infty$ in the one-cut regular case. A special
feature in the analysis is the introduction of a vector equilibrium problem
involving both an external field and an upper constraint.
