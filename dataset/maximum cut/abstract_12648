We study the equation of state (EOS) for dense matter in the core of the
compact star with hyperons and calculate the star structure in an effective
model in the mean field approach. With varying incompressibility and effective
nucleon mass, we analyse the resulting EOS with hyperons in beta equilibrium
and its underlying effect on the gross properties of the compact star
sequences. The results obtained in our analysis are compared with predictions
of other theoretical models and observations. The maximum mass of the compact
star lies in the range $1.21-1.96 ~M_{\odot}$ for the different EOS obtained,
in the model.
