Introducing a new infrared cut-off for the holographic dark-energy, we study
the correspondence between the quintessence, tachyon, K-essence and dilaton
energy density with this holographic dark energy density in the flat FRW
universe. This correspondence allows to reconstruct the potentials and the
dynamics for the scalar fields models, which describe accelerated expansion.
