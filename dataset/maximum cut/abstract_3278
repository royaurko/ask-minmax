We prove a maximum principle for local solutions of quasi-linear parabolic
stochastic PDEs, with non-homogeneous second order operator on a bounded domain
and driven by a space-time white noise. Our method based on an approximation of
the domain and the coefficients of the operator, does not require regularity
assumptions. As in previous works, the results are consequences of It\^{o}'s
formula and estimates for the positive part of local solutions which are
non-positive on the lateral boundary.
