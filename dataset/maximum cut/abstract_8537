A coupled map lattice of generalized Lotka-Volterra equations in the presence
of colored multiplicative noise is used to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution
of three interacting species: one predator and two preys symmetrically
competing each other. The correlation of the species concentration over the
grid as a function of time and of the noise intensity is investigated. The
presence of noise induces pattern formation, whose dimensions show a
nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the noise intensity. The colored noise
induces a greater dimension of the patterns with respect to the white noise
case and a shift of the maximum of its area towards higher values of the noise
intensity.
