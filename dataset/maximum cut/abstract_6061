We relate the entropy of entanglement of ensembles of random vectors to their
generalized fractal dimensions. Expanding the von Neumann entropy around its
maximum we show that the first order only depends on the participation ratio,
while higher orders involve other multifractal exponents. These results can be
applied to entanglement behavior near the Anderson transition.
