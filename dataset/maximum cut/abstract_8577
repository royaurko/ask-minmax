Structured language models for speech recognition have been shown to remedy
the weaknesses of n-gram models. All current structured language models are,
however, limited in that they do not take into account dependencies between
non-headwords. We show that non-headword dependencies contribute to
significantly improved word error rate, and that a data-oriented parsing model
trained on semantically and syntactically annotated data can exploit these
dependencies. This paper also contains the first DOP model trained by means of
a maximum likelihood reestimation procedure, which solves some of the
theoretical shortcomings of previous DOP models.
