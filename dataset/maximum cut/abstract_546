A cutting sequence is a symbolic coding of a linear trajectory on a
translation surface corresponding to the sequence of sides hit in a polygonal
representation of the surface. We characterize cutting sequences in a regular
hexagon with opposite sides identified by translations exploiting the same
procedure used by Smillie and Ulcigrai for the regular octagon. In the case of
the square, cutting sequences are the well known Sturmian sequences. We remark
the differences between the procedure used in the case of the square and the
one used in the cases of the regular hexagon and regular octagon. We also show
how to adapt the latter to work also in the case of the square, giving a new
characterization for this case. We also show how to create a dictionary to pass
from the symbolic coding with respect to the hexagon to the symbolic coding
with respect to the parallelogram representing it in the space of flat tori.
Finally we consider the Bouw-M\"oller surfaces $\mathscr M(3,4)$ and $\mathscr
M(4,3)$ and we use their semi-regular polygons representations to prove our
main result, which is a theorem analogous to the central step used to
characterize cutting sequences in the previous cases.
