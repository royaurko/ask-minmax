In general, the CHSH inequality $S \le 2$ is considered to provide an
\textit{upper} bound for classical correlations. In this note it is shown that
if incoming particles are allowed to be delayed ever so briefly, the inequality
can be inverted to $S \ge 2$ thus becoming a \textit{lower} bound for classical
correlations (maximum S=3). All interaction is strictly local and events are
neither dropped nor re-sequenced thus strictly conforming to the standard CHSH
setup. The key notion is that a (brief) delay in front of a detector is not a
causative intervention.
