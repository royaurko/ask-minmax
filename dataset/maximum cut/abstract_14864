We propose a novel method for maximum likelihood-based parameter inference in
nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian state space models. The method is an iterative
procedure with three steps. At each iteration a particle filter is used to
estimate the value of the log-likelihood function at the current parameter
iterate. Using these log-likelihood estimates, a surrogate objective function
is created by utilizing a Gaussian process model. Finally, we use a heuristic
procedure to obtain a revised parameter iterate, providing an automatic
trade-off between exploration and exploitation of the surrogate model. The
method is profiled on two state space models with good performance both
considering accuracy and computational cost.
