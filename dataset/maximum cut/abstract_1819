A maximum entropy production principle (MEPP) has been postulated to be a
criterion of stability for steady states of open systems [Martyushev et al.,
Phys. Rep. 426, 1 (2006)]. We find a necessary condition for stability of
steady solutions of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. This condition
violates MEPP.
