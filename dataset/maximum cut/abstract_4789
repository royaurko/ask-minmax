The renormalization of the chiral np interaction with Delta-excitations in
intermediate states is considered at next-to-leading order (NLO) and
next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO) for central waves. The inclusion of the
Delta-excitation as an explicit degree of freedom improves the convergence
properties of the effective field theory results for np scattering with respect
to Delta-less theory, and allows the existence of a deuteron bound state in the
infinite cut-off limit. The 1S_0 singlet and 3S_1 triplet phase shifts
reproduce data for p ~ m_pi. The role of spectral function regularization is
also discussed.
