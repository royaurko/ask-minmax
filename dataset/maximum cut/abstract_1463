Ongoing experiments at JLAB investigate the nuclear transparency in exclusive
rho0(770) electroproduction off nuclei. In this work we present transport model
predictions for the attenuation of rho0s in nuclei and for color transparency
(CT) effects as observable at CLAS with a 5 GeV electron beam energy. A full
event simulation presented here permits to study the impact of actual
experimental acceptance conditions and kinematical cuts. The exclusive
(e,e'rho0) cross section off nucleons is described by diffractive and color
string breaking mechanisms extended toward the onset of the deep inelastic
regime. Different hadronization and CT scenarios are compared. We show that a
detailed analysis of elementary cross section, nuclear effects and experimental
cuts is needed to reveal the early onset of rho0-CT at present JLAB energies.
