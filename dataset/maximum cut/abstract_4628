The gaseous Micromegas detector designed for the CERN Axion search experiment
CAST, operated smoothly during Phase-I, which included the 2003 and 2004
running periods. It exhibited linear response in the energy range of interest
(1-10keV), good spatial sensitivity and energy resolution (15-19% FWHM at
5.9keV)as well as remarkable stability. The detector's upgrade for the 2004
run, supported by the development of advanced offline analysis tools, improved
the background rejection capability, leading to an average rate 5x10^-5
counts/sec/cm^2/keV with 94% cut efficiency. Also, the origin of the detected
background was studied with a Monte Carlo simulation, using the GEANT4 package.
