We review recent progress in calculations of one-loop QCD amplitudes. By
imposing the consistency requirements of unitarity and correct behavior as the
momenta of two legs become collinear, we construct ansatze for one-loop
amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external legs. For supersymmetric
amplitudes, which can be thought of as components of QCD amplitudes, the cuts
uniquely specify the amplitude.
