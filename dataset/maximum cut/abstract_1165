We show that the class of multigraphs with at most $p$ connected components
and bonds of size at most $k$ is well-quasi-ordered by edge contraction for all
positive integers $p,k$. (A bond is a minimal non-empty edge cut.) We also
characterize canonical antichains for this relation and show that they are
fundamental.
