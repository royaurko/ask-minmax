Optical (BVRI) and infrared (JHK) photometry of the gamma-ray nova Nova Sco
2012 (V1324 Sco) is presented and the lightcurve reconstructed and discussed.
An interstellar reddening E(B-V)=1.23 is derived. Dust begun to form at an
early date in the nova, only one magnitude down and 20 days past maximum
optical brightness and caused an extinction of at least 6 magnitudes in V band,
that cleared some months later. This unusual early dust formation compromises
the application of the magnitude at maximum versus rate of decline (MMRD)
relations in estimating the distance to the nova.
