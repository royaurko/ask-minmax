We have calculated the low-field magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ of a system
consisting of non-interacting mono-dispersed nanoparticles using a classical
statistical approach. The model makes use of the assumption that the axes of
symmetry of all nanoparticles are aligned and oriented at a certain angle
$\psi$ with respect to the external magnetic field. An analytical expression
for the temperature dependence of the susceptibility $\chi(T)$ above the
blocking temperature is obtained. The derived expression is a generalization of
the Curie law for the case of anisotropic magnetic particles. We show that the
normalized susceptibility is a universal function of the ratio of the
temperature over the anisotropy constant for each angle $\psi$. In the case
that the easy-axis is perpendicular to the magnetic field the susceptibility
has a maximum. The temperature of the maximum allows one to determine the
anisotropy energy.
