Waves are superoscillatory where their local phase gradient exceeds the
maximum wavenumber in their Fourier spectrum. We consider the superoscillatory
area fraction of random optical speckle patterns. This follows from the joint
probability density function of intensity and phase gradient for isotropic
gaussian random wave superpositions. Strikingly, this fraction is 1/3 when all
the waves in the two-dimensional superposition have the same wavenumber. The
fraction is 1/5 for a disk spectrum. Although these superoscillations are weak
compared with optical fields with designed superoscillations, they are more
stable on paraxial propagation.
