The purpose of this study is to explore the population of X-ray point sources
in the bulge of M31, with the primary goal to contrast properties of various
subpopulations, such as persistent and transient sources, primordial LMXBs and
dynamically formed ones. Based on the data from 26 archival Chandra
observations we study the source content and properties of various
subpopulations of X-ray sources to a maximum distance of 12 arcmin from the
centre of M31. A study of the spatial distribution and the luminosity function
of the X-ray sources shows that the distribution of primordial LMXBs is
consistent with the distribution of the K-band light and that their luminosity
function flattens below ~10^{37} erg/s to the dN/dL proportional to 1/L law in
agreement with the behaviour found earlier for LMXBs in the Milky Way and in
Cen A. The luminosity function of dynamically formed LMXBs shows a prominent
fall-off below log(L_X)<36.5. Although the statistics is insufficient to claim
a genuine low-luminosity cut-off in the luminosity function, the best fit
powerlaw with a slope of -0.6+-0.2 is significantly flatter than the dN/dL
proportional to 1/L law. We found 28 transient X-ray sources. Their spatial
distribution follows the distribution of the persistent LMXBs within the
accuracy allowed by the limited number of transients.
