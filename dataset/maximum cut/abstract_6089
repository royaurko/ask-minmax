Let $m:=|E(G)|$ sufficiently large and $s:=(m-1)/3$. We show that unless the
maximum degree $\Delta > 2s$, there is a weighting $w:E\cup V\to \{0,1,...,s\}$
so that $w(uv)+w(u)+w(v)\ne w(u'v')+w(u')+w(v')$ whenever $uv\ne u'v'$ (such a
weighting is called {\em total edge irregular}). This validates a conjecture by
Ivanco and Jendrol' for large graphs, extending a result by Brandt, Miskuf and
Rautenbach.
