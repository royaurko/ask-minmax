In this paper we give tight upper bounds on the total domination number, the
weakly connected domination number and the connected domination number of a
graph in terms of order and Euler characteristic. We also present upper bounds
for the restrained bondage number, the total restrained bondage number and the
restricted edge connectivity of graphs in terms of the orientable/nonorientable
genus and maximum degree.
