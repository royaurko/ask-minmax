We have used over 10,000 early-type galaxies from the 6dF Galaxy Survey
(6dFGS) to construct the Fundamental Plane across the optical and near-infrared
passbands. We demonstrate that a maximum likelihood fit to a multivariate
Gaussian model for the distribution of galaxies in size, surface brightness and
velocity dispersion can properly account for selection effects, censoring and
observational errors, leading to precise and unbiased parameters for the
Fundamental Plane and its intrinsic scatter. This method allows an accurate and
robust determination of the dependencies of the Fundamental Plane on variations
in the stellar populations and environment of early-type galaxies.
