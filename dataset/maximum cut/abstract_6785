We have considered a hot strange star matter, just after the collapse of a
supernova, as a composition of strange, up and down quarks to calculate the
bulk properties of this system at finite temperature with the density dependent
bag constant. To parameterize the density dependent bag constant, we use our
results for the lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) calculations of
asymmetric nuclear matter. Our calculations for the structure properties of the
strange star at different temperatures indicate that its maximum mass decreases
by increasing the temperature. We have also compared our results with those of
a fixed value of the bag constant. It can be seen that the density dependent
bag constant leads to higher values of the maximum mass and radius for the
strange star.
