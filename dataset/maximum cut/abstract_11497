Motivated by recent 3-D calculations of the explosion of Type Ia supernova
via a pure deflagration we calculate the observed spectra at 15-25 days past
maximum light of a parameterized model which has a considerable fraction of
unburnt C+O in the central regions. Rather than attempting a self consistent
3-D calculation, which is beyond the scope of current computer codes, we modify
the composition structure of the 1-D deflagration model W7. In our exploratory
parameterized calculations, we find that a central concentration of C+O is not
ruled out by observations for the epochs we study. We briefly examine whether
nebular phase spectra could be incompatible with observations.
