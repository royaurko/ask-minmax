Recent progress suggests we are moving towards a quantitative understanding
of the whole cosmic ray spectrum, and that many bumps due to different
components and processes hide beneath a relatively smooth total flux between
knee and ankle. The knee is much better understood: the KASCADE observations
support a rather sharp rigidity cut-off; while theoretical developments (strong
magnetic field generation) indicate that supernova remnants (SNR) of different
types should indeed accelerate to a very similar rigidity. X-ray and TeV
observations of shell-type SNR produce evidence in favour of acceleration at
their outer boundaries. There is some still-disputed evidence that the
transition to extragalactic cosmic rays has already occurred just above 10**17
eV, unmarked by an "ankle", in which case the whole spectrum can be well
described by adding a single power-law source spectrum from many extragalactic
sources (but modified by energy losses) to the SNR pre-knee component, if the
sources photodisintegrate all nuclei. At the highest energy, the experiments
using fluorscence light to calibrate energy do not yet show any conflict with
an expected GZK "termination". GRBs seem not to make a significant
contribution.
