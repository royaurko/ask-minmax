Analysis of random censored life-time data along with some related stochastic
covariables is very important in several applied sciences like medical
research, population studies and planning etc. The parametric estimation
technique commonly used under this set-up is based on the efficient but
non-robust likelihood approach. In this paper, we propose a robust parametric
estimator for the censored data with stochastic covariates based on the minimum
density power divergence approach. The resulting estimator also have
competitive efficiency with respect to the maximum likelihood estimator under
the pure data. High robustness property of the proposed estimator with respect
to the presence of outliers in the data is examined through an appropriate
simulation study in the context of censored regression with stochastic
covariates. Further, the theoretical asymptotic properties of the proposed
estimator are also derived in terms of a general class of M-estimators based on
the estimating equation, which provide the framework for studying several
parametric estimators under the present set-up.
