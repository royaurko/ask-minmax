We compute the Lyapunov exponent, generalized Lyapunov exponents and the
diffusion constant for a Lorentz gas on a square lattice, thus having infinite
horizon. Approximate zeta functions, written in terms of probabilities rather
than periodic orbits, a re used in order to avoid the convergence problems of
cycle expansions. The emphasis is on the relation between the analytic
structure of the zeta function, where a branch cut plays an important role, and
the asymptotic dynamics of the system. We find a diverging diffusion constant
$D(t) \sim \log t$ and a phase transition for the generalized Lyapunov
exponents.
