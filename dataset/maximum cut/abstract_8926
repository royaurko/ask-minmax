We consider the effects of gate noise on the operation of an entanglement
purification protocol. We characterize the performance of the protocol by two
measures, the minimum purifiable input state fidelity, and the maximum output
state fidelity. Both these measures are a function of gate error rate. For
sufficiently large gate error rate these two measures converge, defining a
threshold on gate error rates. Numerically, we estimate this threshold to be
$9.2\times 10^{-2}$, which is achievable with many present day experimental
architectures. (This paper is written in an experimental rapid communication
format).
