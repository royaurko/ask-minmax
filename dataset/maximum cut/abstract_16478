Under general circumstances full thermal equilibrium may not be established
for a long period after perturbative or non-perturbative decay of the inflaton
has completed. One can instead have a distribution of particles which is in
kinetic equilibrium and evolves adiabatically during this period.
Number-violating reactions which are required to establish chemical equilibrium
can become efficient only at much later times. We highlight some of the
striking consequences of such a quasi-thermal Universe. In particular, thermal
gravitino production yields {\it no bound} on the maximum temperature of the
primordial thermal bath alone. As another consequence, the lower bound on the
mass of the lightest right-handed (s)neutrino from thermal leptogenesis can be
$\gg 10^{9}$ GeV. Depending on the phase, a Wino or Higgsino considerably
lighter than TeV, or a Bino in the bulk region, can be a viable {\it thermal}
dark matter candidate. Finally the electroweak symmetry may never be restored
in the early Universe, therefore weakening any hopes of realizing a successful
electroweak baryogenesis.
