A simple method, fishing high-Tc superconductor thin films out of liquid
nitrogen bath by a permanent magnet (field > Hc1) due to the effect of high
flux pinning, has been suggested to identify films having high critical current
density (Jc > 106 A/cm2 at 77 K) and thus a low microwave surface resistance
(Rs). We have demonstrated that a Nd-Fe-B magnet, having a maximum field of ~
0.5 T, could fish out Tl-1223 superconducting thin films on LSAT substrate with
a thickness of ~ 5000 Angstrong having Jc > 1 MA/cm2 (at 77 K) whereas it could
not fish out other films with Jc < 0.1 MA/cm2 at 77 K. The fished out films
exhibit Rs values 237 - 245 ((at 77 K and 10 GHz, which is lower than that (Rs
= 317 (() of the best YBCO film at the same temperature and frequency. On the
other hand, the non-fishable films show very high Rs values. This method is a
very simple tool to test for high Jc and good microwave properties of
superconducting films of large area which otherwise require a special and
expensive tool.
