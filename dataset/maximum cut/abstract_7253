A sequential dynamical system (SDS) consists of an undirected simple graph
$Y$ with vertices $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n$, a collection of vertex functions
$\{f_{v_i}\}_{i=1}^n$, a permutation $\pi\in S_n$, and a collection of states
$A$. The vertices update their states in a sequential order specified by $\pi$
using the vertex functions $\{f_{v_i}\}_{i=1}^n$. Any sequential dynamical
system gives rise to an SDS-map $[Y,\{f_{v_i}\}_{i=1}^n,\pi]$, which maps each
initial configuration of vertex states to the new configuration of states
obtained after each vertex updates. When all vertex functions are equal to the
same function $f$, we write the SDS-map as $[Y,f,\pi]$.
  Let $\eta_n$ denote the maximum number of periodic orbits of period $2$ that
an SDS-map of the form $[K_n,f,\pi]$ can have. We show that $\eta_n$ is equal
to the maximum number of codewords in a binary code of length $n-1$ with
minimum distance at least $3$.
