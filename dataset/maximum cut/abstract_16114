We have performed intermediate-resolution VLT/FORS spectroscopy and HST/ACS
imaging of 129 field spiral galaxies within the FORS Deep Field. The galaxies
cover the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.0 and comprise all types from Sa to
Sdm/Im. Spatially resolved rotation curves were extracted and fitted with
synthetic velocity fields that take into account all geometric (e.g.,
inclination and misalignment) and observational effects (in particular,
blurring due to optical beam smearing and seeing). Using these fits, the
maximum rotation velocity Vmax could be determined for 73 objects. The
Tully-Fisher relation of this sample at a mean look-back time of ~5Gyr shows a
luminosity evolution which amounts to ~2mag in rest-frame B for low-mass
spirals (Vmax~100km/s) but is negligible for high-mass spirals (Vmax~300km/s).
This confirms our previous analysis which was limited to ground-based imaging.
The observed overluminosity of low-mass galaxies is at variance with
predictions from simulations. On the other hand, at given Vmax, we find
slightly smaller disk sizes towards higher redshifts, in compliance with the
CDM hierarchical model. The observed mass-dependent luminosity evolution might
therefore point towards the need for a more realistic modelling of the stellar
(i.e. baryonic) component in N-body codes.
