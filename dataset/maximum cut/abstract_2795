We develop a stabilized discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator that is used to
compute an approximate mean curvature vector which enjoys convergence of order
one in L2. The stabilization is of gradient jump type and we consider both
standard meshed surfaces and so called cut surfaces that are level sets of
piecewise linear distance functions. We prove a priori error estimates and
verify the theoretical results numerically.
