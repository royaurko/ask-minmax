This paper presents an approach to the creation of a variant of Extended
Special Relativity that takes into consideration the existence of limiting
relativistically invariant quantities (Planck parameters). It shows the
possibility of excluding unphysical predictions of relativity theories thanks
to the use of the concept of the maximum velocity of the observed motion of
objects. It proposes a model of a vacuum-like medium with a kinematical
property of relativistically invariant rest. The Planck quantities are
considered as fundamental physical constants related to the structure of this
medium.
