We present an extensive new time-series of spectroscopic data of the peculiar
SN 1999aa in NGC 2595. Our data set includes 25 optical spectra between -11 and
+58 days with respect to B-band maximum light, providing an unusually complete
time history. The early spectra resemble those of a SN 1991T-like object but
with a relatively strong Ca H&K absorption feature. The first clear sign of Si
II 6355, characteristic of Type Ia supernovae, is found at day -7 and its
velocity remains constant up to at least the first month after B-band maximum
light. The transition to normal-looking spectra is found to occur earlier than
in SN 1991T suggesting SN 1999aa as a possible link between SN 1991T-like and
Branch-normal supernovae. Comparing the observations with synthetic spectra,
doubly ionized Fe, Si and Ni are identified at early epochs. These are
characteristic of SN 1991T-like objects. Furthermore, in the day -11 spectrum,
evidence is found for an absorption feature which could be identified as high
velocity C II 6580 or H-alpha. At the same epoch C III 4648.8 at photospheric
velocity is probably responsible for the absorption feature at 4500 A. High
velocity Ca is found around maximum light together with Si II and Fe II
confined in a narrow velocity window. Implied constraints on supernovae
progenitor systems and explosion hydrodynamical models are briefly discussed.
