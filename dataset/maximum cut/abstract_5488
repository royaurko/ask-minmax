Motivated by the current observation of a 125 GeV Higgs boson, we calculate
$t\rightarrow cH$ and $t\rightarrow cg(\gamma)H$ in the unitary gauge in the
littlest Higgs model with T-parity(LHT). Due to the large contribution from the
new mirror fermions, we find that the branching ratios of $t\rightarrow cH$ and
$t\rightarrow cgH$ can be greatly enhanced in the LHT model and maximally reach
$\mathcal O(10^{-5})$ in the allowed parameter space. When the mirror fermion
mass $M_3 > 2(1.5)$ TeV and the cut-off scale $f=500$ GeV, the process of $pp
\to t\bar{t} \to 3b +c +\ell+ \slashed E_{T}^{miss}$ can reach
$3\sigma$($5\sigma$) sensitivity at 8(14) TeV LHC with luminosity $\cal{L}$
$=20(300) fb^{-1}$.
