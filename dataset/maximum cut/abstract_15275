In an ideal topological insulator, the helical spin structure of surface
electrons suppresses backscattering and thus can enhance surface conductivity.
We investigate the effect of perpendicular magnetic field on the spin structure
of electrons at the Fermi energy and calculate a magnetic-field dependent
topological enhancement factor for different disorder potentials, ranging from
short-range disorder to screened Coulomb potential. Within the Boltzmann
approximation, the topological enhancement factor reaches its maximum value of
4 for a short-range disorder at zero magnetic field and approaches a value of 1
at high magnetic fields independent of the nature of the disorder potential.
