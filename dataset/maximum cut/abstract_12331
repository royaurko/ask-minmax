We extract the spectral functions in the scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector, and
axial vector channels above the deconfinement phase transition temperature (Tc)
using the maximum entropy method (MEM). We use anisotropic lattices, 32^3 * 32,
40, 54, 72, 80, and 96 (corresponding to T = 2.3 Tc --> 0.8 Tc), with the
renormalized anisotropy xi = 4.0 to have enough temporal data points to carry
out the MEM analysis. Our result suggests that the spectral functions continue
to possess non-trivial structures even above Tc and in addition that there is a
qualitative change in the state of the deconfined matter between 1.5 Tc and 2
Tc.
