A Particle-in-Cell (PIC) numerical simulation of the electron Weibel
instability is applied in a frame of Darwin (radiationless) approximation of
the self-consistent fields of sparse plasma. As a result, we were able to
supplement the classical picture of the instability and, in particular, to
obtain the dependency of the basic characteristics (the time of development and
the maximum field energy) of the thermal anisotropy parameter, to trace the
dynamic restructuring of current filaments accompanying the nonlinear stage of
the instability and to trace in detail the evolution of the initial anisotropy
of the electron component of plasma.
