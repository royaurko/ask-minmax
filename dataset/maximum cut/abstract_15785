Clusters of galaxies at redshifts nearing one are of special importance since
they may be caught at the epoch of formation. At these high redshifts there are
very few known clusters. We present follow-up ASCA, ROSAT HRI and Keck LRIS
observations of the cluster RXJ1716.6+6708 which was discovered during the
optical identification of X-ray sources in the North Ecliptic Pole region of
the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. At z=0.809, RXJ1716.6+6708 is the second most distant
X-ray selected cluster so far published and the only one with a large number of
spectroscopically determined cluster member velocities. The optical morphology
of RXJ1716.6+6708 resembles an inverted S-shape filament with the X-rays coming
from the midpoint of the filament. The X-ray contours have an elongated shape
that roughly coincide with the weak lensing contours. The cluster has a low
temperature, kT=5.66{+1.37 -0.58} keV, and a very high velocity dispersion
sigma_{los}=1522{+215 -150} km s^{-1}. While the temperature is commensurate
with its X-ray luminosity of (8.19 +/- 0.43)x10^{44} h_{50}^{-2} erg s^{-1}
(2-10 keV rest frame), its velocity dispersion is much higher than expected
from the sigma-T_X relationship of present-day clusters with comparable X-ray
luminosity. RXJ1716.6+6708 could be an example of a protocluster, where matter
is flowing along filaments and the X-ray flux is maximum at the impact point of
the colliding streams of matter.
