In this paper, we address the problem of distributing a large amount of bulk
data to a sparse vehicular network from roadside infostations, using efficient
vehicle-to-vehicle collaboration. Due to the highly dynamic nature of the
underlying vehicular network topology, we depart from architectures requiring
centralized coordination, reliable MAC scheduling, or global network state
knowledge, and instead adopt a distributed paradigm with simple protocols. In
other words, we investigate the problem of reliable dissemination from multiple
sources when each node in the network shares a limited amount of its resources
for cooperating with others. By using \emph{rateless} coding at the Road Side
Unit (RSU) and using vehicles as data carriers, we describe an efficient way to
achieve reliable dissemination to all nodes (even disconnected clusters in the
network). In the nutshell, we explore vehicles as mobile storage devices. We
then develop a method to keep the density of the rateless codes packets as a
function of distance from the RSU at the desired level set for the target
decoding distance. We investigate various tradeoffs involving buffer size,
maximum capacity, and the mobility parameter of the vehicles.
