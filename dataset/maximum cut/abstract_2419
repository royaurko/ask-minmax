A coordinate space approach, based on that used by Efimov, is applied to
three-body systems with contact interactions between pairs of particles. In
systems with nonzero orbital angular momentum or with asymmetric spatial wave
functions, the hyperradial equation contains a repulsive 1/r^2 potential. The
resulting wave functions are used in a renormalisation group analysis. This
confirms Griesshammer's power counting for short-range three-body forces in
these systems. The only exceptions are ones like the 4S channel for three
nucleons, where any derivatives needed in the interaction are found to be
already counted by the scaling with the cut-off.
