A novel strategy to encrypt covert information (code) via unitary projections
into the null spaces of ill-conditioned eigenstructures of multiple host
statistical distributions, inferred from incomplete constraints, is presented.
The host pdf's are inferred using the maximum entropy principle. The projection
of the covert information is dependent upon the pdf's of the host statistical
distributions. The security of the encryption/decryption strategy is based on
the extreme instability of the encoding process. A self-consistent procedure to
derive keys for both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography is presented. The
advantages of using a multiple pdf model to achieve encryption of covert
information are briefly highlighted. Numerical simulations exemplify the
efficacy of the model.
