This paper shows that customised broadband absorption of electromagnetic
waves having arbitrary polarisation is possible by use of lossy cut-wire (CW)
metamaterials. These useful features are confirmed by numerical simulations in
which different lengths of CW pairs are combined as one periodic metamaterial
unit and placed near to a perfect electric conductor (PEC). So far metamaterial
absorbers have exhibited some interesting features, which are not available
from conventional absorbers, e.g. straightforward adjustment of electromagnetic
properties and size reduction. The paper shows how with proper design a broad
range of absorber characteristics may be obtained.
