We demonstrate how to resum phase space logarithms in the Sterman-Weinberg
(SW) dijet decay rate within the context of Soft Collinear Effective theory
(SCET). An operator basis corresponding to two and three jet events is defined
in SCET and renormalized. We obtain the RGE of the two and three jet operators
and run the operators from the scale $\mu^2 = Q^2$ to the phase space scale $
\mu^2_\delta = \delta^2 Q^2$. This phase space scale, where $\delta$ is the
cone half angle of the jet, defines the angular region of the jet. At $
\mu^2_{\delta}$ we determine the mixing of the three and two jet operators. We
combine these results with the running of the two jet shape function, which we
run down to an energy cut scale $\mu^2_{\beta}$. This defines the resumed SW
dijet decay rate in the context of SCET. The approach outlined here
demonstrates how to establish a jet definition in the context of SCET. This
allows a program of systematically improving the theoretical precision of jet
phenomenology to be carried out.
