In this work we consider a periodically forced generic integrate-and-fire
model with a unique attracting equilibrium in the subthreshold dynamics and
study the dependence of the firing-rate on the frequency of the drive. In an
earlier study we have obtained rigorous results on the bifurcation structure in
such systems, with emphasis on the relation between the firing-rate and the
rotation number of the existing periodic orbits. In this work we study how
these bifurcation structures behave upon variation of the frequency of the
input. This allows us to show that the dependence of the firing-rate on
frequency of the drive follows a devil's staircase with non-monotonic steps and
that there is an optimal response in the whole frequency domain. We also
characterize certain bounded frequency windows in which the firing-rate
exhibits a bell-shaped envelope with a global maximum.
