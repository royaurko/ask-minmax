This paper deals with the long time behavior of solutions to the spatially
homogeneous Boltzmann equation. The interactions considered are the so-called
(non cut-off and non mollified) hard potentials. We prove an exponential in
time convergence towards the equilibrium, improving results of Villani from
\cite{Vill1} where a polynomial decay to equilibrium is proven. The basis of
the proof is the study of the linearized equation for which we prove a new
spectral gap estimate in a $L^1$ space with a polynomial weight by taking
advantage of the theory of enlargement of the functional space for the
semigroup decay developed by Gualdani and al in \cite{GMM}. We then get our
final result by combining this new spectral gap estimate with bilinear
estimates on the collisional operator that we establish.
