Abstract: The number of points $x=(x_1 ,x_2 ,...x_n)$ that lie in an integer
cube $C$ in $R^n$ and satisfy the constraints $\sum_j h_{ij}(x_j )=s_i ,1\le
i\le d$ is approximated by an Edgeworth-corrected Gaussian formula based on the
maximum entropy density $p$ on $x \in C$, that satisfies $E\sum_j h_{ij}(x_j
)=s_i ,1\le i\le d$. Under $p$, the variables $X_1 ,X_2 ,...X_n $ are
independent with densities of exponential form. Letting $S_i$ denote the random
variable $\sum_j h_{ij}(X_j )$, conditional on $S=s, X$ is uniformly
distributed over the integers in $C$ that satisfy $S=s$. The number of points
in $C$ satisfying $S=s$ is $p \{S=s\}\exp (I(p))$ where $I(p)$ is the entropy
of the density $p$. We estimate $p \{S=s\}$ by $p_Z(s)$, the density at $s$ of
the multivariate Gaussian $Z$ with the same first two moments as $S$; and when
$d$ is large we use in addition an Edgeworth factor that requires the first
four moments of $S$ under $p$. The asymptotic validity of the
Edgeworth-corrected estimate is proved and demonstrated for counting
contingency tables with given row and column sums as the number of rows and
columns approaches infinity, and demonstrated for counting the number of graphs
with a given degree sequence, as the number of vertices approaches infinity.
