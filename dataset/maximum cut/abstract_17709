We explore the sensitivity of the Higgs decay to four leptons, the so-called
golden channel, to higher dimensional loop-induced couplings of the Higgs boson
to $ZZ$, $Z\gamma$, and $\gamma\gamma$, allowing for general CP mixtures. The
larger standard model tree level coupling $hZ^\mu Z_\mu$ is the dominant
"background" for the loop induced couplings. However this large background
interferes with the smaller loop induced couplings, enhancing the sensitivity.
We perform a maximum likelihood analysis based on analytic expressions of the
fully differential decay width for $h\to 4\ell$ ($4\ell \equiv 2e2\mu, 4e,
4\mu$) including all interference effects. We find that the spectral shapes
induced by Higgs couplings to photons are particularly different than the
$hZ^\mu Z_\mu$ background leading to enhanced sensitivity to these couplings.
We show that even if the $h\to\gamma\gamma$ and $h\to 4\ell$ rates agree with
that predicted by the Standard Model, the golden channel has the potential to
probe both the CP nature as well as the overall sign of the Higgs coupling to
photons well before the end of high-luminosity LHC running ($\sim$3 ab$^{-1}$).
