We reanalyze high energy QCD scattering regimes from scattering in cut-off
AdS via gravity-gauge dualities (a la Polchinski-Strassler). We look at 't
Hooft scattering, Regge behaviour and black hole creation in AdS. Black hole
creation in the gravity dual is analyzed via gravitational shockwave
collisions. We prove the saturation of the QCD Froissart unitarity bound,
corresponding to the creation of black holes of AdS size, as suggested by
Giddings.
