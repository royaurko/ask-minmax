We model the static behavior of point Josephson junctions in a micro strip
line using a 1D linear differential equation with delta distributed sine
non-linearities. We analyze the maximum current $\gamma_{max}$ crossing the
micro strip for a given magnetic field $H$. In particular we establish its
periodicity and analyze how it is affected by the geometry, length, type of
current feed, position and area of the junctions. For small currents, which is
the rule in practice, we show that $\gamma_{max}$ can be obtained by a simple
formula, the magnetic approximation. This model is in excellent agreement with
measurements obtained for real devices.
