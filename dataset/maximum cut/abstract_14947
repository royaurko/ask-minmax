We study two extremal problems about subgraphs excluding a family $\F$ of
graphs. i) Among all graphs with $m$ edges, what is the smallest size $f(m,\F)$
of a largest $\F$--free subgraph? ii) Among all graphs with minimum degree
$\delta$ and maximum degree $\Delta$, what is the smallest minimum degree
$h(\delta,\Delta,\F)$ of a spanning $\F$--free subgraph with largest minimum
degree? These questions are easy to answer for families not containing any
bipartite graph. We study the case where $\F$ is composed of all even cycles of
length at most $2r$, $r\geq 2$. In this case, we give bounds on $f(m,\F)$ and
$h(\delta,\Delta,\F)$ that are essentially asymptotically tight up to a
logarithmic factor. In particular for every graph $G$, we show the existence of
subgraphs with arbitrarily high girth, and with either many edges or large
minimum degree. These subgraphs are created using probabilistic embeddings of a
graph into extremal graphs.
