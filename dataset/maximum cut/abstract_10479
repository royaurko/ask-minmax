We present a full description of the N-probability density function of the
galaxy number density fluctuations. This N-pdf is given in terms, on the one
hand, of the cold dark matter correlations and, on the other hand, of the
galaxy bias parameter. The method relies on the assumption commonly adopted
that the dark matter density fluctuations follow a local non-linear
transformation of the initial energy density perturbations. The N-pdf of the
galaxy number density fluctuations allows for an optimal estimation of the bias
parameter (e.g., via maximum-likelihood estimation, or Bayesian inference if
there exists any \emph{a priori} information on the bias parameter). It also
provides the proper framework to perform model selection between two
competitive hypotheses (e.g., galaxy biasing versus a one-to-one relation
between the galaxy number density and the dark matter perturbations). The bias
estimation capabilities of the N-pdf are proved by SDSS-like simulations,
showing that our estimator is unbiased. We apply our formalism to the 7th
release of the SDSS main sample (for a volume-limited subset with absolute
magnitudes $M_r \leq -20$). We obtain a maximum-likelihood bias estimate
$\hat{b} = 1.500 \pm 0.036$, for galaxy number density fluctuations in cells of
the size of $30h^{-1}$Mpc. Different model selection criteria show that galaxy
biasing is clearly favoured.
