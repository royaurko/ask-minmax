We report photometry of three outbursts of NN Cam in 2007, 2008 and 2009. The
2007 event started with a normal outburst, lasting about 4 days, which was a
precursor to a superoutburst lasting at least 13 days. Both the precursor and
the superoutburst had an amplitude of 4.9 mag above mean quiescence. Superhumps
with a maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.22 mag were detected during the
superoutburst with a mean superhump period Psh = 0.07385(56) d. Psh decreased
continuously with dPsh /dt = -1.72(23) x 10-3. We used our measurement to
confirm that the shorter of two possible values of Porb reported by another
researcher is the correct one, Porb = 0.0717 d. The 2008 outburst was rather
poorly observed, although we present evidence that this too may have been a
superoutburst. The 2009 event was also a superoutburst, with Psh = 0.07414(44)
d, but we could find no evidence for a precursor. From the 2007 and 2009 data,
we report a superhump period excess of epsilon = 0.030(8) to 0.034(6), which is
typical for SU UMa dwarf novae of similar orbital period, and estimate the
binary mass ratio q = Mwd/Msec $\simeq$ 0.11 to 0.17
