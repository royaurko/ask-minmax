We investigate the dressed quark-gluon vertex combining two established
non-perturbative approaches to QCD: the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) for the
quark propagator and lattice-regularized simulations for the quark, gluon and
ghost propagators. The vertex is modeled using a generalized Ball-Chiu ansatz
parameterized by a single form factor $\tilde X_0$ which effectively represents
the quark-ghost scattering kernel. The solution space of the DSE inversion for
$\tilde X_0$ is highly degenerate, which can be dealt with by a numerical
regularization scheme. We consider two possibilities: (i) linear regularization
and (ii) the Maximum Entropy Method. These two numerical approaches yield
compatible $\tilde X_0$ functions for the range of momenta where lattice data
is available and feature a strong enhancement of the generalized Ball-Chiu
vertex for momenta below 1 GeV. Our ansatz for the quark-gluon vertex is then
used to solve the quark DSE which yields a mass function in good agreement with
lattice simulations and thus provides adequate dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking.
