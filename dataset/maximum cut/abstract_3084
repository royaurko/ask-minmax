The strong maximum principle is proved to hold for weak (in the sense of
support functions) sub- and super-solutions to a class of quasi-linear elliptic
equations that includes the mean curvature equation for $C^0$ spacelike
hypersurfaces in a Lorentzian manifold. As one application a Lorentzian warped
product splitting theorem is given.
