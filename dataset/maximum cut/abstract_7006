It has recently been proposed that spin-transfer torques in magnetic systems
with anisotropic exchange can be strongly enhanced, reducing the characteristic
current density with up to four orders of magnitude compared to conventional
setups. Motivated by this, we analytically solve the equations of motion in a
collective-coordinate framework for this type of anisotropic exchange system,
to investigate the domain wall dynamics in detail. In particular, we obtain
analytical expressions for the maximum attainable domain wall velocity of such
a setup and also for the occurrence of Walker breakdown. Surprisingly, we find
that, in contrast to the standard case with domain wall motion driven by the
nonadiabatic torque, the maximum velocity obtained via the anisotropic exchange
torque is completely independent of the nonadiabaticity parameter beta, in
spite of the torque itself being very large for small beta. Moreover, the
Walker breakdown threshold has an opposite dependence on beta in these two
cases; i.e., for the anisotropic exchange torque scenario, the threshold value
decreases monotonically with beta. These findings are of importance to any
practical application of the proposed giant spin-transfer torque in anisotropic
exchange systems.
