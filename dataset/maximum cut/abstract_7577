The high-energy Regge behavior of gauge theories is studied via the formalism
of Analytic Multi-Regge Theory. Perturbative results for spontaneously-broken
theories are first organised into reggeon diagrams. Unbroken gauge theories are
studied via a reggeon diagram infra-red analysis of symmetry restoration.
Massless fermions play a crucial role and the case of QCD involves the
Super-Critical Pomeron as an essential intermediate stage. An introductory
review of the build up of transverse momentum diagrams and reggeon diagrams
from leading log calculations in gauge theories is presented first. It is then
shown that the results closely reproduce the general structure for multi-regge
amplitudes derived in Part I of the article, allowing the construction of
general reggeon diagrams for spontaneously-broken theories. Next it is argued
that, with a transverse-momentum cut-off, unbroken gauge theories can be
reached through an infra-red limiting process which successively decouples
fundamental representation Higgs fields . The first infra-red limit studied is
the restoration of SU(2) gauge symmetry. The analysis is dominated by the
exponentiation of divergences imposed by Reggeon Unitarity and the contribution
of massless quarks ...
