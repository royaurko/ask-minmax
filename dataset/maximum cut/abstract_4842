We present the techniques and early results of our program to measure the
luminosity function for White Dwarfs in the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey. Our survey
covers over three quarters of the sky to a mean depth of I~19.2, and finds
~9,500 Galactic disk WD candidates on applying a conservative lower tangential
velocity cut of 30kms^-1. Novel techniques introduced in this survey include
allowing the lower proper motion limit to vary according to apparent magnitude,
fully exploiting the accuracy of proper motion measurements to increase the
sample size. Our luminosity function shows good agreement with that measured in
similar works. We find a pronounced drop in the local number density of WDs at
a M_bol~15.75, and an inflexion in the luminosity function at M_bol~12.
