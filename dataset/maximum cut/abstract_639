It is rigorously shown that the fluctuation formula, which is used in
simulations to calculate the dielectric constant of interaction site models,
corresponds to the reaction field with an individual site cut-off rather than
with the usual molecular center of mass truncation. Within the molecular
cut-off scheme, a modified reaction field is proposed. An influence of the
truncation effects is discussed and examined by actual Monte Carlo simulations
for a MCY water model.
