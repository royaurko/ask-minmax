In manufacturing during the cutting process the appearance of vibrations can
not be avoided. These vibrations constitute a major obstacle to obtain a
greater productivity and a better quality of the workpiece. It is thus
necessary to develop models which make it possible to study, the totality of
the 3D dynamic phenomena. Thanks to an experimental approach the complete
torque of the mechanical actions is measured in the presence of the vibrations
during a turning operation. This study makes it possible to analyze the
variations of the central axis which is a significant parameter of the
vibratory phenomena.
