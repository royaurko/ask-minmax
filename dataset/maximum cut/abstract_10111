We present the results of a molecular dynamics simulation study of
thermodynamic and structural properties upon supercooling of a low
concentration sodium chloride solution in TIP4P water and the comparison with
the corresponding bulk quantities. We study the isotherms and the isochores for
both the aqueous solution and bulk water. The comparison of the phase diagrams
shows that thermodynamic properties of the solution are not merely shifted with
respect to the bulk. Moreover, from the analysis of the thermodynamic curves,
both the spinodal line and the temperatures of maximum density curve can be
calculated. The spinodal line appears not to be influenced by the presence of
ions at the chosen concentration, while the temperatures of maximum density
curve displays both a mild shift in temperature and a shape modification with
respect to bulk. Signatures of the presence of a liquid-liquid critical point
are found in the aqueous solution. By analysing the water-ion radial
distribution functions of the aqueous solution we observe that upon changing
density, structural modifications appear close to the spinodal. For low
temperatures additional modifications appear also for densities close to that
corresponding to a low density configurational energy minimum.
