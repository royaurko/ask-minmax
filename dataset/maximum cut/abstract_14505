The violation of a classical Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) inequality is identified as
an unequivocal signature of spontaneous Hawking radiation in sonic black holes.
This violation can be particularly large near the peaks in the radiation
spectrum emitted from a resonant boson structure forming a sonic horizon. As a
function of the frequency-dependent Hawking radiation intensity, we analyze the
degree of CS violation and the maximum violation temperature for a double
barrier structure separating two regions of subsonic and supersonic condensate
flow. We also consider the case where the resonant sonic horizon is produced by
a space-dependent contact interaction. In some cases, CS violation can be
observed by direct atom counting in a time-of-flight experiment. We show that
near the conventional zero-frequency radiation peak, the decisive CS violation
cannot occur.
