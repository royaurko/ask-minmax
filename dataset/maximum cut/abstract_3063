The maximum entropy principle in Tsallis statistics is reformulated in the
mathematical framework of the q-product, which results in the unique non
self-referential q-canonical distribution. As one of the applications of the
present formalism, we theoretically derive the physical temperature which
coincides with that already obtained in accordance with the generalized zeroth
law of thermodynamics.
