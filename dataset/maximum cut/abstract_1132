We discuss the regularization of vacuum fluctuations in a gravitational
background. It is shown that general covariance is broken even by a 4-momentum
cut-off, consistent with Lorentzian symmetry. It is pointed out that general
covariance is a protective symmetry for the vacuum energy from power
divergences.
