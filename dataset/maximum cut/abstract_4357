The CP violating parameter epsilon'/epsilon is computed using the low-energy
dynamics of a chiral theory supplemented by vector resonances. The divergent
contributions coming from strong pi-pi scattering are tamed by vector-meson
exchange terms. This amounts to softening the fast growing high-energy
behaviour of pi-pi scattering. The final result for epsilon'/epsilon shows a
smooth dependence on the cut-off where low energy dynamics is matched with that
of QCD.
