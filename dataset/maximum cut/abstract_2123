Using polynomial truncations of the Fourier transform of the RG
transformation of Dyson's hierarchical model, we show that it is possible to
calculate very accurately the renormalized quantities in the symmetric phase.
Numerical results regarding the corrections to the scaling laws, (i.e finite
cut-off dependence) triviality, hyperscaling, universality and high-accuracy
determinations of the critical exponents are discussed.
