We investigate for the first time the enhancement of the stimulated Raman
scattering in slow-light Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) photonic crystal line
defect waveguides. By applying the Bloch-Floquet formalism to the guided modes
in a planar photonic crystal, we develop a formalism that relates the intensity
of the down-shifted Stokes signal to the pump intensity and the modal group
velocities. The formalism is then applied to two prospective schemes for
enhanced stimulated Raman generation in slow-light photonic crystal waveguides.
The results demonstrate a maximum factor of 10^4 (66,000) enhancement with
respect to SOI channel waveguides. Effects of two photon absorption, intrinsic
scattering, and disorder with respect to slow-light Raman generation towards
optically-pumped silicon amplifiers and lasers are also discussed.
