We present preliminary results of the observational campaign on SN 2002er
carried out by the European Supernova Collaboration (ESC). For this supernova
the optical coverage from epochs -11 days to +50 days is excellent, both in
imaging and spectroscopy. The extinction deduced from the photometry is
E(B-V)=0.35, while Deltam15=1.31. In general SN 2002er behaves like a "normal"
type Ia supernova, very similar to SN 1996X.
