We study di-boson production via both neutral and charged current at the
Large Hadron Collider, i.e. subprocesses $q\bar q\to e^+\nu_e \mu^-\bar\nu_\mu$
+ ${\rm{c.c.}}$ and $q\bar q'\to l^+\nu_l l^{'+}l^{'-}$ + ${\rm{c.c.}}$,
respectively, where $q,q'$ are quarks and $l,l'=e,\mu$, in all possible
combinations, in the context of the 4-Dimensional Composite Higgs Model. These
modes enable the production in the intermediate steps of several additional --
with respect to the Standard Model -- neutral and charged gauge bosons
belonging to the spectrum of this scenario, all of which in resonant
topologies. We not only find these channels to be accessible over the
background but also show that, after a dedicated cut-based analysis, kinematic
reconstruction of most such resonances is always possible. However, since the
Electro-Weak precision data generally disfavor neutral and charged gauge boson
masses below the TeV range and also their large couplings to light-fermions,
these modes turn out to be relevant only for the 14 TeV option with high
integrated luminosity.
