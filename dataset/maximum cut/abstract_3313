In this paper, a new three-parameter lifetime distribution is introduced and
many of its standard properties are discussed. These include shape of the
probability density function, hazard rate function and its shape, quantile
function, limiting distributions of order statistics, and the moments. The
unknown parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation
procedure. We develop an EM algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimates
of the parameters, because they are not available in closed form. The Fisher
information matrix is also obtained and it can be used for constructing the
asymptotic confidence intervals. Finally, a real-data application is given to
demonstrate the performance of the new distribution.
