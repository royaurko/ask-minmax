We show Poisson statistics for random band matrices which diagonal entries
have Gaussian components. These components are possibly as small as
$n^{-\varepsilon}$. Particularly, our result is applicable for a band matrix
cut from the GUE with the band width satisfying $w^{3.5}<<n$. A uniform upper
bound of the averaged density of states (DOS) is obtained for complex deformed
Gaussian band matrices with arbitrary $w$. A lower estimate of the DOS is also
proven for arbitrary $w$ in a certain class of band matrices.
