We present observations of Galactic H alpha emission along two declination
bands where the South Pole cosmic microwave background experiment reports
temperature fluctuations. The high spectral resolution of our Fabry-Perot
system allows us to separate the Galactic signal from the much larger local
sources of H alpha emission, such as the Earth's geocorona. For the two bands
(at declination -62 and -63 degrees), we find a total mean emission of about 1
Rayleigh with variations of about 0.3 R. The variations are within the
estimated uncertainty of our total intensity determinations. For an ionized gas
at T around 10**4 K, this corresponds to a maximum free-free brightness
temperature of less than 10 microK at 30 GHz (K-band). Thus, unless there is a
hot gas component with T around 10**6 K, our results imply that there is
essentially no free-free contamination of the SP91 (Schuster et al. 1993) and
SP94 (Gunderson et al.1995) data sets.
