A simple scaling theory for the sintering of fractal aerogels is presented.
The densification at small scales is described by an increase of the lower
cut-off length $a$ accompanied by a decrease of the upper cut-off length $\xi$,
in order to conserve the total mass of the system. Scaling laws are derived
which predict how $a$, $\xi$ and the specific pore surface area $\Sigma$ should
depend on the density $\rho$. Following the general ideas of the theory,
numerical simulations of sintering are proposed starting from computer
simulations of aerogel structure based on a diffusion-limited cluster-cluster
aggregation gelling process. The numerical results for $a$, $\xi$ and $\Sigma$
as a function of $\rho$ are discussed according to the initial aerogel density.
The scaling theory is only fully recovered in the limit of very low density
where the original values of $a$ and $\xi$ are well separated. These numerical
results are compared with experiments on partially densified aerogels.
