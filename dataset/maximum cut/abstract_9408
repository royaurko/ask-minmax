The thermal drift of the characteristic wavelength of fiber Bragg gratings
(FBGs) photowritten in the core of microstructured fibers (MOFs) is
significantly reduced by inserting a liquid of suitable refractive index into
their holes. For instance, the spectral range of variations is divided by a
factor of 4 over a temperature range larger than 20\degree C in a six-hole MOF,
and the maximum sensitivity is reduced. Such passive FBG temperature
compensation technique is of great interest for applications involving accurate
sensing free of thermal effects.
