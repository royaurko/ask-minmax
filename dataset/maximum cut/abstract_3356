In this paper we derive Piterbarg's max-discretisation theorem for two
different grids considering centered stationary vector Gaussian processes. So
far in the literature results in this direction have been derived for the joint
distribution of the maximum of Gaussian processes over $[0,T]$ and over a grid
$ \mathfrak{R}(\delta_1(T))=\{k\delta_1(T): k=0,1,\cdots\}$. In this paper we
extend recent findings by considering additionally the \bE{maximum} over
another grid $ \mathfrak{R}(\delta_2(T))$. We derive the joint limiting
distribution of maximum of stationary Gaussian vector processes for different
choices of such grids by letting $T\to \infty$.
