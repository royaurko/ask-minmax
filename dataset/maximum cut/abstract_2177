A Fortran-program for the production cross-sections of squarks and gluinos at
hadron colliders is described. It includes full next-to-leading order SUSY-QCD
corrections to all possible final states ($\squark\squarkbar, \gluino\gluino,
\squark\gluino, \squark\squark$). The program allows to calculate total
cross-sections as well as differential distributions in the transverse momentum
p_t and the rapidity y of one of the outgoing particles. In addition cuts
in p_t and y can easily be implemented.
