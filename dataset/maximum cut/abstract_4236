Moment analysis of global multiplicity distribution previously done for
$e^{+}e^{-}$ and $hh$ processes is applied to $hA$ and $AA$ collisions. The
oscillations of cumulants as functions of their rank are found in all the
cases. Some phenomenological approaches and quark-gluon string models are
confronted to experimental data. It has been shown that the analysis is a
powerful tool for revealing the tiny features of the distributions, and its
qualitative results in various processes are rather stable for different
multiplicity cut-offs determined by experimental (or Monte-Carlo) statistics.
