The main conjecture on maximum distance separable (MDS) codes states that,
execpt for some special cases, the maximum length of a q-ary linear MDS code is
q+1. This conjecture does not hold true for near maximum distance separable
codes because of the existence of q-ary near MDS elliptic codes having length
bigger than q+1. An interesting related question is whether a near MDS elliptic
code can be extended to a longer near MDS code. Our results are some
non-extendability results and an alternative and simpler construction for
certain known near MDS elliptic codes.
