We estimate how clustering in large-scale redshift surveys can constrain
various cosmological parameters. Depth and sky coverage of modern redshift
surveys are greater than ever, opening new possibilities for statistical
analysis. We have constructed a novel maximum likelihood technique applicable
to deep redshift surveys of wide sky coverage by taking into account the
effects of both curvature and linear velocity distortions. The Fisher
information matrix is evaluated numerically to show the bounds derived from a
given redshift sample. We find that intermediate-redshift galaxies, such as the
Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, can constrain
cosmological parameters, including the cosmological constant, unexpectedly
well. The importance of the dense as well as deep sampling in designing
redshift surveys is emphasized.
