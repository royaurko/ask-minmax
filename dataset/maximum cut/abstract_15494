Millimeter-wave links are of a line-of-sight nature. Hence, multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in the millimeter-wave band may not
achieve full spatial diversity or multiplexing. In this paper, we utilize
reconfigurable antennas and the high antenna directivity in the millimeter-wave
band to propose a rate-two space coding design for 2x2 MIMO systems. The
proposed scheme can be decoded with a low complexity maximum-likelihood
detector at the receiver and yet it can enhance the bit-error-rate performance
of millimeter-wave systems compared to traditional spatial multiplexing
schemes, such as the Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time Architecture
(VBLAST). Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed code and show its superiority compared to existing rate-two space-time
block codes.
