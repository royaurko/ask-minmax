We present a predictive warped model of flavor that is cut off at an
ultraviolet scale O(10^3) TeV. This "Little Randall-Sundrum (LRS)" model is a
volume-truncation, by a factor $y \approx 6$, of the RS scenario and is
holographically dual to dynamics with number of colors larger by $y$. The LRS
couplings between Kaluza-Klein states and the Standard Model fields, including
the proton constituents, are explicitly calculable without ad hoc assumptions.
Assuming separate gauge and flavor dynamics, a number of unwanted contributions
to precision electroweak, $Z b\bar b$ and flavor observables are suppressed in
the LRS framework, compared with the corresponding RS case. An important
consequence of the LRS truncation, independent of precise details, is a
significant enhancement of the clean (golden) di-lepton LHC signals, by O(y^3),
due to a larger "$\rho$-photon" mixing and a smaller inter-composite coupling.
