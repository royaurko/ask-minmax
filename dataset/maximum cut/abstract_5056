Universality of eigenvalue spacings is one of the basic characteristics of
random matrices. We give the precise meaning of universality and discuss the
standard universality classes (sine, Airy, Bessel) and their appearance in
unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic ensembles. The Riemann-Hilbert problem for
orthogonal polynomials is one possible tool to derive universality in unitary
random matrix ensembles. An overview is presented of the Deift/Zhou steepest
descent analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem in the one-cut regular case.
Non-standard universality classes that arise at singular points in the spectrum
are discussed at the end.
