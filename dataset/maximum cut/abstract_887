The method of continuous unitary transformations (CUTs) is applied to the
Anderson impurity and the Kondo model aiming at the systematic derivation of
convergent effective models. If CUTs are applied in a conventional way,
diverging differential equations occur. Similar to poor man's scaling the
energy scale, below which the couplings diverge, corresponds to the Kondo
temperature $T_K$. We present a way to apply CUTs to the Kondo and to the
Anderson impurity model so that no divergences occur but a converged effective
low-energy model is derived with small fnite parameters at arbitrarily small
energies. The ground state corresponds to a bound singlet with a binding energy
given by the Kondo temperature $T_K$.
