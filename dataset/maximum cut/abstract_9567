We introduce a new mean-field approximation based on the reconciliation of
maximum entropy and linear response for correlations in the cluster variation
method. Within a general formalism that includes previous mean-field methods,
we derive formulas improving upon, e.g., the Bethe approximation and the
Sessak-Monasson result at high temperature. Applying the method to direct and
inverse Ising problems, we find improvements over standard implementations.
