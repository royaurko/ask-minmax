The rare decays of mesons are higher order effects in weak interactions. The
main contributions to such decay processes are from the Z-penguin, the
photonpenguin and the box diagram. At the quark level, these contributions are
well known. However, when considering the corresponding physical hadronic
processes, a knowledge of how hadronic states are expressed in terms of quarks.
In this paper, we suggest a simplistic way to relate the quark level process to
the hadronic process. For simplicity, we consider here only the decays of
pseudoscalar mesons. The meson-quark coupling is described in terms of a
gamma-5 coupling with a constant coupling constant. We apply the model to
processes in which meson M1 decays to meson M2 with the emissions of neutrino
pair and charged lepton pair. In calculating the decay rates, a cut-off
momentum lamda is introduced to control the divergent triangle integral over
the internal momentum. The results of our calculation is compared to
experimental data on the decay rates for K- and B-meson decays.
