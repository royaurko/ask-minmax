In this paper, I revisit the constraints obtained by several contributors
(Reichart et al. 1999; Eke et al. 1998; Henry 2000) on the estimated values of
$\Omega_{\rm m}$, $n$ and $\sigma_8$ in the light of recent theoretical
developments: 1) new theoretical mass functions (Sheth & Tormen 1999, Sheth, Mo
& Tormen 2001, Del Popolo 2002b); 2) a more accurate mass-temperature relation,
also determined for arbitrary $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\Omega_{\rm \Lambda}$ (Del
Popolo 2002a). Firstly, using the quoted improvements, I re-derive an
expression for the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF), similarly to Reichart et
al. (1999), and then I get some constraints to $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $n$, by
using the {\it ROSAT} BCS and {\rm EMSS} samples and maximum-likelihood
analysis. Then I re-derive the X-ray Temperature Function (XTF), similarly to
Henry (2000), re-obtaining the constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$, $n$,
$\sigma_8$. Both in the case of the XLF and XTF, the changes in the mass
function and M-T relation produces an increase in $\Omega_{\rm m}$ of $ \simeq
20%$ and similar results in $\sigma_8$ and $n$.
