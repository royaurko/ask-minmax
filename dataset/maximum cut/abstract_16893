We present a circuit QED experiment in which a separate transmission line is
used to address a quasi-lumped element superconducting microwave resonator
which is in turn coupled to an Al/AlO$_{x}$/Al Cooper-pair box (CPB) charge
qubit. In our measurements we find a strong correlation between the measured
lifetime of the CPB and the coupling between the qubit and the transmission
line. By monitoring perturbations of the resonator's 5.44 GHz resonant
frequency, we have measured the spectrum, lifetime ($T_{1}$), Rabi, and Ramsey
oscillations of the CPB at the charge degeneracy point while the CPB was
detuned by up to 2.5 GHz . We find a maximum lifetime of the CPB was $T_{1} =
200\ \mu$s for $f = 4$ to 4.5 GHz. Our measured $T_{1}$'s are consistent with
loss due to coupling to the transmission line, spurious microwave circuit
resonances, and a background decay rate on the order of $5\times 10^{3}$
s$^{-1}$ of unknown origin, implying that the loss tangent in the AlO$_{x}$
junction barrier must be less than about $4\times 10^{-8}$ at 4.5 GHz, about 4
orders of magnitude less than reported in larger area Al/AlO$_{x}$/Al tunnel
junctions.
