This paper considers a simple on-off random multiple access channel, where n
users communicate simultaneously to a single receiver over m degrees of
freedom. Each user transmits with probability lambda, where typically lambda n
< m << n, and the receiver must detect which users transmitted. We show that
when the codebook has i.i.d. Gaussian entries, detecting which users
transmitted is mathematically equivalent to a certain sparsity detection
problem considered in compressed sensing. Using recent sparsity results, we
derive upper and lower bounds on the capacities of these channels. We show that
common sparsity detection algorithms, such as lasso and orthogonal matching
pursuit (OMP), can be used as tractable multiuser detection schemes and have
significantly better performance than single-user detection. These methods do
achieve some near-far resistance but--at high signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs)--may achieve capacities far below optimal maximum likelihood detection.
We then present a new algorithm, called sequential OMP, that illustrates that
iterative detection combined with power ordering or power shaping can
significantly improve the high SNR performance. Sequential OMP is analogous to
successive interference cancellation in the classic multiple access channel.
Our results thereby provide insight into the roles of power control and
multiuser detection on random-access signalling.
