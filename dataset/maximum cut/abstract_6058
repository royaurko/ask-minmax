We investigate the possibility of non-destructive electron diffraction
imaging of a single molecule to determine its structure. The molecular specimen
will be held on a free-standing sheet of graphene. Due to the high conductivity
of graphene, electrons lost by ionization would be rapidly replaced, enabling
repeated nondestructive interrogation. Limits of resolution, maximum particle
size and required electron flux are assessed.
