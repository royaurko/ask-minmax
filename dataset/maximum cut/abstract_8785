For a smooth map $f:X^4\to\Sigma^2$ that is locally modeled by holomorphic
maps, the domain is shown to admit a symplectic structure that is symplectic on
some regular fiber, if and only if $f^*[\Sigma]\ne0$. If so, the space of
symplectic forms on $X$ that are symplectic on all fibers is nonempty and
contractible. The cohomology classes of these forms vary with the maximum
possible freedom on the reducible fibers, subject to the obvious constraints.
The above results are derived via an analogous theorem for locally holomorphic
maps $f:X^{2n}\to Y^{2n-2}$ with $Y$ symplectic.
