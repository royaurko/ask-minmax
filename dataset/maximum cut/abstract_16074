We present spectroscopy of the microquasar SS 433 obtained near primary
eclipse and disk precessional phase Psi = 0.0, when the accretion disk is
expected to be most ``face-on''. The likelihood of observing the spectrum of
the mass donor is maximized at this combination of orbital and precessional
phases since the donor is in the foreground and above the extended disk
believed to be present in the system. The spectra were obtained over four
different runs centered on these special phases. The blue spectra show clear
evidence of absorption features consistent with a classification of A3-7 I. The
behavior of the observed lines indicates an origin in the mass donor. The
observed radial velocity variations are in anti-phase to the disk, the
absorption lines strengthen at mid-eclipse when the donor star is expected to
contribute its maximum percentage of the total flux, and the line widths are
consistent with lines created in an A supergiant photosphere. We discuss and
cast doubt on the possibility that these lines represent a shell spectrum
rather than the mass donor itself. We re-evaluate the mass ratio of the system
and derive masses of 10.9 +/- 3.1 Msun and 2.9 +/- 0.7 Msun for the mass donor
and compact object plus disk, respectively. We suggest that the compact object
is a low mass black hole.
  In addition, we review the behavior of the observed emission lines from both
the disk/wind and high velocity jets.
