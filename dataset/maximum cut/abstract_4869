We point out at the peculiarity of B --> mu nu decay, namely the enhancement
of the soft photon events which originate from the structure dependent part of
the B --> mu nu gamma amplitude. This may be a dominant source of systematic
uncertainty and compromise the projected experimental uncertainty on Gamma(B
--> mu nu). We show that the effect of these soft photons can be controlled if
the experimental cut on identification of soft photons is lowered and
especially if the better resolution in identifying the momentum of muon
emerging from B --> mu nu, is made. A lattice QCD computation of the relevant
form factors would be highly helpful for a better numerical control over the
structure dependent soft photon emission.
