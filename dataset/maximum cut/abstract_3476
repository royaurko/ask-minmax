In this paper we consider graph algorithms in models of computation where the
space usage (random accessible storage, in addition to the read only input) is
sublinear in the number of edges $m$ and the access to input data is
constrained. These questions arises in many natural settings, and in particular
in the analysis of MapReduce or similar algorithms that model constrained
parallelism with sublinear central processing. In SPAA 2011, Lattanzi etal.
provided a $O(1)$ approximation of maximum matching using $O(p)$ rounds of
iterative filtering via mapreduce and $O(n^{1+1/p})$ space of central
processing for a graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges.
  We focus on weighted nonbipartite maximum matching in this paper. For any
constant $p>1$, we provide an iterative sampling based algorithm for computing
a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation of the weighted nonbipartite maximum matching
that uses $O(p/\epsilon)$ rounds of sampling, and $O(n^{1+1/p})$ space. The
results extends to $b$-Matching with small changes. This paper combines
adaptive sketching literature and fast primal-dual algorithms based on relaxed
Dantzig-Wolfe decision procedures. Each round of sampling is implemented
through linear sketches and executed in a single round of MapReduce. The paper
also proves that nonstandard linear relaxations of a problem, in particular
penalty based formulations, are helpful in mapreduce and similar settings in
reducing the adaptive dependence of the iterations.
