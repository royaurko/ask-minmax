Hilhorst and Schehr recently presented a straight forward computation of
limit distributions of sufficiently correlated random numbers \cite{hilhorst}.
Here we present the analytical form of entropy which --under the maximum
entropy principle (with ordinary constraints)-- provides these limit
distributions. These distributions are not $q$-Gaussians and can not be
obtained with Tsallis entropy.
