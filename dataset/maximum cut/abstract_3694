The dynamics of a platoon of adaptive cruise control vehicles is analyzed for
a general mechanical response of the vehicle's power-train. Effects of
acceleration-feedback control that were not previously studied are found. For
small acceleration-feedback gain, which produces marginally string-stable
behavior, the reduction of a disturbance (with increasing car number n) is
found to be faster than for the maximum allowable gain. The asymptotic
magnitude of a disturbance is shown to fall off as erf(ct./sq. rt. n) when n
goes to infinity. For gain approaching the lower limit of stability,
oscillations in acceleration associated with a secondary maximum in the
transfer function (as a function of frequency) can occur. A frequency-dependent
gain that reduces the secondary maximum, but does not affect the transfer
function near zero frequency, is proposed. Performance is thereby improved by
elimination of the undesirable oscillations while the rapid disturbance
reduction is retained.
