We discuss implementation of TOPbase and Iron Project opacities for stellar
spectral codes. We use a technique employed by Peach, where a
Boltzmann-averaged cross section is calculated for selected temperatures, and
the opacity obtained from double interpolation in temperature and wavelength.
It is straightforward to include {\it all} levels for which cross sections have
been calculated. Boltzmann-averaged cross sections for Fe II show a local
maximum between 1700 and 2000[A]. We suggest this feature arises from 3d^5 4snl
to 3d^5 4pnl transitions within Fe II. IUE spectra of iron-rich CP stars show
local minima in this region. Theoretical calculations of a representative
stellar continuum demonstrate that Fe II photoionization contributes
significantly to the observed minima.
