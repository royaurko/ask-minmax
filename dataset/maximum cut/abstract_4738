We study pair production of scalar top quarks in polarized photon-photon
collisions with the subsequent decay of the top squarks into b-quarks and
charginos. We simulate this process by using PYTHIA6.4 for an electron beam
energy 2E_beam =1000 GeV. A set of criteria for physical variables is proposed
which leads to a good separation of stop signal events from top quark pair
production being the main background. These criteria allow us to reconstruct
the mass of the top squark provided that the neutralino mass is known.
