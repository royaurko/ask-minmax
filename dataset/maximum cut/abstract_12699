In a previous Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 123401 (2006)] we have shown by
means of three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations and a simple
rigid-sphere model that nonlinear resonance absorption is the dominant
collisionless absorption mechanism in the intense, short-pulse laser cluster
interaction. In this paper we present a more detailed account of the matter. In
particular we show that the absorption efficiency is almost independent of the
laser polarization. In the rigid-sphere model, the absorbed energy increases by
many orders of magnitude at a certain threshold laser intensity. The
particle-in-cell results display maximum fractional absorption around the same
intensity. We calculate the threshold intensity and show that it is
underestimated by the common over-barrier ionization estimate.
