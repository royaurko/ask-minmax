Consider a drawing of a graph $G$ in the plane such that crossing edges are
coloured differently. The minimum number of colours, taken over all drawings of
$G$, is the classical graph parameter "thickness". By restricting the edges to
be straight, we obtain the "geometric thickness". By further restricting the
vertices to be in convex position, we obtain the "book thickness". This paper
studies the relationship between these parameters and treewidth.
  Our first main result states that for graphs of treewidth $k$, the maximum
thickness and the maximum geometric thickness both equal $\lceil{k/2}\rceil$.
This says that the lower bound for thickness can be matched by an upper bound,
even in the more restrictive geometric setting. Our second main result states
that for graphs of treewidth $k$, the maximum book thickness equals $k$ if $k
\leq 2$ and equals $k+1$ if $k \geq 3$. This refutes a conjecture of Ganley and
Heath [Discrete Appl. Math. 109(3):215-221, 2001]. Analogous results are proved
for outerthickness, arboricity, and star-arboricity.
