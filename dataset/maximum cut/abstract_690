The separate study of quark and gluon jets is vital for the interpretation of
multiple variables behaviour observed in both high-energy hadron and heavy-ion
collisions in the present and future experiments. We propose a set of
jet-energy dependent cuts to be used to distinguish between quark and gluon
jets experimentally based on a Monte-Carlo study of their properties. Further,
we introduce the possibility to calibrate these cuts via gamma-jet and
multi-jet events, which represent clean production channels for quark and gluon
jets, respectively. The calibration can happen on real data and thus, reduces
the dependence of the method performance on Monte-Carlo model predictions.
