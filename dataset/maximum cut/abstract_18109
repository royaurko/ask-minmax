We study the position of a biased tracer particle (TP) in a bath of hardcore
particles moving on a lattice of arbitrary dimension and in contact with a
reservoir. Starting from the master equation satisfied by the joint probability
of the TP position and the bath configuration and resorting to a
mean-field-type approximation, we presented a computation of the fluctuations
of the TP position in a previous publication [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{87}, 032164
(2013)]. Counterintuitively, on a one-dimensional lattice, the diffusion
coefficient of the TP was shown to be a non-monotonic function of the density
of bath particles, and reaches a maximum for a nonzero value of the density.
Here, we: (i) give the details of this computation and offer a physical insight
into the understanding of the non-monotonicity of the diffusion coefficient;
(ii) extend the mean-field-type approximation to decouple higher-order
correlation functions, and obtain the evolution equation satisfied by the
cumulant generating function of the position of the TP, valid in any space
dimension. In the particular case of a one-dimensional lattice, we solve this
equation and obtain the probability distribution of the TP position. We show
that the position rescaled by its fluctuations is asymptotically distributed
accordingly to a Gaussian distribution in the long-time limit.
