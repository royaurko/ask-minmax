The generation of harmonics by atoms or ions in a two-color, coplanar field
configuration with commensurate frequencies is investigated through both, an
analytical calculation based on the Lewenstein model and the numerical ab
initio solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation of a
two-dimensional model ion. Through the analytical model, selection rules for
the harmonic orders in this field configuration, a generalized cut-off for the
harmonic spectra, and an integral expression for the harmonic dipole strength
is provided. The numerical results are employed to test the predictions of the
analytical model. The scaling of the cut-off as a function of both, one of the
laser intensities and frequency ratio $\eta$, as well as entire spectra for
different $\eta$ and laser intensities are presented and analyzed. The
theoretical cut-off is found to be an upper limit for the numerical results.
Other discrepancies between analytical model and numerical results are
clarified by taking into account the probabilities of the absorption processes
involved.
