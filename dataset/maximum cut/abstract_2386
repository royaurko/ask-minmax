We look at an electron in the field of an arbitrary external potential $V$,
such that the Schr\"odinger operator $p^2 + V$ has at least one eigenvalue, and
show that by coupling to a quantized radiation field the binding energy
increases, at least for small enough values of the coupling constant $\alpha$.
Moreover, we provide concrete numbers for $\alpha$, the ultraviolet cut-off
$\Lambda$, and the radiative correction for which our procedure works.
