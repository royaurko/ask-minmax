We show that in supersymmetry one can obtain inflationary potentials in the
observable sector that are sufficiently flat at sub-Planckian field values.
Structure of the supersymmetric scalar potential along a flat direction
combined with the existence of higher order terms in an effective field theory
expansion allows one to find scales below the effective field theory cut off
where two or a higher number of the potential derivatives may vanish. As an
explicit example, we demonstrate that inflection point inflation within a broad
range of scales O(TeV) << H < 3 x 10^9 GeV can be accommodated within weak
scale supersymmetry. The fine tuning of model parameters needed for successful
inflation is considerably improved in this scenario.
