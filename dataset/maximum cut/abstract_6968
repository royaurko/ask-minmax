We compare different selection criteria to choose the number of latent states
of a multivariate latent Markov model for longitudinal data. This model is
based on an underlying Markov chain to represent the evolution of a latent
characteristic of a group of individuals over time. Then, the response
variables observed at the different occasions are assumed to be conditionally
independent given this chain. Maximum likelihood of the model is carried out
through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm based on forward-backward
recursions which are well known in the hidden Markov literature for time
series. The selection criteria we consider in our comparison are based on
penalized versions of the maximum log-likelihood or on the posterior
probabilities of belonging to each latent state, that is the conditional
probability of the latent state given the observed data. A Monte Carlo
simulation study shows that the indices referred to the log-likelihood based
information criteria perform in general better with respect to those referred
to the classification based criteria. This is due to the fact that the latter
tend to underestimate the true number of latent states, especially in the
univariate case.
