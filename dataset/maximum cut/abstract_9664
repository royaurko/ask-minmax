We report a study on the optical dipole force on a beam of neutral
three-level like atomic system induced by a femtosecond super-Gaussian pulse.
We show that maximum coherence between the ground state |1> and the excited
state |2> could be achieved using a train of femtosecond pulses. In addition,
it is possible to control the trajectory of the atoms in an atomic beam by
using the same scheme. The robustness of the scheme against the variation of
the pulse parameters is also investigated.
