We present an analytic technique for evaluating single cuts for one-loop
integrands, where exactly one propagator is taken to be on shell. Our method
extends the double-cut integration formalism of one-loop amplitudes to the
single-cut case. We argue that single cuts give meaningful information about
amplitudes when taken at the integrand level. We discuss applications to the
computation of tadpole coefficients.
