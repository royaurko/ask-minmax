The hard X-ray source IGRJ11215-5952, discovered with INTEGRAL during a brief
outburst in 2005, has been proposed as a new member of the class of Supergiant
Fast X-ray Transients. Analysing archival INTEGRAL observations of the source
field,we have discovered two previously unnoticed outbursts (in July 2003 and
in May 2004),spaced by intervals of ~330 days, suggesting a possible orbital
period.The 5-100keV spectrum is well described by a cut-off power law, with a
photon index of 0.5, and a cut-off energy 15-20keV, typical of High Mass X-ray
Binaries containing a neutron star. The luminosity is ~3E36erg/s assuming
6.2kpc, the distance of the likely optical counterpart, the blue supergiant
HD306414.A fourth outburst was discovered in 2006 with XTE/PCA, 329 days after
the third one, confirming the periodic nature of the source outbursts.Follow-up
observations with Swift/XRT refined the source position and confirmed the
association with HD306414.The 5-100keV spectrum, the recurrent nature of the
outbursts, the blue supergiant companion star HD 306414, support the hypothesis
that IGRJ11215-5952 is a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient, and it is the first
object of this class of High Mass X-ray Binaries displaying periodic outbursts.
