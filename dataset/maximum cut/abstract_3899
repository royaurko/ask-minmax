We consider the merging of high-mass black-hole binaries of the Cyg X-1 type,
in which the O-star companion becomes a neutron star following a supernova
explosion. Our estimated rate of mergers, $\sim 2\times 10^{-5} yr^{-1}$ for
the Galaxy, is relatively low because of the paucity of high-mass black holes.
None the less, because of their high masses, these black-hole, neutron-star
binaries could contribute importantly to the merging sought by LIGO. From
stellar evolutionary calculations including mass loss, we estimate that a ZAMS
mass of $\sim 80 \msun$ is necessary before a high-mass black hole can result
in a massive binary. We estimate the detection rate for LIGO of high-mass black
hole neutron-star mergers to be a factor $\sim 40$ greater than that for binary
neutron stars. We suggest how our high cut-off mass can be reconciled with the
requirements of nucleosynthesis, and show that a bimodal distribution with
masses of black holes can account, at least qualitatively, for the many
transient sources which contain high-mass black holes.
