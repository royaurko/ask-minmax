The bend-number b(G) of a graph G is the minimum k such that G may be
represented as the edge intersection graph of a set of grid paths with at most
k bends. We confirm a conjecture of Biedl and Stern showing that the maximum
bend-number of outerplanar graphs is 2. Moreover we improve the formerly known
lower and upper bound for the maximum bend-number of planar graphs from 2 and 5
to 3 and 4, respectively.
