Bright EUV sunspot plumes have been observed in five out of nine sunspot
regions with the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer -- CDS on SOHO. In the other
four regions the brightest line emissions may appear inside the sunspot but are
mainly concentrated in small regions outside the sunspot areas. These results
are in contrast to those obtained during the Solar Maximum Mission, but are
compatible with the Skylab mission results. The present observations show that
sunspot plumes are formed in the upper part of the transition region, occur
both in magnetic unipolar-- and bipolar regions, and may extend from the umbra
into the penumbra.
