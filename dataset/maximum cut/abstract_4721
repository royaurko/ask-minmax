We present a calculation of interference effects in Hjj production via gluon
fusion and via vector boson fusion, respectively, beyond tree level. We
reproduce results recently discussed in the literature, but go beyond this
calculation by including a class of diagrams not considered previously. Special
care is taken in developing a numerically stable and flexible parton level
Monte-Carlo program which allows us to study cross sections and kinematic
distributions within experimentally relevant selection cuts. Loop-induced
interference contributions are found to exhibit kinematical distributions
different in shape from vector boson fusion. Due to the small interference
cross section and cancelation among different quark flavor contributions their
impact on the signal process is found to be negligible in all regions of phase
space, however.
