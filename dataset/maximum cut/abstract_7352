RXTE observations of the X-ray transient pulsar 2S 1417-62 between 1999
November and 2000 August with a total exposure of $\sim 394$ ksec were
analyzed. Observations include a main outburst followed by a series of mini
outbursts. Changes in pulse morphology and pulse fraction were found to be
related to the changes in X-ray flux. Particularly low X-ray flux regions were
found to have significantly lower pulse fractions with different pulse
morphologies. The 3-60 keV PCA-HEXTE main outburst spectrum was modeled with an
absorbed power law model with high energy cut-off and a Gaussian Iron line
complex feature. Using the same spectral model, individual 3-20 keV PCA spectra
were found to be softer and less absorbed in low X-ray flux regions between
outbursts. Spectral studies showed that hydrogen column density was correlated,
and the power law index was anti-correlated with the 3-20 keV X-ray flux. X-ray
flux related spectral and timing features in 2S 1417-62 except for low X-ray
flux regions were interpreted as a sign of disc accretion with a similar
accretion geometry with a varying mass accretion rate ($\dot{M}$), whereas
spectral and timing features of the low X-ray flux regions were interpreted as
a sign of possible temporary accretion geometry change prior to the next
periastron where $\dot{M}$ increases again to restore the original accretion
geometry.
