We investigate the existence of anomalous Higgs boson couplings,
$H\gamma\gamma$ and $HZ\gamma$, through the analysis of the process $e^+ e^-
\to \gamma\gamma\gamma$ at LEP2 energies. We suggest some kinematical cuts to
improve the signal to background ratio and determine the capability of LEP2 to
impose bounds on those couplings by looking for a Higgs boson signal in this
reaction.
