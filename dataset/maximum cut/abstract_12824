The $\Delta_3(L)$ statistic characterizes the fluctuations of the number of
levels as a function of the length of the spectral interval. It is studied as a
possible tool to indicate the regular or chaotic nature of underlying dynamics,
detect missing levels and the mixing of sequences of levels of different
symmetry, particularly in neutron resonance data. The relation between the
ensemble average and the average over different fragments of a given
realization of spectra is considered. A useful expression for the variance of
$\Delta_3(L)$ which accounts for finite sample size is discussed. An analysis
of neutron resonance data presents the results consistent with a maximum
likelihood method applied to the level spacing distribution.
