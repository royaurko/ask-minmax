We note that the maximum temperature during reheating can be much greater
than the reheating temperature $T_r$ at which the Universe becomes radiation
dominated. We show that the Standard Model anomalous $(B+L)$-violating
processes can therefore be in thermal equilibrium for 1 GeV $\simlt T_{r}\ll
100$ GeV. Electroweak baryogenesis could work and the traditional upper bound
on the Higgs mass coming from the requirement of the preservation of the baryon
asymmetry may be relaxed. Alternatively, the baryon asymmetry may be
reprocessed by sphaleron transitions either from a $(B-L) $ asymmetry generated
by the Affleck-Dine mechanism or from a chiral asymmetry between $e_R$ and
$e_L$ in a $B-L = 0$ Universe. Our findings are also relevant to the production
of the baryon asymmetry in large extra dimension models.
