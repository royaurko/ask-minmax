By the same method introduced in [9], we calculate the Laplace transform of
the celebrated cut-and-join equation of Mari\~no-Vafa formula discovered by C.
Liu, K. Liu and J. Zhou [17]. Then, we study the applications of the polynomial
identity (1) obtained in theorem 1.1 of this paper. We show the proof
Bouchard-Mari\~no conjecture for C^3 which was given by L. Chen [5] Firstly.
Subsequently, we will present how to obtain series Hodge integral identities
from this polynomial identity (1). In particular, the main result in [9] is one
of special case in such series of Hodge integral identities. At last, we give a
explicit formula for the computation of Hodge integral
<\tau_{b_L}\lamda_{g}\lamda_{1}>_{g} where b_L = (b_1,..,b_l).
