The theory of multiverse and wormholes suggests that the parameters of the
Standard Model are fixed in such a way that the radiation of the $S^{3}$
universe at the final stage $S_{rad}$ becomes maximum, which we call the
maximum entropy principle. Although it is difficult to confirm this principle
generally, for a few parameters of the Standard Model, we can check whether
$S_{rad}$ actually becomes maximum at the observed values. In this paper, we
regard $S_{rad}$ at the final stage as a function of the weak scale ( the Higgs
expectation value ) $v_{h}$, and show that it becomes maximum around
$v_{h}={\cal{O}}(300\text{GeV})$ when the dimensionless couplings in the
Standard Model, that is, the Higgs self coupling, the gauge couplings, and the
Yukawa couplings are fixed. Roughly speaking, we find that the weak scale is
given by \begin{equation}
v_{h}\sim\frac{T_{BBN}^{2}}{M_{pl}y_{e}^{5}},\nonumber\end{equation} where
$y_{e}$ is the Yukawa coupling of electron, $T_{BBN}$ is the temperature where
the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis starts and $M_{pl}$ is the Planck mass.
