In an earlier work, several properties of fundamental particles were brought
together by a simple equation based on continuity and discreteness. It is shown
here, that the maximum modes of decay of all fundamental particles can also be
predicted without any arbitrary parameters. The method used is to break up the
mean lifetimes of particles to obtain the maximum modes of decay. This is done
by using a binary expansion of $\hbar/MT$ where M is the mass of the particle
and T is the mean lifetime. The agreements between that obtained from theory
and experiment are remarkable. The ordering of the flavours plays an important
part in understanding the reasons for this agreement. It is shown that the Zeno
effect in Quantum mechanics is connected with use of the binary series.
