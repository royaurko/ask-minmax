I examine some non-anthropic approaches to the string landscape. These
approaches are based on finding the initial conditions of the universe using
the wavefunction of the multiverse to select the most probable vacuum out of
this landscape. All approaches tackled so far seems to have their own problems
and there is no clear cut alternative to anthropic reasoning. I suggest that
finding the initial conditions may be irrelevant since all possible vacua on
the landscape are possible initial state conditions and eternal inflation could
generate all the other vacua. We are now left to reason out why we are
observing the small value of the cosmological constant (CC). I address this
issue in the contest of noncritical string theory in which all values of the
cosmological constant on the landscape are departures from critical equilibrium
state.
