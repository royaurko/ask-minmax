We study a simple extended model of oscillator neural networks capable of
storing sparsely coded phase patterns, in which information is encoded both in
the mean firing rate and in the timing of spikes. Applying the methods of
statistical neurodynamics to our model, we theoretically investigate the
model's associative memory capability by evaluating its maximum storage
capacities and deriving its basins of attraction. It is shown that, as in the
Hopfield model, the storage capacity diverges as the activity level decreases.
We consider various practically and theoretically important cases. For example,
it is revealed that a dynamically adjusted threshold mechanism enhances the
retrieval ability of the associative memory. It is also found that, under
suitable conditions, the network can recall patterns even in the case that
patterns with different activity levels are stored at the same time. In
addition, we examine the robustness with respect to damage of the synaptic
connections. The validity of these theoretical results is confirmed by
reasonable agreement with numerical simulations.
