We address an idea of applying generalized entropies in counting problems.
First, we consider some entropic properties that are essential for such
purposes. Using the $\alpha$-entropies of Tsallis-Havrda-Charv\'{a}t type, we
derive several results connected with Shearer's lemma. In particular, we derive
one-parameter upper bounds on the maximum possible cardinality of a family of
$k$-sets, in which no pairwise intersections of the $k$-subsets may coincide.
Then, we revisit the Minc conjecture. Our approach leads to a family of
one-parameter extensions of Br\'{e}gman's theorem. A utility of the obtained
bounds is explicitly exemplified.
