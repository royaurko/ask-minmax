A study of the reactions pp -> pfps(K+K-pi+pi-) and pp -> pfps(K+K-pi+pi-pi0)
shows evidence for the K*K* and phi omega channels respectively. The K*K* mass
spectrum shows a broad distribution with a maximum near threshold and an
angular analysis shows that it is compatible with having JP = 2+. The behaviour
of the cross-section as a function of centre of mass energy, and the four
momentum transfer dependence, are compatible with what would be expected if the
K*K* system was produced via double Pomeron exchange. The dPT behaviour of the
phi omega channel is similar to what has been observed for all the undisputed
qqbar states. In contrast, the dPT behaviour of the K*K* final state is similar
to what has been observed for the phi phi final state and for previously
observed glueball candidates.
