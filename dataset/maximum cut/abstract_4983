We propose an holographic $k$-essence and dilaton models of dark energy. The
correspondence between the $k$-essence and dilaton energy densities with the
holographic density, allows the reconstruction of the potential and the fields
for the $k$-essence and dilaton models in flat FRW background. For the proposed
infrared cut-off the reconstruction was made for the two cases of the constant
$\alpha$: for $\alpha<1$ the model presents phantom crossing and the
reconstruction was made in the region before the $\omega=-1$ crossing for the
EoS parameter. The cosmological dynamics for $\alpha>1$ was also reconstructed.
The reconstruction is consistent with the observational data.
