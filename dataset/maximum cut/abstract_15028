We predict by first-principles calculations that the electron-doped
phosphorene is a potential BCS-like superconductor. The stretching modes at the
Brillouin-zone center are remarkably softened by the electron-doping, which
results in the strong electron-phonon coupling. The superconductivity can be
introduced by a doped electron density ($n_{2D}$) above $1.3 \times10^{14}$
cm$^{-2}$, and may exist over the liquid helium temperature when $n_{2D}>2.6
\times10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$. The maximum critical temperature is predicted to be
higher than 10 K. The superconductivity of phosphorene will significantly
broaden the applications of this novel material.
