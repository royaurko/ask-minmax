We investigate the behaviour of a non-commutative radiating
Reissner-Nordstrom(Re-No)black hole. We find some interesting results : a). the
existence of a minimal non-zero mass to which the black hole can shrink. b). a
finite maximum temperature that the black hole can reach before cooling down to
absolute zero. c) compared to the neutral black holes the effect of charge is
to increase the minimal non-zero mass and lower the maximum temperature. d) the
absence of any curvature singularity. We also derive some essential
thermodynamic quantities from which we study the stability of the black hole.
Finally we find an upper bound for the non-commutativity parameter $\theta$.
