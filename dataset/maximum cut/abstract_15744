We present detailed NLTE synthetic spectra of hydrodynamic SNe Ia models. We
make no assumptions about the form of the spectrum at the inner boundary. We
calculate both Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration models and sub-Chandrasekhar
``helium detonators.'' Gamma-ray deposition is handled in a simple, accurate
manner. We have parameterized the storage of energy that arises from the time
dependent deposition of radioactive decay energy in a reasonable manner, that
spans the expected range. We find that the Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration
model W7 of Nomoto etal shows good agreement with the observed spectra of SN
1992A and SN 1994D, particularly in the UV, where our models are expected to be
most accurate. The sub-Chandrasekhar models do not reproduce the UV deficit
observed in normal SNe Ia. They do bear some resemblance to sub-luminous SNe
Ia, but the shape of the spectra (i.e. the colors) are opposite to that of the
observed ones and the intermediate mass element lines such as Si II, and Ca II
are extremely weak, which seems to be a generic difficulty of the models.
Although the sub-Chandrasekhar models have a significant helium abundance
(unlike Chandrasekhar-mass models), helium lines are not prominent in the
spectra near maximum light and thus do not act as a spectral signature for the
progenitor.
