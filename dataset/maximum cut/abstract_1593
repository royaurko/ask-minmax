This paper examines detection prospects and constraints on the chromomagnetic
dipole operator for the bottom quark. This operator has a flavor, chirality and
Lorentz structure that is distinct from other dimension six operators
considered in Higgs coupling studies. Its non-standard Lorentz structure
bolsters boosted $b \bar{b} h$ events, providing a rate independent signal of
new physics. To date, we find this operator is unconstrained by $p p
\rightarrow h + {\rm jets}$ and $pp \rightarrow \bar b b $ searches: for
order-one couplings the permitted cutoff $\Lambda$ for this operator can be as
low as $\Lambda \sim 1~{\rm TeV}$. We show how to improve this bound with
collider cuts that allow a $b$-tagged Higgs plus dijet search in the Higgs to
diphoton decay channel to exclude cutoffs as high as $\sim 6~{\rm TeV}$ at $2
\sigma$ with 3 $\text{ab}^{-1}$ of luminosity at the 14 TeV LHC. Cuts on the
$p_T$ of the Higgs are key to this search, because the chromomagnetic dipole
yields a non-standard fraction of boosted Higgses.
