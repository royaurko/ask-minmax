The interplay of pairing is explored for the spectral statistics of nuclear
systems with emphasis on the nearest neighbor spacing distributions by
employing the kernel density and maximum likelihood estimation techniques.
Different sequences prepared by all the available empirical data for low-lying
energy levels of even and odd-mass nuclei in the 34 < A < 206 mass region. A
deviation to more regular dynamics is apparent for even-mass nuclei in compare
to odd-mass ones, and there are suggestions of effects due to unclosed proton
shells on more chaotic dynamics.
