In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 1003 (1998)] Hussein and Pato
employed the maximum entropy principle (MEP) in order to derive interpolating
ensembles between any pair of universality classes in random matrix theory.
They apply their formalism also to the transition from random matrix to Poisson
statistics of spectra that is observed for the case of the Anderson-type
metal-insulator transition. We point out the problems with the latter
procedure.
