We report single crystal growth of the reentrant superconductor Tm_2Fe_3Si_5,
and measurements of the anisotropic static magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) and
isothermal magnetization M(H), ac susceptibility \chi_ac(T), electrical
resistivity \rho(T) and heat capacity C(T) at ambient pressure and \chi_ac(T)
at high pressure. The magnetic susceptibility along the c-axis \chi_c(T) shows
a small maximum around 250 K and does not follow the Curie-Weiss behavior while
the magnetic susceptibility along the a-axis \chi_a(T) follows a Curie-Weiss
behavior between 130 K and 300 K with a Weiss temperature \theta and an
effective magnetic moment \mu_eff which depend on the temperature range of the
fit. The easy axis of magnetization is perpendicular to the c-axis and
\chi_a/\chi_c = 3.2 at 1.8 K. The ambient pressure \chi_ac(T) and C(T)
measurements confirm bulk antiferromagnetic ordering at T_N = 1.1 K. The sharp
drop in \chi_ac below T_N is suggestive of the existence of a spin-gap. We
observe superconductivity only under applied pressures P\geq 2 kbar. The
temperature-pressure phase diagram showing the non-monotonic dependence of the
superconducting transition temperature T_c on pressure P is presented.
