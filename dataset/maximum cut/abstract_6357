Using
  Greenwich and SOON sunspot group data during the period 1874 -- 2005, we find
that the sums of the areas of the sunspot groups in $0^\circ$ -- $10^\circ$
latitude-interval of the
  Sun's northern hemisphere and in the time-interval, minus 1.35 year to plus
2.15 year from the time of the preceding minimum--and in the same latitude
interval of the southern hemisphere but plus 1.0 year to plus 1.75 year from
the time of the maximum--of a sunspot cycle are well correlating with the
amplitude (maximum of the smoothed monthly sunspot number) of its immediate
following cycle. Using this relationship it is possible to predict the
amplitude of a sunspot cycle by about 9 -- 13 years in advance. We predicted
$74 \pm 10$ for the amplitude of the upcoming cycle~24. Variations in solar
meridional flows during solar cycles and 9 -- 16 year variations in solar
equatorial rotation may be responsible for the aforementioned relationship.
