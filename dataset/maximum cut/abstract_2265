In the low energy region chiral perturbation theory including virtual photons
is used to derive the structure of the generating functional. The work we do is
performed within the three flavor framework and reaches up to next-to-leading
order. An Euclidian cut-off is introduced to separate the long- and
short-distance contributions. The long-distance part is evaluated in the ChPT
framework up to $\mathcal{O}(p^4)$. The short-distance part is achieved partly
from the work of J. Bijnens and J. Prades [1], through perturbative QCD and
factorization. A matching is made and the finite parts of the low-energy
constants (LECs) is determined by using already existing data of the QCD LECs
up to order $p^4$ [1],[2],[3].
