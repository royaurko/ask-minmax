New B, V, I photometry was obtained for a sample of 152 variables (125 RR
Lyrae's, 4 anomalous Cepheids, 11 classical Cepheids, 11 eclipsing binaries and
a delta Scuti star) in two regions near the bar of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC). We derived complete and well sampled B and V light curves, very accurate
periods, epochs of maximum light, amplitudes, intensity- and magnitude-averaged
apparent luminosities for about 95% of the RR Lyrae stars. All these
informations are contained in the photometric catalogue. Metallicities from the
Fourier decomposition of the V light curves were derived for 29 of the ab type
RR Lyrae's and are compared with the DeltaS metal abundances from low
resolution spectra obtained with the Very Large Telescope (VLT).
