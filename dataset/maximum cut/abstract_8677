In supersymmetric models the presence of Higgs triplets introduce new quartic
interactions for the doublets that may raise the mass of the lightest CP-even
field up to 205 GeV. We show that the complete effect of the triplets can be
understood by decoupling them from the minimal sector and then analyzing the
vacuum and the spectrum of the two-Higgs doublet model that results. We find
that the maximum value of m_h is only achieved in a very definite region of the
parameter space. In this region, however, radiative corrections decrease the
bound to 190 GeV.
