Constant-dimension codes have recently received attention due to their
significance to error control in noncoherent random network coding. In this
paper, we show that constant-rank codes are closely related to
constant-dimension codes and we study the properties of constant-rank codes. We
first introduce a relation between vectors in $\mathrm{GF}(q^m)^n$ and
subspaces of $\mathrm{GF}(q)^m$ or $\mathrm{GF}(q)^n$, and use it to establish
a relation between constant-rank codes and constant-dimension codes. We then
derive bounds on the maximum cardinality of constant-rank codes with given rank
weight and minimum rank distance. Finally, we investigate the asymptotic
behavior of the maximal cardinality of constant-rank codes with given rank
weight and minimum rank distance.
