We report calculation of heat capacity of an attractive Bose-Einstein
condensate, with the number N of bosons increasing and eventually approaching
the critical number Ncr for collapse, using the correlated potential harmonics
(CPH) method. Boson pairs interact via the realistic van der Waals potential.
It is found that the transition temperature Tc increases initially slowly, then
rapidly as N becomes closer to Ncr . The peak value of heat capacity for a
fixed N increases slowly with N, for N far away from Ncr . But after reaching a
maximum, it starts decreasing when N approaches Ncr . The effective potential
calculated by CPH method provides an insight into this strange behavior.
