NGC 1275 is a gamma-ray-emitting radio galaxy at the center of the Perseus
cluster. Its multi-wavelength spectrum is similar to that of blazers, and thus
a jet-origin of gamma-ray emissions is believed. In the optical and X-ray
region, NGC 1275 also shows a bright core, but their origin has not been
understood, since a disk emission is not ruled out. In fact, NGC 1275 exhibits
optical broad emission lines and a X-ray Fe-K line, which are typical for
Seyfert galaxies. In our precious studies of NGC 1275 with Suzaku/XIS, no X-ray
time variability was found from 2006 to 2011, regardless of moderate gamma-ray
variability observed by {it Fermi}-LAT~\cite{Yamazaki}. We have continued
monitoring observations of NGC 1275 with Suzaku/XIS. In 2013-2014, MeV/GeV
gams-ray flux of NGC 1275 gradually increased and reached the maximum at the
beginning of 2014. Correlated with this recent gamma-ray activity, we found
that X-ray flux also increased, and this is the first evidence of X-ray
variability of NGC 1275. Following these results, we discuss the emission
component during the time variability, but we cannot decide the origin of X-ray
variability correlating with gamma-ray. Therefore, for future observation, it
is important to observe NGC 1275 by using Fermi gamma-ray, XMM-Newton, NuStar,
ASTRO-H X-ray, CTA TeV gamma-ray and Kanata optical telescope.
