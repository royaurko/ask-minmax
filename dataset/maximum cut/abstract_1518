We report on the first investigation of plateau and cut-off structures in
photoelectron spectra from nano-scale metal tips interacting with few-cycle
near-infrared laser pulses. These hallmarks of electron rescattering,
well-known from atom-laser interaction in the strong-field regime, appear at
remarkably low laser intensities with nominal Keldysh parameters of the order
of $\gtrsim 10$. Quantum and quasi-classical simulations reveal that a large
field enhancement near the tip and the increased backscattering probability at
a solid-state target play a key role. Plateau electrons are by an order of
magnitude more abundant than in comparable atomic spectra, reflecting the high
density of target atoms at the surface. The position of the cut-off serves as
an in-situ probe for the locally enhanced electric field at the tip apex.
