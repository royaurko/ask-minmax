We apply the reaction-diffusion (stochastic) approach to the numerical
calculation of the elastic amplitude in the Reggeon Field Theory (RFT) and its
single diffractive cut. Fits to the total, integrated and differential elastic
cross sections with account of all Pomeron loops are reported together with
all-loop calculation of the single difraction dissociation cross section.
