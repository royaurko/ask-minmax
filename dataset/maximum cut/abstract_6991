The lack of X-ray pulsars with spin periods > 12 s raises the question of
where the population of evolved high magnetic field neutron stars has gone.
Unlike canonical radio pulsars, X-ray pulsars are not subject to physical
limits to the emission mechanism nor observational biases against the detection
of sources with longer periods. Here we show that a highly resistive layer in
the innermost part of the crust of neutron stars naturally limits the spin
period to a maximum value of about 10-20 s. This highly resistive layer is
expected if the inner crust is amorphous and heterogeneous in nuclear charge,
possibly due to the existence of a nuclear pasta phase. Our findings suggest
that the maximum period of isolated X-ray pulsars can be the first
observational evidence of an amorphous inner crust, which properties can be
further constrained by future X-ray timing missions combined with more detailed
models.
