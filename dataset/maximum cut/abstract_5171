The Yarowsky algorithm is a rule-based semi-supervised learning algorithm
that has been successfully applied to some problems in computational
linguistics. The algorithm was not mathematically well understood until (Abney
2004) which analyzed some specific variants of the algorithm, and also proposed
some new algorithms for bootstrapping. In this paper, we extend Abney's work
and show that some of his proposed algorithms actually optimize (an upper-bound
on) an objective function based on a new definition of cross-entropy which is
based on a particular instantiation of the Bregman distance between probability
distributions. Moreover, we suggest some new algorithms for rule-based
semi-supervised learning and show connections with harmonic functions and
minimum multi-way cuts in graph-based semi-supervised learning.
