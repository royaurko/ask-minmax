The main possibilities of investigation of leptons and bosons birth in
interaction of polarized photons are considered. The usage of $\gamma \gamma
\to f \bar{f} [+\gamma]$ reactions for the luminosity measurement on linear
photon collider is analyzed. The achievable precision of the luminosity
measuring is considered and calculated. The first-order QED correction to
$\gamma\gamma\to l \bar{l}$ scattering is analyzed. Differential cross section
of process $\gamma\gamma\to 4l$ is calculated using the helicity amplitudes
method as well as covariant method of precision calculations. All possible
polarization states of interacting particles are investigated under different
cuts of TESLA kinematics. For the detection of deviations from SM predictions
at linear $\gamma\gamma$ colliders with centre of mass energies running to $1
TeV$ the influence of three possible anomalous couplings on the cross sections
of $W^+W^-$ productions has been investigated. The significant discrimination
between various anomalous contributions is discovered. The main contribution of
high order electroweak effects is considered.
