In this paper, the capacity of a diffusion based molecular communication
network under the model of a Linear Time Invarient-Poisson (LTI-Poisson)
channel is studied. Introduced in the context of molecular communication, the
LTI-Poisson model is a natural extension of the conventional memoryless Poisson
channel to include memory. Exploiting prior art on linear ISI channels, a
computable finite-letter characterization of the capacity of single-hop
LTI-Poisson networks is provided. Then, the problem of finding more explicit
bounds on the capacity is examined, where lower and upper bounds for the point
to point case are provided. Furthermore, an approach for bounding mutual
information in the low SNR regime using the symmetrized KL divergence is
introduced and its applicability to Poisson channels is shown. To best of our
knowledge, the first non-trivial upper bound on the capacity of Poisson channel
with a maximum transmission constraint in the low SNR regime is found.
Numerical results show that the proposed upper bound is of the same order as
the capacity in the low SNR regime.
