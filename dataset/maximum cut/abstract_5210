High resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements have been carried
out on (La_1.4-xNd_0.6Sr_x)CuO_4, a model system with static stripes, and
(La_1.85Sr_0.15)CuO_4, a high temperature superconductor (T_c=40K) with dynamic
stripes. In addition to the straight segments near (pi, 0) and (0, pi)
antinodal regions, we have identified the existence of nodal spectral weight
and its associated Fermi surface in the electronic structure of both systems.
The ARPES spectra in the nodal region show well-defined Fermi cut-off,
indicating a metallic character of this charge-ordered state. This observation
of nodal spectral weight, together with the straight segments near antinodal
regions, reveals dual nature of the electronic structure of the stripes due to
the competition of order and disorder.
