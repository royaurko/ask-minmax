In this report a potential problem in the data analysis of the OPERA
experiment is discussed: the main issue is that the quantity "\partialt" used
in the maximum likelihood procedure is not a "true" parameter of the
parent-distribution (called PDF in the apaper) but a shift in the x-axis (time
scale). This means that the quantity "\partialt" has to be considered only as
systematic effect these error in not simply deducible from a gaussian
distribution as stated.
