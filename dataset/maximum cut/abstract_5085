Production in association with an electroweak vector boson V is a distinctive
mode of production for a Higgs boson H without tree-level couplings to
fermions, known as a fermiophobic Higgs boson. We focus on HV associated
production with H decay into a pair of photons, and V into a pair of jets, with
the goal of distinguishing a fermiophobic Higgs boson from the standard model
Higgs boson. Performing a simulation of the signal and pertinent QCD
backgrounds, and using the same event selection cuts employed by the LHC ATLAS
Collaboration, we argue that existing LHC data at 7 TeV with 4.9 fb^{-1} of
integrated luminosity may distinguish a fermiophobic Higgs boson from a
standard model Higgs boson near 125 GeV at about 1.9 standard deviation signal
significance (1.9 sigma) per experiment. At 8 TeV we show that associated
production could yield 2.8 sigma significance per experiment with 10 fb^{-1} of
data.
