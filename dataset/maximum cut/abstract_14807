We describe the main features of our most recent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
nuclear mass models, based on 16-parameter generalized Skyrme forces. They have
been fitted to the data of the 2012 Atomic Mass Evaluation, and favour a value
of 30 MeV for the symmetry coefficient J, the corresponding root-mean square
deviation being 0.549 MeV. We find that this conclusion is compatible with
measurements of neutron-skin thickness. By constraining the underlying
interactions to fit various equations of state of neutron matter calculated
{\it ab initio} our models are well adapted to a realistic and unified
treatment of all regions of neutron stars. We use our models to calculate the
composition, the equation of state, the mass-radius relation and the maximum
mass. Comparison with observations of neutron stars again favours a value of J
= 30 MeV.
