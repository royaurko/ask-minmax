We investigate the dependence of the carbon and oxygen production in stars on
the 3-alpha rate by varying the energy of the 02+-state of 12C and determine
the resulting yields for a selection of low-mass, intermediate-mass, and
massive stars. The yields are obtained using modern stellar evolution codes
that follow the entire evolution of massive stars, including the supernova
explosion, and consider in detail the 3rd dredge-up process during the
thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch of low-mass and intermediate-mass
stars. Our results show that the C and O production in massive stars depends
strongly on the initial mass, and that it is crucial to follow the entire
evolution. A rather strong C production during the He-shell flashes compared to
quiescent He burning leads to a lower sensitivity of the C and O production in
low-mass and intermediate-mass stars on the 3-alpha-rate than predicted in our
previous work. In particular, the C production of intermediate-mass stars seems
to have a maximum close to the actual value of the 02+ energy level of 12C.
