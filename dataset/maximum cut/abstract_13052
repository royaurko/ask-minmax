This paper aims to showcase the measure of structural diversity of an
ensemble of 9 classifiers and then map a relationship between this structural
diversity and accuracy. The structural diversity was induced by having
different architectures or structures of the classifiers The Genetical
Algorithms (GA) were used to derive the relationship between diversity and the
classification accuracy by evolving the classifiers and then picking 9
classifiers out on an ensemble of 60 classifiers. It was found that as the
ensemble became diverse the accuracy improved. However at a certain diversity
measure the accuracy began to drop. The Kohavi-Wolpert variance method is used
to measure the diversity of the ensemble. A method of voting is used to
aggregate the results from each classifier. The lowest error was observed at a
diversity measure of 0.16 with a mean square error of 0.274, when taking 0.2024
as maximum diversity measured. The parameters that were varied were: the number
of hidden nodes, learning rate and the activation function.
