IGR J11305-6256 is one of the numerous sources discovered through the
INTEGRAL scan of the Galactic Plane. Thanks to the Swift-BAT survey, that
allows the frequent sampling of any sky region, we have discovered in the hard
X-ray emission of this source a modulation with a period of ~120.83 d. The
significance of this periodic modulation is ~4 standard deviations in Gaussian
statistics. We interpret it as the orbital period of the binary system. We
derive an orbital separation between IGR J11305-6256 and its companion star of
~286 R$_{\odot}$ corresponding to ~19 times the radius of the companion star.
The broadband XRT-BAT (0.3-150 keV) spectrum is described either by the sum of
a black-body and a cut-off power-law or by a partially absorbed cut-off
power-law. The temporal and spectral characteristics of the source indicate its
possible association with the class of persistent, but faint, Be X-ray binary
systems.
