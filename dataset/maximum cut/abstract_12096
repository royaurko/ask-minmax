Stage-2 Cu$_{0.93}$Co$_{0.07}$Cl$_{2}$ graphite intercalation compound
magnetically behaves like a reentrant ferromagnet near the multicritical point
($c_{MCP} \approx 0.96$). It undergoes two magnetic phase transitions at
$T_{RSG}$ ($= 6.64 \pm 0.05$ K) and $T_{c}$ ($= 8.62 \pm 0.05$ K). The static
and dynamic nature of the ferromagnetic and reentrant spin glass phase has been
studied using DC and AC magnetic susceptibility. Characteristic memory
phenomena of the DC susceptibility are observed at $T_{RSG}$ and $T_{c}$. The
nonlinear AC susceptibility $\chi_{3}^{\prime}$ has a positive local maximum at
$T_{RSG}$, and a negative local minimum at $T_{c}$. The relaxation time $\tau$
between $T_{RSG}$ and $T_{c}$ shows a critical slowing down: $\tau$ with $x =
13.1 \pm 0.4$ and $\tau_{0}^{*} = (2.5 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-13}$ sec. The
influence of the random disorder on the critical behavior above $T_{c}$ is
clearly observed: $\alpha = -0.66$, $\beta = 0.63$, and $\gamma = 1.40$. The
exponent of $\alpha$ is far from that of 3D Heisenberg model.
