This paper is third in a series, studying the optical properties of a sample
of Seyfert galaxies. Here we present a homogeneous set of global (ellipticity,
position angle, inclination, and total magnitude) and isophotal (semi-major
axis and colour indices at 24 V mag/sq.arcsec) parameters of the galaxy sample.
We find the following median corrected isophotal colour indices: B-Ic = 1.9
mag/sq.arcsec and V-Ic = 1.1 mag/sq.arcsec. A set of bar parameters -
ellipticity, position angle, semi-major axis corresponding to the ellipticity
maximum in the bar region, and length, are also reported; deprojection has been
applied to the bar ellipticity, length, and relative length in terms of galaxy
isophotal semi-major axis. Regarding bar length estimation, we use a method,
based on the relation between the behaviour of the profiles and orbit analysis.
The so estimated bar length tightly correlates with the semi-major axis,
corresponding to the ellipticity maximum with a median ratio of the former to
the latter of 1.22. The median of the deprojected bar ellipticity, length, and
relative length are 0.39, 5.44 kpc, and 0.44, respectively. There is a
correlation between the deprojected bar length and the corrected isophotal
semi-major axis at 24 V mag/sq.arcsec. Three of the 17 large-scale bars appear
strong, based on the deprojected bar ellipticity as a first-order approximation
of bar strength. The deprojected relative bar length does not appear to
correlate with the bar ellipticity.
