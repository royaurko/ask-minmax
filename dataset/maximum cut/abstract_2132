We calculate the vector meson masses in $N_{\rm f} = 2+1$ Wilson chiral
perturbation theory at next-to-leading order. Generalizing the framework of
heavy vector meson chiral perturbation theory, the quark mass and the lattice
cutoff dependence of the vector meson masses is derived. Our chiral order
counting assumes that the lattice cut-off artifacts are of the order of the
typical pion momenta, $p \sim a\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^{2}$. This counting scheme is
consistent with the one in the pseudo scalar meson sector where the O($a^2$)
terms are included in the leading order chiral Lagrangian.
