A detailed study is presented of the counterrotating model (CRM) for generic
electrovacuum static axially symmetric relativistic thin disks without radial
pressure. We find a general constraint over the counterrotating tangential
velocities needed to cast the surface energy-momentum tensor of the disk as the
superposition of two counterrotating charged dust fluids. We also find explicit
expressions for the energy densities, charge densities and velocities of the
counterrotating fluids. We then show that this constraint can be satisfied if
we take the two counterrotating streams as circulating along electro-geodesics.
However, we show that, in general, it is not possible to take the two
counterrotating fluids as circulating along electro-geodesics nor take the two
counterrotating tangential velocities as equal and opposite. Four simple
families of models of counterrotating charged disks based on Chazy-Curzon-like,
Zipoy-Voorhees-like, Bonnor-Sackfield-like and Kerr-like electrovacuum
solutions are considered where we obtain some disks with a CRM well behaved.
The models are constructed using the well-known ``displace, cut and reflect''
method extended to solutions of vacuum Einstein-Maxwell equations.
