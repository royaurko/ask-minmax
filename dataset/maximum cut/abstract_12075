Thin films of cadmium stannate was prepared using low cost cadmium acetate
and tin (II) chloride precursors by spray pyrolysis technique at three
different substrate temperatures of 400, 450 and 5000 C. A novel procedure of
simultaneously forming additional layer, introduced for the first time in this
work, on the already coated cadmium stannate film reduced the sheet resistance
from 160 ohms/sq to 15 ohms/sq. Further, it is identified that the formation of
additional layer does not affect the structural and optical properties of the
cadmium stannate films, but improves the electrical property; thus the
formation of additional layer seems to be an effective alternate for annealing
the films at high temperature in the presence of Ar, CdS, Ar/CdS mixture,
hydrogen or nitrogen to improve the structural, electrical and optical
properties of the cadmium stannate films as has been reported in the
literature. The maximum optical transmittance value of the prepared cadmium
stannate film is about 99.8 % and the optical band gap energy value is about
2.9 eV.
