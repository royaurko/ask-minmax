The aim of this paper is to model the length of registration at university
and its associated academic outcome for undergraduate students at the
Pontificia Universidad Cat\'olica de Chile. Survival time is defined as the
time until the end of the enrollment period, which can relate to different
reasons - graduation or two types of dropout - that are driven by different
processes. Hence, a competing risks model is employed for the analysis. The
issue of separation of the outcomes (which precludes maximum likelihood
estimation) is handled through the use of Bayesian inference with an
appropriately chosen prior. We are interested in identifying important
determinants of university outcomes and the associ- ated model uncertainty is
formally addressed through Bayesian model averaging. The methodology introduced
for modelling university outcomes is applied to three selected degree
programmes, which are particularly affected by dropout and late graduation.
