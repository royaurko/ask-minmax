One dimensional stylized model taking into account spatial activity of firms
with uniformly distributed customers is proposed. The spatial selling area of
each firm is defined by a short interval cut out from selling space (large
interval). In this representation, the firm size is directly associated with
the size of its selling interval.
  The recursive synchronous dynamics of economic evolution is discussed where
the growth rate is proportional to the firm size incremented by the term
including the overlap of the selling area with areas of competing firms. Other
words, the overlap of selling areas inherently generate a negative feedback
originated from the pattern of demand. Numerical simulations focused on the
obtaining of the firm size distributions uncovered that the range of free
parameters where the Pareto's law holds corresponds to the range for which the
pair correlation between the nearest neighbor firms attains its minimum.
