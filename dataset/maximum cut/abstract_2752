We consider the production of $Z\gamma$ pairs at hadron colliders. We report
on the first complete and fully differential computation of radiative
corrections at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD perturbation theory. We
present selected numerical results for pp collisions at 7 TeV and compare them
to available LHC data. We find that the impact of the NNLO QCD corrections on
the fiducial cross section ranges between 4 and 15%, depending on the applied
cuts.
