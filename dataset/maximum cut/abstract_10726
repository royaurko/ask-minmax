We present the results of a deep wide-field near-infrared survey of the
entire Pleiades cluster recently released as part of the UKIRT Infrared Deep
Sky (UKIDSS) Galactic Clusters Survey (GCS) Data Release 9 (DR9). We have
identified a sample of ~1000 Pleiades cluster member candidates combining
photometry in five near-infrared passbands and proper motions derived from the
multiple epochs provided by the UKIDSS GCS DR9. We also provide revised
membership for all previously published Pleiades low-mass stars and brown
dwarfs in the past decade recovered in the UKIDSS GCS DR9 Pleiades survey based
on the new photometry and astrometry provided by the GCS. We find no evidence
of K-band variability in the Pleiades members larger than ~0.08 mag. In
addition, we infer a substellar binary frequency of 22-31% in the 0.075-0.03
Msun range for separations less than ~100 au. We employed two independent but
complementary methods to derive the cluster luminosity and mass functions: a
probabilistic analysis and a more standard approach consisting of stricter
astrometric and photometric cuts. We found that the resulting luminosity and
mass functions obtained from both methods are very similar. We derive the
Pleiades mass function in the 0.6-0.03 Msun mass range and found that it is
best reproduced by a log-normal representation with a mean characteristic mass
of 0.24(+0.01-0.03) Msun, in agreement with earlier studies and the
extrapolation of the field mass function.
