In many applications like FIR filters, FFT, signal processing and
measurements, we are required (~45 dB) or less side lobes amplitudes. However,
the problem is usual window based FIR filter design lies in its side lobes
amplitudes that are higher than the requirement of application. We propose a
window function, which has better performance like narrower main lobe width,
minimum side lobe peak compared to the several commonly used windows. The
proposed window has slightly larger main lobe width of the commonly used
Hamming window, while featuring 6.2\ sim 22.62 dB smaller side lobe peak. The
proposed window maintains its maximum side lobe peak about -58.4 \sim -52.6 dB
compared to -35.8 \sim -38.8 dB of Hamming window for M=10~14, while offering
roughly equal main lobe width. Our simulated results also show significant
performance upgrading of the proposed window compared to the Kaiser, Gaussian,
and Lanczos windows. The proposed window also shows better performance than
Dolph-Chebyshev window. Finally, the example of designed low pass FIR filter
confirms the efficiency of the proposed window.
