We introduce a new method for solving maximum likelihood problems through
variational calculus, and apply it to the case of recovering an unknown star
formation history, $SFR(t)$, from a resulting HR diagram. This approach allows
a totally non-parametric solution which has the advantage of requiring no
initial assumptions on the $SFR(t)$. As a full maximum likelihood statistical
model is used, we take advantage of all the information available in the HR
diagram, rather than concentrating on particular features such as turn off
points or luminosity functions. We test the method using a series of synthetic
HR diagrams produced from known $SFR(t)$, and find it to be quite successful
under noise conditions comparable to those present in current observations. At
this point we restrict the analysis to situations where the metallicity of the
system is known, as is the case with the resolved populations of the dwarf
spheroidal companions to the Milky Way or the solar neighbourhood Hipparcos
data. We also include tests to quantify the way uncertainties in the assumed
metallicity, binary fraction and IMF affect our inferences.
