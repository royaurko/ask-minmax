We have investigated the Quasi Periodic Oscillation (QPO) properties of the
transient accreting X-ray pulsar XTE J1858+034 during the second outburst of
this source in April-May 2004. We have used observations made with the
Proportional Counter Array (PCA) of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
during May 14-18 2004, in the declining phase of the outburst. We detected the
presence of low frequency QPOs in the frequency range of 140--185 mHz in all
the RXTE-PCA observations. We report evolution of the QPO parameters with the
time, X-ray flux, and X-ray photon energy. Though a correlation between the QPO
centroid frequency and the instantaneous X-ray flux is not very clear from the
data, we point out that the QPO frequency and the one day averaged X-ray flux
decreased with time during these observations. We have obtained a clear energy
dependence of the RMS variation in the QPOs, increasing from about 3% at 3 keV
to 6% at 25 keV. The X-ray pulse profile is a single peaked sinusoidal, with
pulse fraction increasing from 20% at 3 keV to 45% at 30 keV. We found that,
similar to the previous outburst, the energy spectrum is well fitted with a
model consisting of a cut-off power law along with an iron emission line.
