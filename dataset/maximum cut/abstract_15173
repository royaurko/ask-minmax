In this work, we propose a cross-layer design strategy based on a joint
successive interference cancellation (SIC) detection technique and a
multi-relay selection algorithm for the uplink of cooperative direct-sequence
code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems. We devise a low-cost greedy
list-based SIC (GL-SIC) strategy with RAKE receivers as the front-end that can
approach the maximum likelihood detector performance. %Unlike prior art, the
proposed GL-SIC algorithm %exploits the Euclidean distance between users of
interest, multiple %ordering and their constellation points to build an
effective list %of detection candidates. We also present a low-complexity
multi-relay selection algorithm based on greedy techniques that can approach
the performance of an exhaustive search. %A cross-layer %design strategy that
brings together the proposed GL-SIC algorithm %and the greedy relay selection
is then developed. Simulations show an excellent bit error rate performance of
the proposed detection and relay selection algorithms as compared to existing
techniques.
