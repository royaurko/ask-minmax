The prospects for detecting trilepton events ($\ell = e$ or $\mu$) from
chargino-neutralino ($\chi^\pm_1 \chi^0_2$) associated production are
investigated for the upgraded Fermilab Tevatron Collider in the context of the
minimal supergravity model (mSUGRA). In some regions of parameter space,
$\chi^\pm_1$ and $\chi^0_2$ decay dominantly into final states with $\tau$
leptons and the contributions from $\tau-$leptonic decays enhance the trilepton
signal substantially when soft cuts on lepton transverse momenta are used.
Additional sources of the mSUGRA trilepton signal and dominant irreducible
backgrounds are discussed. The dilepton ($\ell^+\ell^-$) invariant mass
distribution near the endpoint is considered as a test of mSUGRA mass
relations. Discovery contours for $p\bar{p} \to 3\ell +X$ at 2 TeV with an
integrated luminosity of 2 fb$^{-1}$ to 30 fb$^{-1}$ are presented in the
mSUGRA parameter space of $(m_0,m_{1/2})$ for several choices of $\tan\beta$.
