This paper is devoted to the estimation of a vector $\bm {\theta}$
parametrizing an energy function of a Gibbs point process, via the maximum
pseudolikelihood method. Strong consistency and asymptotic normality results of
this estimator depending on a single realization are presented. In the
framework of exponential family models, sufficient conditions are expressed in
terms of the local energy function and are verified on a wide variety of
examples.
