An accurate low-energy dispersive parametrization of the scalar Kpi form
factor was constructed some time ago in terms of a single parameter guided by
the Callan-Treiman low-energy theorem. A similar twice subtracted dispersive
parametrization for the vector Kpi form factor will be investigated here. The
robustness of the parametrization of these two form factors will be studied in
great detail. In particular the cut-off dependence, the isospin breaking
effects and the possible, though not highly probable, presence of zeros in the
form factors will be discussed. Interesting constraints in the latter case will
be obtained from the soft-kaon analog of the Callan-Treiman theorem and a
comparison with the recent tau --> K pi nu_tau data.
