We demonstrate strong laser-field-free orientation of absolute-ground-state
carbonyl sulfide molecules. The molecules are oriented by the combination of a
485-ps-long non-resonant laser pulse and a weak static electric field. The
edges of the laser pulse create a coherent superposition of two rotational
states resulting in revivals of strong transient molecular orientation after
the laser pulse. The experimentally attained degree of orientation of 0.6
corresponds to the theoretical maximum for mixing of the two states. Switching
off the dc field would provide the same orientation completely field-free.
