Analytical expressions for the evaluation of AC losses in a
superconductor-metal composite strip in a nonuniform AC magnetic field having
the form of a standing wave are derived. The considered configuration models
superconducting tapes, thin films and coated superconductors. A distinctive
feature of the problem is the appearance of a transverse component of the
induced current that converts the problem to a two-dimensional one. Bean's
critical state model for a superconductor and a low frequency approximation for
a metal are used. In the framework of this approximation the influence of eddy
currents in the metal on the magnetic field is neglected, and the current
distribution in the superconductor is determined by an external field. Two
cases were considered: (1) superconducting and metal strips electrically
separated; (2) they are in an electric contact. It is shown that for most
practical cases enough to take into account only the losses generated by
induced longitudinal currents in a composite strip. When an electric contact
between strips exists, the maximum loss density in high fields (above 2 T) can
be determined by the transverse component of the current.
