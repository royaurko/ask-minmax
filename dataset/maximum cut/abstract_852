This paper proposes a method to vibration analysis in order to on-line
monitoring of milling process quality. Adapting envelope analysis to
characterize the milling tool materials is an important contribution to the
qualitative and quantitative characterization of milling capacity and a step by
modeling the three-dimensional cutting process. An experimental protocol was
designed and developed for the acquisition, processing and analyzing
three-dimensional signal. The vibration envelope analysis is proposed to detect
the cutting capacity of the tool with the optimization application of cutting
parameters. The research is focused on Hilbert transform optimization to
evaluate the dynamic behavior of the machine/ tool/workpiece.
