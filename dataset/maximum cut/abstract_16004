We report the detection at X-rays of the radio/optical hotspot and knots of
3C 303 from a short (15 ksec) Chandra exposure in 2001 March. The X-ray
morphology is similar to that of the radio/optical emission with peaks in the
X-ray emission found at 5.5''(knot B), 9'' (knot C) and 17'' (hotspot) from the
core of 3C 303. Despite the limited signal-to-noise ratio of the short Chandra
exposure, the X-ray photon spectrum was measured for the hotspot. We construct
the spectral energy distribution (SED) and find that the X-ray flux is well
below the extrapolation of the radio-to-optical continuum, which we interpret
as resulting from the production of X-rays via inverse Compton scattering of
both synchrotron photons (SSC) and cosmic microwave background photons
(EC/CMB). The magnetic field strength, region size, and the maximum energy of
electrons are self-consistently determined for the hotspot to be B ~ 4.3 \mu G,
R ~ 6.5x10^{21} cm, and G_max ~ 1.4x10^7. This implies a magnetic field
strength a factor of ~30 below the equipartition value; B_eq ~ 150 \mu G. The
origin of this large departure from equipartition is still uncertain, but the
discrepancy is reduced if the plasma in the hotspot is moving with mildly
relativistic speeds. Our observation of 3C 303, as well as recent Chandra
detections of large scale jets and hotspots in a number of radio galaxies,
confirm that particles are accelerated very efficiently in radio galaxies.
