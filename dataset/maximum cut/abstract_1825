Universal properties of efficiency at maximum power are investigated in a
general setting. In particular, it is demonstrated how successive symmetries
placed upon the dynamics manifest themselves at the macroscopic level. A
general condition is derived for which thermodynamic devices are able to attain
a reversible operation.
