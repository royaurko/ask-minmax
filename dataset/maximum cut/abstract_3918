I propose a modification of the spherical infall model for the evolution of
density fluctuations with initially Gaussian probability distribution and
scale-free power spectra. I introduce a generalized form of the initial density
distribution around an overdense region and cut it off at half the inter-peak
separation accounting in this way for the presence of neighbouring
fluctuations. Contrary to the original predictions of the model, resulting
density profiles within virial radii no longer have power-law dependence on the
distance, but are well fitted by the universal formula of changing slope
obtained as a result of N-body simulations. The profiles of halos of a given
mass are in general flatter than the corresponding ones from the simulations,
but the trend of steeper profiles for smaller masses is reproduced. The
profiles of galaxy size objects are in general in better agreement with N-body
simulations than those of larger ones.
