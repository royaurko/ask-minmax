The better understanding of the material cutting process has been shown with
the benefit of the forces and moments measurement since some years ago. In
paper, simultaneous six mechanical components and chip orientation measurements
were realized during turning tests. During these tests, the influence of the
depth of cut or feed rate has been observed and a link between the chip
orientation and the moment vector orientation or the central axis
characteristics has been shown.
