The total charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon cross section is usually
estimated by the sum of contributions from quasi-elastic scattering (QES),
single-pion production through baryon resonances (RES), and deep inelastic
scattering (DIS) with an appropriate scratching the phase space of the RES and
DIS contributions. However the resulting total cross section is very sensitive
to the value of the cut-off in invariant mass of the final hadron system
produced in RES and DIS. We examine available experimental data on the QES and
total CC cross sections in order to extract the best-fit value for this
cut-off. By using the same data set we attempt to adjust the poorly known
values of the axial mass for QES and RES.
