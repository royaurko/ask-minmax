We present the results of new AGILE observations of PSR B1509-58 performed
over a period of $\sim$2.5 years following the detection obtained with
preliminary data. The modulation significance of the lightcurve above 30 MeV is
at a 5$\sigma$ confidence level and the lightcurve is similar to those found
earlier up to 30 MeV by COMPTEL: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching its
maximum $0.39 \pm 0.02$ cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at $0.94
\pm 0.03$. The $\gamma$-ray spectral energy distribution of pulsed flux is well
described by a power-law (photon index $\alpha=1.87\pm0.09$) with a remarkable
cutoff at $E_c=81\pm 20$ MeV, representing the softest spectrum observed among
$\gamma$-ray pulsars so far. The unusual soft break in the spectrum of PSR
B1509-58 has been interpreted in the framework of polar cap models as a
signature of the exotic photon splitting process in the strong magnetic field
of this pulsar. In the case of an outer-gap scenario, or the two pole caustic
model, better constraints on the geometry of the emission would be needed from
the radio band in order to establish whether the conditions required by the
models to reproduce AGILE lightcurves and spectra match the polarization
measurements.
