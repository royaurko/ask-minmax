We present a new method for reconstructing two-dimensional mass maps of
galaxy clusters from the image distortion of background galaxies. In contrast
to most previous approaches, which directly convert locally averaged image
ellipticities to mass maps (direct methods), our entropy-regularized
maximum-likelihood method is an inverse approach. Albeit somewhat more
expensive computationally, our method allows high spatial resolution in those
parts of the cluster where the lensing signal is strong enough. Furthermore, it
allows to straightforwardly incorporate additional constraints, such as
magnification information or strong-lensing features. Using synthetic data, we
compare our new approach to direct methods and find indeed a substantial
improvement especially in the reconstruction of mass peaks. The main
differences to previously published inverse methods are discussed.
