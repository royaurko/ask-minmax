The bosonic excitations induced by the omega meson propagation in dense
nuclear matter is studied within the framework of random phase approximation.
The collective modes are then analyzed by finding the zeros of the relevant
dielectric functions. Subsequently we present closed form analytical
expressions for the dispersion relations in different kinematical regime. Next,
the analytical behaviour of the in-medium effective propagator for the omega
meson is examined. This is exploited to calculate the full spectral function
for the transverse (T) and longitudinal (L) mode of the omega meson. In
addition, various sum rules are constructed for the omega meson spectral
density in nuclear medium. Results are then discussed by calculating residues
at the poles and discontinuities across the cuts.
