We study charged boson stars in scalar-tensor (ST) gravitational theories. We
analyse the weak field limit of the solutions and analytically show that there
is a maximum charge to mass ratio for the bosons above which the weak field
solutions are not stable. This charge limit can be greater than the GR limit
for a wide class of ST theories. We numerically investigate strong field
solutions in both the Brans Dicke and power law ST theories. We find that the
charge limit decreases with increasing central boson density. We discuss the
gravitational evolution of charged and uncharged boson stars in a cosmological
setting and show how, at any point in its evolution, the physical properties of
the star may be calculated by a rescaling of a solution whose asymptotic value
of the scalar field is equal to its initial asymptotic value. We focus on
evolution in which the particle number of the star is conserved and we find
that the energy and central density of the star decreases as the cosmological
time increases. We also analyse the appearance of the scalarization phenomenon
recently discovered for neutron stars configurations and, finally, we give a
short discussion on how making the correct choice of mass influences the
argument over which conformal frame, the Einstein frame or the Jordan frame, is
physical.
