We extend a previously theory for the interspecific allometric scaling
developed in a $d+1$-dimensional space of metabolic states. The time, which is
characteristic of all biological processes, is included as an extra dimension
to $d$ biological lengths. The different metabolic rates, such as basal (BMR)
and maximum (MMR), are described by supposing that the biological lengths and
time are related by different transport processes of energy and mass.
  We consider that the metabolic rates of animals are controlled by three main
transport processes: convection, diffusion and anomalous diffusion. Different
transport mechanisms are related to different metabolic states, with its own
values for allometric exponents. In $d=3$, we obtain that the exponent $b$ of
BMR is $b=0.71$, and that the aerobic sustained MMR upper value of the exponent
is $b=0.86$ (best empirical values for mammals: $b=0.69(2)$ and $b=0.87(3)$).
The 3/4-law appears as an upper limit of BMR. The MMR scaling in different
conditions, other exponents related to BMR and MMR, and the metabolism of
unicellular organisms are also discussed.
