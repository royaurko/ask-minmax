Convincing evidence of a past interaction between two rich clusters A399 and
A401 was recently found by the X-ray imaging observations. In this paper we
examine the structure and dynamics of this pair of galaxy clusters. A
mixture-modeling algorithm has been applied to obtain a robust partition into
two clusters, which allows us to discuss the virial mass and velocity
distribution for each cluster. Assuming that these two clusters follow a linear
orbit and they have once experienced a close encounter, we model the binary
cluster as a two-body system. As a result, four gravitationally bound solutions
are obtained. The recent X-ray observations seem to favor a scenario in which
the two clusters with a true separation of $5.4h^{-1}$ Mpc are currently
expanding at 583 km/s along the direction with a projection angle of 67.5
degree, and they will reach a maximum extent of $5.65h^{-1}$ Mpc in about
$1.0h^{-1}$ Gyr.
