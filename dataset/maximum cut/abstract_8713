We briefly review the recent advances of heavy-quark recombination mechanism.
This mechanism predicts a class of power-suppressed 3-jet events in $Z^0$
decay, such as $b\bar{b}q$ and $b\bar{b}\bar{q}$. Furthermore, heavy quark
fragmentation function also receives a contribution from this mechanism. Some
light can be shed on the scaling of the maximum of the fragmentation function
for S-wave heavy hadrons. We finally comment on a new variant of this mechanism
which has important impact on the precision electroweak physics.
