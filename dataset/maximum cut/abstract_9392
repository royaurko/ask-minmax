Using the known solutions of the Lugiato-Lefever equation, we derive
universal trends of Kerr frequency combs. In particular, normalized properties
of temporal cavity soliton solutions lead us to a simple analytic estimate of
the maximum attainable bandwidth for given pump-resonator parameters. The
result is validated via comparison with past experiments encompassing a diverse
range of resonator configurations and parameters.
