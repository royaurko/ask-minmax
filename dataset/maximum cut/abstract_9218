We calculate the low-temperature thermodynamic quantities (magnetization,
correlation functions, transverse and longitudinal correlation lengths, spin
susceptibility, and specific heat) of the frustrated one-dimensional spin-half
J1-J2 Heisenberg ferromagnet, i.e. for J2< 0.25|J1|, in an external magnetic
field using a second-order Green-function formalism and full diagonalization of
finite systems. We determine power-law relations for the field dependence of
the position and the height of the maximum of the uniform susceptibility.
Considering the specific heat at low magnetic fields, two maxima in its
temperature dependence are found.
