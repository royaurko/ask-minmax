We report the first fully self-consistent calculations of the nonlinear
optical properties of superlattices. The materials investigated are mono-layer
superlattices with GaP grown on the the top of InP, AlP and GaAs (110)
substrates. We use the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method
within the generalized gradient approximation to obtain the frequency dependent
dielectric tensor and the second-harmonic-generation susceptibility. The effect
of lattice relaxations on the linear optical properties are studied. Our
calculations show that the major anisotropy in the optical properties is the
result of strain in GaP. This anisotropy is maximum for the superlattice with
maximum lattice mismatch between the constituent materials. In order to
differentiate the superlattice features from the bulk-like transitions an
improvement over the existing effective medium model is proposed. The
superlattice features are found to be more pronounced for the second-order than
the linear optical response indicating the need for full supercell calculations
in determining the correct second-order response.
