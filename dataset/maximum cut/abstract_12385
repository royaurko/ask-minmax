We present the Master Integrals needed for the calculation of the two-loop
QCD corrections to the forward-backward asymmetry of a quark-antiquark pair
produced in electron-positron annihilation events. The abelian diagrams
entering in the evaluation of the vector form factors were calculated in a
previous paper. We consider here the non-abelian diagrams and the diagrams
entering in the computation of the axial form factors, for arbitrary space-like
momentum transfer Q^2 and finite heavy quark mass m. Both the UV and IR
divergences are regularized in the continuous D-dimensional scheme. The Master
Integrals are Laurent-expanded around D=4 and evaluated by the differential
equation method; the coefficients of the expansions are expressed as
1-dimensional harmonic polylogarithms of maximum weight 4.
