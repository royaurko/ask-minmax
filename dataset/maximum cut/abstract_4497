Generalised unitarity techniques are used to calculate the coefficients of
box and triangle integral functions of one-loop gluon scattering amplitudes in
gauge theories with $N < 4$ supersymmetries. We show that the box coefficients
in N=1 and N=0 theories inherit the same coplanar and collinear constraints as
the corresponding N=4 coefficients. We use triple cuts to determine the
coefficients of the triangle integral functions and present, as an example, the
full expression for the one-loop amplitude $A^{N=1}(1^-,2^-,3^-,4^+,..,n^+)$.
