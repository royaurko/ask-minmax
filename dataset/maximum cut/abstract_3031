We report on photometric observations of V 1493 Aql during the early decline
and highlight some uncommon aspects of the light curve. V 1493 Aql was hotter
at maximum light than in the following phases, and was characterized by the
presence of a long lasting secondary maximum, that, unlike in other novae, was
quite red in color. The mean of three distance estimates yields d ~ 18.8 +/-
3.6 Kpc. Such a large distance would place V 1493 Aql at the extreme outskirts
of our Galaxy or even in an external Local Group galaxy.
