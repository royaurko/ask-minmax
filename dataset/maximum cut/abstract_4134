Dijet production by almost real photons has been studied at HERA with the
ZEUS detector. Jets have been identified using the cone algorithm. A cut on xg,
the fraction of the photon energy participating in the production of the two
jets of highest transverse energy, is used to define cross sections sensitive
to the parton distributions in the proton and in the photon. The dependence of
the dijet cross sections on pseudorapidity has been measured for xg $\ge 0.75$
and xg $< 0.75$. The former is sensitive to the gluon momentum density in the
proton. The latter is sensitive to the gluon in the photon. The cross sections
are corrected for detector acceptance and compared to leading order QCD
calculations.
