We present the analysis of the signature 2j + ETmiss (+X) via squark-squark
production and direct decay into the lightest neutralino, pp -> squark squark
-> j j chi_1^0 chi_1^0 (+X), in next-to-leading order QCD within the framework
of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. In our approximation the produced
squarks are treated on shell. Thus, the calculation of production and decay
factorizes. In this way, we provide a consistent, fully differential
calculation of NLO QCD factorizable corrections to the given processes.
Clustering final states into partonic jets, we investigate the experimental
inclusive signature 2j + ETmiss for several benchmark scenarios. We compare
resulting differential distributions with leading-order approximations rescaled
by a flat K-factor and examine a possible impact for cut-and-count searches for
supersymmetry at the LHC.
