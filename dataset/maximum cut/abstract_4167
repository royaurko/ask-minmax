We calculate the pressure in QCD with two and three light quarks on a lattice
of size 16^3x4 using tree level improved gauge and fermion actions. We argue
that for temperatures T > 2T_c systematic effects due to the finite lattice
cut-off and non-vanishing quark masses are below 15% in this calculation and
give an estimate for the continuum extrapolated pressure in QCD with massless
quarks. We find that the flavour dependence of the pressure is dominated by
that of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Furthermore we perform a calculation of
the pressure using 2 light (m_u,d/T=0.4) and one heavier quark (m_s/T = 1). In
this case the pressure is reduced relative to that of three flavour QCD. This
effect is stronger than expected from the mass dependence of an ideal Fermi
gas.
