We show that various formulations (e.g., dual and Kullback-Csiszar
iterations) of estimation of maximum entropy (ME) models can be transformed to
solving systems of polynomial equations in several variables for which one can
use celebrated Grobner bases methods. Posing of ME estimation as solving
polynomial equations is possible, in the cases where feature functions
(sufficient statistic) that provides the information about the underlying
random variable in the form of expectations are integer valued.
