A study of the effects of short-range correlations over the (e,e'p) reaction
for low missing energy in closed shell nuclei is presented. We use correlated,
quasi-hole overlap functions extracted from the asymptotic behavior of the
one-body density matrix, containing central correlations of Jastrow type, up to
first-order in a cluster expansion, and computed in the very high asymptotic
region, up to 100 fm. The method to extract the overlap functions is checked in
a simple shell model, where the exact results are known. We find that the
single-particle wave functions of the valence shells are shifted to the right
due to the short-range repulsion by the nuclear core. The corresponding
spectroscopic factors are reduced only a few percent with respect to the shell
model. However, the (e,e'p) response functions and cross sections are enhanced
in the region of the maximum of the missing momentum distribution due to
short-range correlations.
