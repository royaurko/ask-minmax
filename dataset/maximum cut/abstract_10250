We present the orbital-phase resolved analysis of an archival FO Aqr
observation obtained using the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton),
European Photon Imaging Camera (pn instrument). We investigate the variation of
the spin pulse amplitudes over the orbital period in order to account for the
effects of orbital motion on spin modulation. The semi-amplitude variations are
in phase with the orbital modulation, changing from (38.0 +/- 1.8)% at the
orbital maximum to (13.3 +/- 3.7)% at the orbital minimum. The spectral
parameters also show changes over the orbital period. One of the absorption
components increase by a factor of 5 between the orbital minimum and maximum.
We interpret that this absorption arises from the bulge where accretion stream
from the secondary impacts the disk. The spectrum extracted from the orbital
minima and maxima can be fitted with a warm absorber model yielding values N_H
= 2.09 (+0.98 -1.09) \times 10^22 and 0.56 (+0.26 -0.15) \times 1022 cm^{-2} ;
and log({\xi}) = 0.23 (+0.37 -0.26) and <0.30 erg cm s^{-1} respectively,
indicating the existence of ionized absorption from the bulge at the impact
zone which is spread out on the disk. The absorption due to accretion curtain
and/or column which causes the spin modulation can be distinguished from the
disk absorption via spectral modeling.
