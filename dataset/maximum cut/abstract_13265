We experimentally investigate jamming in a quasi-two-dimensional granular
system of automatically swelling particles and show that a maximum in the
height of the first peak of the pair correlation function is a structural
signature of the jamming transition at zero temperature. The same signature is
also found in the second peak of the pair correlation function, but not in the
third peak, reflecting the underlying singularity of jamming transition. We
also study the development of clusters in this system. A static length scale
extracted from the cluster structure reaches the size of the system when the
system approaches the jamming point. Finally, we show that in a highly
inhomogeneous system, friction causes the system to jam in series of steps. In
this case, jamming may be obtained through successive buckling of force chains.
