Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical imaging technique
to assess the health of the auditory (vestibulocochlear) nerve. A well known
problem with MRI machines is that the acoustic noise they generate during a
scan can cause auditory temporary threshold shifts (TTS) in humans. In
addition, studies have shown that excessive noise in general can cause rapid
physiological changes of constituents of the auditory within the cochlea. Here,
we report in-situ measurements of the acoustic noise from a 1.5 Tesla MRI
machine (GE Signa) during scans specific to auditory nerve assessment. The
measured average and maximum noise levels corroborate earlier investigations
where TTS occurred. We briefly discuss the potential for physiological changes
to the intracochlear branches of the auditory nerve as well as iatrogenic
misdiagnoses of intralabyrinthine and intracochlear schwannomas due to
hypertrophe of the auditory nerve within the cochlea during MRI assessment.
