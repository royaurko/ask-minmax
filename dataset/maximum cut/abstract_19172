In phylogenetic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to
have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species.
In the presence of lateral gene transfer (LGT), however, this may not be the
case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have
gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or
reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the
evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modelling the
speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate
that if the number of sampled species is small compared to the total number of
existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve
speciation to, and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that
the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good
approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described
by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to
calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum likelihood
reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near
universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of
transfer events -- 28% -- appear to have topological signatures of evolution
along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their
ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.
