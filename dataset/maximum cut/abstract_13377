We report the detection of the lunar gamma-ray emission during the first year
of Fermi-LAT observations. Such emission is produced by cosmic ray nuclei
interacting with the lunar surface. Thanks to the solar minimum conditions and
the reduced effects of heliospheric modulation, the lunar flux was at its
maximum due to the increased flux of Galactic cosmic rays hitting the lunar
surface. Fermi-LAT instrument has a superior sensitivity, angular resolution,
and observes the whole sky every two orbits. It is the only gamma-ray mission
capable of detecting the lunar emission with high confidence and to monitor it
over the full 24th solar cycle. We also report the status of a search of the
gamma-ray emission from major planets and asteroid populations in the ecliptic
plane.
