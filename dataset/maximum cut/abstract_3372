A mesh-dependent relation for the slip number in the Navier-slip with
friction boundary condition for computations of impinging droplets is proposed.
The relation is obtained as a function of the Reynolds number, the Weber number
and the mesh size. The proposed relation is validated for several test cases by
comparing the numerically obtained wetting diameter with the experimental
results. Further, the computationally obtained maximum wetting diameter using
the proposed slip relation is verified with the theoretical predictions. The
relative error between the computationally obtained maximum wetting diameter
and the theoretical predictions is less than 10 % for impinging droplet on a
hydrophilic surface, and the error increases in the case of hydrophobic
surface.
