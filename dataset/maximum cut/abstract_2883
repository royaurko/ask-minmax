We investigate the nature of the low-energy, large-scale excitations in the
three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass with Gaussian couplings and
free boundary conditions, by studying the response of the ground state to a
coupling-dependent perturbation introduced previously. The ground states are
determined exactly for system sizes up to 12^3 spins using a branch and cut
algorithm. The data are consistent with a picture where the surface of the
excitations is not space-filling, such as the droplet or the ``TNT'' picture,
with only minimal corrections to scaling. When allowing for very large
corrections to scaling, the data are also consistent with a picture with
space-filling surfaces, such as replica symmetry breaking. The energy of the
excitations scales with their size with a small exponent \theta', which is
compatible with zero if we allow moderate corrections to scaling. We compare
the results with data for periodic boundary conditions obtained with a genetic
algorithm, and discuss the effects of different boundary conditions on
corrections to scaling. Finally, we analyze the performance of our branch and
cut algorithm, finding that it is correlated with the existence of
large-scale,low-energy excitations.
