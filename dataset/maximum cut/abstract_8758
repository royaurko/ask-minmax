We define and study Vassiliev invariants for (long) Morse knots. It is shown
that there are Vassiliev invariants which can distinguish some topologically
equivalent Morse knots. In particular, there is an invariant of order 3 for
Morse knots with one maximum that distinguishes two different representations
of the figure eight knot. We also present the results of computer calculations
for some invariants of low order. It turns out that for Morse knots with two
maxima there is a Z/2-valued invariant of order 6 which is not a reduction of
any integer-valued invariant.
