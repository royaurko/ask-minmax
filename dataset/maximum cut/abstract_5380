Distinguishing quark-initiated jets from gluon-initiated jets has the
potential to significantly improve the reach of many beyond-the-standard model
searches at the Large Hadron Collider and to provide additional tests of QCD.
To explore whether quark and gluon jets could possibly be distinguished on an
event-by-event basis, we perform a comprehensive simulation-based study. We
explore a variety of motivated and unmotivated variables with a semi-automated
multivariate approach. General conclusions are that at 50% quark jet acceptance
efficiency, around 80%-90% of gluon jets can be rejected. Some benefit is
gained by combining variables. Different event generators are compared, as are
the effects of using only charged tracks to avoid pileup. Additional
information, including interactive distributions of most variables and their
cut efficiencies, can be at http://jets.physics.harvard.edu/qvg.
