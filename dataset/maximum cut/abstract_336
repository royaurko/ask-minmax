A new class of solutions to Laplacian growth with zero surface tension is
presented and shown to contain all other known solutions as special or limiting
cases. These solutions, which are time-dependent conformal maps with branch
cuts inside the unit circle, are governed by a nonlinear integral equation and
describe oil fjords with non-parallel walls in viscous fingering experiments in
Hele-Shaw cells. Integrals of motion for the multi-cut Laplacian growth
solutions in terms of singularities of the Schwarz function are found, and the
dynamics of densities (jumps) on the cuts are derived. The subclass of these
solutions with linear Cauchy densities on the cuts of the Schwarz function is
of particular interest, because in this case the integral equation for the
conformal map becomes linear. These solutions can also be of physical
importance by representing oil/air interfaces, which form oil fjords with a
constant opening angle, in accordance with recent experiments in a Hele-shaw
cell.
