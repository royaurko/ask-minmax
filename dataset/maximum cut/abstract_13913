In the offered review ordering received and published by domestic and foreign
researchers of the experimental results showing the phenomenon of a
photoluminescence in glasses and optical fiber, activated by bismuth is
executed, and from uniform positions representations about the process
responsible for a photoluminescence in case of use for excitation of this
environment of various laser sources are considered. At interpretation of
process of a photoluminescence the known model considering mirror symmetry of
features of frequency spectra of a photoluminescence (in this case the maximum
values is used: humps or peaks of spectra of a photoluminescence) and the
spectra characterising optical losses (absorption) of glass, activated by
(atomic) bismuth. For the analysis values of lines of the bismuth, published in
reference media are used. This model is added by earlier published
specification of the contributor, according to which to a point of mirror symmetry
of such spectra there corresponds frequency of radiation of the source raising
a photoluminescence - mean arithmetical of the frequencies of peaks of spectra
of a photoluminescence and frequencies of lines atomic bismuth.
