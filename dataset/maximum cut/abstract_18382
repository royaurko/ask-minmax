Chandra observations of the Vela pulsar-wind nebula (PWN) have revealed a jet
in the direction of the pulsar's proper motion, and a counter-jet in the
opposite direction, embedded in diffuse nebular emission. The jet consists of a
bright, 8''-long inner jet, between the pulsar and the outer arc, and a dim,
curved outer jet that extends up to 100'' in approximately the same direction.
 From the analysis of thirteen Chandra observations spread over about 2.5 years
we found that this outer jet shows particularly strong variability, changing
its shape and brightness. We observed bright blobs in the outer jet moving away
from the pulsar with apparent speeds (0.3-0.6)c and fading on time-scales of
days to weeks. The spectrum of the outer jet fits a power-law model with a
photon index of 1.3\pm0.1. The X-ray emission of the outer jet can be
interpreted as synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons/positrons.
This interpretation allows one to estimate the magnetic field, ~100 microGauss,
maximum energy of X-ray emitting electrons, ~2\times 10^{14} eV, and energy
injection rate, ~8\times 10^{33} erg/s, for the outer jet. In the summed PWN
image we see a dim, 2'-long outer counter-jet, which also shows a power-law
spectrum with photon ined of 1.2-1.5. Southwest of the jet/counter-jet an
extended region of diffuse emission is seen. Relativistic particles responsible
for this radiation are apparently supplied by the outer jet.
