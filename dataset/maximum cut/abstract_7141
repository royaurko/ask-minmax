We discuss how maximum entropy methods may be applied to the reconstruction
of Markov processes underlying empirical time series and compare this approach
to usual frequency sampling. It is shown that, at least in low dimension, there
exists a subset of the space of stochastic matrices for which the MaxEnt method
is more efficient than sampling, in the sense that shorter historical samples
have to be considered to reach the same accuracy. Considering short samples is
of particular interest when modelling smoothly non-stationary processes, for
then it provides, under some conditions, a powerful forecasting tool. The
method is illustrated for a discretized empirical series of exchange rates.
