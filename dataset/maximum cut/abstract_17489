Recently, lattice reduction (LR) technique has caught great attention for
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) receiver because of its low complexity and high
performance. However, when the number of antennas is large, LR-aided linear
detectors and successive interference cancellation (SIC) detectors still
exhibit considerable performance gap to the optimal maximum likelihood detector
(MLD). To enhance the performance of the LR-aided detectors, the LR-aided
K-best algorithm was developed at the cost of the extra complexity on the order
$\mathcal{O}(N_t^2 K + N_t K^2)$, where $N_t$ is the number of transmit
antennas and $K$ is the number of candidates. In this paper, we develop an
LR-aided K-best algorithm with lower complexity by exploiting a priority queue.
With the aid of the priority queue, our analysis shows that the complexity of
the LR-aided K-best algorithm can be further reduced to $\mathcal{O}(N_t^2 K +
N_t K {\rm log}_2(K))$. The low complexity of the proposed LR-aided K-best
algorithm allows us to perform the algorithm for large MIMO systems (e.g.,
50x50 MIMO systems) with large candidate sizes. Simulations show that as the
number of antennas increases, the error performance approaches that of AWGN
channel.
