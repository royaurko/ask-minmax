In this paper we present a new mathematical model for the density regions
where a specific spectral line and its SACs/DACs are created in the Oe and Be
stellar atmospheres. In the calculations of final spectral line function we
consider that the main reasons of the line broadening are the rotation of the
density regions creating the spectral line and its DACs/SACs, as well as the
random motions of the ions. This line function is able to reproduce the
spectral feature and it enables us to calculate some important physical
parameters, such as the rotational, the radial and the random velocities, the
Full Width at Half Maximum, the Gaussian deviation, the optical depth, the
column density and the absorbed or emitted energy. Additionally, we can
calculate the percentage of the contribution of the rotational velocity and the
ions' random motions of the DACs/SACs regions to the line broadening. Finally,
we present two tests and three short applications of the proposed model.
