This paper presents a new Bayesian model and algorithm for nonlinear unmixing
of hyperspectral images. The model proposed represents the pixel reflectances
as linear combinations of the endmembers, corrupted by nonlinear (with respect
to the endmembers) terms and additive Gaussian noise. Prior knowledge about the
problem is embedded in a hierarchical model that describes the dependence
structure between the model parameters and their constraints. In particular, a
gamma Markov random field is used to model the joint distribution of the
nonlinear terms, which are expected to exhibit significant spatial
correlations. An adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is then proposed
to compute the Bayesian estimates of interest and perform Bayesian inference.
This algorithm is equipped with a stochastic optimisation adaptation mechanism
that automatically adjusts the parameters of the gamma Markov random field by
maximum marginal likelihood estimation. Finally, the proposed methodology is
demonstrated through a series of experiments with comparisons using synthetic
and real data and with competing state-of-the-art approaches.
