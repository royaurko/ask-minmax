In this paper, we present the diversity order analysis of bit-interleaved
coded multiple beamforming (BICMB) combined with the constellation precoding
scheme. Multiple beamforming is realized by singular value decomposition of the
channel matrix which is assumed to be perfectly known to the transmitter as
well as the receiver. Previously, BICMB is known to have a diversity order
bound related with the product of the code rate and the number of parallel
subchannels, losing the full diversity order in some cases. In this paper, we
show that BICMB combined with the constellation precoder and maximum likelihood
detection achieves the full diversity order. We also provide simulation results
that match the analysis.
