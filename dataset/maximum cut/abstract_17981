Several efforts to predict student failure rate (SFR) at school accurately
still remains a core problem area faced by many in the educational sector. The
procedure for forecasting SFR are rigid and most often times require data
scaling or conversion into binary form such as is the case of the logistic
model which may lead to lose of information and effect size attenuation. Also,
the high number of factors, incomplete and unbalanced dataset, and black boxing
issues as in Artificial Neural Networks and Fuzzy logic systems exposes the
need for more efficient tools. Currently the application of Genetic Programming
(GP) holds great promises and has produced tremendous positive results in
different sectors. In this regard, this study developed GPSFARPS, a software
application to provide a robust solution to the prediction of SFR using an
evolutionary algorithm known as multi-gene genetic programming. The approach is
validated by feeding a testing data set to the evolved GP models. Result
obtained from GPSFARPS simulations show its unique ability to evolve a suitable
failure rate expression with a fast convergence at 30 generations from a
maximum specified generation of 500. The multi-gene system was also able to
minimize the evolved model expression and accurately predict student failure
rate using a subset of the original expression
