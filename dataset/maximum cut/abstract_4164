The gluon propagator is calculated in quenched QCD for two different lattice
sizes (16^3x48 and 32^3x64) at beta=6.0. The volume dependence of the
propagator in Landau gauge is studied. The smaller lattice is instrumental in
revealing finite volume and anisotropic lattice artefacts. Methods for
minimising these artefacts are developed and applied to the larger lattice
data. New structure seen in the infrared region survives these conservative
cuts to the lattice data. This structure serves to rule out a number of models
that have appeared in the literature. A fit to a simple analytical form
capturing the momentum dependence of the nonperturbative gluon propagator is
also reported.
