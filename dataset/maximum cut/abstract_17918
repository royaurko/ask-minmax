Magnetite (Fe3O4) is an eligible candidate for magnetic tunnel junctions
(MTJs) since it shows a high spin polarization at the Fermi level as well as a
high Curie temperature of 585{\deg}C. In this study, Fe3O4/MgO/Co-Fe-B MTJs
were manufactured. A sign change in the TMR is observed after annealing the
MTJs at temperatures between 200{\deg}C and 280{\deg}C. Our findings suggest an
Mg interdiffusion from the MgO barrier into the Fe3O4 as the reason for the
change of the TMR. Additionally, different treatments of the magnetite
interface (argon bombardment, annealing at 200{\deg}C in oxygen atmosphere)
during the preparation of the MTJs have been studied regarding their effect on
the performance of the MTJs. A maximum TMR of up to -12% could be observed
using both argon bombardment and annealing in oxygen atmosphere, despite
exposing the magnetite surface to atmospheric conditions before the deposition
of the MgO barrier.
