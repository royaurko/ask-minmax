Eigenmodes of electromagnetic field with perfectly conducting or infinitely
permeable conditions on the boundary of a D-dimensional spherically symmetric
cavity is derived explicitly. It is shown that there are (D-2) polarizations
for TE modes and one polarization for TM modes, giving rise to a total of (D-1)
polarizations. In case of a D-dimensional ball, the eigenfrequencies of
electromagnetic field with perfectly conducting boundary condition coincides
with the eigenfrequencies of gauge one-forms with relative boundary condition;
whereas the eigenfrequencies of electromagnetic field with infinitely permeable
boundary condition coincides with the eigenfrequencies of gauge one-forms with
absolute boundary condition. Casimir energy for a D-dimensional spherical shell
configuration is computed using both cut-off regularization and zeta
regularization. For a double spherical shell configuration, it is shown that
the Casimir energy can be written as a sum of the single spherical shell
contributions and an interacting term, and the latter is free of divergence.
The interacting term always gives rise to an attractive force between the two
spherical shells. Its leading term is the Casimir force acting between two
parallel plates of the same area, as expected by proximity force approximation.
