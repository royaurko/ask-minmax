Dynamic magnetic properties of $\mathrm{Y_{0.7}Ca_{0.3}MnO_{3}}$ are
reported. The system appears to attain local ferromagnetic order at
$T_{\mathrm{SRF}} \approx 70$ K. Below this temperature the low field
magnetization becomes history dependent, i.e. the zero field cooled (ZFC) and
field cooled (FC) magnetization deviate from each other and closely logarithmic
relaxation appears at our experimental time scales (0.3-$10^{4}$ sec). The zero
field cooled magnetization has a maximum at $T_{\mathrm{f}}\approx 30$ K,
whereas the field cooled magnetization continues to increase, although less
sharply, also below this temperature. Surprisingly, the dynamics of the system
shows non-equilibrium spin glass (SG) features not only below the maximum in
the ZFC magnetization, but also in the temperature region between this maximum
and $T_{\mathrm{SRF}}$. The aging and temperature cycling experiments show only
quantitative differences in the dynamic behavior above and below the maximum in
the ZFC-magnetization; similarly, memory effects are observed in both
temperature regions. We attribute the high temperature behavior to the
existence of clusters of short range ferromagnetic order below
$T_{\mathrm{SRF}}$; the configuration evolves into a conventional spin glass
state at temperatures below $T_{\mathrm{f}}$.
