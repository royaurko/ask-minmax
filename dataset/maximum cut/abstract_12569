Chaos, oscillations, instabilities, intermittency represent only some
nonlinear examples apparent in natural world. These phenomena appear in any
field of study, and advances in complex and nonlinear dynamic techniques bring
about opportunities to better understand animal signals.
  In this work we suggest an analysis method based on the characterization of
the vocal fold dynamics by means of the nonlinear time series analysis, and by
the computations of the parameters typical of chaotic oscillations: Attractor
reconstruction, Spectrum of Lyapunov Exponents and Maximum Lyapunov Exponent
was used to reconstruct the dynamic of the vocal folds. Identifying a sort of
of vocal fingerprint can be useful in biodiversity monitoring and understanding
the health status of a given animal.
  This method was applied to the vocalization of the Cervus elaphus corsicanus,
the Sardinian Red Deer.
