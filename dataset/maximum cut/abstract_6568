To investigate the affinity of acetylated wood for organic liquids, Yezo
spruce wood specimens were acetylated with acetic anhydride, and their swelling
in various liquids were compared to those of untreated specimens. The
acetylated wood was rapidly and remarkably swollen in aprotic organic liquids
such as benzene and toluene in which the untreated wood was swollen only
slightly and/or very slowly. On the other hand, the swelling of wood in water,
ethylene glycol and alcohols remained unchanged or decreased by the
acetylation. Consequently the maximum volume of wood swollen in organic liquids
was always larger than that in water. The effect of acetylation on the maximum
swollen volume of wood was greater in liquids having smaller solubility
parameters. The easier penetration of aprotic organic liquids into the
acetylated wood was considered to be due to the scission of hydrogen bonds
among the amorphous wood constituents by the substitution of hydroxyl groups
with hydrophobic acetyl groups.
