This paper presents a brief review of the evidence for dark matter in the
Universe on the scales of galaxies. In the interests of critically and
objectively testing the dark matter paradigm on these scales, this evidence is
weighed against that from the only other game in town, modified Newtonian
dynamics. The verdict is not as clear cut as one might have hoped.
