We have designed and carried out simulation studies of a two layer Shower
Maximum Detector diagonally off-set (SMD-dos) optimized for the separation of
\pi^0 showers from \gamma showers in the 30 to 150 GeV energy range. For 90%
\gamma acceptance the SMD-dos yields \pi^0 rejection efficiency of 92+-4%,
87+-4% and 32+-2%, respectively, for 30, 50 and 150 GeV incident energies. We
find that the SMD-dos is superior to a conventional geometry single-layer or
mutiple-layer shower maximum detector (SMD), of equal granularity, by an
average factor of ~1.5 over the 50 to 150 GeV energy range. We also find that
the SMD-dos gives better \pi^0 rejection, for the same number of channels, than
a SMD. At hadron - hadron colliders the signature of choice for the detection
of the Higgs particle, in the mass range of 120 to 160 GeV, is via the decay
H-->\gamma\gamma. The addition of a SMD-dos to the planned detectors at the LHC
would significantly reduce the background to the \gamma-signal coming from
prolific \pi^0 production.
