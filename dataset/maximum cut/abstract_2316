The {\em cutting and sewing} procedure is used for getting two-loop order
Feynman diagrams of $\Phi^{4}$-theory with an internal SU(N) symmetry group,
starting from tachyon amplitudes of the open bosonic string theory. In a
suitably defined field theory limit, we reproduce the field theory amplitudes
properly normalized and expressed in the Schwinger parametrization.
