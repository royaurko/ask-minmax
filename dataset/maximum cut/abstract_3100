This paper proves that the maximum number of rational points on a smooth,
absolutely irreducible genus 4 curve over the field of 8 elements is 25. The
body of the paper shows that 27 points is not possible using techniques from
algebraic geometry. The appendix shows that 26 points is not possible by
examining the zeta functions.
