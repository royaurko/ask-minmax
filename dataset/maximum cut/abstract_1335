The Kazakov--Migdal (KM) Model is a U(N) Lattice Gauge Theory with a Scalar
Field in the adjoint representation but with no kinetic term for the Gauge
Field. This model is formally soluble in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ though
explicit solutions are available for a very limited number of scalar
potentials. A ``Double Penner'' Model in which the potential has two
logarithmic singularities provides an example of a explicitly soluble model. We
begin by reviewing the formal solution to this Double Penner KM Model. We pay
special attention to the relationship of this model to an ordinary (one) matrix
model whose potential has two logarithmic singularities (the Double Penner
Model). We present a detailed analysis of the large N behavior of this Double
Penner Model. We describe the various one cut and two cut solutions and we
discuss cases in which ``eigenvalue condensation'' occurs at the singular
points of the potential. We then describe the consequences of our study for the
KM Model described above. We present the phase diagram of the model and
describe its critical regions.
