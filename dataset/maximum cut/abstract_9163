The long-range entanglement dynamics of an one-dimensional spin-1/2
anisotropic XXZ model are studied using the method of the adaptive
time-dependent density-matrix renormalization-group. The long-range
entanglement can be generated when a local quench on one of boundary bonds is
performed in the system. The anisotropic interaction has a strong influence
both on the maximal value of long-range entanglement and the time of reaching
the maximum long-range entanglement. The local coupling has a notable impact on
the long-range entanglement, but it can be neglected in the time of reaching
the maximal long-range entanglement.
