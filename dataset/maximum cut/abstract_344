We propose and study a new semi-random semi-adversarial model for Balanced
Cut, a planted model with permutation-invariant random edges (PIE). Our model
is much more general than planted models considered previously. Consider a set
of vertices V partitioned into two clusters $L$ and $R$ of equal size. Let $G$
be an arbitrary graph on $V$ with no edges between $L$ and $R$. Let
$E_{random}$ be a set of edges sampled from an arbitrary permutation-invariant
distribution (a distribution that is invariant under permutation of vertices in
$L$ and in $R$). Then we say that $G + E_{random}$ is a graph with
permutation-invariant random edges.
  We present an approximation algorithm for the Balanced Cut problem that finds
a balanced cut of cost $O(|E_{random}|) + n \text{polylog}(n)$ in this model.
In the regime when $|E_{random}| = \Omega(n \text{polylog}(n))$, this is a
constant factor approximation with respect to the cost of the planted cut.
