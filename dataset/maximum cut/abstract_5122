We investigate the factorization and resummation of t-channel single top
(antitop) quark production in the SM at both the Tevatron and the LHC in SCET.
We find that the resummation effects decrease the NLO cross sections by about
3% at the Tevatron and about 2% at the LHC. And the resummation effects
significantly reduce the factorization scale dependence of the total cross
section. The transfer momentum cut dependence and other matching scale
dependencies are also discussed. We also show that when our numerical results
for s- and t-channel single top production at the Tevatron are combined, it is
closer to the experimental result than the one reported in previous
literatures.
