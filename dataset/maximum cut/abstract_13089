Pulsed electrically-detected magnetic resonance of phosphorous (31P) in bulk
crystalline silicon at very high magnetic fields (B > 8.5 T) and low
temperatures (T = 2.8 K) is presented. We find that the spin-dependent capture
and reemission of highly polarized (>95%) conduction electrons by equally
highly polarized 31P donor electrons introduces less decoherence than other
mechanisms for spin-to-charge conversion. This allows the electrical detection
of spin coherence times in excess of 100 microseconds: 50 times longer than the
previous maximum for electrically-detected spin readout experiments.
