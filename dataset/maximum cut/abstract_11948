A powerful method for mobility spectrum analysis is presented, based on
Bryan's maximum entropy algorithm. The Bayesian analysis central to Bryan's
algorithm ensures that we avoid overfitting of data, resulting in a physically
reasonable solution. The algorithm is fast, and allows the analysis of large
quantities of data, removing the bias of data selection inherent in all
previous techniques. Existing mobility spectrum analysis systems are reviewed,
and the performance of the Bryan's Algorithm Mobility Spectrum (BAMS) approach
is demonstrated using synthetic data sets. Analysis of experimental data is
briefly discussed. We find that BAMS performs well compared to existing
mobility spectrum methods.
