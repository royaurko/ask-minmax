We propose a first implementation of the integrand-reduction method for
two-loop scattering amplitudes. We show that the residues of the amplitudes on
multi-particle cuts are polynomials in the irreducible scalar products
involving the loop momenta, and that the reduction of the amplitudes in terms
of master integrals can be realized through polynomial fitting of the
integrand, without any apriori knowledge of the integral basis. We discuss how
the polynomial shapes of the residues determine the basis of master integrals
appearing in the final result. We present a four-dimensional constructive
algorithm that we apply to planar and non-planar contributions to the 4- and
5-point MHV amplitudes in N=4 SYM. The technique hereby discussed extends the
well-established analogous method holding for one-loop amplitudes, and can be
considered a preliminary study towards the systematic reduction at the
integrand-level of two-loop amplitudes in any gauge theory, suitable for their
automated semianalytic evaluation.
