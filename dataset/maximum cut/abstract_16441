The gauge boson pair production processes Wg, WW, WZ, and Zg were studied
using pbarp collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of ~14 pb-1 at
a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 1.8 TeV. Analysis of Wg prod with
subsequent W boson decay to lv (l=e,mu) is reported, including a fit to the pT
spectrum of the photons which leads to limits on anomalous WWg couplings. A
search for WW prod with subsequent decay to l-lbar-v-vbar (l=e,mu) is presented
leading to an upper limit on the WW prod cross section and limits on anomalous
WWg and WWZ couplings. A search for high pT W bosons in WW and WZ prod is
described, where one W boson decays to an ev and the second W boson or the Z
boson decays to two jets. A maximum likelihood fit to the pT spectrum of W
bosons resulted in limits on anomalous WWg and WWZ couplings. A combined fit to
the three data sets which provided the tightest limits on anomalous WWg and WWZ
couplings is also described. Limits on anomalous ZZg and Zgg couplings are
presented from an analysis of the photon ET spectrum in Zg events in the decay
channels (ee, mu-mu, and v-vbar) of the Z boson.
