Exploring the idea of Broadhurst on the ``sixth root of unity'' we present an
ansatz for construction of a basis of transcendental numbers for the
epsilon-expansion of single mass scale diagrams with two particle massive cut.
As example, several new two- and three-loop master integrals are calculated.
