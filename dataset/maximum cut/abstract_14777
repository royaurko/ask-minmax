We present a fast and simple way to determine the erosion rate and absorption
coefficient of hydrogenated amorphous carbon films exposed to a hydrogen atomic
source based on ex-situ Raman micro-spectroscopy. Results are compared to
ellipsometry measurement. The method is applied to films eroded at different
temperatures. A maximum of the erosion rate is found at ~ 450 {\degree}C in
agreement with previous results. This technique is suitable for future
quantitative studies on the erosion of thin carbonaceous films, especially of
interest for plasma wall interactions occurring in thermonuclear fusion
devices.
