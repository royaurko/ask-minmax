This article introduces definitions for a number of new event shapes and
jet-rates in hadron-hadron dijet production. They are designed so as to be
measurable in practice at the Tevatron and the LHC, and to be global so that
they can be resummed with currently available techniques. We explain how to
vary their sensitivity to beam fragmentation, limiting its impact for purely
perturbative studies, or deliberately enhancing it so as to focus on
non-perturbative effects. Explicit next-to-leading logarithmic resummed results
are presented, as obtained with CAESAR.
