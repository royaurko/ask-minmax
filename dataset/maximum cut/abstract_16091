Models of M-type Miras with masses of 1 $M_\odot$ and 1.2 $M_\odot$, i.e.
with envelope masses of about 0.4 $M_\odot$ and 0.6 $M_\odot$, have been
constructed, and a comparison has been made of their observable properties.
Geometric pulsation of continuum-forming layers is found to be little affected
by the mass difference. The influence of molecular contamination of
near-infrared continuum bandpasses upon interferometrically measured fit
diameters ranges from undetectable to quite significant. Some pulsation cycles
of the lower-mass model Mira show substantially stronger contamination than
that found in any cycle of the higher-mass star. Observations which sample
pulsation phase well and continuously are crucial for avoiding
misinterpretations, because the assignment of absolute pulsation phases is
inherently uncertain by at least 0.1 cycles, diameter changes may be strongly
phase-dependent, and cycle-to-cycle variations may be substantial. In accord
with expectations, we find that cycle-to-cycle variations that show up in light
curves and in near-continuum diameters tend to be larger and more common in the
low-mass models, leading to one possible way to discriminate mass. Two other
methods, based on high-precision measurements of the pulsation amplitude and on
derivation of pre-maximum effective temperatures from diameter measurements,
are also discussed. High-layer features that may be strongly affected by mass
are not well described by present dust-free models.
