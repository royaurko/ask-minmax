A graph $G$ is class II, if its chromatic index is at least $\Delta+1$. Let
$H$ be a maximum $\Delta$-edge-colorable subgraph of $G$. The paper proves best
possible lower bounds for $\frac{|E(H)|}{|E(G)|}$, and structural properties of
maximum $\Delta$-edge-colorable subgraphs. It is shown that every set of
vertex-disjoint cycles of a class II graph with $\Delta\geq3$ can be extended
to a maximum $\Delta$-edge-colorable subgraph. Simple graphs have a maximum
$\Delta$-edge-colorable subgraph such that the complement is a matching.
Furthermore, a maximum $\Delta$-edge-colorable subgraph of a simple graph is
always class I.
