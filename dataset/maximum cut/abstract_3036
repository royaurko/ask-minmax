The Chandrasekhar limit for strange stars described by a linear equation of
state (describing quark matter with density-dependent quark masses) is
evaluated. The maximum mass and radius of the star depend on the fundamental
constants and on the energy density of the quark matter at zero pressure. By
comparing the expression for the mass of the star with the limiting mass
formula for a relativistic degenerate stellar configuration one can obtain an
estimate of the mass of the strange quark.
