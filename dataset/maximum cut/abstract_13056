We have set up and tested a pipeline for processing the data from a spherical
gravitational wave detector with six transducers. The algorithm exploits the
multichannel capability of the system and provides a list of candidate events
with their arrival direction. The analysis starts with the conversion of the
six detector outputs into the scalar and the five quadrupolar modes of the
sphere, which are proportional to the corresponding gravitational wave
spherical components. Event triggers are then generated by an adaptation of the
WaveBurst algorithm. Event validation and direction reconstruction are made by
cross-checking two methods of different inspiration: geometrical (lowest
eigenvalue) and probabilistic (maximum likelihood). The combination of the two
methods is able to keep substantially unaltered the efficiency and can reduce
drastically the detections of fake events (to less than ten per cent). We show
a quantitative test of these ideas by simulating the operation of the resonant
spherical detector miniGRAIL, whose planned sensitivity in its frequency band
(few hundred Hertz's around 3 kHz) is comparable with the present LIGO one.
