Knowledge of the beam profiles is of critical importance for interpreting
data from cosmic microwave background experiments. In this paper, we present
the characterization of the in-flight optical response of the WMAP satellite.
The main beam intensities have been mapped to < -30 dB of their peak values by
observing Jupiter with the satellite in the same observing mode as for CMB
observations. The beam patterns closely follow the pre-launch expectations. The
full width at half maximum is a function of frequency and ranges from 0.82
degrees at 23 GHz to 0.21 degrees at 94 GHz; however, the beams are not
Gaussian. We present: (a) the beam patterns for all ten differential
radiometers and show that the patterns are substantially independent of
polarization in all but the 23 GHz channel; (b) the effective symmetrized beam
patterns that result from WMAP's compound spin observing pattern; (c) the
effective window functions for all radiometers and the formalism for
propagating the window function uncertainty; and (d) the conversion factor from
point source flux to antenna temperature. A summary of the systematic
uncertainties, which currently dominate our knowledge of the beams, is also
presented. The constancy of Jupiter's temperature within a frequency band is an
essential check of the optical system. The tests enable us to report a
calibration of Jupiter to 1-3% accuracy relative to the CMB dipole.
