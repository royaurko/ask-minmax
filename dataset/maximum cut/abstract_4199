We examine prospects for detecting the neutral Higgs bosons of minimal
supersymmetric models (MSSM) when their decays into neutralino pairs are
kinematically allowed. The best signature appears to be
$H_h,H_p\to\tz_2\tz_2\to 4\ell +\eslt$. We argue that Standard Model
contributions to this signature are negligible, and examine regions of MSSM
parameter space where the four lepton mode should be observable at the Large
Hadron Collider. The same signal can also come from continuum neutralino pair
production. We propose a set of cuts to illustrate that the neutralino decay
mode of the Higgs bosons provides a viable signal over a substantial range of
model parameters, and show that it may be separable from continuum neutralino
production if sufficient integrated luminosity can be accumulated.
