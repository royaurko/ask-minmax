It is well-known that the dominant late time behavior of waves propagating on
a Schwarzschild spacetime is a power-law tail; tails for other spacetimes have
also been studied. This paper presents a systematic treatment of the tail
phenomenon for a broad class of models via a Green's function formalism and
establishes the following. (i) The tail is governed by a cut of the frequency
Green's function $\tilde G(\omega)$ along the $-$~Im~$\omega$ axis,
generalizing the Schwarzschild result. (ii) The $\omega$ dependence of the cut
is determined by the asymptotic but not the local structure of space. In
particular it is independent of the presence of a horizon, and has the same
form for the case of a star as well. (iii) Depending on the spatial
asymptotics, the late time decay is not necessarily a power law in time. The
Schwarzschild case with a power-law tail is exceptional among the class of the
potentials having a logarithmic spatial dependence. (iv) Both the amplitude and
the time dependence of the tail for a broad class of models are obtained
analytically. (v) The analytical results are in perfect agreement with
numerical calculations.
