NLO QCD corrections to H, W and Z production via vector boson fusion have
recently been calculated in the form of flexible parton level Monte Carlo
programs. This allows for the calculation of distributions and cross sections
with cuts at NLO accuracy. Some features of the calculation, as well as results
for the LHC, are reviewed.
