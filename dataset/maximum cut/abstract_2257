We discuss uncertainties in the extraction of parton distributions from
global analyses of DIS and related data. We present conservative sets of
partons, at both NLO and NNLO, which are stable to x,Q^2,W^2 cuts on the data.
We give the corresponding values of alpha(M_Z^2) and the cross sections for W
production at the Tevatron.
