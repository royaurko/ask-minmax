We study the observability of a Standard Model-like Higgs boson at an
upgraded Fermilab Tevatron via the mode $h \to W^*W^*$. We concentrate on the
main channel $gg \to h \to W^*W^* \to l \nu l \nu$. We also find the mode
$q\bar q'\to W h \to W W^*W^* \to l^\pm \nu l^\pm \nu jj$ useful. We perform
detector level simulations by making use of a Monte Carlo program SHW.
Optimized searching strategy and kinematical cuts are developed. We find that
with a c.m. energy of 2 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 30 fb$^{-1}$ the
signal should be observable at a 3$\sigma$ level or better for the mass range
of 145 GeV < m_h < 180 GeV. For 95% confidence level exclusion, the mass reach
is 135 GeV < m_h <190 GeV. We also present results of studying these channels
with a model-independent parameterization. Further improvement is possible by
including other channels. We conclude that the upgraded Fermilab Tevatron will
have the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of Higgs boson
physics.
