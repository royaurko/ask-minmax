This paper presents a timing study and broadband spectral analysis of the
broad-line radio galaxy 4C+74.26 based on a 35 ks XMM-Newton observation. As
found in previous datasets, the source exhibits no evidence for rapid
variability, and its 0.2-10 keV lightcurve is well fit by a constant. An
excellent fit to the pn 0.3-12 keV spectrum was found using a continuum that
combines an ionized and a neutral reflector, augmented by both cold and warm
absorption. There is no evidence for a soft excess. The column of cold
absorption was greater than the Galactic value with an intrinsic column of
\~1.9\times 10^{21} cm^{-2}. Evidence for the warm absorber was found from O
VII and O VIII absorption edges with maximum optical depths of \tau_{O VII}=0.3
and \tau_{O VIII}=0.03, respectively. A joint pn-MOS fit increased the O VIII
optical depth to \tau_{O VIII}=0.1. A simple, one-zone warm absorber model
yielded a column of ~9\times 10^{20} cm^{-2} and an ionization parameter of
\~60. Partial covering models provide significantly worse fits than ones
including a relativistically broadened Fe K line, strengthening the case for
the existence of such a line. On the whole, the X-ray spectrum of 4C+74.26
exhibits many features typical of both a radio-loud quasar (excess absorption)
and radio-quiet Seyfert~1 galaxies (\fe emission and warm absorption). We also
show that a spurious absorption line at ~8 keV can be created by the
subtraction of an instrumental Cu K\alpha emission line.
