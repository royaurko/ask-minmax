The maximum efficiency of autonomous engines with finite chemical potential
difference is investigated. We show that without a particular type of
singularity autonomous engines cannot attain the Carnot efficiency. In
addition, we demonstrate that a special autonomous engine with the singularity
attains the Carnot efficiency even if it is macroscopic. Our results clearly
illustrate that the singularity plays a crucial role for the maximum efficiency
of autonomous engines.
