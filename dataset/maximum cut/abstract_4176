The anomalous scaling behavior of the topological susceptibility $\chi_t$ in
two-dimensional $CP^{N-1}$ sigma models for $N\leq 3$ is studied using the
overlap Dirac operator construction of the lattice topological charge density.
The divergence of $\chi_t$ in these models is traced to the presence of small
instantons with a radius of order $a$ (= lattice spacing), which are directly
observed on the lattice. The observation of these small instantons provides
detailed confirmation of L\"{u}scher's argument that such short-distance
excitations, with quantized topological charge, should be the dominant
topological fluctuations in $CP^1$ and $CP^2$, leading to a divergent
topological susceptibility in the continuum limit. For the $\CP$ models with
$N>3$ the topological susceptibility is observed to scale properly with the
mass gap. These larger $N$ models are not dominated by instantons, but rather
by coherent, one-dimensional regions of topological charge which can be
interpreted as domain wall or Wilson line excitations and are analogous to
D-brane or ``Wilson bag'' excitations in QCD. In Lorentz gauge, the small
instantons and Wilson line excitations can be described, respectively, in terms
of poles and cuts of an analytic gauge potential.
