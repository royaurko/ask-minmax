We have prepared a number of GaAs structures delta-doped by Sn using the
well-known molecular beam epitaxy growth technique. The samples obtained for a
wide range of Sn doping densities were characterised by magnetotransport
experiments at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields up to 38 T.
Hall-effect and Shubnikov-de Haas measurements show that the electron densities
reached are higher than for other delta-dopants, like Si and Be. The maximum
carrier density determined by the Hall effect equals 8.4x10^13 cm^-2. For all
samples several Shubnikov-de Haas frequencies were observed, indicating the
population of multiple subbands. The depopulation fields of the subbands were
determined by measuring the magnetoresistance with the magnetic field in the
plane of the delta-layer. The experimental results are in good agreement with
selfconsistent bandstructure calculations. These calculation shows that in the
sample with the highest electron density also the conduction band at the L
point is populated.
