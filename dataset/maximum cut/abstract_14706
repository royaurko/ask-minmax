Blood vessel constriction is simulated with particle-based method using a
molecular dynamics contributoring software known as Molecular Workbench (WM). Blood
flow and vessel wall, the only components considered in constructing a blood
vessel, are all represented in particle form with interaction potentials:
Lennard-Jones potential, push-pull spring potential, and bending spring
potential. Influence of medium or blood plasma is accommodated in plasma
viscosity through Stokes drag force. It has been observed that pressure p is
increased as constriction c is increased. Leakage of blood vessel starts at 80
% constriction, which shows existence of maximum pressure that can be overcome
by vessel wall.
