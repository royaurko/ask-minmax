We present a comprehensive study of graphene grown by chemical vapor
deposition on copper single crystals with exposed (100), (110) and (111) faces.
Direct examination of the as-grown graphene by Raman spectroscopy using a range
of visible excitation energies and microRaman mapping shows distinct strain and
doping levels for individual Cu surfaces. Comparison of results from Raman
mapping with X-ray diffraction techniques and Atomic Force Microscopy shows it
is neither the crystal quality nor the surface topography responsible for the
specific strain and doping values, but it is the Cu lattice orientation itself.
We also report an exceptionally narrow Raman 2D band width caused by the
interaction between graphene and metallic substrate. The appearance of this
extremely narrow 2D band with full-width-at-half maximum (FWHM) as low as 16
cm-1 is correlated with flat and undoped regions on the Cu(100) and (110)
surfaces. The generally compressed (~ 0.3% of strain) and n-doped (Fermi level
shift of ~250 meV) graphene on Cu(111) shows the 2D band FWHM minimum of ~20
cm-1. In contrast, graphene grown on Cu foil under the same conditions reflects
the heterogeneity of the polycrystalline surface and its 2D band is accordingly
broader with FWHM > 24 cm-1.
