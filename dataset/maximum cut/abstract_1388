The gluon-gluon induced terms for Higgs production through weak boson fusion
(WBF) are computed. Formally, these are of NNLO in the strong coupling
constant. This is the lowest order at which non-zero color exchange occurs
between the scattering quarks, leading to a color field and thus additional
hadronic activity between the outgoing jets. Using a minimal set of cuts, the
numerical impact of these terms is at the percent level with respect to the NLO
rate for weak boson fusion. Applying the so-called WBF cuts leads to an even
stronger suppression, so that we do not expect a significant deterioration of
the WFB signal by these color exchange effects.
