We obtain the solutions and explicitly calculate the energy for a class of
two-spin semiclassical string states in the Lunin-Maldacena background. These
configurations are \beta-deformed versions of the folded string solutions in
AdS_{5}\times S^{5} background. They correspond to certain single trace
operators in the \mathcal{N}=1 superconformal \beta deformation of
\mathcal{N}=4 Yang-Mills. We calculate the one loop anomalous dimension for the
dual single trace operator from the associated twisted spin chain with a
general two-cut distribution of Bethe roots. Our results show a striking match
between the two calculations. We demonstrate the natural identification of
parameters on the two sides of the analysis, and explain the significance of
the Virasoro constraint associated with the winding motion of semiclassical
strings from the perspective of the spin chain solution.
