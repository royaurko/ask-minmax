This paper presents the first theoretical results showing that stable
identification of overcomplete $\mu$-coherent dictionaries $\Phi \in
\mathbb{R}^{d\times K}$ is locally possible from training signals with sparsity
levels $S$ up to the order $O(\mu^{-2})$ and signal to noise ratios up to
$O(\sqrt{d})$. In particular the dictionary is recoverable as the local maximum
of a new maximisation criterion that generalises the K-means criterion. For
this maximisation criterion results for asymptotic exact recovery for sparsity
levels up to $O(\mu^{-1})$ and stable recovery for sparsity levels up to
$O(\mu^{-2})$ as well as signal to noise ratios up to $O(\sqrt{d})$ are
provided. These asymptotic results translate to finite sample size recovery
results with high probability as long as the sample size $N$ scales as $O(K^3dS
\tilde \varepsilon^{-2})$, where the recovery precision $\tilde \varepsilon$
can go down to the asymptotically achievable precision. Further, to actually
find the local maxima of the new criterion, a very simple Iterative
Thresholding and K (signed) Means algorithm (ITKM), which has complexity
$O(dKN)$ in each iteration, is presented and its local efficiency is
demonstrated in several experiments.
