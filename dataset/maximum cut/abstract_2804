This paper is concerned with the It\^o stochastic differential equations with
$\mR^{d\times k}$ diffusions in class of H\"older spaces and continuous $\mR^d$
drifts. We derive a uniqueness result of strong solutions for $\cC^\alpha \
(\alpha\geq \frac{1}{2})$ coefficients and this result is new. Our proof is
supported by It\^o's formula and a finer analysis on cut-off and smoothing
techniques.
