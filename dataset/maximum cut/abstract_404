The aim of this paper is to determine the structure of the cut locus for a
class of surfaces of revolution homeomorphic to a cylinder. Let $M$ denote a
cylinder of revolution which admits a reflective symmetry fixing a parallel
called the equator of $M.$ It will be proved that the cut locus of a point $p$
of $M$ is a subset of the union of the meridian and the parallel opposite to
$p$ respectively, if the Gaussian curvature of $M$ is decreasing on each upper
half meridian.
