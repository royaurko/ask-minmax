In statistics, experimental designs are methods for making efficient
experiments. E-optimal designs are the multisets of experimental conditions
which minimize the maximum axis of the confidence ellipsoid of estimators. The
aim of this thesis is to propose a new algorithm for constructing E-optimal
designs approximately for weighted polynomial regression with a nonnegative
weight function.
  First, an algorithm to calculate E-optimal designs for weighted polynomial
regression of particular weight functions is discussed. Next a new algorithm
for constructing E-optimal designs approximately is proposed. Notions of the
Tchebycheff systems and orthogonal polynomials are used in the proposed
algorithm. Finally in this thesis, the results of numerical examples are shown
in order to verify the accuracy of the E-optimal designs computed by the
proposed algorithm.
