Aims. We have analysed VLBA 92cm archive data of 44 extragalactic sources in
order to identify early targets and potential calibrator sources for the LOFAR
radio telescope and the RadioAstron space VLBI mission. Some of these sources
will also be suitable as in-beam calibrators, permitting deep, wide-field
studies of other faint sources in the same field of view.
  Methods. All publicly available VLBA 92cm data observed between 1 January
2003 to December 31 2006 have been analysed via an automatic pipeline,
implemented within AIPS. The vast majority of the data are unpublished.
  Results. The sample consists of 44 sources, 34 of which have been detected on
at least one VLBA baseline. 30 sources have sufficient data to be successfully
imaged. Most of the sources are compact, with a few showing extended
structures. Of the 30 sources imaged, 13 are detected on the longest VLBA
baselines (approx. 9 Mega wavelengths), while all were detected on baselines
greater than 2 Mega wavelengths (the maximum baseline of LOFAR including the
current international baselines).
