We demonstrate the theoretical possibility of obtaining a pure spin current
in a 1D ring with spin-orbit interaction by irradiation with a non-adiabatic,
two-component terahertz laser pulse, whose spatial asymmetry is reflected by an
internal dephasing angle $\phi$. The stationary solutions of the equation of
motion for the density operator are obtained for a spin-orbit coupling linear
in the electron momentum (Rashba) and used to calculate the time-dependent
charge and spin currents. We find that there are critical values of $\phi$ at
which the charge current disappears, while the spin current reaches a maximum
or a minimum value.
