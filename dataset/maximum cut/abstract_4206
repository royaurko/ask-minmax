In view of the forthcoming experiments at high energy $e^+ e^-$ colliders,
LEP2 and beyond, the process $e^+ e^- \to W^+ W^- \to 4f$ has been investigated
for {\it off-shell} $W$'s. After deriving the matrix element for the process
within the helicity amplitude formalism, QED radiative corrections to the
initial state leptons have been included at the leading logarithmic level in
the framework of the electron structure functions. Cross sections and
distributions are computed by means of both a semi-analytical and a Monte Carlo
code, allowing for several cuts of experimental interest. A Monte Carlo event
generator has also been built, for simulation purposes. Some illustrative
numerical results are included and shortly described.
