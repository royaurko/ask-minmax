GRS 1915+105, one of the two known galactic microquasars, shows an extremely
complex variability in the X-ray band, comparable to no other X-ray source in
the sky. Making use of RXTE/PCA data, we have analyzed the X-ray spectral
distribution throughout the variability. We find that all variations can be
attributed to the rapid appearance and disappearance of the inner region of an
optically-thick accretion disk. Since the time scale for each event is related
to the maximum radius of the disappearing region, the difference in time
structure is due to the time distribution of such radii. The observed relation
between the extent of the missing inner region of the disk and the duration of
an event is in remarkable agreement with the expected radius dependence of the
viscous time scale of the radiation-dominated region of an accretion disk.
