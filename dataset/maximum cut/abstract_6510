We calculate the self-energy and self-force for an electrically charged
particle at rest in the background of Gott-Hiscock cosmic string space-time. We
found the general expression for the self-energy which is expressed in terms of
the $S$ matrix of the scattering problem. The self-energy continuously falls
down outward from the string's center with maximum at the origin of the string.
The self-force is repulsive for an arbitrary position of the particle. It tends
to zero in the string's center and also far from the string and it has a
maximum value at the string's surface. The plots of the numerical calculations
of the self-energy and self-force are shown.
