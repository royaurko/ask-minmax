X-ray surveys facilitate investigations of the environment of AGNs. Deep
Chandra observations revealed that the AGNs source surface density rises near
clusters of galaxies. The natural extension of these works is the measurement
of spatial clustering of AGNs around clusters and the investigation of relative
biasing between active galactic nuclei and galaxies near clusters. The major
aims of this work are to obtain a measurement of the correlation length of AGNs
around clusters and a measure of the averaged clustering properties of a
complete sample of AGNs in dense environments. We present the first measurement
of the soft X-ray cluster-AGN cross-correlation function in redshift space
using the data of the ROSAT-NEP survey. The survey covers 9x9 deg^2 around the
North Ecliptic Pole where 442 X-ray sources were detected and almost completely
spectroscopically identified. We detected a > 3 sigma significant clustering
signal on scales s<50 h_70^-1 Mpc. We performed a classical maximum-likelihood
power-law fit to the data and obtained a correlation length s_0=8.7^+1.2_-0.3
h70^-1 Mpc and a slope gamma=1.7^+0.2_-0.7 (1 sigma errors). This is a strong
evidence that AGNs are good tracers of the large scale structure of the
Universe. Our data were compared to the results obtained by cross-correlating
X-ray clusters and galaxies. We observe, with a large uncertainty, a similar
behaviour of the AGNs clustering around clusters similar to the clustering of
galaxies around clusters.
