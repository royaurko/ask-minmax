Quantum molecular dynamic (QMD) simulations are introduced to study the
thermophysical properties of liquid deuterium under shock compression. The
principal Hugoniot is determined from the equation of states, where
contributions from molecular dissociation and atomic ionization are also added
onto the QMD data. At pressures below 100 GPa, our results show that the local
maximum compression ratio of 4.5 can be achieved at 40 GPa, which is in good
agreement with magnetically driven flyer and convergent-explosive experiments;
At the pressure between 100 and 300 GPa, the compression ratio reaches a
maximum of 4.95, which agrees well with recent high power laser-driven
experiments. In addition, the nonmetal-metal transition and optical properties
are also discussed.
