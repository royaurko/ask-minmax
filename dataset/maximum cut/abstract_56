A recurrence relation between equal mass two-loop sunrise diagrams differing
in dimensionality by 2 is derived and it's solution in terms of Gauss' 2F1 and
Appell's F_2 hypergeometric functions is presented. For arbitrary space-time
dimension d the imaginary part of the diagram on the cut is found to be the 2F1
hypergeometric function with argument proportional to the maximum of the Kibble
cubic form. The analytic expression for the threshold value of the diagram in
terms of the hypergeometric function 3F2 of argument -1/3 is given.
