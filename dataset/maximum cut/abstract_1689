Discrete maximum principles in the approximation of partial differential
equations are crucial for the preservation of qualitative properties of
physical models. In this work we enforce the discrete maximum principle by
performing a simple cutoff. We show that for many problems this a posteriori
procedure even improves the approximation in the natural energy norm. The
results apply to many different kinds of approximations including conforming
higher order and $hp$-finite elements. Moreover in the case of finite element
approximations there is no geometrical restriction on the partition of the
domain.
