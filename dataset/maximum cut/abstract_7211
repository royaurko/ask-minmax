We study one-sided nonlocal equations of the form
$$\int_{x_0}^\infty\frac{u(x)-u(x_0)}{(x-x_0)^{1+\alpha}}\,dx=f(x_0),$$ on the
real line. Notice that to compute this nonlocal operator of order $0<\alpha<1$
at a point $x_0$ we need to know the values of $u(x)$ to the right of $x_0$,
that is, for $x\geq x_0$. We show that the operator above corresponds to a
fractional power of a one-sided first order derivative. Maximum principles and
a characterization with an extension problem in the spirit of
Caffarelli--Silvestre and Stinga--Torrea are proved. It is also shown that
these fractional equations can be solved in the general setting of weighted
one-sided spaces. In this regard we present suitable inversion results. Along
the way we are able to unify and clarify several notions of fractional
derivatives found in the literature.
