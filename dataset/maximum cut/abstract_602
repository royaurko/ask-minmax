We consider dijet production in the region where symmetric cuts on the
transverse energy, $E_t$, are applied to the jets. In this region
next-to--leading order calculations are unreliable and an all-order resummation
of soft gluon effects is needed, which we carry out. Although, for illustrative
purposes, we choose dijets produced in deep inelastic scattering, our general
ideas apply additionally to dijets produced in photoproduction or $\gamma
\gamma$ processes and should be relevant also to the study of prompt di-photon
$E_t$ spectra in association with a recoiling jet, in hadron-hadron processes
