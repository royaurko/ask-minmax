The $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ lifetime is measured using 9.0 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$
annihilation data collected on or just below the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with
the CLEO II.V detector at CESR. Using an unbinned maximum likelihood fit, the
$\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ lifetime is measured to be $(179.6 \pm 6.9(stat.) \pm
4.4(syst.))$ fs. The precision of this colliding beam measurement is comparable
to other measurements, which are based on fixed target experiments with
different systematic errors.
