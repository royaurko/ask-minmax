We report the COMPTEL detection of pulsed $\gamma$-emission from PSR B1509-58
up to at least 10 MeV using data collected over more than 6 years. The 0.75-10
MeV lightcurve is broad and reaches its maximum near radio-phase 0.38, slightly
beyond the maximum found at hard X-rays/ soft $\gamma$-rays. In the 10-30 MeV
energy range a strong source is present in the skymap positionally consistent
with the pulsar, but we do not detect significant pulsed emission. However, the
lightcurve is consistent with the pulse shape changing from a single broad
pulse into a double-peak morphology. Our results significantly constrain pulsar
modelling.
