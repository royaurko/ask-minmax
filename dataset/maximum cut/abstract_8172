We present results from an H-alpha monitoring campaign of the Be X-ray binary
systems HDE 245770 = A 0535+26 and X Per. We use the H-alpha equivalent widths
together with adopted values of the Be star effective temperature, disk
inclination, and disk outer boundary to determine the half-maximum emission
radius of the disk as a function of time. The observations of HDE 245770
document the rapid spectral variability that apparently accompanied the
regeneration of a new circumstellar disk. This disk grew rapidly during the
years 1998 - 2000, but then slowed in growth in subsequent years. The outer
disk radius is probably truncated by resonances between the disk gas and
neutron star orbital periods. Two recent X-ray outbursts appear to coincide
with the largest disk half-maximum emission radius attained over the last
decade. Our observations of X Per indicate that its circumstellar disk has
recently grown to near record proportions, and concurrently the system has
dramatically increased in X-ray flux, presumably the result of enhanced mass
accretion from the disk. We find that the H-alpha half-maximum emission radius
of the disk surrounding X Per reached a size about six times larger than the
stellar radius, a value, however, that is well below the minimum separation
between the Be star and neutron star. We suggest that spiral arms excited by
tidal interaction at periastron may help lift disk gas out to radii where
accretion by the neutron star companion becomes more effective.
