We propose that in time dependent backgrounds the holographic principle
should be replaced by the generalized second law of thermodynamics. For
isotropic open and flat universes with a fixed equation of state, the
generalized second law agrees with the cosmological holographic principle
proposed by Fischler and Susskind. However, in more complicated spacetimes the
two proposals disagree. A modified form of the holographic bound that applies
to a post-inflationary universe follows from the generalized second law.
However, in a spatially closed universe, or inside a black hole event horizon,
there is no simple relationship that connects the area of a region to the
maximum entropy it can contain.
