The focusing of high energy charged particles by a bent crystal is
considered. The limits and constraints of focusing imposed by dynamics of
particles are pointed out. The crystalline geometry provided the maximum
magnification and minimum focusing size is proposed. The focusing parameters
are compared with current experimental results.
