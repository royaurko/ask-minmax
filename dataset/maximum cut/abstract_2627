The properties of multi-jet events impact many LHC analysis. The exclusive
number of jets at hadron colliders can be described in terms of two simple
patterns: staircase scaling and Poisson scaling. In photon plus jets production
we can interpolate between the two patterns using simple kinematic cuts. The
associated theoretical errors are well under control. Understanding such
exclusive jet multiplicities significantly impacts Higgs searches and searches
for supersymmetry at the LHC.
