It is shown, that highly accurate estimation of muon shower content can be
performed on the basis of knowledge of only vertical depth of shower maximum
and total signal in ground detector. The estimate is almost independent on
primary energy and particle type and on zenith angle. The study is performed
for 21500 showers, generated with CORSIKA~6.204 from spectrum $E^{-1}$ in the
energy range $\log10(E)$ [eV]=18.5--20 and uniformly in $\cos^2{\theta}$ in
zenith angle interval $\theta=0^\circ-65^\circ$ for QGSJET II/Fluka interaction
models.
