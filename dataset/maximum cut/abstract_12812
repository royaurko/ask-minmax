This article presents the $A$-dependence of the differential cross section
for the coherent electroproduction of vector mesons on nuclei in forward
direction, at fixed values of longitudinal momentum transfer $q_{L}$. It is
shown that such cross section has complicated behavior over the atomic mass
number $A$ with local minimums and maximums. It is also shown that a ratio of
the real to the imaginary parts of the forward coherent amplitude on nuclei
$\alpha_{A} = \Re e{f_{A}} / \Im m{f_{A}}$ has breaking points at some values
of $A$. Comparison of the behaviors of the normalized cross section
$\Big(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\Big)_{A}\Big/\Big(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\Big)_{N}$
and $\alpha_{A}$ over $A$ shows that the location of minimums of the cross
section are very close to the breaking points of $\alpha_{A}$.
