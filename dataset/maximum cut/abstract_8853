An alternative being considered for the Next Linear Collider (NLC) is not to
tunnel in a straight line but to bend the Main Linac into an arc so as to
follow an equipotential. We begin here an examination of the effects that this
would have on vertical dispersion, with its attendant consequences on
synchrotron radiation and emittance growth by looking at two scenarios: a
gentle continuous bending of the beam to follow an equipotential surface, and
an introduction of sharp bends at a few sites in the linac so as to reduce the
maximum sagitta produced.
