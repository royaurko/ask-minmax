Using the gravity side of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the
analytic properties of thermal retarded Green's functions for scalars,
conserved currents, the stress tensor, and massless fermions. We provide some
results concerning their large and small frequency behavior and their pole
structure. From these results, it is straightforward to prove the validity of
various sum rules on the field theory side of the duality. We introduce a novel
contraction mapping we use to study the large frequency behavior of the Green's
functions.
