We determine the chiral phase transition line in (2+1)-flavor QCD for small
values of the light quark chemical potential. We show that for small values of
the chemical potential the curvature of the phase transition line can be
deduced from an analysis of scaling properties of the chiral condensate and its
susceptibilities. To do so we extend earlier studies of the magnetic equation
of state in (2+1)-flavor QCD to finer lattice spacings, aT=1/8. We use these
universal scaling properties of the chiral order parameter to extract the
curvature of the transition line at two values of the cut-off, aT=1/4 and 1/8.
We find that cut-off effects are small for the curvature parameter and
determine the transition line in the chiral limit to leading order in the light
quark chemical potential. We obtain Tc(\mu_q)/Tc(0) = 1 - 0.059(2)(4)
(\mu_q/T)^2 +O(\mu_q^4).
