We suggest the possibility of creation in the early Universe of stable
domains of radius a few kilometers wide, formed by coherently excited states of
$\pi$-mesons. Such domains appear dark to an external observer, since the decay
rate of the said coherent pionic states into photons is vanishingly small. The
related thermal insulation of the domains from the outer world could have
allowed them to survive till present days. The estimated maximum radius and the
period of rotation of such objects turn out to be compatible with those of
certain pulsars.
