The Gemini Remote Access to CFHT ESPaDONS Spectrograph has achieved first
light of its experimental phase in May 2014. It successfully collected light
from the Gemini North telescope and sent it through two 270 m optical fibers to
the the ESPaDOnS spectrograph at CFHT to deliver high-resolution spectroscopy
across the optical region. The fibers gave an average focal ratio degradation
of 14% on sky, and a maximum transmittance of 85% at 800nm. GRACES achieved
delivering spectra with a resolution power of R = 40,000 and R = 66,000 between
400 and 1,000 nm. It has a ~8% throughput and is sensitive to target fainter
than 21st mag in 1 hour. The average acquisition time of a target is around 10
min. This project is a great example of a productive collaboration between two
observatories on Maunakea that was successful due to the reciprocal involvement
of the Gemini, CFHT, and NRC Herzberg teams, and all the staff involved closely
or indirectly.
