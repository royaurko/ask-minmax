In this paper, we propose a new detection technique for multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. The proposed scheme combines
a lattice reduction (LR) transformation, which makes the channel matrix nearly
orthogonal, and then employs a multi-branch (MB) technique with successive
interference cancellation (SIC). A single LR transformation is required for the
receive filters of all branches in the scheme, which proposes a different
ordering for each branch and generates a list of detection candidates. The best
vector of estimated symbols is chosen according to the maximum likelihood (ML)
selection criterion. Simulation results show that the proposed detection
structure has a near-optimal performance while the computational complexity is
much lower than that of the ML detector.
