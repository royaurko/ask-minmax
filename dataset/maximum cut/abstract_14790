Stochastic volatility (SV) models mimic many of the stylized facts attributed
to time series of asset returns, while maintaining conceptual simplicity. The
commonly made assumption of conditionally normally distributed or
Student-t-distributed returns, given the volatility, has however been
questioned. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel maximum penalized
likelihood approach for estimating the conditional distribution in an SV model
in a nonparametric way, thus avoiding any potentially critical assumptions on
the shape. The considered framework exploits the strengths both of the powerful
hidden Markov model machinery and of penalized B-splines, and constitutes a
powerful and flexible alternative to recently developed Bayesian approaches to
semiparametric SV modelling. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach in
a simulation study before outlining its potential in applications to three
series of returns on stocks and one series of stock index returns.
