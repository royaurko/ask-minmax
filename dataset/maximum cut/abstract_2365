A theorem of Kontsevich relates the homology of certain infinite dimensional
Lie algebras to graph homology. We formulate this theorem using the language of
reversible operads and mated species. All ideas are explained using a pictorial
calculus of cuttings and matings. The Lie algebras are constructed as
Hamiltonian functions on a symplectic operad manifold. And graph complexes are
defined for any mated species. The general formulation gives us many examples
including a graph homology for groups. We also speculate on the role of
deformation theory for operads in this setting.
