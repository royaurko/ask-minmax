The Tevatron experiments have recently excluded a Standard Model Higgs boson
in the mass range 160 - 170 GeV at the 95% confidence level. This result is
based on sophisticated analyses designed to maximize the ratio of signal and
background cross-sections. In this paper we study the production of a Higgs
boson of mass 160 GeV in the gg -> H -> WW -> l nu l nu channel. We choose a
set of cuts like those adopted in the experimental analysis and compare
kinematical distributions of the final state leptons computed in NNLO QCD to
lower-order calculations and to those obtained with the event generators
PYTHIA, HERWIG and MC@NLO. We also show that the distribution of the output
from an Artificial Neural Network obtained with the different tools does not
show significant differences. However, the final acceptance computed with
PYTHIA is smaller than those obtained at NNLO and with HERWIG and MC@NLO. We
also investigate the impact of the underlying event and hadronization on our
results.
