We present optical observations of a SN 2002cx-like supernova SN 2013en in
UGC 11369, spanning from a phase near maximum light (t= +1 d) to t= +60 d with
respect to the R-band maximum. Adopting a distance modulus of mu=34.11 +/- 0.15
mag and a total extinction (host galaxy+Milky Way) of $A_V \sim1.5$ mag, we
found that SN 2013en peaked at $M(R)\sim -18.6$ mag, which is underluminous
compared to the normal SNe Ia. The near maximum spectra show lines of Si II, Fe
II, Fe III, Cr II, Ca II and other intermediate-mass and iron group elements
which all have lower expansion velocities (i.e., ~ 6000 km/s). The photometric
and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2013en is remarkably similar to those of SN
2002cx and SN 2005hk, suggesting that they are likely to be generated from a
similar progenitor scenario or explosion mechanism.
