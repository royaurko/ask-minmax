We present the discovery of debris systems around three solar mass stars
based upon observations performed with the Spitzer Space Telescope as part of a
Legacy Science Program, ``the Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems''
(FEPS). We also confirm the presence of debris around two other stars. All the
stars exhibit infrared emission in excess of the expected photospheres in the
70 micron band, but are consistent with photospheric emission at <= 33 micron.
This restricts the maximum temperature of debris in equilibrium with the
stellar radiation to T < 70 K. We find that these sources are relatively old in
the FEPS sample, in the age range 0.7 - 3 Gyr. Based on models of the spectral
energy distributions, we suggest that these debris systems represent materials
generated by collisions of planetesimal belts. We speculate on the nature of
these systems through comparisons to our own Kuiper Belt, and on the likely
planet(s) responsible for stirring the system and ultimately releasing dust
through collisions. We further report observations of a nearby star HD 13974 (d
=11 pc) that is indistinguishable from a bare photosphere at both 24 micron and
70 micron. The observations place strong upper limits on the presence of any
cold dust in this nearby system (L_IR/L_* < 10^{-5.2}).
