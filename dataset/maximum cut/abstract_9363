An R package for specifying and estimating linear latent variable models is
presented. The philosophy of the implementation is to separate the model
specification from the actual data, which leads to a dynamic and easy way of
modeling complex hierarchical structures. Several advanced features are
implemented including robust standard errors for clustered correlated data,
multigroup analyses, non-linear parameter constraints, inference with
incomplete data, maximum likelihood estimation with censored and binary
observations, and instrumental variable estimators. In addition an extensive
simulation interface covering a broad range of non-linear generalized
structural equation models is described. The model and software are
demonstrated in data of measurements of the serotonin transporter in the human
brain.
