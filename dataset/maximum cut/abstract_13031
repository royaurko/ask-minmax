Diamagnetic susceptibility measurements under high hydrostatic pressure (up
to 1.03 GPa) were carried out on the newly discovered Fe-based superconductor
LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs(x=0.11). The transition temperature T_c, defined as the
point at the maximum slope of superconducting transition, was enhanced almost
linearly by hydrostatic pressure, yielding a dT_c/dP of about 1.2 K/GPa.
Differential diamagnetic susceptibility curves indicate that the underlying
superconducting state is complicated. It is suggested that pressure plays an
important role on pushing low T_c superconducting phase toward the main
(optimal) superconducting phase.
