In the presence of a light singlino-like LSP in the NMSSM, the missing
transverse energy - MET - signature of squark/gluino production can be
considerably reduced. Instead, a pair of Higgs bosons is produced in each
event. We propose benchmark points for such scenarios, which differ in the
squark and gluino masses, and in their decay cascades. Events for these points
are simulated for the run II of the LHC at 13 TeV centre of mass energy. After
cuts on the transverse momenta of at least four jets, and requiring two
tau-leptons from one Higgs decay, we find that the invariant mass of two b-jets
from the other Higgs decay shows clear peaks above the background. Despite the
reduced MET, this search strategy allows to see signals for sufficiently large
integrated luminosities, depending on the squark/gluino masses.
