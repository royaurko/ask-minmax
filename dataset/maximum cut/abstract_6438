Epitaxial thin films of La0.7Ba0.3MnO3 manganite, deposited using Chemical
Solution Deposition technique, were irradiated by 200 MeV Ag+15 ions with a
maximum ion dose up to 1x10^12 ions/cm2. Temperature- and magnetic
field-dependent resistivity measurements on all the films (before and after
irradiation) reveal a sustained decrease in resistivity with increasing ion
dose. A maximum dose of 1x10^12 ions/cm2 suppresses resistivity by factors of 3
and 10, at 330 K [insulator-metal (I-M) transition] and at 10 K, respectively.
On the other hand, with increasing ion dose, the magnetoresistance (MR)
enhances in the vicinity of I-M transition but decreases at low temperatures.
These results, corroborated by surface morphology of films, suggest that the
origin of such properties lies in the irradiation induced improved
crystallinity and epitaxial orientation, enhanced connectivity between grains,
and conglomeration of grains which result in better conductivity at grain
boundaries.
