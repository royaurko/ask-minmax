This paper explores the application of a new algebraic method of color
exchanges to the edge coloring of simple graphs. Vizing's theorem states that
the edge coloring of a simple graph $G$ requires either $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$
colors, where $\Delta$ is the maximum vertex degree of $G$. Holyer proved that
it is {\bf NP}-complete to decide whether $G$ is $\Delta$-edge-colorable even
for cubic graphs. By introducing the concept of complex colors, we show that
the color-exchange operation follows the same multiplication rules as
quaternion. An initially $\Delta$-edge-colored graph $G$ allows
variable-colored edges, which can be eliminated by color exchanges in a manner
similar to variable eliminations in solving systems of linear equations. The
problem is solved if all variables are eliminated and a properly
$\Delta$-edge-colored graph is reached. For a randomly generated graph $G$, we
prove that our algorithm returns a proper $\Delta$-edge-coloring with a
probability of at least 1/2 in $O(\Delta|V||E|^5)$ time if $G$ is
$\Delta$-edge-colorable. Otherwise, the algorithm halts in polynomial time and
signals the impossibility of a solution, meaning that the chromatic index of
$G$ probably equals $\Delta+1$. Animations of the edge-coloring algorithms
proposed in this paper are posted at YouTube
