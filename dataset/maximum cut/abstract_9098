We report on studies of the composition of ultra high energy cosmic rays with
the Pierre Auger Observatory. The detection of longitudinal air shower profiles
with the fluorescence detector is described and the measurement of the average
shower maximum as a function of energy is presented. Furthermore, mass
sensitive parameters that can be obtained from the observatory's surface
detector data are discussed.
