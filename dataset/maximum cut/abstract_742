We reanalyze the Fermi spectra of the Geminga and Vela pulsars. We find that
the spectrum of Geminga above the break is exceptionally well approximated by a
simple power law without the exponential cut-off, making Geminga's spectrum
similar to that of Crab. Vela's broadband gamma-ray spectrum is equally well
fit with both the exponential cut-off and the double power law shapes.
  In the broadband double power-law fits, for a typical Fermi spectrum of a
bright \gamma-ray pulsar, most of the errors accumulate due to the arbitrary
parametrization of the spectral roll-off. In addition, a power law with an
exponential cut-off gives an acceptable fit for the underlying double power-law
spectrum for a very broad range of parameters, making such fitting procedures
insensitive to the underlying Fermi photon spectrum.
  Our results have important implications for the mechanism of pulsar high
energy emission. A number of observed properties of \gamma-ray pulsars, i.e.,
the broken power law spectra without exponential cut-offs and stretching in
case of Crab beyond the maximal curvature limit, spectral breaks close to or
exceeding the maximal breaks due to curvature emission, a Crab patterns of
relative intensities of the leading and trailing pulses repeated in the X-ray
and \gamma-ray regions, all point to the inverse Compton origin of the high
energy emission from majority of pulsars.
