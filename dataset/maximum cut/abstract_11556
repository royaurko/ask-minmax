We present X-ray and spectroscopic confirmation of a cluster assembling from
multiple, distinct galaxy groups at z=0.371. Initially detected in the Las
Campanas Distant Cluster Survey, the structure contains at least four X-ray
detected groups that lie within a maximum projected separation of 4 Mpc and
within dv=550 km/s of one another. Using Chandra imaging and wide-field optical
spectroscopy, we show that the individual groups lie on the local sigma-T
relation, and derive a total mass of M>=5e14 solar masses for the entire
structure. We demonstrate that the groups are gravitationally bound to one
another and will merge into a single cluster with >=1/3 the mass of Coma. We
also find that although the cluster is in the process of forming, the
individual groups already have a higher fraction of passive members than the
field. This result indicates that galaxy evolution on group scales is key to
developing the early-type galaxies that dominate the cluster population by z~0.
