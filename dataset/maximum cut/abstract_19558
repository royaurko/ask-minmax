We present the results of sixteen Swift-triggered GRB follow-up observations
taken with the VERITAS telescope array from January, 2007 to June, 2009. The
median energy threshold and response time of these observations was 260 GeV and
320 s, respectively. Observations had an average duration of 90 minutes. Each
burst is analyzed independently in two modes: over the whole duration of the
observations and again over a shorter time scale determined by the maximum
VERITAS sensitivity to a burst with a t^-1.5 time profile. This temporal model
is characteristic of GRB afterglows with high-energy, long-lived emission that
have been detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi
satellite. No significant VHE gamma-ray emission was detected and upper limits
above the VERITAS threshold energy are calculated. The VERITAS upper limits are
corrected for gamma-ray extinction by the extragalactic background light (EBL)
and interpreted in the context of the keV emission detected by Swift. For some
bursts the VHE emission must have less power than the keV emission, placing
constraints on inverse Compton models of VHE emission.
