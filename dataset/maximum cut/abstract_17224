During July 2009 we observed the first confirmed superoutburst of the
eclipsing dwarf nova SDSS J150240.98+333423.9 using CCD photometry. The
outburst amplitude was at least 3.9 magnitudes and it lasted at least 16 days.
Superhumps having up to 0.35 peak-to-peak amplitude were present during the
outburst, thereby establishing it to be a member of the SU UMa family. The mean
superhump period during the first 4 days of the outburst was Psh = 0.06028(19)
d, although it increased during the outburst with dPsh/dt = + 2.8(1.0) x 10-4.
The orbital period was measured as Porb = 0.05890946(5) d from times of
eclipses measured during outburst and quiescence. Based on the mean superhump
period, the superhump period excess was 0.023(3). The FWHM eclipse duration
declined from a maximum of 10.5 min at the peak of the outburst to 3.5 min
later in the outburst. The eclipse depth increased from ~0.9 mag to 2.1 mag
over the same period. Eclipses in quiescence were 2.7 min in duration and 2.8
mag deep.
