We present a complete polymorphic effect inference algorithm for an ML-style
language with handlers of not only exceptions, but of any other algebraic
effect such as input & output, mutable references and many others. Our main aim
is to offer the programmer a useful insight into the effectful behaviour of
programs. Handlers help here by cutting down possible effects and the resulting
lengthy output that often plagues precise effect systems. Additionally, we
present a set of methods that further simplify the displayed types, some even
by deliberately hiding inferred information from the programmer.
