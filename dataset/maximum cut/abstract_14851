A nanofiber-based optical tweezer is demonstrated. Trapping is achieved by
combining attractive near-field optical gradient forces with repulsive
electrostatic forces. Silica-coated Fe$_2$O$_3$ nanospheres of 300 diameter are
trapped as close as 50 nm away from the surface with 810 $\mu$W of optical
power, with a maximum trap stiffness of 2.7 pN $\mu$m$^{-1}$. Electrostatic
trapping forces up to 0.5 pN are achieved, a factor of 50 larger than those
achievable for the same optical power in conventional optical tweezers.
Efficient collection of the optical field directly into the nanofiber enables
ultra-sensitive tracking of nanoparticle motion and extraction of its
characteristic Brownian motion spectrum, with a minimum position sensitivity of
3.4 $\AA / \sqrt{\text{Hz}}$.
