Around 1930, both Gregory Breit and Erwin Schroedinger showed that the
eigenvalues of the velocity of a particle described by wavepacket solutions to
the Dirac equation are simply $\pm$c, the speed of light. This led Schroedinger
to coin the term Zitterbewegung, which is German for "trembling motion", where
all particles of matter (fermions) zig-zag back-and-forth at only the speed of
light. The result is that any finite speed less than $c$, including the state
of rest, only makes sense as a long-term average that can be thought of as a
drift velocity. In this paper, we seriously consider this idea that the
observed velocities of particles are time-averages of motion at the speed of
light and demonstrate how the relativistic velocity addition rule in one
spatial dimension is readily derived by considering the probabilities that a
particle is observed to move either to the left or to the right at the speed of
light.
