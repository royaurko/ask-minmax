Bayesian statistics in the frame of the maximum entropy concept has widely been
used for inferential problems, particularly, to infer dynamic properties of
strongly correlated fermion systems from Quantum-Monte-Carlo (QMC) imaginary
time data. In current applications, however, a consistent treatment of the
error-covariance of the QMC data is missing. Here we present a closed Bayesian
approach to account consistently for the QMC-data.
