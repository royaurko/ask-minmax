In this paper, we analyze the cross-correlation properties for Chu sequences,
which provide information on the distribution of the maximum magnitudes of the
cross-correlation function. Furthermore, we can obtain the number of available
sequences for a given maximum magnitude of the cross-correlation function and
the sequence length.
