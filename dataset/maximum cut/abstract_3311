It was conjectured by Mkrtchyan, Petrosyan, and Vardanyan [4,5] that: Every
graph $G$ with $\Delta(G)-\delta(G) \le 1$ has a maximum matching $M$ such that
any two $M$-unsaturated vertices do not share a neighbor. Early results
obtained in [4,6,7] leave the conjecture unknown only for $k$-regular graphs
with $4\le k\le 6$. All counterexamples for $k$-regular graphs $(k\ge7)$ given
in [6] have multiple edges. In this paper, we consider the conjecture for both
simple $k$-regular graphs and $k$-regular graphs with multiple edges. We show
that the conjecture holds for all simple $k$-regular graphs, and for
$k$-regular graphs ($k=4$ or 5) with multiple edges.
