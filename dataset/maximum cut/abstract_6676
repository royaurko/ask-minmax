This paper considers the problem of multi-sample nonparametric comparison of
counting processes with panel count data, which arise naturally when recurrent
events are considered. Such data frequently occur in medical follow-up studies
and reliability experiments, for example. For the problem considered, we
construct two new classes of nonparametric test statistics based on the
accumulated weighted differences between the rates of increase of the estimated
mean functions of the counting processes over observation times, wherein the
nonparametric maximum likelihood approach is used to estimate the mean function
instead of the nonparametric maximum pseudo-likelihood. The asymptotic
distributions of the proposed statistics are derived and their finite-sample
properties are examined through Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation results
show that the proposed methods work quite well and are more powerful than the
existing test procedures. Two real data sets are analyzed and presented as
illustrative examples.
