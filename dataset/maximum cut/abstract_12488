We introduce the term "protonormal" to refer to a subgroup H of a group G
such that for every x in G the subgroups x^{-1}Hx and H commute as sets. If
moreover (G,H) is a Hecke pair we show that the Hecke algebra H(G,H) is
generated by the range of a canonical partial representation of G vanishing on
H. As a consequence we show that there exists a maximum C*-norm on H(G,H),
generalizing previous results by Brenken, Hall, Laca, Larsen, Kaliszewski,
Landstad and Quigg. When there exists a normal subgroup N of G, containing H as
a normal subgroup, we prove a new formula for the product of the generators and
give a very clean description of H(G,H) in terms of generators and relations.
We also give a description of H(G,H) as a crossed product relative to a twisted
partial action of the group G/N on the group algebra of N/H. Based on our
presentation of H(G,H) in terms of generators and relations we propose a
generalized construction for Hecke algebras in case (G,H) does not satisfy the
Hecke condition.
