An analysis using modern atomic data of fluxes culled from the literature for
O VIII and Ne IX lines observed in solar active regions by the P78 and Solar
Maximum Mission satellites confirms that the coronal Ne/O abundance ratio
varies by a factor of two or more, and finds an increase in Ne/O with
increasing active region plasma temperature. The latter is reminiscent of
evidence for increasing Ne/O with stellar activity in low-activity coronae that
reaches a "neon saturation" in moderately active stars at approximately twice
the historically accepted solar value of about 0.15 by number. We argue that
neon saturation represents the underlying stellar photospheric compositions,
and that low activity coronae, including that of the Sun, are generally
depleted in neon. The implication would be that the solar Ne/O abundance ratio
should be revised upward by a factor of about two to n(Ne)/n(O)~0.3. Diverse
observations of neon in the local cosmos provide some support for such a
revision. Neon would still be of some relevance for reconciling helioseismology
with solar models computed using recently advocated chemical mixtures with
lower metal content.
