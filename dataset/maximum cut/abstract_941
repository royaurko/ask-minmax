In this paper we prove that the maximum principle in forcing is equivalent to
the axiom of choice. The maximum principle is the property of forcing: p ||-
exists x theta(x) iff for some name tau p ||- theta(tau). We also look at three
similar partial orders in the Basic Cohen model for the failure of the axiom of
choice. We show that despite their apparent similarity the maximum principle
holds for only one of the three.
