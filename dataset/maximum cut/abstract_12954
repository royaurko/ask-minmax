A simulation model of a population having internal (genetic) structure is
presented. The population is subject to selection pressure coming from the
environment which is the same in the whole system but changes in time.
Reproduction has a sexual character with recombination and mutation. Two cases
are considered - oscillatory changes of the environment and abrupt ones
(catastrophes). We show how the survival chance of a population depends on
maximum allowed size of the population, the length of the genotypes
characterising individuals, selection pressure and the characteristics of the
climate changes, either their period of oscillations or the scale of the abrupt
shift.
