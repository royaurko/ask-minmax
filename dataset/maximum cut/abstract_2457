A material comprised of an array of subwavelength coaxial waveguides
decomposes incident electromagnetic waves into spatially discrete wave
components, propagates these components without frequency cut-off, and
reassembles them on the far side of the material. The propagation of these wave
components is fully controlled by the physical properties of the waveguides and
their geometrical distribution in the array. This allows for an exceptional
degree of control over the electromagnetic response of this effective medium,
with numerous potential applications. With the development of nanoscale
subwavelength coaxial waveguides, these applications (including metamaterial
functionality) can be enabled in the visible frequency range.
