We argue the existence of solutions of the Euclidean Einstein equations that
correspond to a vortex sitting at the horizon of a black hole. We find the
asymptotic behaviours, at the horizon and at infinity, of vortex solutions for
the gauge and scalar fields in an abelian Higgs model on a Euclidean
Schwarzschild background and interpolate between them by integrating the
equations numerically. Calculating the backreaction shows that the effect of
the vortex is to cut a slice out of the Euclidean Schwarzschild geometry.
Consequences of these solutions for black hole thermodynamics are discussed.
