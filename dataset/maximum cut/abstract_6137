We give an explicit version of a result due to D. Burgess. Let $\chi$ be a
non-principal Dirichlet character modulo a prime $p$. We show that the maximum
number of consecutive integers for which $\chi$ takes on a particular value is
less than $\left\{\frac{\pi e\sqrt{6}}{3}+o(1)\right\}p^{1/4}\log p$, where the
$o(1)$ term is given explicitly.
