Oikonomou [Physica A 386 (2007) 119] has published a calculation which
purports to show that the Tsallis and Renyi entropies can be obtained from the
generalized multinomial coefficients. In this paper, we prove that the method
of generalized multinomial coefficients failed to determine the Tsallis entropy
at equilibrium. Moreover, it is shown that Oikonomou's analysis contains
mistakes which led him to misleading statements related to the Jaynes principle
of maximum entropy, the Tsallis and the Renyi statistics.
