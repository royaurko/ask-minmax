Maximum likelihood estimations for the parameters of extreme value
distributions are discussed in this paper using fixed point iteration. The
commonly used numerical approach for addressing this problem is the
Newton-Raphson approach which requires differentiation unlike the fixed point
iteration which is also easier to implement. Graphical approaches are also
usually proposed in the literature. We prove that these reduce in fact to the
fixed point solution proposed in this paper.
