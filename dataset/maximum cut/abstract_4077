Full quantum-mechanical description of electrons moving in 3D structures with
unidirectional periodic modulation subject to tilted magnetic fields requires
an extensive numerical calculation. To understand magneto-oscillations in such
systems it is in many cases sufficient to use the quasi-classical approach, in
which the zero-magnetic-field Fermi surface is considered as a
magnetic-field-independent rigid body in k-space and periods of oscillations
are related to extremal cross-sections of the Fermi surface cut by planes
perpendicular to the magnetic-field direction. We point out cases where the
quasi-classical treatment fails and propose a simple tight-binding
fully-quantum-mechanical model of the superlattice electronic structure.
