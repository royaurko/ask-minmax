We prove that $N$-user Gaussian multiple access channels (MACs) admit the
strong converse. This means that every sequence of codes with asymptotic
average error probabilities smaller than one has rate tuples that lie in the
pentagonal region prescribed by Cover and Wyner. Our proof consists of four key
ingredients: First, similar to Dueck's proof of the strong converse for the
discrete memoryless MAC, we perform an expurgation step to convert the code
defined in terms of the average probability of error to one defined in terms of
the maximum error without too much loss in rate. Second, similar to Ahlswede's
proof of the strong converse for the discrete memoryless MAC, we use a wringing
technique to approximate the code distribution (induced by the code defined in
terms of the maximum error) with a product distribution over users. Third, we
use a scalar quantizer of increasing precision with the blocklength to
discretize the input space so that Ahlswede's techniques can be applied to the
resultant sequence of discrete problems. Finally, we upper bound achievable sum
rates in terms of the fundamental limits of a binary hypothesis test and we use
the preceding techniques to simplify the bound. Our proof carries over to the
two sender-receiver (2-user) pair Gaussian interference channel in the strong
interference regime.
