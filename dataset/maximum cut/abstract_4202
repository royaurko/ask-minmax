PROJET is a parton level Monte Carlo program for the calculation of jet cross
sections in deeply inelastic electron proton scattering. In its present version
it contains the Born level diagrams for the production of (1+1), (2+1) and
(3+1) jets and the next-to-leading order corrections for the production cross
sections of (1+1) and (2+1) jets for all polarisations of the exchanged virtual
photon. In particular, the full angular correlations between the lepton and jet
momenta are implemented. The program permits the application of acceptance cuts
on all external momenta. For this purpose, the program creates an event record
accessible to the user program with all momenta in the laboratory frame and in
the center of momentum frame of the proton and the virtual photon. This option
is indispensable for phenomenological studies because of the strong dependence
of cross sections on phase space restrictions and the large uncertainty of
fragmentation corrections in the proton direction. Since PROJET uses the Monte
Carlo integration method for the evaluation of phase space integrals, the
weights of the generated events can be used to produce distributions of
observables related to jet momenta.
