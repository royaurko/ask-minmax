To study the establishment of homochirality observed in the crystal growth
experiment of chiral molecules from a solution under grinding, we extend the
lattice gas model of crystal growth as follows. A lattice site can be occupied
by a chiral molecule in R or S form, or can be empty. Molecules form
homoclusters by nearest neighbor bonds. They change their chirality if they are
isolated monomers in the solution. Grinding is incorporated by cutting and
shafling the system randomly. It is shown that Ostwald ripening without
grinding is extremely slow to select chirality, if possible. Grinding alone
also cannot achieve chirality selection. For the accomplishment of
homochirality, we need an enhanced chirality change on crystalline surface.
With this "autocatalytic effect" and the recycling of monomers due to rinding,
an exponential increase of crystal enantiomeric excess to homochiral state is
realized.
