In a cut-off Woods-Saxon (CWS) potential with realistic depth $S$-matrix
poles being far from the imaginary wave number axis form a sequence where the
distances of the consecutive resonances are inversely proportional with the
cut-off radius value, which is an unphysical parameter. Other poles lying
closer to the imaginary wave number axis might have trajectories with irregular
shapes as the depth of the potential increases. Poles being close repel each
other, and their repulsion is responsible for the changes of the directions of
the corresponding trajectories. The repulsion might cause that certain
resonances become antibound and later resonances again when they collide on the
imaginary axis. The interaction is extremely sensitive to the cut-off radius
value, which is an apparent handicap of the CWS potential.
