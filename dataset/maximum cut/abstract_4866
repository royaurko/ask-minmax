Neutrino telescopes with cubic kilometer volume have the potential to
discover new particles. Among them are next to lightest supersymmetric (NLSPs)
and next to lightest Kaluza-Klein (NLKPs) particles. Two NLSPs or NLKPs will
transverse the detector simultaneously producing parallel charged tracks. The
track separation inside the detector can be a few hundred meters. As these
particles might propagate a few thousand kilometers before reaching the
detector, multiple scattering could enhance the pair separation at the
detector. We find that the multiple scattering will alter the separation
distribution enough to increase the number of NLKP pairs separated by more than
100 meters (a reasonable experimental cut) by up to 46% depending on the NLKP
mass. Vertical upcoming NLSPs will have their separation increased by 24% due
to multiple scattering.
