We introduce MCMAS-SLK, a BDD-based model checker for the verification of
systems against specifications expressed in a novel, epistemic variant of
strategy logic. We give syntax and semantics of the specification language and
introduce a labelling algorithm for epistemic and strategy logic modalities. We
provide details of the checker which can also be used for synthesising agents'
strategies so that a specification is satisfied by the system. We evaluate the
efficiency of the implementation by discussing the results obtained for the
dining cryptographers protocol and a variant of the cake-cutting problem.
