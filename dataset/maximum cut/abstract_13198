We study transport of interacting particles in weakly disordered media. Our
one-dimensional system includes (i) disorder: the hopping rate governing the
movement of a particle between two neighboring lattice sites is inhomogeneous,
and (ii) hard core interaction: the maximum occupancy at each site is one
particle. We find that over a substantial regime, the root-mean-square
displacement of a particle, sigma, grows super-diffusively with time t, sigma ~
(epsilon t)^{2/3}, where epsilon is the disorder strength. Without disorder the
particle displacement is sub-diffusive, sigma ~ t^{1/4}, and therefore disorder
dramatically enhances particle mobility. We explain this effect using scaling
arguments, and verify the theoretical predictions through numerical
simulations. Also, the simulations show that disorder generally leads to
stronger mobility.
