High frequency [1-500 MHz] measurements of the Magneto-Impedance (MI) of
glass-covered Co$_{69.4}$Fe$_{3.7}$B$_{15.9}$Si$_{11}$ microwires are carried
out with various metal-to-wire diameter ratios. A twin-peak, anhysteretic
behaviour is observed as a function of magnetic field. A maximum in $\Delta
Z/Z$ appears at different values of the frequency $f$, 125, 140 and 85 MHz with
the corresponding diameter ratio $p$ = 0.80, 0.55 and 0.32. We describe the
measurement technique and interpret our results with a thermodynamic model that
leads to a clearer view of the effects of $p$ on the maximum value of MI and
the anisotropy field.
