We present the results of a study of galaxy activity in two merging binary
clusters (A168 and A1750) using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data
supplemented with the data in the literature. We have investigated the merger
histories of A168 and A1750 by combining the results from a two-body dynamical
model and X-ray data. In A168 two subclusters appear to have passed each other
and to be coming together from the recent maximum separation. In A1750, two
major subclusters appear to have started interaction and to be coming together
for the first time. We find an enhanced concentration of the galaxies showing
star formation (SF) or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in the region
between two subclusters in A168, which were possibly triggered by the cluster
merger. In A1750, we do not find any galaxies with SF/AGN activity in the
region between two subclusters, indicating that two major subclusters are in
the early stage of merging.
