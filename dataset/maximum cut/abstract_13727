In this paper we are interested in the existence of a principal eigenfunction
of a nonlocal operator which appears in the description of various phenomena
ranging from population dynamics to micro-magnetism. More precisely, we study
the following eigenvalue problem:
$$\int_{\O}J(\frac{x-y}{g(y)})\frac{\phi(y)}{g^n(y)}\, dy +a(x)\phi =\rho
\phi,$$ where $\O\subset\R^n$ is an open connected set, $J$ a nonnegative
kernel and $g$ a positive function. First, we establish a criterion for the
existence of a principal eigenpair $(\lambda_p,\phi_p)$. We also explore the
relation between the sign of the largest element of the spectrum with a strong
maximum property satisfied by the operator. As an application of these results
we construct and characterize the solutions of some nonlinear nonlocal reaction
diffusion equations.
