The rank of a graph is defined to be the rank of its adjacency matrix. A
graph is called reduced if it has no isolated vertices and no two vertices with
the same set of neighbors. We determine the maximum order of reduced
triangle-free graphs with a given rank and characterize all such graphs
achieving the maximum order.
