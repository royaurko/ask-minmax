We examine physicists' charge of ad hocness against the Higgs mechanism in
the standard model of elementary particle physics. We argue that even though
this charge never rested on a clear-cut and well-entrenched definition of "ad
hoc", it is based on conceptual and methodological assumptions and principles
that are well-founded elements of the scientific practice of high-energy
particle physics. We further evaluate the implications of the recent discovery
of a Higgs-like particle at the CERN's Large Hadron Collider for the charge of
ad hocness against the Higgs mechanism.
