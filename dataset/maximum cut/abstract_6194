We present a one-parameter family of models for square contingency tables
that interpolates between the classical quasisymmetry model and its Pearsonian
analogue. Algebraically, this corresponds to deformations of toric ideals
associated with graphs. Our discussion of the statistical issues centers around
maximum likelihood estimation.
