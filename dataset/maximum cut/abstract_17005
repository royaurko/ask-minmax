We observed the accreting white dwarf 1E1339.8+2837 (1E1339) in the globular
cluster M3 in Nov. 2003, May 2004 and Jan. 2005, using the Chandra ACIS-S
detector. The source was observed in 1992 to possess traits of a supersoft
X-ray source (SSS), with a 0.1-2.4 keV luminosity as large as 2x10^{35} erg/s,
after which time the source's luminosity fell by roughly two orders of
magnitude, adopting a hard X-ray spectrum more typical of CVs. Our observations
confirm 1E1339's hard CV-like spectrum, with photon index Gamma=1.3+-0.2. We
found 1E1339 to be highly variable, with a 0.5-10 keV luminosity ranging from
1.4+-0.3x10^{34} erg/s to 8.5+4.9-4.6x10^{32} erg/s, with 1E1339's maximum
luminosity being perhaps the highest yet recorded for hard X-ray emission onto
a white dwarf. In Jan. 2005, 1E1339 displayed substantial low-energy emission
below 0.3 keV. Although current Chandra responses cannot properly model this
emission, its bolometric luminosity appears comparable to or greater than that
of the hard spectral component. This raises the possibility that the supersoft
X-ray emission seen from 1E1339 in 1992 may have shifted to the far-UV.
