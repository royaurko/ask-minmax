A two-parameter family of statistical measures of complexity are introduced
based on the Tsallis-type nonadditive entropies. This provides a unified
framework for the study of the recently proposed various measures of complexity
as well as for the discussion of a whole new class of measures. As a special
case, a generalization of the measure proposed by Landsberg and his co-workers
based on the Tsallis entropy indexed by q is discussed in detail and its
behavior is illustrated using the logistic map. The value of the entropic
index, q, with which the maximum of the measure of complexity is located at the
edge of chaos, is calculated.
