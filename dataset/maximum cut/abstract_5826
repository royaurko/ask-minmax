We analyse the ultraviolet variability time scales in a sample of 15 Type 1
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) observed by IUE. Using a structure function
analysis, we demonstrate the existence in most objects of a maximum variability
time scale of the order of 0.02-1.00 year. We do not find any significant
dependence of these maximum variability time scales on the wavelength, but we
observe a weak correlation with the average luminosity of the objects. We also
observe in several objects the existence of long-term variability, which seems
decoupled from the short-term one. We interpret the existence of a maximum
variability time scale as a possible evidence that the light curves of Type 1
AGN are the result of the superimposition of independent events. In the
framework of the so-called discrete-event model, we study the event energy and
event rate as a function of the object properties. We confront our results to
predictions from existing models based on discrete events. We show that models
based on a fixed event energy, like supernova explosions, can be ruled out. In
their present form, models based on magnetic blobs are also unable to account
for the observed relations. Stellar collision models, while not completely
satisfactory, cannot be excluded.
