Congestion in network occurs due to exceed in aggregate demand as compared to
the accessible capacity of the resources. Network congestion will increase as
network speed increases and new effective congestion control methods are
needed, especially to handle bursty traffic of todays very high speed networks.
Since late 90s numerous schemes i.e. [1]...[10] etc. have been proposed. This
paper concentrates on comparative study of the different congestion control
schemes based on some key performance metrics. An effort has been made to judge
the performance of Maximum Entropy (ME) based solution for a steady state
GE/GE/1/N censored queues with partial buffer sharing scheme against these key
performance metrics.
