A multi-pomeron exchange potential (MPP) is proposed as a model for the
three-body repulsion indicated in neutron-star matter, which works universally
among three- and four-baryons. Its strength is determined by analyzing the
nucleus-nucleus scattering with the G-matrix folding model. The EoS in neutron
matter is obtained including the MPP contribution. The neutron-star mass is
calculated by solving the TOV equation. The maximum mass is obtained to be
larger than the observed one $1.97 M_{solar}$ on the basis of the experimental
data.
