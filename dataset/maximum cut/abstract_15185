We consider the initial value problem for the fractionally dissipative
quasi-geostrophic equation \[ \partial_t \theta + \mathcal{R}^\perp \theta
\cdot \nabla \theta + \Lambda^\gamma \theta = 0, \qquad \theta(\cdot,0)
=\theta_0 \] on $\mathbb{T}^2 = [0,1]^2$, with $\gamma \in (0,1)$. The
coefficient in front of the dissipative term $\Lambda^\gamma =
(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}$ is normalized to $1$. We show that given a smooth initial
datum with $\|\theta_0\|_{L^2}^{\gamma/2}
\|\theta_0\|_{\dot{H}^2}^{1-\gamma/2}\leq R$, where {\em $R$ is arbitrarily
large}, there exists $\gamma_1 = \gamma_1(R) \in (0,1)$ such that for $\gamma
\geq \gamma_1$, the solution of the supercritical SQG equation with dissipation
$\Lambda^\gamma$ does not blow up in finite time. The main ingredient in the
proof is a new concise proof of eventual regularity for the supercritical SQG
equation, that relies solely on nonlinear lower bounds for the fractional
Laplacian and the maximum principle.
