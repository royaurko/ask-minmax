In the post-genome era, biologists have sought to measure the complete
complement of proteins, termed proteomics. Currently, the most effective method
to measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the
proteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein
inference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun
proteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are
identified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage
would allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all
post translational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy
of biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit,
but ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that
are too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true
origin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by
several analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide
lengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit
observable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also
explored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be
achieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases
and chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 91.1% proteome coverage.
