In this paper, historical optical(UBVRI) data and newly observed data from
the Yunnan Observatory of China(about100 years) are presented for BL Lacertae.
Maximum variations in UBVRI: 5.12, 5.31, 4.73, 2.59, and 2.54 and color indices
of U-B = -0.11 +/- 0.20, B-V= 1.0 +/- 0.11, V-R= 0.73 +/- 0.19, V-I= 1.42 +/-
0.25, R-I= 0.82 +/- 0.11, and B-I= 2.44 +/- 0.29 have been obtained from the
literature; The Jurkevich method is used to investigate the existence of
periods in the B band light curve, and a long-term period of 14 years is found.
The 0.6 and 0.88 year periods reported by Webb et al.(1988) are confirmed. In
addition, a close relation between B-I and B is found, suggesting that the
spectra flattens when the source brightens.
