While the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator under
regularity conditions is long established, in this paper we derive explicit
bounds for the bounded Wasserstein distance between the distribution of the
maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the normal distribution. For this task
we employ Stein's method. We focus on independent and identically distributed
random variables, covering both discrete and continuous distributions as well
as exponential and non-exponential families. In particular, we do not require a
closed form expression of the MLE. We also use a perturbation method to treat
cases where the MLE has positive probability of being on the boundary of the
parameter space.
