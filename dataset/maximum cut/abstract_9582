In this paper, we show how the MEP hypothesis may be used to build simple
climate models without representing explicitly the energy transport by the
atmosphere. The purpose is twofold. First, we assess the performance of the MEP
hypothesis by comparing a simple model with minimal input data to a complex,
state-of-the-art General Circulation Model. Next, we show how to improve the
realism of MEP climate models by including climate feedbacks, focusing on the
case of the water-vapour feedback. We also discuss the dependence of the
entropy production rate and predicted surface temperature on the resolution of
the model.
