We consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on open network
consisting of three consecutively coupled macroscopic chain segments with a
shortcut between the tail of the first segment and the head of the third one.
The model was introduced by Y.-M. Yuan et al [J. Phys. A 40, 12351 (2007)] to
describe directed motion of molecular motors along filaments. We report here
unexpected results in the case of maximum current through the network which
revise the previous findings. Our theoretical analysis, based on the effective
rates approximation, shows that the second (shunted) segment can exist in both
low-density and high-density phases, as well as in the coexistence (shock)
phase. Numerical simulations demonstrate that it is the last option that takes
place - the local density distribution and the nearest-neighbor correlations in
the middle chain correspond to a shock phase with completely delocalized domain
wall. Surprisingly, the main quantitative parameters of that shock phase are
governed by a real root of a cubic equation the coefficients of which simply
depend on the probability of choosing the shortcut. The unexpected conclusion
is that a shortcut in the bulk of a single lane always creates traffic jams.
