The MiniBooNE detector at Fermilab is designed to search for $\nu_\mu \to
\nu_e$ oscillation appearance at $E_\nu \sim 1 {\rm GeV}$ and to make a
decisive test of the LSND signal. The main detector (inside a veto shield) is a
spherical volume containing 0.680 ktons of mineral oil. This inner volume,
viewed by 1280 phototubes, is primarily a \v{C}erenkov medium, as the
scintillation yield is low. The entire detector is under a 3 m earth
overburden. Though the detector is not optimized for low-energy (tens of MeV)
events, and the cosmic-ray muon rate is high (10 kHz), we show that MiniBooNE
can function as a useful supernova neutrino detector. Simple trigger-level cuts
can greatly reduce the backgrounds due to cosmic-ray muons. For a canonical
Galactic supernova at 10 kpc, about 190 supernova $\bar{\nu}_e + p \to e^+ + n$
events would be detected. By adding MiniBooNE to the international network of
supernova detectors, the possibility of a supernova being missed would be
reduced. Additionally, the paths of the supernova neutrinos through Earth will
be different for MiniBooNE and other detectors, thus allowing tests of
matter-affected mixing effects on the neutrino signal.
