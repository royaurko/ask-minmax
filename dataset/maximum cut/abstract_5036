Starting with the generalized electromagnetic field equations of dyons, we
have discussed the theory of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of plasma for particles
carrying simultaneously the electric and magnetic charges (namely dyons). It is
shown that the resultant system supports the electromagnetic duality of dyons.
Consequently the frequency of dyonic plasma has been obtained and it is
emphasized that there is a different plasma frequency for each species
depending on wave number k. For k to be real, only those generalized
electromagnetic waves are allowed to pass, for which the usual frequency is
greater than the plasma frequency (i.e. \omega>\omega_{p}). It is shown that
the plasma frequency sets the lower cuts for the frequencies of electromagnetic
radiation that can pass through a plasma . Accordingly the ohm's law has been
reestablished to derive the plasma oscillation equation as well as the
magetohydrodynamic wave equation and the energy of dyons in unique and
consistent manner.
