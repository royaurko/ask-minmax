Bi4Ti3O12 (BIT) has been considered as material for UV detector since it has
optical band gap of about 3.5 eV. Unlike the most used material for this
purpose, such as GaN and AlN, BIT is a ferroelectric oxide material. It has
shown good detection properties in the UV regions. We have developed a Pulsed
Laser Ablation Deposition (PLAD) method for preparation of BIT thin films. The
BIT films were grown on Si/SiO2/Pt(111) substrates and these films exhibit good
crystalline properties with preferential orientation in c-axis. A structure of
Al/Bi4Ti3O12/Pt(111)/Si(100) was fabricated for measurement of spectral
distribution of the voltage responsivity. The maximum voltage responsivity and
the spectral distribution significantly depend on the films preparations and
treatments.
