We present an analytic proof of the integrals for astrophysical thermonuclear
functions which are derived on the basis of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical
mechanics. Among the four different cases of astrophysical thermonuclear
functions, those with a depleted high-energy tail and a cut-off at high
energies find a natural interpretation in q-statistics.
