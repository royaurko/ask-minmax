We discuss the extension of the maximal-unitarity method to two loops,
focusing on the example of the planar double box. Maximal cuts are
reinterpreted as contour integrals, with the choice of contour fixed by the
requirement that integrals of total derivatives vanish on it. The resulting
formulae, like their one-loop counterparts, can be applied either analytically
or numerically.
