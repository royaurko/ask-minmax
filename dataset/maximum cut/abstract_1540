For the massless Nelson model we provide detailed information about the
dependence of the normalized ground states $\check{\psi}_{P,\sigma}$ of the
fiber single-electron Hamiltonians $H_{P,\sigma}$ on the total momentum $P$ and
the infrared cut-off $\sigma$. This information is obtained with the help of
the iterative analytic perturbation theory. In particular, we derive bounds of
the form
  \[ \|\partial_{P}^{\beta}\check{\psi}_{P,\sigma}\|\leq
\frac{c}{\sigma^{\delta_{\lambda_0}}}, \]
  for any multiindex $\beta$, s.t. $0\leq |\beta|\leq 2$ and some function of
the maximal admissible coupling constant $\lambda_0\mapsto \delta_{\lambda_0}$
s.t. $\lim_{\lambda_0\to 0}\de_{\lambda_0}=0$. Analogous bounds are obtained
for the derivatives w.r.t. $P$ of the $q$-particle momentum wavefunctions
$f^q_{P,\sigma}$ of $\check{\psi}_{P,\sigma}$. These results are exploited in a
companion paper to construct the two-electron scattering states in the
infrared-regular massless Nelson model (in the absence of an infrared cut-off)
along the lines of Haag-Ruelle scattering theory.
