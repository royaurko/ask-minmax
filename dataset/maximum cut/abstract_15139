A new, maximum proton energy, $e$, scaling law with the laser pulse energy,
$E_L$ has been derived from the results of 3D particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations. Utilizing numerical modelling, protons are accelerated during
interactions of the femtosecond relativistic laser pulses with the plain
semi-transparent targets of optimum thickness [Esirkepov {\it et al.} Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 96}, 105001 (2206)]. The scaling, $e \sim E_L^{0.7}$, has been
obtained for the wide range of laser energies, different spot sizes, and laser
pulse durations. Our results show that the proper selection of foil target
optimum thicknesses, results in a very promising increase of the ion energy
with the laser intensity even in the range of parameters below the radiation
pressure (light sail) regime. The proposed analytical model is consistent with
numerical simulations.
