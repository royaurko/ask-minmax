Recent data from heavy ion collisions at RHIC show unexpectedly large
near-angle correlations that broaden longitudinally with increasing centrality.
The amplitude of this ridge-like correlation rises rapidly, reaches a maximum,
and then falls in the most central collisions. In this letter we explain how
this behavior can be explained as initial-state coordinate-space anisotropies
converted into final-state momentum-space correlations. We propose
$v_n^2/\epsilon_{n,\mathrm{part}}^{2}$ as a useful way to study length scales
and provide a prediction for the ridge in Pb+Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 2.76 TeV.
